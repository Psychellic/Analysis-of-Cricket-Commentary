"length delivery, gets it to shape away from off stump, Rizwan blocks to begin"
"excellent delivery, this one looked like it nipped back in sharply, strikes Rizwan high on the pad"
"moves across and drives him back down the ground, Hasan collects neatly sending Rizwan scurrying back into his crease"
"tried to pull it in front of square, but gets a thick under-edge and gets himself off the mark"
Lynn had no clue about that one. Length delivery that reared up and had Lynn rushing to get his gloves - and body - out of the way
"flicked to the on side off the pads, and completes a tidy little over"
"runs it down to third man, point should have cut that off but a misfield allows Multan the single"
"hits the deck hard and kept a little low, Rizwan's slash across ended up making no contact"
"another little misfield in the infield at backward point. Just the single, though"
looked like he was shaping to go over the top. Late adjustment and he drops back and defends through the covers
"<strong>he strikes, and Lynn goes early!</strong> Something of an agricultural shot, made room and tried to clear cover-point. Extra bounce does him, though, and the upper edge carries through to the keeper for a simple catch"
"backfoot punch, and a brilliant start for Islamabad United. Just two of this one"
tidily defended. Islamabad will be chuffed by the start they've made
"just plugging away around that good length area. This one came back in, and he tucks it away to the onside"
"seaming away, Vince warily lets that go"
"A lazy swing from the Englishman, no real foot movement. But that shot was on, and Hasan gets away with it"
elegant little punch through extra cover gets him off the mark
guided to third man fetches him the strike for the next over
"first boundary bof the innings, RIzwan is off and away! Mohammad Waseem began with a loose ball short and wide at modest pace, and the Multan captain punishes him straightaway"
"slightly closer to the body, he attempted a similar cut shot, but this one's collected at backward point"
cleared the front leg and tried to hoist him over mid-on. Timing was missing and he only gets a single
"back of a length, pushed out to mid-off"
"<strong>and there's that easy elegance in full flow!</strong> Ball was there to be punished, and boy did Vince punish it! Full and wide, and Vince frees his arms and absolutely bludgeons the youngster through extra cover"
"Tried to loft him back over his head again, but only manages a thick inside edge. Better over for Multan, who really need to get going"
"short, that was there to be smashed, but the pull shot finds the fielder"
"swing and a miss! Attempted a drive back over Faheem's head, and it misses both bat and stumps rather narrowly"
"timing lacking once more. Vince is getting a lot of these balls he'd put away in full flow. Gets a single due to some errant fielding, though"
"Not much foot movement there, Rizwan attempted a bit of stand and deliver, looking to slap Faheem to cow corner. Misses the ball"
"<strong>a bit of bottom hand, and that wasn't middled by any stretch, but it carries all the way for six!</strong> It's a top edge, really, all it is, and it sails over the fine leg boundary"
"that's a poor delivery to end the over. Dragged down legside, Rizwan helps it to the fine leg boundary to end the over strongly"
"Gregory nearly nails Vince first up. Full, almost yorker length and tailing back in. Inside edge saves the batsman"
"and we finally see Vince in full flow! That was absolutely hammered to cow corner. Short, not quick enough, in the slot, and Vince stands back and crunches it well over the rope for six! Multan trying to salvage the Powerplay at the backend"
"yorker length again, dug out down to long-on"
"so good from Rizwan, that was all bottom hand. Gave himself room and clobbers him over mid-off for a boundary on the bounce"
"goes back to the yorker line, which has worked for him this over, beats the bat"
"wide yorker, finishes decently. 11 off the over, though"
"comes around the wicket, nicely timed to sweeper cover"
"slower delivery, made Rizwan wait before he opened the face and the pair scrambled across for a single"
"makes room and tries to slap him over extra cover, Misses the bails by a whisker, realky"
<strong>dropped</strong>! That was an easy catch and Faheem puts it down running in from long-on. Hales drove to long-on in the air and Islamabad United miss an early chance
"Rizwan rubs salt in the wound by smashing him over his head for six! In the slot, and Rizwan dances down the track and sends the ball sailing over the sighscreen"
"brute force followed up by a delicate dab to a vacant  third man. Frustrating over for Gohar ends, and Multan looking like they're on their way now"
"Vince falls, finally! It's Faheem , would you believe it! Just after he had put him down last over, Faheem runs in from third man and takes a clean catch to remove Vince. Could never truly get going, and this is a huge blow for Sultans"
"took the pace off, and guided to fine leg"
"off-cutter, worked away to long-on"
nudged into the onside
"that was just a short-arm jab, but boy he got some fizz on that. Slightly short, and Rizwan jabs it in front of square, the ball sailing to the boundary on the bounce"
single down to long-on keeps the strike
pushes it to the onside to get off strike
"spun back in and made a beeline for the stumps, driven back to Shadab"
"nice shot, read the wrong'un early, and with no fielding in the sweeper cover region, Rossouw merely had to clear the infield to pick up an easy four"
"slightly too full to cut, but he went for it anyway and picks up another couple"
"another googly. Went for a sweep shot, but didn't make contact"
driven to extra cover
"wicket-to-wicket line, gets a single down the ground"
takes the pace off. Nurdled to the onside for one
"in the slot, but rizwan doesn't find quite the perfect timing. Aerial slog to long-on on the bounce"
"a crunch through the offside, but only finds the fielder"
slower ball deceived Rossouw completely. This is been a good over from the young man so far. Let's see if he can finish it off
gets the boundary to spoil a great over! Bit of width for Rizwan to make some room and crack it through point.
guided to midwicket for a single
"that's in Rossouw's slot. He'd hit that for six at least half the time, you'd reckon. Could see the googly coming amile off, and he gets down on one knee and tonks it over cow corner for a huge six"
"<strong>another six</strong>. This was a flat hit, picked up from well wide of off stump, and he latches on to it beautifully. Pierces the two fielders around the long on area, and it clears the fence"
"<strong>Shadab strikes back!</strong> thick edge as he tried to open the face off the bat, loops up and short third has a straightforward catch! Shadab is pumped up, and the South African looks mighty disgusted with himself"
a slog-drive to long-on for a single
"lovely pick-up from Rizwan. Low full toss that Rizwan picks up deftly to deposit for a boundary past long-on. Expensive over from the Islamabad captain, despite the big wicket"
"starts off with a bouncer, 139 kph. Maqsood ducks under"
tucked into the onside
driven to extra cover for a single
"gone, Wasim strikes again. That will frustrate Maqsood, it was in the slot, there to be hit, and the batsman manages to find the fielder at cow corner. Doesn't really find the middle of the bat."
nudged into the onside for a couple
"quick single to mid-on, where they took a risk taking on Shadab's arm. Successful over for the emerging player from Islamabad"
"wrong'un, he tried to open the face of the bat, narrowly misses the outside edge"
"that's what he was trying to do, runs it past short third man and the pair come back for a couple"
"driven to long-on for a single, <strong>and that's Rizwan's fifty</strong>. Came off 31 balls, and this little superstar's purple patch just continues"
"reverse sweep for Khushdil, slightly out of control, but lands it safely and he gets a single"
"drops it short, pulled away to long on for a single"
"googly, which beats Khushdil all ends up. Salt whips off the bails at the second attempt as Khushdil lifts his back foot, but Aleem Dar in the TV umpire's chair rightly gives him not out"
"slashed over the infield for four! Attempted cutter, wide outside off on a length, and Rizwan did well to reach it. Flies away over backward point"
"hard length, punched down to long-on"
"angled across the left-hander on a length. Khushdil shapes to cut but is cramped for room, and can't lay bat on ball"
"banged into pitch, <b>skied towards long-on and Hales takes the catch!</b> Khushdil goes. Short ball, up towards Khushdil's shoulder. He swats at the pull, mis-timing it, and picks out Hales, who takes a sharp catch running round to his left at long-on. Made it look very easy"
"strays down the leg side, Rizwan nudges it straight to the man at fine leg. Missed out there"
punched down to long-on from a length to retain the strike
"tossed up, defended back to the bowler"
"tossed up outside off, slapped straight to the man on the edge of the ring at extra cover"
"full legbreak, smothers the spin"
"pressed to cover with a high front elbow, <b>four dots in a row</b>"
"fast legbreak, defended towards mid-off. <b>Five in a row!</b>"
"jumps into position, pulling in front of square through midwicket for a couple"
"length ball, pressed to short cover with no foot movement"
"bit of width, and Brathwaite clubs him through point for four. Cut past the man at backward point"
"overpitches ever so slightly looking for the yorker outside off, and it skews into the legside via the bottom of Brathwaite's bat"
"another attempted yorker, Rizwan shapes to whip him to leg but his timing is off and he hits it into his pad"
"whipped to the right hand of Gregory at long-on, and they won't attempt a second"
slower ball which bamboozles Brathwaite. He looks to steer it into the off side but can't connect
"slower ball, nudged towards midwicket with soft hands and they scamper back"
"yorker, dug out to extra cover"
"slower ball, pressed out to extra cover"
"length ball, Rizwan inside-edges into his hip and takes a single"
"banged in, Brathwaite tries to give himself room but is cramped by the short one, and toe-ends it back to Gregory. Good over so far"
"slower-ball bouncer, and Brathwaite can't get it past short fine leg. Tidy stuff from Gregory, only six off the 17th"
"clears the front dog, and pulls a back-of-a-length ball straight to deep midwicket"
"full outside off, mistimed drive to extra cover on the edge of the ring and Rizwan cautiously decides against the single"
"wide outside the off stump, Rizwan flays it wide of long-off for four! Poor ball, very wide on a length, and Rizwan flashes hard with fast hands, sending it over straight extra cover"
"low full bunger, mistimed out to deep midwicket"
clears the front leg shaping to slog into the leg side but Faheem's bouncer flies past Brathwaite's right shoulder. Belatedly given as a wide
"in the slot, and <b>Brathwaite mooses it over midwicket!</b> Clears the front leg and sends it 93m into the stands. Kolkata 2016 vibes!"
"full outside off, crunched to long-off to keep the strike"
"in the slot, clears the front leg, and sends it straight to Hales on the bounce at long-off. Slight misfield but won't cost a run"
"spots Rizwan's shimmy down the pitch so drops short, and he can't lay bat on ball, shaping to heave over the leg side"
"carved out to deep square leg on the bounce. Mistimed again, but that means have time to scamper back for a second"
"<b>gottim! Wasim clears Rizwan up! Tiiiiimber!</b> Mohammad Wasim goes wide on the crease, and spears in a yorker. It's very full, with the seam angling in towards the leg side - superb seam position. Rizwan's timing has been way off for the last five overs or so, and he can't get his bat down on this. It sends off stump flying and Wasim has got the big wicket"
"never change, Afridi. Not that you were likely to. Wide outside off stump on a length, and Afridi tries to send this 150 metres over midwicket as he shimmies down. It balloons up into the night sky, nestling in the hands of Shadab Khan on the edge of the inner ring at cover. Short and sweet"
"poor way to finish. Wide outside the off stump, on a length, and Brathwaite cuts it fine past short third man. Superb spell from Mohammad Wasim: 3 for 29 from his four overs"
"clothed to mid-off on the edge of the ring and Tanvir, the No. 9, sets off. He's out if the throw from Gregory hits the stumps at the non-striker's end, but it's wide!"
"clears the front leg but Hasan lands the yorker, and he can only jam it towards midwicket"
"full and straight, dug out to deep midwicket for a couple"
"back of a length, clubbed out to midwicket on the bounce"
"clears the front leg again, and can only hack this yorker to long-on. 150 up with one ball to go. Great old-school death bowling from Hasan."
"miscues it high, high, <b>high</b> into the night sky. Hasan Ali settles underneath it, and takes a tumbling catch off his own bowling. He falls to the deck and then brushes either shoulder after jumping to his feet to celebrate a fine bowling performance as though it's no big deal. Offcutter on a length, and Tanvir was through his shot early"
"length outside off, Salt shapes to crash through the infield but can't beat short cover"
defended from a length. Early movement on offer for Tanvir
"checked drive down the ground for four! Slightly overpitched, minimal foot movement, and beats the dive of mid-off to his right"
"drops his length ball, keeps slightly low, and Salt misses out looking to hoick across the line"
"nice angle from wide on the crease, as the ball shapes away off the seam. Pressed out to cover, and Rossouw dives well to his right to save three runs"
"thinks about leaving it but re-thinks late, and ends up defending it behind square on the off side"
"in the slot, and <b>clubbed over wide long-on for four!</b> Beautiful pick-up from Salt. Hint of swing but equally a free-flowing swing of the bat"
clipped off the pads out to midwicket
"good shape back into the right-hander, cramping Hales for room. Defended"
"length ball, dabbed to point on the bounce"
"shimmies outside leg stump to give himself room, and with mid-off inside the circle Hales only needs to chip this over his head. A cross-batted hack really, but it flies away to the rope"
"gives himself room once more, and an excellent diving stop at cover from Umar to cut it off"
tucked into the onside for a single
"takes the pace off like the wily old fox he is. Clobbered back to the bowler, and a bit of footwork from Afridi hits the stumps. Never a run-out, the the sprightly Afridi appeals anyway"
"going down leg that one, and Hales gets a legbye down to the onside"
"a bit too far outside off stump for the umpire's liking. Harsh call, but it's given a wide"
pushed to mid-on for a comfortable single
"pace off once more, but it was wide and perhaps should have received greater punishment than a single to backward point"
"another leg bye, good over that shows again why Tanvir is valuable in the PSL. Teams tend to struggle to get a gold him, especially in the Powerplay"
stump-to-stump line on a length. Driven to mid-on
"Hales frees his arms, and he's off. Clears the front leg and biffs the young seamer over square leg for a 79-metre six. This is a baptism of fire for the bowler"
"brilliant fielding from Brathwaite. Looked for all the world like that was another four, but the big man leaps to his right, sticks a bucket-like hand out and grasps the ball. 3 runs saved, and Hales is off strike"
"<strong>Umar strikes</strong>! Salt's gone; it's a delivery that really should have been dispatched over cow corner. Instead, the waist high full toss finds the fielder there, and after he was put on strike by some brilliant fielding, Salt departs"
"too easy for Hales. These length deliveries are cannon fodder for him. Sat up nicely and the Englishman finds it right in his slot, and sends it in front of square leg over the ropes once more"
"timed away to midwicket, and an eventful over for Umar comes to an end"
opens the face to cover
"the line wavers, and he's punished. Just outside leg stump with the pace off, and the Islamabad United captain had all the time in the world to tickle it down to fine leg"
"bowls this one at full tilt, rushes on to him. Shadab's beaten"
"mistimed slog, one bounce to mid-on"
"bit of a miscue, Shadab really making his intentions clear this over. Slightly short of a length, pulled to midwicket"
"made him wait for it, and a mistimed drive lands him a single"
followed Hales as he tried to make room. Poked into the offside
"<strong>and Shadab departs</strong>. This had been on the cards from the moment Shadab walked out. Got underneath a shorter delivery to try and loft that over midwicket, but got more height than distance on it, and the boundary fielder takes a simple catch"
"very little pace, just 117 kph, nudged to the onside"
"that was in the air, and shirt third man looked like he might be in the game for a second. Too close to cut but he went for it, and a thick outside edge fizzes past that man. Three feet closer and that was straight to him. As it is, it races away for four"
""
Talat watches it go past
nicely flighted to begin. Hales respectfully blocks
"drags it down wide. Hales was out of his crease for a brief moment, and there was perhaps half a chance to effect a stumping. Instead, it sails past him for five wides"
single back down the ground
"flatter this time, pushing Talat back. Defended"
"that was a topspinner, slashed to backward point"
"early stride out, driven to long-off"
"<strong>cleans him up, what a delivery</strong>! Almost a flipper, that. Pitches in that corridor of uncertainty, Hales had no clue whether to move forward or back. It fizzes on after landing and crashes into middle stump. Afridi celebrates as you know he does, and the evergreen allrounder has made a huge impact on this game"
"dabbed to short third man. Thought about a run, but thought better of it"
"drops it short, defended"
runs it down to third man for a single
"bouncer from Brathwaite, Asif ducks underneath"
"drifting down legside, and that's an easy putaway from Asif Ali. Flicks it down to fine leg, where it runs away for four"
defended to cap off the over
"tried to run it past the man at 45, went straight to him in the end"
"gives this a bit more air, and tucks up Talat slightly, who defends"
"<strong>that's a reverse sweep that Talat didn't really seem in control of, but the top edge goes all the way for six</strong>! What a hit that was, and one that Islamabad really needed to try and get out of the bind they've suddenly found themselves in"
"flatter and quicker, defended to short third man"
"slightly ordinary fielding at short third, but the man in the deep is covering, so only leaks a single"
nudged to backward point to round out the over
opens the face and gets a single to deep cover
"big appeal but the feather to the keeper looks like it came off the pad. Young Umar's keen to review, but RIzwan overrules him"
"slower ball, he tried to nudge it past short third, misses out"
strays down leg stump and punished this time. Deft pick up from Asif Ali who gets an easy four to fine leg
""
"wide yorker that Talat hung his bat out to. Huge appeal from Multan, but after the umpire's unmoved, Rizwan opts to go upstairs this time. Looked like a deflection in real time, but the <strong>replays showed the bat hit the ground</strong>. Another excellent decision from Ahsan Raza"
"and <strong>Afridi strikes again, because of course he does</strong>! That was in the slot for Asif to try his favourite shot, aslog down to long-on, but as happens a touch too frequently with him, he finds the man stationed there instead of the rope behind him"
"nice flight, moves across and rives it back to the bowler"
"skidded on and rapped him on the pads. Going down leg, though"
turned off the surface with a bit of extra bounce to boot. Did well to defend
driven to cover-point. First run of the over
"<strong>looked like a suicidal run, and Afridi's direct hit makes them pay. The veteran is razing through Islamabad right now. Afridi at his electrifying best. Iftikhar is nowhere near, and Multan Sultans are well on top now</strong>"
"<strong>and another wicket, Islamabad are crumbling here</strong>. Talat went for a slog over cow corner, deciding to attack Khushdil first ball. That's a very canny bowling change, and it's got the two-time champions reeling"
nudged to square leg for a single
driven to extra cover
""
rushes this one through. Nurdled to the onside for a single
"full and flat. That was a masterstroke of a bowling change, and Khushdil has done what he was brought in to do"
"bit of spin and flight from Afridi, Gregory gets a single through the covers"
"wavers down leg side, rare bad delivery from him, and Faheem cannily tickles it past short fine to pick up a boundary"
single through the offside. Faheem still has an intense look about him
"another single, and the asking rate is up past nine now"
"wrong'un, batsman strides out and across, and the pair exchange ends"
"slower and gets more turn to round out. Nine off his last over, and Afridi finishes with 4-0-24-2, not to mention that magnifcent run-out. Take a bow, Afridi. Take yet another bow"

"slower ball to start off, cut away through the offside"
"tucked into the onside, and Gregory pushes Faheem to run back for a couple. Slightly different intensity about this game after that big over"
"carves it down to third man, and a misfield gets Islamabad the boundary! Poor Sohaibullah puts in a slide and the ball clips the top of his fingers and creeps past him for four! Is the momentum shifting slightly?"
"slower ball, maybe a little too close to being called wide, but the umpire allows it. Good comeback"
"Slower ball, punched to the fielder at extra cover"
"slow, low full toss. Maybe should have made more of that, but the single gets him back the strike"
tucked him up slightly with a slightly shorter ball. Gets him a single
"slightly wide of off stump, and the umpire decides its wide of the popping crease. Called wide"
"<strong>Afridi shells it</strong>! He is human after all. In the slot and Faheem spooned it to mid-off, where the veteran had to leap. He got both hands to it, and really should have grasped it, but it pops back out."
""
<strong>short ball that Gregory brilliantly steers past a valiant dive from Khushdil at square leg</strong>. The momentum is beginning to shift now with this late rearguard
intelligent little poke down the ground gets them a single
"It just had to be. <strong>Faheem scoops it up to Afridi again, and this time it's a regulation catch</strong>. He makes no mistake and then smashes the ball back into the ground in frustration. Multan were desperate for that one"
steered to mid-off and the pair exchange ends
gets off the mark with a single to third man
slower ball that Gregory was onto very quickly. Saw the gap in the extra cover region and perfectly found it with a thumping drive. Game's still got life in it
"fuller delivery, chunky inside edge that could have fetched four were it a few inches either side of short fine leg"
"really taking the pace off it now, and Gohar's only too happy to rotate the strike for now. Direct hit would have had Gregory in trouble"
Single to backward point
"little jab to the onside, Gregory was desperate for two there but it was never really on. Edge of seat stuff, this"
length delivery with a bit of extra bounce. Muffled appeal for caught behind by Rizwan
"driven back to the bowler. A little misfield by the big man, and the batsmen scamper across for one"
the change of pace is really hard to get a hold off. Danced own the track but went thourgh his shot way too early. Great over for Multan so far
"arghh, another misfield, they're beginning to catch up with Multan here. That should only ever have been a single, but a misfield allows Gregory to come back. Rizwan does not look best pleased"
chipped to midwicket where the fielder collects on the bounce. Superb over from Brathwaite. We're into the final two
"slower bouncer from Tanvir. Bottom edge from the batsman, no runs to be had"
"<strong>nails it, Gregory is taking Islamabad home at the moment!</strong> Short and sat up at pace, with Gregory lying in wait to thump it over square leg"
"carved away past backward point, and Islamabad on their way now. Somehow, Multan have seen this slip away from them. Pierces the gap between deep point and backward point, but Tanvir felt the ring fielder could have put in a better effort there"
"another boundary, beats short fine leg this time. Strays down leg side and all he has to do is steer it past the man at short fine. Just 6 away now"
driven back past Tanvir. Right in the slot and he slapped it back past the bowler for a fourth boundary on the trot. Gregory two away from 50 now
"Single to keep the strike. Scores level, 19 off the over, and Islamabad are about to begin with a win"
"that's a wide, and while that denies Gregory the half-century, let that not detract from a glorious innings for his side. Multan look properly dejected here, they've thrown this game away. Afridi having words with Sohail Tanvir and it's all fallen apart for Mohammad Rizwan's side"
