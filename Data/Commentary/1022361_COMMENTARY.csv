"what a start. Rohit has played him a million times in the nets in the heat of Mumbai. But this is tripe. Length, short and wide. Rohit caresses it with his languid half-push at the ball. Finds the gap through point. All timing."
"better comeback. Back of a length outside off, sliding away in his usual style. Blocked to point"
"straight, full. Accurate. Rohit defends"
"back of a length on middle and leg, played down towards square leg"
"back of a length outside off, some extra bounce. Not as much width but still wide. Cut to backward point"
"excellent finish from Malinga. Back of a length outside off, left alone by Rohit. A five-minute over to start."
"lovely start from Lakmal. Nothing wrong with that. Back of a length, zoning in on the top of off. Punched to cover point from the back foot. A good stop prevents a run"
that's not a good ball. Short and wide with just a sole point. Help yourself mate. Thanks. Cut through point with glee. Played that into the surface
"wow. Beauty. Good length on middle and off, the ball seams back in and cuts Dhawan in half. Just over off stump"
"nice. Full delivery on a fourth-stump channel. This is quite full. Dhawan leaves. Nicely bowled. Keep it full, like Pakistan yesterday"
"no no no. Got to learn quickly. Short and wide again, cut to point who fumbles what should have been a stop. Burst through his hands. Gunathilaka, he's a sensational fielder"
"great end. On a length on off, good length. Dhawan stays on the back foot to defend into the point region"
"good length on off, punched to mid-off. Nice length. But not much movement. Where has swing gone? It's cloudy. It's England"
"too much width. Well to Rohit at least. Good length outside off, slashed to third man"
"good length on middle and leg, so easy for Dhawan as he tickles the ball by square leg for a run."
"good length outside off, fourth-stump channel. Defended towards cover"
"that's impeccable. Just need some movement, but none there. Fuller length on or just outside off, blocked into the off side"
"tidy over. Good length outside off, punched up to mid-off from the back foot."
"there's that length. Just see if swing is there. None. Full, straight, defended. Nice."
"Kusal Mendis saves four. Good length outside off, carved to a short point who dives to his right to save four. Don't bowl there."
"nice. If it's outside off, it shouldn't be wide enough for a cut. Like this. Good length outside off, left alone."
"Shikhar wants one, Rohit doesn't. Close to off on a length, played by his feet. Asks Rohit, who yells 'noooo'"
"nice length. Full on a fourth-stump line. much better length. Inside-edged into the pad. Excellent over, can he finish?"
"a maiden. Fullish down leg, clipped to square leg. Still no swing. Not a good sign for cricket"
"just a tad wide. And Rohit lays into a cut. Shortish and wide, slashed to third man for one."
<strong>just misses the off stump</strong>. Gets underneath Dhawan's bat too. A spearing yorker that would have knocked over a fourth stump just misses the off stump. Excellent change-up.
"there was just enough swing there. Comes back in the air. Another terrific yorker on middle and off, jammed out. Terrific bowling"
"Dhawan steps out to convert a yorker into a full toss but this is Malinga. He's wily, delivers a slower ball outside off, pushed to cover"
"fullish and wide outside off, driven on the up towards mid-off"
"wow. Delectable. Malinga overpitches, his first bad ball of the over and Dhawan accepts. Crisply drills a drive through cover for four. Waited for that bad ball, that's good, patient batting"
"there should not be one there. Lakmal agrees. Good length on off, dabbed away towards point who is in, but is too slow on the ball. Dhawan makes it easily. Think it was Gunathilaka"
"136 kph, good length, top of off. Played to point from the crease. Tentative footwork."
"beautiful ball-striking. Shimmies down, gets a nice delivery - fullish and close to off. Dhawan strides forward and hammers a punchy drive through cover. All timing. Not an angry shot, thinking batting"
"good change in length but it will cost him plenty. A bouncer on leg, hustles Dhawan for pace who wants to hit over square leg but the ball hurries onto him. Takes the leading edge and past the keeper for four"
"that's Gunathilaka. Quality fielder. Good length outside off, carved towards backward point who dives to his right, but can't save one because he misfielded"
"good end. But India take 10 off the over. Full and straight, defended back up the pitch"
"good length outside off, too much width. Dhawan finds point with a cut"
"a slower delivery, but it's slightly too full. Dhawan eases into his drive and picks out cover point. Nicely played"
"no. Gets away with it again. Good length and wide outside off, slashed to point. Should have hit a gap. That's eight runs missed off two bad balls. Can't hit a gap every ball though"
"half-stops. Full and wide outside off, crisply hit to cover who dives to his left. Gets a hand on it. Maybe a bobble off the pitch in front of him. Not easy to stop nonetheless"
"133 kph, short. Bouncer down leg, helped down to fine leg. Nice change in length."
"better line. A tad too full. Fullish, straight. Driven through Rohit's legs for a run. Easy single but Rohit has to recover in time from the ball hit back at him."
"lovely run. Good length on off, not a bad ball at all. But Dhawan just taps towards cover and calls 'yea, yea'. Rohit responds. Dhawan doesn't even look at where the ball has gone. Sensational single."
"that, though, is not a well-judged run. Fullish on off, shovelled towards short mid-on. Pradeep gets there, turns around and misses the non-striker's stumps. <strong>Out if he hit.</strong> Should he have hit from so close?"
"fullish outside off, carved to short point"
"good length on off, very close to off. Dhawan takes that from his stumps and cuts down to third man. Three singles off four very good balls this over. This is what limited-overs cricket is about"
"good length on off, just outside actually. Rohit inside-edges this into his pad."
"on the bounce to third man. That's what good singles do. If my good balls are going for one, I need to try something else, is the bowler's thought. He bowls it short and wide, and Rohit is all over it. Well, not completely but you get the drift. The cut lands on the bounce to third man"
"good length outside off, excellent. High elbow defensive push to cover"
"picks the length early and when he does, he's an awesome player. Knows all along that he wants to hit it over the infield. Back of a length on leg, Rohit pulls merrily over square leg. Poor line"
"closer to off, pushed to mid-on. One more off a very good ball. This is a lesson for the lower-ranked teams."
"fuller than a good length on a fifth-stump line, carved to third man. Another good ball for a single"
"fullish and wide outside off, left alone. A half-volley that"
"width. Don't bowl there mate. Short and wide, Rohit leans on his cut and clatters the ball in front of point for four. Some loose bowling now, these two won't let 'em go"
"excellent line. Length on off, top of off. Blocked with a high elbow"
"shortish and wide outside off, cut into the surface and over point. Done in by the bounce of an adjacent pitch, just like at the Wankhede"
"lovely line. On a length on off, inside-edged into the body. Keep it there for three more balls."
"fine leg is up so Rohit tries to go over him. A percentage shot? Roy was caught that way in the opener. Full outside off, Rohit gets some bat, not a lot, and it goes straight to that man. On the bounce"
"good length outside off, punched to cover. Dhawan says 'ya'. Rohit says 'no'. Good call from Rohit"
"great end from Pradeep. Consistency over six balls. Fullish length on off, blocked back. Not much could be done with that"
"good length outside off, worked towards mid-on for one. Exemplary batting"
"full down leg, off the pad towards square leg. It's India's fifty. Just what they would have wanted."
"good length outside off, blocked to cover."
"excellent. Back of a length outside off, dabbed to point."
"good length on middle and leg, clipped to square leg"
"tidy over. Back of a length outside off, chopped into the surface towards backward point"
"fullish length outside off, left alone. Left primarily because there is still a slip in place."
"lovely stroke. Overpitched outside off, hammered past cover for a couple. The sweeper cover cleans up."
"dug in short. Bouncer on off, pulled away to deep backward square leg. Not enough pace in this surface to trouble Rohit"
there is five. Digs this in so short that it goes waaaay over the batsman and keeper. Five free runs.
"good length around off, played quietly towards point"
"fullish delivery outside off, driven to cover"
"runs down, And chops a cut to point and calls 'yea' instantly. Not a good call from Dhawan. Is rightly sent back by Rohit."
"fullish and slightly wide, goes past Rohit's cut. Too much width but it's at least not short"
"fullish delivery outside off, caressed through cover for a run"
"full and straight, pushed to mid-on for an easy single. He was slightly deep. Understandable considering it's a 6-3 field"
"good length outside off, punched to cover. Nice line. Stay there for two more. Finish well"
"130 kph, slower yorker. On off. Jammed out"
"nicely played that. Back of a length on off, pulled behind square for a couple. Played that late. Intentionally placed."
"shortish, not wide. Dhawan still cuts and finds point. Great batting. Warner does that very well, makes room out of nothing. An unnecessary throw allows one"
"good length outside off, dabbed to backward point"
"good length outside off, pushed away into the off side"
"quick call of 'two, two, two' and makes it easily. Worked into the gap through midwicket for a couple. Nicely batted"
"good length outside off, punched on the up to the sweeper cover"
"short on middle, stabbed away to the deep square leg fielder. Nicely played. All along the ground"
"that's a poor ball. Flat down leg, Dhawan helps it along. Just past the keeper and races away for four. A fine paddle."
"flat and straight, skids on with the arm. Shovelled to midwicket"
"a low full toss on off, pushed to long-off for one"
"flat and straight, Rohit strides forward to defend"
"full outside off, flat and quick. Hit back to the bowler."
"comes down. But Gunathilaka fires this outside off, carved away towards point for one. Good comeback"
"good length on off, worked to deep square leg for a run"
"goes past the edge. Fullish delivery outside off, beats the bat. Plays the line. Maybe just enough lateral movement"
"good length outside off, punched away to the sweeper cover"
"shortish and wide, sliced down towards third man for a run. The fielder hurtled across to his left to save three"
"popped into the air. Back of a length on off, Dhawan wants to jab this to deep square leg but there is some extra bounce. Lobs towards fine leg"
"too straight, clipped down to fine leg"
"flat and straight, not full, not short. Pushed towards cover for a run. Quality single"
"big big appeal. Was it sliding down? Going down says the umpire Rod Tucker. Dhawan misses a sweep. Yea, going down"
"that's a poor ball. Flat down leg,swept down to short fine leg. Malinga gets across and dives. Sticks his legs into the surface. Gets hand on it but the ball trickles for four"
"looking to go straight, over the bowler. Full and straight, skews off the outside half to deep cover."
"flat outside off, pushed to cover. Pushed through that one. No turn yet"
"shortish on off, cut towards point. Too close, too straight to cut."
a deft little glide to third man - but there are symptoms of how Sri Lanka have let India off here - the ball was short and wide
"demands a quick single, but Rohit's loud and insistent yell of no could well be translated to 'are you kidding?'. Dhawan's game relies on these quick nips across to the other end, and though he did play gently, point was onto the ball quickly"
"onto the pads and he tucks it around the corner to long leg. Ah, the one-day staple."
"shortish on and around off stump, Rohit stands up tall and taps it down to point"
"<b>huge lbw appeal</b>, but its been turned out, perhaps because of height. Promising signs though, because the batsman is beaten by some lateral movement, off the pitch though and not necessarily in the air. Rohit sees a length ball, tries to flick, but is pinned high on his front pad. The umpire weathers the plea from Thisara"
""
"steps forward and inside the line, with the ball coming in from around the wicket, and drives through cover"
"rocks back to a shortish delivery, that has no turn, and flicks it with the angle to deep square leg"
on the pads and Rohit clips it along the ground through midwicket
"moves back to a good length ball, well aware that there is no turn, and punches to mid-on"
"now he steps down the track, but Gunathilaka pulls his length back, and then dives full-length to his left to prevent the drive becoming runs"
"stays beside the ball, he does that well, and nails the cover drive. He's played that shot really well in this match."
"is that move seam off the pitch? Rohit, as set batsman, is compelled to square up by a good length ball looking for the top of off stump and block with an angled bat"
"almost... almost.... and it's tipped over. Rohit has fifty, India has hundred, Sri Lanka has... bad luck. This is ferociously hit. It's meant to go over the deep square leg fielder, and Gunaratne does well, steadying himself on the rope, leaping back, getting both hands to it. But it spills through"
"slower in pace, but hits a good length just outside off, Rohit is already waiting with his defensive shot and gets an inside edge onto pad"
"muscled! There's no risk in this shot. He picks the length early, swivels on the back foot, and pulls hard and flat behind square leg. It's the short boundary too. Class batting from Rohit"
"full on middle and off, Rohit, hanging back in his crease, expecting the short ball perhaps, has to reach in front of him with a straight bat"
tucks into a single to deep square leg
on the pads and Rohit milks it for a couple through square leg
"flat and quick on leg stump, it's stopped in its tracks"
"fine shot! It's a credit to Rohit's footwork, to be more precise how quickly he comes down the track that a bowler bowling flat has gotten to the pitch of the good length ball and pummeled down the ground past mid-off's right"
"flatter delivery, Rohit hangs back and flicks to midwicket"
"<b>beaten</b> by a straight one! This is what Gunathilaka is looking for. The angle working for him, with the batsman looking for turn."
gets beside the shortish delivery outside off and pats it towards cover
"shortish on middle and leg, Rohit works it to deep square leg"
"oh, he's missed out. The cut comes out strong as ever, but Dhawan picks the point fielder."
"well played. He spots a slower ball, dabs it to the left of point and receives the nod from Rohit on a quick single. Lovely"
lines up behind the shortish delivery on off stump
gets up tall against a back of a length delivery and punches to mid-off
he's annoyed with himself for nailing a back foot cover drive straight to the fielder. I'd be tweeting about it for days. #HighElbow
"full, slow and wide outside off. Dhawan lets it go and tags in the umpire"
"good length, nibbling for a nibble outside off, Dhawan summons his inner scrooge and doesn't give out any treats"
"gets down the track, a sign that he is comfortable with Malinga's pace, but not his length, and thumps the ball to cover"
"full on off stump, defends"
"happy to hit on the up, without any footwork, and that's because he's confident he can pick the gap. This shot is made by his balance, even if he doesn't move, head over the ball, hands flowing through the line. His power takes care of the rest"
the fast bowler comes back with a predictably short ball and Rohit pulls it down to long leg. This is all very PlayStation batting
"silly old short ball. Go think about life at deep square leg, says Dhawan with a pull"
"good length and outside off, Dhawan, staying on the back foot, mistimes the push to cover"
"sprints down the pitch, and having done so a tad too early, Thisara is able to shorten his length and not give the room that Dhawan so craves"
"full and sliding down, Dhawan looks for the pick up shot over square leg but gets hit on the pad. Rohit whisks him across for a single"
"now it's Dhawan's turn to help his partner profit off a mis-hit. Rohit shapes to tap into the leg side, but with the ball straightening, takes a little caution. Outside edge towards point"
step forward and block. That's all.
"shortish and outside off, punches it to the sweeper"
"nails it through extra cover. It's a tiny gap, but it is easily accessed when the bowler bowls a wide half-volley. That's Dhawan's fifty, second in as many matches. Fine knock. Never looked troubled"
"shortish and outside off, moving around the wicket, cuts to the sweeper"
"looks for the bouncer, on and around off stump. Malinga would make batsmen hop in his best years. Here, Rohit blunts it quite easily"
"they keep going. Or rather they keep coming. Rohit pulls, but the ball climbs on him, he is so not in control of the shot, but it takes the top edge and sails over long leg"
"ah, the irony! He gets a lot more bat on this. Actually surprisingly good connection, with the shot being somewhere between a pull and a flick. The problem though is, with the better contact, the short ball goes squarer and finds the man on the boundary at long leg. Sri Lanka sigh in relief. India groan, 'oh, 200 denied'"
"good length ball outside off, Kohli ignores it"
... without warming up perhaps for he slides the first one down leg and it trundles down to long leg off a Dhawan flick
brings him forward with a good length ball outside off and Kohli plants the middle of his bat on it to cover point
"back of a length and outside off, Kohli won't indulge yet"
"fullish and outside off, Kohli goes for the on the up drive, he's into the shot a touch too early though and mistimes to cover"
"he's got him! Pradeep, you beauty, baiting Kohli outside off, and nabbing him <i>easily</i>. The shot is risky, with a slip in, but the batsman goes for the glide to third man anyway. A touch of seam movement away, but more importantly a little extra bounce, undoes him."
"back of a length on off stump, defends under his eyes."
"yorker from around the wicket, Dhawan protects his castle"
and he plunders next ball. It's a short one and Dhawan picks it early and puts it away through midwicket. Hitting in front of square shows how unafraid the batsman is to pull the bouncer
"he's still good when he goes full, and he beats Dhawan with a wide yorker. Ladies and gentlemen, the Malinga of old"
"full on middle and off, Dhawan opens the face and tries to pinch a single to cover, but the Sri Lanka fielders are on their toes. Good to see. They're building pressure."
"every time Malinga's missed his spot, Dhawan finds the boundary, and invariably its the one at cover. The yorker goes awry and the batsman picks the gap between mid-off and cover"
"low full toss, which Dhawan squirts out to deep point"
"full on leg stump, clips it out to deep midwicket"
"looks to drive on the up, but he's into the shot a tad too early. So he checks it, and opens the face a lot more, to find the gap at point"
"tip and run, this is good from Yuvraj. Blocks a good length ball into the covers and before the fielder can come in, he's almost three-fourth down"
"well done, Gunathilaka at point, diving to his right and stopping a superbly timed cut shot"
"finds the gap behind square leg, and he's only helped it away. There is no malice in this stroke. Just a batsman picking his opportunity. All of Sri Lanka's short balls aren't rising to that head-shoulder height that will induce nerves."
"again! Dhawan is on song! He should thank Sri Lanka too for supplying him with a steady drivel of short-pitched bowling. Makes his own room this time and carves it behind point, and in front of third man on the boundary"
"good length ball, just outside off, from around the wicket. Yuvraj pats it through cover to get off strike"
this is getting too easy. Dhawan tucks into a wide half-volley and nails it past cover's left. Long-off on the boundary has no chance
eases it through cover for a single this time
comes forward to block a good length ball on off stump
"well done. He holds this back just a tad, sensing Yuvraj had lined him up, and his spidey sense helps him beat the batsman's inside edge as he drives away from his body"
"flat and quick on off stump, blocks"
shortish and it makes Dhawan hop off his toes to get on top of the bounce. No run towards point
"no room offered, and Dhawan, in trying to manufacture room, gets an inside edge and the ball doesn't go past the crease line. A sign of the fun India are having is that Dhawan jumps in and out of his crease, feigning a run even as the fielder comes in and then throwing his head back to laugh"
nudgles it away behind square leg
easy put away again as Yuvraj taps it off his hips to long leg
"struck in the stomach, serves him right not to read the slower ball. Dhawan loads up the pull - an instinctive shot - and is caught unawares by Thisara."
turns a rather straight delivery to long leg to retain strike
"slow through the air, tossed up as well, and so Dhawan gives it the respect it deserves."
"flatter in trajectory and so Dhawan rocks back, gets himself nice and tall and punches to long-on"
"huge appeal, as Gunathilaka gets a straight one past Yuvraj's inside edge. The batsman was playing ofr turn, but he rarely does that. Height an issue there"
"races down the track, turns a good length ball into a half-volley and then has to scurry back into his crease because Gunathilaka dives to his right and pulls off a stunning save"
"a tad short, he guides it to cover point"
"quickish, full on off stump, Yuvraj can only block. End of a good over. Lovely variations in pace, as opposed to just flat darts"
has to defend with Thisara hitting a hard length and refusing Dhawan the room he loves
"shortish on middle and leg, short-arm pulls it to the right of long leg"
takes on a short ball with plenty of room and pulls. But it skews off the bottom of the bat towards the left of mid-on
"<b>uppish</b> and point makes a grand effort, moving forward and to his left, but it just doesn't carry to him. Gunathilaka, take a bow. And Thisara too, getting some help off the pitch. Read deceptively slower pace, and extra bounce. Dhawan, looking to play a forceful shot through the off side, is surprised"
"pulls, powerfully, the short ball on middle and off stump. There is protection at deep square leg though"
slaps a shortish delivery to cover
"on the pads, works it away calmly to deep midwicket"
"steps forward to a good length ball and blocks in front of short cover. There shouldn't be a single there, but Dhawan's manipulated the field so well"
"lines this up, but that big swing of the bat is not big enough. The ball sneaks under it to hit his pad. Not entirely short enough for the pull"
blocks on middle
"good length ball on middle, Yuvraj benefits from a little inside edge out to deep square leg"
stays beside the flighted delivery on off stump and drives through cover
"slower offcutter outside off, played quietly towards point"
"another slow, straight one, worked to square leg easily."
"bowled. Chopped on. Unfortunate. But that's how it goes. A yorker outside off, Yuvraj gets his high back lift down just in time to jam that yorker out. But with the momentum of Yuvraj not having got to the ball in time, the ball goes backwards. Just clips the top of off and middle. Yuvraj is distraught and SL strike. Crucial wicket. Will stop the attack for now"
"fullish and straight, pushed back to the bowler."
"big big appeal. <strong>Mathews chooses to review.</strong> Did that pitch in line? Umpire Kettleborough says no. Was there bat on that? A proper offcutter on leg, no bat, but it pitched well outside leg. No bat, says UltraEdge. A green to start and a green to end. Decision is upheld."
"another cutter down leg, clipped to square leg"
"on a length down leg, worked to deep square leg"
"fullish delivery outside off, pushed away towards cover. Tidy bowling"
"fullish delivery outside off, and left alone by Dhoni"
"cut away over third man for six! Short and wide from Lakmal, poor ball. Dhoni gets underneath the length and lifts the ball somehow over third man. He was slightly square and would have been out had he been in a regulation position"
"on the pads, worked to midwicket for a run"
"nicely bowled, nicely played. Close to off, and played down towards his feet and gets across to complete a tight run"
"flat and quick from Asela, straight, punched away to long-on from the back foot"
"tossed up outside off, driven up towards mid-off for a quick single. Good batting"
"on the pads, flicked down to short fine leg. Loud no from Dhoni"
"flat again and straight, punched up towards long-on"
"the quicker one. Flat, quick, skids on. Dhoni keeps that one out"
"popped back towards the bowler. No pace into the ball, no pace from the bat. An offcutter on leg, leading edge back to the bowler"
"on the pads, driven to long-on. Too easy for these two"
"flat on off, nice length to Dhoni. Better short than full. Defended off the back foot"
"tossed up outside off, driven towards cover"
"somehow finds a gap. Flat down leg, and Dhoni helps himself to four with a half-pull between square leg and fine leg"
"too straight, an easy nudge towards fine leg for a run"
"overpitched on the pads, worked away to midwicket. Another dot. Getting through these middle overs"
"flatter on off, nice lines these. Pushed away to cover."
"a flat delivery on the pads, Dhoni misses his flick and is struck on the thigh pad. Another dot"
"flat down leg, Dhoni tries to paddle him away but it skids on and beats Dhoni's sweep. Struck on the pad"
"overpitched on leg, clipped to deep midwicket for one"
"flatter delivery outside off, carved to the sweeper cover. Dhawan had set off, but Dhoni waited for it to beat the fielder. Dhawan knew it had gone past"
"a bit of width. Short and wide, slashed to the sweeper cover"
"excellent line. Flat on off, punched with use of that bottom hand to cover"
"quicker and fuller and wider outside off, Dhoni leans into his drive and finds one to the sweeper cover"
"nice lines. Fullish and straight, defended towards cover."
"comes down, and hits the ball through cover for a couple. Not great timing but found the gap so will get two to the sweeper cover sweeping at cover"
"lovely shot. A leg side delivery down leg, Dhawan flicks that behind square. Intentionally put it in that gap and moves closer. Great hitting"
"full and wide outside off, chopped towards point. Dot"
"good length around off, tidy around off, played towards point"
"gets that alright. Picks the length early, a short ball on middle. Dhoni stays back and hammers a pull in front of midwicket. One bounce and into the boundary. Wow."
"full and straight, plumb in front if Dhoni did not get bat but he has got a massive inside edge onto his pad. Ricochets towards cover"
"<strong>that's hundred for Dhawan</strong>. What an innings. Takes off his helmet and soaks it all in. Well deserved. Shortish delivery outside off, Dhawan arches his back and cuts behind point for four. Fantastic knock. Took away all the pressure after Kohli's wicket"
"lucky! Chipped to the deep square leg. Full delivery on leg, just a bunt off his pad to the deep square leg fielder"
"a slower ball on leg, nudged to square leg"
"on the pads, Dhoni flicks and calls for two immediately but won't get there. The fielder is quick on it."
"a low full toss outside off, driven to long-on. Dhawan wants two, but it isn't there. The fielder, Gunaratne, hits the stumps at the bowler's end. The ricochet though allows two"
"that's four more. Full and wide outside off, Dhawan walks across and drills the ball straight. Past Dhoni. Dhoni wants two but Dhawan knows it's gone past. FGunaratne dives to his left but the ball goes through"
"looking for the ramp. Full down leg, Dhawan looks to go over fine leg but gets there early. Goes off the toe end towards square leg."
"fullish down leg, off the pad towards midwicket for one."
"full and wide, just inside the tramline. Good bowling. Dhawan looks to go over midwicket but doesn't make contact. Maybe an inside edge. Through to the keeper"
"lovely shot. A low full toss outside off, sliced to the deep point fielder for a run"
"that's not good bowling. Short delivery down leg, Dhawan gets inside the line and wallops a pick-up flick over fine leg. Sensational shot. Gone a long way back. Bad ball"
"a slower ball down leg, pulled to deep midwicket"
"slugged away past midwicket. Can't bowl a full toss, can't miss your length. Looking for a yorker, it's a full toss that is heaved away past midwicket for a boundary. Lovely hit"
"four more. A low full toss outside off, Dhoni slices a drive intentionally past point and it races away again. The point fielder has no chance."
"143 kph, a low full toss outside off, Dhoni misses a drive this time. Goes past his bat and well kept by the keeper. It bounced after missing the bat"
"<b>dropped</b>. A slow delivery outside off, Dhawan gets across and inside the line. Swept away over square leg. Deep midwicket gets across but can't quite get a hand on it. Goes past and for four. Gunathilaka"
"another slower ball, outside off, Dhawan chips a flick to long-on. Looking to go over square leg, who is inside the circle"
"a slower short ball on leg, helped along to fine leg for a run. Good change-up."
"another slower ball outside off, Dhawan mis-times to long-off. So bad that long-on gets across and Dhoni makes two with no hassle"
"a slower, short wide delivery is cut to point"
"yet another slower ball outside off, chops and finds point. Another dot. Used that offcutter well, to take pace away. Dhawan is fatigued"
goes for the wide yorker but misses the tramline. Wide called
"lovely yorker on middle, pushed back towards his partner and it hits Dhawan. Took so long to get out of the way, clearly tiring. They still get one"
"a low full toss down leg, follows the backing-away Dhawan, flicked to fine leg"
"another full, wide delivery that goes out of the legal range. Wide called"
"hammered away into the gap. A low full toss outside off, Dhoni manages to get typical power behind that drive. Finds the gap between two deep fielders too. Wow, what muscle"
""
"not called. Low full toss down leg. Dhawan backed away, then got back inside the line, looking for a ramp. Misses."
"off the toe end again. A short slow delivery down leg, toe-ended to deep midwicket for a single."
"taken. End of Dhawan's quality for now. A slow, wide delivery outside off. Dhawan wants to hit the short leg side boundary but it's far too wide outside off to do that. He gets enough behind it but not great timing and his weary body lets him down. Goes straight down long-on's throat. Superb innings from Dhawan, he'll agree it's right up there. These weren't easy conditions and he hardly played a false shot."
"that's Dhoni at his best. Short delivery down leg, Dhoni gets a bit of bat on that to get it very fine, past fine leg for four. Just paddled. No force. Knows what's happening"
"another shortish delivery on middle, helped down to fine leg"
"another short offcutter, Pandya gets on top of the bounce and pulls with soft hands towards deep square leg. Massive leg side boundaries and two easy runs the result."
"another short ball down leg, paddled away again down to fine leg this time"
"another short ball on leg, pulled down to fine leg. Good over from Malinga"
"good field placement. Full and wide from Lakmal, Dhoni changes the colour of the ball by removing the leather with that bludgeoned drive to deep cover"
"a slow delivery that is far too wide for Pandya to reach, left alone. Wide called"
"a slower ball outside off, Pandya wants to get bat on ball  but the ball goes on. Beats the bat. Was an offcutter"
short boundary and six. Boom. Can't miss the yorker. A low full toss and Pandya lifts the ball over midwicket nonchalantly. Just can't err
gone! That's the longer boundary. Full and wide from Lakmal. Well bowled. Bowling to his field. Pandya wanted to go more over cover and the ball skews off the outside half and lobs towards the sweeper cover who comes in and completes a routine catch. Good comeback by Lakmal after the previous ball
"short and wide outside off, sliced past point for a couple. Behind the fielder. Bowling it there intentionally"
"another slower ball outside off, goes under Dhoni's bat. Dot. Good response from Lakmal"
"a slower short delivery on middle, pulled to deep square leg"
"shortish delivery outside off, carved towards point. Another dot."
"slower short ball down leg, nudged down to fine leg. Wanted that finer"
a slower delivery drifts down leg for a wide. Sri Lanka should have finished their innings by now
"hammered back past the bowler. Slower delivery outside off, Jadhav runs down and flat-bats it back past the bowler for a couple"
"short outside off, carved to backward point"
"that will be four. A slower delivery down leg, clipped past the keeper and that races away for four down to fine leg. Nice, deft touch from Jadhav"
"excellently bowled. Playing with the margins. Wins this one. Full and very wide outside off, on line with the tramline. Dot"
"Dhoni comes down, looking to slug it away but it's a low full toss and all he can do it mis-time it back to the bowler"
"on the bounce to long-off. Full and wide outside off, helicopter-ed that to long-off. Asks for a new bat and<strong> brings up his fifty too. </strong>"
"excellent bowling. A low full toss outside off, pushed back to the bowler. Just nothing in the full, straight line"
"full and very wide again, jammed away towards point"
"he misses his length and it's going to go. Don't expect anything else. A low full toss, right in the slot. Straight. Swung away over midwicket for a massive six."
"a slower, straight ball, outside-edged towards cover. More leading edge"
"another slower delivery on leg, nudged to deep square leg with soft hands. Calls two and in the end overs, does he ever not get what he wants?"
"length on leg, worked to midwicket. Dot. Cannot bowl full, or miss his yorker so Malinga doesn't play with those margins. Bowls length"
"and again. A short slower ball on middle, pushed away to long-off"
"yet another slower ball on middle, worked to midwicket. One more"
"finds the gap. Short and wide from Malinga, doesn't want to get hit for six over midwicket. Bowls it short and wide, cut through point. What execution this has been from Dhonu"
"a full toss on off, swung away, on the bounce to deep midwicket, Short boundary too, that should have been six"
"taken on the boundary. Full and wide again from Perera, slightly predictable, but it isn't quite in Dhoni's swinging arc. He has to manufacture his own power and does, but doesn't get good timing. Skews off the outside half and lands in long-off's hands. Important runs saved these could be"
"that's six. Makes up this time. Gets right across, it's a predictable line. And then just sweeps it through square leg. No fielder there"
tries again. But this is a yorker. Outside off. Goes underneath Jadhav's sweep. Off the pad to the keeper.
"that goes for four more. A low full toss outside off, swept away towards deep midwicket again. All along the ground and that's four"
"another boundary. A short slow legcutter outside off, jadhav swings and hits the ball over square leg. Skips off the surface and races away"
"full and wide, the batsman wafts his bat out, timidly, somewhere between a punch and a free-flowing drive. Not good signs. Worse because he's beaten"
"a tentative block, with the bat going away from the body, and the shortish delivery pings off the inside edge onto his boot"
"hacks a good length ball on middle and off through midwicket. It nearly travels the distance, and Umesh has to put in a slide to flick the ball back, and then picks it up only after making sure the back foot doesn't touch the advertising skirting. Well done. Good presence of mind"
"direct hit at the bowler's would have had Gunathilaka! This start is going to make the dressing room break out with the heebie-jeebies. Dickwella isn't confident playing his shots, Gunathilaka is racing out of his crease for a non-existent single. Jadhav at midwicket takes the shy but misses"
covers the line on middle and off and defends to show he is a proper opening batsman. That's more like it
"shortish on off stump, blocks"
digs into the pitch and makes the ball rise up near the shoulder outside off. Gunathilaka gets up on his toes and taps it towards cover
pushes him back again and Gunathilaka is able to tap it through midwicket
"opens the face, and is denied runs by Jadeja diving to his right at point. Crisp strike, solid fielding"
"shortish on middle and leg, nudged towards square leg"
"full on off stump, blocks it back whence it came"
"gets a 141 kph good length ball to nip away off the seam enough that Gunathilaka, looking to flick through midwicket, gets a bit of a leading edge to mid-off"
"the slightest straying in line and Dickwella has the chance for a free swing, flicking the ball towards long leg"
"half an appeal for lbw, but it would have pitched outside leg. Nice, tight lines from Bhuvneshwar, careful not to give the batsman room. Gunathilaka looks for the pick up shot but misses"
"the traditional, Test-match, good length ball angled across the left-hander, gets the traditional leave alone"
good work. There was an early call of yes and the response was in earnest as well. Good length ball pushed down to the left of mid-off
"risky shot, but these are the kinds Dickwella plays and plays well. Picks it up even though he isn't on top of the bounce on off stump and whips it just past mid-on's left"
"full and outside off brings Gunathilaka's attacking intent out, but his on-the-up drive finds mid-off"
"wanders around his crease, but the rapid, and rapidly improving, Umesh is not fooled. He hits back of a length over the top of off stump and the extra bounce beats the batsman"
"now he follows Dickwella's move to leg with a short ball, only it might well have wandered over his head. Wide called"
"flicks away the leg-stump half-volley, goes on the bounce to long leg - who chose not to go forward and see if it might be a chance. Jadhav was the man making that call."
"where's that gone, wonders Gunathilaka, as he is turned around by a good length ball seaming away off the deck. Leading edge ends up at third man"
veers leg side again and Umesh pings in a 142 kph short delivery and still succeeds in cramping Dickwella again.
pulls a short delivery on middle and leg to long leg
"good plan, but the gentle dab behind point for a quick single doesn't work with India's fielders rushing in."
"shortish and outside off, steers it to point"
"hello! He goes for the slog, playing across the line of a good length delivery, and it zips through to the wicketkeeper"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"he finds success with it as well! I'm half certain this is a knuckle ball. Either way, it was a slightly slower ball, induces a false shot. Dickwella, nervous, jittery, not-sure-if-he-should-hang-in-there-or-hit-out Dickwella goes for a whip across the line and gets a leading edge that is pouched at point"
"fullish and outside off, slices it towards backward point"
"looks for a little legcutter, but in trying to do so he goes short and wide and Gunathilaka whacks it through the covers"
"back of a length and just outside off, Mendis blocks carefully. He's got two slips to worry about."
"fullish delivery on and around off stump, Mendis is right behind it again"
he's getting some purchase off the pitch - as a few out and out quicks have done banging it in back of a length. Mendis is originally drawn into playing at the ball and might well have been beaten despite trying to pull the bat inside the line
<b>outside edge</b> as the shortish delivery on and around off stump just nips away off the seam. Good control from Umesh.
a touch straight to the left-hander and Gunathilaka is able to pinch a single to midwicket
"full on off stump, Mendis protects it zealously. He looks like the man Sri Lanka should be batting around"
moves around the wicket for a short of a good length ball which Gunathilaka tries to glide through point. Not enough room for such shenanigans so he gets a single off the inside edge to cover
"goes short on middle and leg, pulls to long leg"
"shortish and outside off, Gunathilaka lashes it to the left of deep third man"
pushes him back with a quick delivery on and around off stump. Mendis ensures he keeps his bat straight
"shortish on off stump, pushes it past the bowler"
"jumps back and pulls - not too hard - past square leg. He doesn't really have the room to free the arms, but he controls it quite well."
"looks for the bouncer, but it doesn't rise up high enough, and it has all the pace Gunathilaka is looking for. Swivels on his back foot and pulls it over the boundary"
"shortish on middle and leg, turns it around the corner at square leg"
"shot! This should calm him down. If that six hadn't done so already. Steps forward to a proper fast bowler and plinks him through extra cover. On the up, all timing."
"good length ball, from around the wicket, Gunathilaka uses the angle to flick to midwicket"
"opens the face against a full delivery outside off, but he can't find the gap at cover"
blocks down the pitch as Umesh targets the top of off stump
"looks to punch a back of a length delivery through the off side, but he finds cover. Orthodox players like Mendis often do with the field up. The good ones hold their nerve despite that"
"wafts away from the body, and the <b>outside edge</b> flies past first slip's right. Would have been gobbled up by second slip"
"now he goes for the pull, when the ball isn't too short, and it slips under his bat. Mendis needs to calm down."
"<b>that's a ripper</b>. Mendis could have been the best batsman in the world and he still would've only edged that to the keeper. So he should consider himself lucky that he is only beaten. Pitches on middle and off, angling into the right-hander, then goes barking past the outside edge"
"shortish on off stump, steered to cover point with soft hands"
"full on off stump, Mendis defends with his bat held only in the top hand, well in front of his body, doing his best to check his shot having been early into it"
"back of a length on off stump, Gunathilaka thinks about a single to point, but Jadeja's the fielder, India's best, and Mendis yells no immediately."
"pummeled down the ground! That's more like it. India haven't bowled too full today, but this one is and the tall left-hander takes full too. Looks very pleasing when he drives."
"good length ball on middle and off, blocks"
"fullish on middle and leg, Gunathilaka pats it towards mid-on, gently, for a single"
into the pads and Mendis flicks to square leg
"runs a shortish delivery down the third man, and though it is off a thick outside edge, credit to Mendis for playing with soft hands and ensuring if he is deceived, the ball will go to ground more often than not"
"back of a length on off stump, pushes it towards cover point"
"moves around the wicket to the left-hander, who uses that angle to pull a ball that isn't necessarily short to deep square leg"
top-edge over the keeper. Those are always welcome. But it does emphasise the change in this Indian bowling attack. They know they're fast. They threaten with short balls. This one was heading for the badge and Mendis is too slow on the hook
"another short ball, Mendis picks it up earlier this time and avoids it"
"into the pads, Mendis exploits the gap in front of square on the on side. With deep midwicket back, he gets an easy couple"
"full on middle, turns it around to long leg"
"141 kph, shortish on off stump, Mendis eases it to point"
"looks to punch a back of a length delivery on the up, but it climbs on him and he only gets an inside edge"
width and he lays into it. It's probably the first time he's had the chance to free his arms and he suddenly finds how quick the outfield is.
"full and outside off, nails the cover drive, but now there's a man out there. Long stride forward, lovely bent knee, Mendis slowly getting in and getting set"
runs the shortish delivery outside off to deep third man
steps forward in response to a full and wide delivery but finds backward point with his drive
"starts with a slightly slow, back of a length delivery. Gunathilaka blocks with soft hands and finds a single towards point"
"he's getting a little grip from the pitch, or at least this ball does so. Hits a good length on middle, Mendis is looking to flick it, but has to watch out as the ball doesn't come on. Blocks with a straighter bat"
bangs it into the middle of the pitch and Mendis spots it very early and avoids it very easily
moves just enough across onto middle and off to pull a short ball away to long leg. Clever batting to raise the <b>fifty partnership</b>
"back of a length and outside off, Gunathilaka guides to point"
"full and outside off, lashes it in front of point. Good on him for placing that well away from Jadeja"
the angle from around the wicket slides the ball onto the batsman's hip and that is what the ball connects with before going to long leg
"likes the ball in his half of the pitch, but this time, his drive on the up nearly leads to his wicket. Kohli at mid-on moves to his left, trying to get under the ball, but having realised he would never claim the catch, he puts his body behind it and stops any runs"
"scorching short ball, on and around off stump, which is important. Also key here is how he doesn't bang it into the middle of the pitch, giving the batsman an early gauge of its length. Gunathilaka to his credit dropped his wrists and swayed out of the way very well"
"fullish delivery, pushes it to mid-on, and takes on Kohli. Puts in the dive as well and with the Indian captain not picking the ball up, there is no threat of a run-out"
"back of a length and outside off, punches it through cover"
"goes short again, doing his best to cramp the left-hander, but Gunathilaka swivels and pulls. He gets no bat, but it does trickle away to the long leg boundary off his legs"
"full on off stump, Mendis defends inside the line and gets a bit of an outside edge to cover"
"<b>nearly carries</b> to short cover! It's the centurion doing the fielding there, diving forward to try and make something happen. But Mendis, pulling his bottom hand off the bat, after being deceived by the slower pace at which the ball comes, survives"
"back of a length and outside off, runs it to point"
"digs it in short and outside off, Mendis ignores it"
"<b>dropped</b> by the bowler. It was driven firmly back in his direction and Pandya, in his followthrough, does get both hands to it. Too much power in the shot for him to hold on though"
"shortish on middle and leg, Mendis leaps across onto off stump and defuses it to midwicket"
"sharp angle into the left-hander, and Bumrah has this knack of making balls hurry off the pitch. This is one of those, and Gunathilaka handles it well, bringing the bat down quickly and sending it to point"
gets a bit of an outside edge as he goes searching for a good length ball on off stump. Bumrah gets the ball to straighten just enough to beat the middle of the bat. Misfield from Jadeja allows a single
"good length ball on off stump, blocks firmly"
"shortish and outside off, Mendis whips it to the right of mid-on, all with his wrists."
"huge appeal for lbw, as Gunathilaka plays around the straight ball, beaten for pace. Umpire Kettleborough knows it hits him above the pad and so would go over the stumps"
"he rarely overpitches, but having done so to Gunathilaka, who has always been on the lookout to flaunt his drives, he has to walk off nursing a bruised ego. No fast bowler likes being hammered down the ground like he's a dibbly-dobbly wibbly-wobbly bowler"
"shortish on middle and leg, works it in front of square leg"
"flashes hard outside off, knowing there are no slips in, and he gets a boundary to third man"
"good lenght ball, a touch slower than normal, Gunathilaka isn't fooled though. Waits on his shot and clips it through square leg"
"seems set to unleash a big stroke, but he realises the good length ball is too close to the off stump, and would be hard to get under. So Gunathilaka, instead, runs it to point"
"goes for a pull, but doesn't quite connect properly. Perhaps he was into the shot a tad early. Anyway, inside edge to long leg"
"too short, and it flies away, well over Mendis' head, down leg as well. Penalised"
"lovely control with the pull. Makes sure it goes behind square, and away from the fielder, as well for a couple."
"stays back, seeing the flatter trajectory, but it's full-length delivery. That's why Gunathilaka's push becomes an inside edge to long leg"
"well bowled. He tosses it up, the angle of the ball taking the ball in towards off stump, and then he gets just enough spin as well. Mendis blocks well, soft hands, bat face straight and pointing down"
"steps forward nicely, and across as well, to nudge the ball towards silly mid-on"
"now he hits the drive a little uppishly, and he is happy to do so for he makes sure the ball is well to the right of Jadeja"
"shortish and outside off, Gunathilaka taps it through cover"
leans over the fuller delivery outside off and flicks it to mid-on
"fullish length around off, Gunathilaka wants to turn this into the leg side, but gets a leading edge back to the bowler"
swung away for six. Premeditated a slog. Got the length to boot and slugged it away over midwicket for six. Nice way <strong>to get to fifty</strong>. In his first game of the tournament
"a slower ball outside off, tapped down to third man for a run"
"back of a length outside off, pushed away towards point. Nicely bowled."
"back of a length on the pads, worked to square leg for one"
"a slower ball, nice end. Good comeback from Pandya. Pulled that over back nicely"
"flat on middle, Mendis bends low and just stabs a pull to midwicket. Not short enough and adjusted well"
worked away towards midwicket. 100 up for SL. They are still in this
"sloppy from Yuvraj. Flat on leg, Mendis chips down and bunts a flick wide of midwicket. Long-on gets across but over-runs it. Goes for four"
"flat on off, nudged to midwicket"
"flat down leg, Mendis misses a flick. A big appeal, not given. India don't review. Sliding down"
"beautiful batting this. Slightly short from Jadeja, Mendis rocks back and pulls over midwicket. Finds the gap. Knew if it was short, I'm going over midwicket. No one there. Execution flawless"
"excellent single. On a length outside off, dabbed towards third man"
"back of a length outside off, carved to third man. Played that late"
nicely steered to third man. Good length outside off
"on a length but sliding down leg, 142 kph, off the pad towards fine leg"
"a slower delivery outside off, Gunathilaka defends."
"superb single. Just what India were doing. Drop and run. A nice slower ball on off, patted to silly point and both respond well"
"flat and quick and straight, swept to deep square leg"
"slower outside off, crisply driven into the gap to the sweeper cover"
"too straight again, worked to fine leg for one"
"flat and straight, driven back to the bowler"
"picks his area again. No midwicket with the four-fielder rule. Jadeja is happy with that shot. hit me if you can. Kay, says Mendis as he sweeps over midwicket. out if he missed. But he didn't miss"
"fullish on off, driven back"
"back of a length on middle, Gunathilaka misses a flick and is struck on the midriff, but Mendis is aware the single is on. And calls him through"
"shortish length outside off, nudged to midwicket"
"too straight from Bumrah, flicked to square leg"
"too straight from Bumrah, flicked down to fine leg for one."
"another slower ball outside off, excellent change-up. An IPL style slower ball. Mendis defends"
"Bumrah's biggest weakness some may say. I'd agree. Full and straight, worked to midwicket. But Bumrah has overstepped."
"and that's his biggest strength. Beautiful and ugly in two balls. A superb yorker on the pads, Mendis is beaten for pace and movement. The ball ricochets off his pad towards fine leg as he falls over."
"flat and quick, straight. Driven back. 'Bahut badiya (very good), Jaad,' yells Dhoni"
"that is excellent from Mendis. Runs down the pitch, isn't quite there and flicks the ball over midwicket. Same area. Gets enough bat and clears the boundary. <b>Fifty too</b>"
driven to long-off
"bad choice of stroke. Just because he executes doesn't mean it's the right shot. Gets low and reverse sweeps a straight Jadeja over third man. Out if he missed that. But he didn't miss, importantly"
"flat outside off, blocked"
"pad or glove? Pad, I think. Flat down leg, Dhoni collects down the leg side and appeals. But that was thigh pad. Umpire kettleborough got that wrong. You should be able to review that, I feel."
"and that's a much much better shot. Sits back, waits for the short ball and cuts behind point. He took the risk earlier in the over with a reverse sweep to put jadeja off his length and reaps reward here"
"back of a length on off, pushed back to the bowler"
"fullish delivery outside off, hammered to mid-off"
"on a length on leg, Mendis flicks him away through midwicket. One more"
"a low full toss outside off, pushed to cover on the bounce. The Oval goes up in celebration, a crowd catch"
"nice slower ball outside off, tapped to point for a single. Tight run. Makes it in the end"
"full and straight, driven away to mid-on. Tidy over, just stalls the momentum for now"
"slower delivery outside off to start from Pandya, played away towards the keeper"
"good length outside off, tapped to third man. Point dives to his left but can't cut it off"
"pops out as he hits the ground. fantastic effort from Rohit. Runs in and gets his fingers underneath but the ball comes out somehow as he falls over. A full delivery outside off, Gunathilaka plays an unnecessary heave towards long-on. Good effort, coming in"
"full on off, Mendis drills the ball over Pandya's head. Dead straight. Deadly area to hit the ball"
"quick on the pull, gets lucky, gets four. Shortish delivery on middle, a leading edge for Mendis, the ball goes over the keeper. One bounce and into the boundary, 180 degree opposite to the previous ball"
"three on the bounce. Almost literally. This too, skids into the boundary on the single bounce. Back of a length down leg, picks the length early and swats a pull  behind square. Mendis all over India"
"nicely tossed up outside off, driven towards cover"
"flat and wide outside off, smashed to long-off. Just the one"
"full and straight, driven to long-on for a run"
"full and wide outside off, toe-ended away towards third man"
"wow, too close to cut. Flat on off, Gunathilaka goes back and cuts perilously. Gets one to point"
"flat down leg, swept to deep backward square leg"
"drops short, good length on middle. Swivel-pulled behind square for four. Easily done. The wheels falling off"
"full and wide outside off, a thick inside edge somehow misses the stumps. A run"
drifts down leg and Gunathilka flicks him through backward square leg for a couple. Kohli not happy
"full and straight, driven back. 'Aage se marne de,' says Dhoni, translates to 'let him hit from the front foot."
"that was so unnecessary and Gunathilaka is gone I think. Yup, just in the air and India have a wicket courtesy a run-out. A completely unnecessary second run and India have a way back. Worked to backward square leg and Gunathilaka calls for the second. Dhoni picks the throw on the bounce from Umesh yadav and just about takes the bails off in time. A full-length dive can't save Gunathilaka. The ball came out of his glove just after he took off the bails. Lucky for India, but their good fielding has done it again. Happened to Sri Lanka against SA too."
"on the pads, clipped to short fine leg for one."
"flat outside off, slapped to the sweeper cover"
"a yorker on leg, played back to the bowler. Things getting tense"
"that's tripe. Short and wide outside off, sits up for Mendis to clatter through cover. Easy four runs. Tried something else"
"on the pads, worked to midwicket for one"
"nicely played. Shortish outside off, Kusal Perera hurries back to cut to the sweeper cover"
"overpitched on middle and leg, driven to long-on"
"that legcutter type action almost results in a leading edge. Flat outside off, a thick outside edge goes to long-off just past Kohli's left"
"flat and wide, slapped to the sweeper cover"
"full and wide outside off, driven to long-off"
"on the pads, sliding down, a leg bye"

"flat outside off, Kusal gets across and sweeps towards square leg"
"flat on leg, swept to deep square leg. One more"
"round-arm action, goes down leg, wide"
"<strong>dropped</strong>! Very hard. Flat on off, Kusal tries to cut but the ball takes a massive deflection and no chance really for Dhoni"
hardly bounced. A two-bouncer almost. Played away towards third man
driven to long-on
"just short. Full outside off, chipped away towards cover. The fielder dives in front but just can't get there"
shovelled away towards midwicket for one
"full and straight, down leg, off the pad towards midwicket. No run"
"flat on leg, worked to midwicket. A tight run."
"full and wide outside off, carved to the sweeper cover"
"short outside off, flat-batted to long-on for a run"
"good length on off, played back towards the bowler"
"back of a length on leg, nudged to deep backward square leg."
"good length on off, picks length early and swats a pull to deep midwicket"
"and that's Mendis run-out too. So many run-outs against South Africa changed that game. And two more here. That's an awful call. Pushed towards short mid-on. Bhuvneshwar is quick on the ball, picks up and swivels into a throw to release early, unaware that he had plenty of time. Maybe that helped because it was bang on target at the striker's end. Mendis dives, but he may as well run all the way off. End of a superlative knock but India back on top again"
"fullish delivery outside off, edged away towards point"
"a solid block back to the bowler. A wicket for Bhuvi, not in his column but to his credit"
"flat on off, hit back to Jadeja"
"flat down leg, off the pad towards square leg"
"flat outside off, punched to long-off from the back foot"
"somehow finds a gap through point. Flat and wide, quick. Skews off the outside half towards deep point for one. Hmm."
clipped to midwicket
swept away behind square for a run. One more.
worked away into the gap at midwicket. Just one. Jadhav gets across. Loud no from mathews
"another direct hit but Kusal is home here. Full outside off, thick inside edge towards point. jadeja gets to it and effects a direct hit"
"good length outside off, chopped towards point"
"slower ball on middle, pushed to cover. Tidy bowling. SL limp along as they look to soak pressure"
"a slower ball outside off, sliced towards deep point. Just one"
"full and straight, driven back to the bowler. And that's drinks"
somebody get a song for Kusal! He's met one of India's key bowlers with a reverse sweep reeking of impunity
"conventional sweep now, with a full, flat delivery on off stump. Top edge over the wicketekeeper"
"nudges forward, but this shot is all in his wrists. Picks the length ball and whips it through midwicket"
"tosses it up with the right-hander on strike, and perhaps knowing Mathews might not be stretching forward with his history of leg injury. Single to long-off"
backs away and cuts behind point
drives to long-off to retain strike
made it look ridiculously easy. Fine it's a bad ball - short on leg stump. And okay fine leg was up so he just had to pick the gap. But does he have to look so cool playing a one-legged pull?
"fullish on middle and leg, Mathews taps it towards midwicket, and though the fielder Kohli is off balance, he flicks a direct throw to the non-strikers' end."
races down the track to greet a length ball with a flat bat to mid-off
"looks like the offcutter, pushed wide with Kusal backing away to leg. Mistimed slash to the sweeper on the off side"
"full and outside off, pats it down to long-on. Mathews will be doing all he can to last the 50 overs. India will be gunning for his wicket. This is shaping up to be a humdinger"
superb hit! I can talk about the connection. Or the fact that he came down the track. But I'll choose to highlight how risk-free this is. He sees mid-off up. He knows there is no lateral movement. He has the room to free the arms and he belts the ball well over the fielder's head. Lovely batting
"slaps a back of a length delivery on the up through cover. That's tough. More so because it's off India's quickest bowler. Classy, Mathews"
"shimmies down the pitch, but Umesh delivers a short ball and keeps him quiet. Dab to point."
"firmly struck, and that only makes the fielding effort more special. Mathews puts the pull to good use, or so he thinks, having placed the ball to the left of Jadhav at midwicket. Would have been looking at a boundary if not for a diving save"
"superb work, both from Mathews in placing the ball behind point, and from Dhawan, who had to race across and stop the boundary. Another diving effort by another desperate India fielder. This is good stuff"
"offcutter, skirting by the off stump, with Kusal trying to cut. Low bounce deceives him"
shortish on middle and off - another off-pace delivery - Kusal looks to smash it through the covers but gets a bit of an inside edge to mid-off
"back of a length and outside off, steers to backward point"
gets squared up by a good length ball on off stump. But the outside edge still fetches profit for Mathews. One to third man
"comes down the track, but Bumrah, wily Bumrah, does not allow Kusal the room he so craves. Inside edge onto pad. Single nipped off the ricochet on the off side"
"back of a length and outside off, guides it to deep point"
moves across and tries to scoop over short fine leg. Doesn't connect well enough. Good plans though.
"this is the slower ball, planted into the blockhole outside off, Kusal, not to be one-upped, slices a couple to the right of deep point"
"shortish and outside off, Mathews goes for a pull, inside edges it towards midwicket. Kusal looks for the run, but his partner is not interested. Direct hit from Kedar would have had him at the non-strikers'"
"length ball, whooped over wide midwicket. Mathews plays these situations well. He waits and waits for the boundary ball and when it comes he shows how powerful a striker he is"
"digs it into the pitch, well outside off, Mathews plays the most polite pull shot you'll see. Just dinks it over to deep midwicket"
"this is poor bowling. Fine leg is up. All it needed was a little bit of cleverness from Kusal and he shows it, scooping the ball over the man. Did Umesh think Kusal would make room? Anyway, <b>fifty partnership up</b>"
"goes full, straight, and it's pushed down to long-on"
"another length ball.... and he misses out. Clears his front leg, looking to pelt the ball into the crowd straight behind the bowler. Misses altogether"
"keeps the length short, and also follows Kusal who is backing away outside leg. Short-arm pull to long-on"
"shortish and outside off, Mathews stays beside the ball and runs it to the left of Jadeja at point. Good dive from Kusal, would have made his ground even with a direct hit"
"very full on off stump, but he is still able to get the bat underneath it and shovel the ball to long-on"
comes down the track to a fullish delivery and drums it down the ground. Good on Bumrah to field it himself
"beautiful bowling! It deserved a wicket, nearly looked like he would have it too, with Mathews completely at sea about this being a slower delivery. He was looking to blast the ball over midwicket, ends up skewing it high. Kohli running in, racing in, can't get under the ball"
"the last ball... it's always the last ball, isn't it? Looking for the yorker, Bumrah bowls a low full toss, and Kusal clips it powerfully to the deep midwicket boundary. It wouldn't have gone there though if Jadhav had fielded it properly. India can't afford these slip ups"
"oh, lovely! Umesh steams in and delivers a pin-point yorker just outside off. Mathews tries a flick, desperately trying to get under the ball. No such luck. Kohli looks around at everyone at the ground to see what happened, if it hit the pad, if it was in line. Replays indicate it hit the inside edge, hit the ground and went to the keeper"
"and lovely again! He sees mid-off up, he gets an overpitched delivery and he launches it over the top"
"shortish deliveyr on middle and off, Mathews turns it through square leg"
he's hobbling down! He just can't run. This could be difficult for Sri Lanka. Kusal moves across outside off and whips a near yorker to deep square leg.
"ridiculous batting! If you thought Sri Lanka were underdogs, look at this shot. Mathews nimbly steps forward, and with deft hands, flicks the ball over fine leg to the boundary. A 90 mph delivery made fun of. They're bossing this."
"shortish and outside off, steers the ball to point"
"India have got Rahane on the field and he does well as the substitute, moving quickly to his right at deep midwicket and keeping a ferocious pull from Kusal to a tame little single"
"full and outside off, Mathews taps it to long-on"
"moves around the wicket to Kusal for a wide yorker, but he toes the wrong side of the guide line."
loopy old full toss - the ugly cousin of the yorker - and Kusal carves it over the top to third man. <b>Kusal is basically batting on one leg</b> with perhaps a hamstring issue.
"fullish and outside off, Mathews turns it to deep midwicket"
"full and wide outside off, Kusal fetches it with a heave to long-on. His batting is being affected now. He couldn't reach far enough outside off to hammer the ball as he likes"
"shortish on off stump, Mathews tucks it to square leg. Only six runs off the over."
good pace. Beats him for it as the ball bounces a lot more and ruins his intended glide to third man
"<b>inside edge</b>, and he is looking for a single, against Umesh, who is a supreme athlete. Panic stations! In the end, Mathews sends Gunaratne back and then comes down the pitch to talk to the inexperienced man."
"runs down the track, buckling under pressure, and goes for a wild heave. He's beaten again and gets another lecture from Mathews. India fighting tooth and nail. Umesh bowling faaaaast."
"goes for the short ball, but finds Gunaratne waiting for it. The batsman swivels back in his crease and pulls it handsomely over long leg. That's grand."
"slower ball outside off, Gunaratne slices it to deep point"
"shortish and outside off, Mathews dabs it to backward point and retains strike"
"slower ball on middle, Mathews nudges it towards midwicket and pinches a single"
lovely connection as Gunaratne moves his front leg across and whips a very full delivery from outside off to deep square leg
"he's picked the gap behind square leg! Helped by a slightly short ball, and his own power, Gunaratne is able to pelt the ball to the boundary. Picked the knuckle ball."
"yorker, right on the base of middle, Gunaratne can only block"
"140kph, another pin-point yorker, just outside off. Gunaratne is beaten for sheer pace and possibly a hint of reverse swing as well"
"so to counter the reverse swing, Gunaratne moves away outside leg, predicts the length will be in the blockhole again, and is totally ready for it. Square drive behind point. Unstoppable"
"back of a length and outside off, Mathews dabs to point and gets a single"
"how has he done that?! He has swept Bumrah for six over square leg. This is ridiculous batting from Sri Lanka. They are running away with this game, and deservedly so"
"goes for the slower ball, and it dips like nobody's business. Leaves Gunaratne gasping as he tries to flick"
"looks for the blockhole again, but Gunaratne is pre-empting that length. He gets low and essentially lets the ball run off the face of the bat to third man"
"another very full delivery outside off, another little glide to third man, and he places it so fine he can get two again. Brilliant batting."
"this is a yorker, spearing in at the base of middle and leg, signs of those reverse again. Gunaratne plonks the bat down in time"
"short, wide, all Mathews has to do is place it to the left of point. He does so with the least amount of fuss you can imagine. Hitting with the wind to the short boundary"
"shortish and outside off, runs it to point, and also has to send Gunaratne back"
"full on off stump, Mathews nudges it past the right of short midwicket, and whisks two for good measure"
"shortish and outside off, Mathews taps it to the sweeper cover"
"back of a length delivery - seemingly holding in the pitch. Gunaratne goes for the pull, then stops midway through the shot. Gets a top edge over fine leg"
"shortish on off stump, turns it to short midwicket"
"it's the slower ball, and he makes him reach outside off to bring short cover in play. Gunaratne though manages to place the ball to the sweeper"
"full on off stump, pushes it back down the pitch"
"full on off stump, Mathews sends it down to long-on"
"slow, full delivery outside off, pushes it to the left of mid-off"
"shortish and outside off, Mathews drags it to long leg with half a hack and half a pull"
"full on off stump, drives to mid-off"
"shortish delivery, pulls it to deep square leg for a couple"
"this is a slower short ball, Gunaratne backs away and slices it to deep third man"
"races down the pitch and thumps a length ball down the ground to bring up his fifty. Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews, ladies and gentlemen. His team is in splits in the dressing room and the flags are high and proud"
"short ball, helps it away to long leg and Sri Lanka have thumped India. Mathews makes a gesture that I will find hard to describe but I'll do so anyway. He puts his bat over his head, handle pointing at his name perhaps on his jersey"
