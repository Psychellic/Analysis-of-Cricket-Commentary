"<strong>Belted back to Mujeeb, but the ball bursts out</strong>. He drops a difficult return catch. Narine runs down the track, meets a half-volley on off, and slams it back, the bowler attempts the catch and in the process hurts his bowling hand. He needs some attention from the physio.

"Tye drags his length back, cramps the batsman for room, and bowls him. Short and angling into the body from over the wicket, Lynn swivels into a pull. The ball hits the thigh, then his arm, the ball swivels, and bounces up to trim the bails. Lucky break for Kings XI"

"pulled straight down the throat of deep square. This is a fiery bouncer, Agarwal had decided yesterday that he'll pull this, got big on him but he went through with the stroke but showed signs of pulling out very late. But by then, the deed was done. Sensational from DreRuss. I have no reason why the onfield umpire even went upstairs to check for the no-ball.

He went for it with two hands, but it took a while for him to bring them together, by which time the ball had lodged in his right hand. Lucky he managed to hold on, has a sheepish smile but years later when someone sees the scorecard, all they'll know is this was Prasidh's catch. Kings XI in trouble"

"fuller than a good length and skids in to cramp the batsman for room and ping the pad. Ashwin strays out for a single but Tye sends him back. There's a horrible mix-up, they then go for the single. Russell swoops down on the ball, turns, and aims to effect a direct hit at the non-striker's end. He, however, loses his balance and collapses. Has he hurt his hamstring again? Given as one leg bye"
