"full outside off, and spinning away from the left-hander. Tapped away to cover with gentle hands"
"good length ball on off, and drifting inwards. Nurdled off his pads to the vacant mid-wicket region for a single. A tidy over from the Renegades - as it often is - to start off the game"

"full on off, and coming into his pads. Stump-to-stump bowling, and Weatherald clips this away to square leg"
"full just outside off, and he <b>crunches a cover drive</b> through the infield! Once it beats the fielder, the ball continues to generate pace up until it rattles the boundary-rope skirting"

"length ball outside off, and angling into the batsman. Nudged off the back foot to deep midwicket. First run of the over"
"<b>mix-up!</b> And that's what happens when you're starved of the strike. Back of a length ball on off, and Carey taps this to mid off. Weatherald isn't interested in the run while Carey's almost reached the other end. The throw from mid off is wonky, and Ludeman does well to jump up and grab the ball. Thereafter, he quickly whips the bails off to send Carey back for only five!"

"good length on off, and he works it away - off his hips - to deep midwicket"
"full on middle, and he backs away to free some shackles. Swings away over mid off, but it's come off the bat's toe end. Nabi runs back from mid-on, and sticks one hand out while running towards the boundary, but the ball hits his hand and almost runs away into the boundary! Nabi does well to recover and parry the ball back, while a second fielder cleans up his effort. Goes down as a <b>dropped chance</b> but that was mighty difficult"
"low full toss on middle, and that's been squeezed away to cover after an attempted drive"
"full and wide outside off, and Ingram throws his hands at this. Looks to drive over cover, but he slices it over point instead"

"back of a length outside off, and firmly punched off the back foot to mid off"
"<b>beauty</b> from Wildermuth. Extra bounce after landing on a length outside off. He tries to punch away from his body, but the ball whizzes past his outside edge"
"full on leg stump, and he <b>check-slogs</b> through to the leg side! Wide long-on runs to his left to try and take a catch, but the ball hits the boundary-rope skirting on the full. Third umpire will decide this shot's fate, and yep, that's two runs less because the ball landed <i>just</i> before"
"length ball outside off, and angling further away. He frees his arms, and slaps a cut-shot through to deep point"
"back of a length outside off stump, and Short - he's very tall by the way - swivels to smack this towards deep midwicket"

"Short! And Christian can't pull this away. Extra pace forces him to play the shot late, and Carey takes a sharp take from near his face. Could've easily been top-edged over the keeper though"
"slower ball, full and wide outside off, and Christian completely misses the shot! Looks to smack the leather off this delivery, but he was through his shot way too early"
"<b>check-drive over long off!</b> Again full outside off, and the pace only helps Christian. Keeps his back leg rooted on the ground and transfers his energy forward as he pulverises a six over the bowler's head"
"full on off stump, and this has been <b>slogged</b> towards midwicket! Lands just between midwicket and long-on, and goes into the boundary on the bounce. <b>Stanlake concedes 20</b>"
"<b>there it is!</b> A hug between Nabi and Christian signifies what this means to them. Back of a length outside off, and Nabi slices a cut from near his body, and it has enough power to go into the third-man boundary. <b>Renegades win by five wickets</b>"
