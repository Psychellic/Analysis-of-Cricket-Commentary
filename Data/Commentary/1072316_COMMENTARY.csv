"down the leg side first up, a wide to get things going"
"very full, outside off, a touch of late swing and jabbed to the covers off the toe end"
"full and straight, flicked fine of short fine leg, whistles to the boundary. Just needed a touch"
a little too straight again but this one rebounds off the pad towards square leg
"big appeal for lbw that looked to have pitched outside leg, Munro aiming to flick into the leg side"
"full at off stump, pushed from the front foot into the leg side, sets off for the run straightaway but it doesn't beat midwicket. A clean stop and pick up from Stoinis would have been a run out chance"
"full outside off, sliced square over the off side, skids across the outfield towards deep point. Tye chases and makes a good attempt to flick it back. He's done very well there"
"strikes first ball! The short one. Munro goes for the pull, onto him too quickly, takes a big top edge and Carey moves around to the short fine-leg position to gather a simple chance. Probably not short enough for the stroke"
"what a ball! He's on a hat-trick! Good length at off stump, nips off the seam, beats the outside edge and takes the top of off stump. That's a beauty"
"goes for the yorker, not far off, 151kph, clipped through the leg side"
"another top delivery! Full outside off, shapes away from Williamson who is feeling for it away from his body"

"full and straight, 138kph, clipped to midwicket"
"more seam movement, jags back at Williamson from back of a length and takes him near a very delicate area"
"short of a length outside off, opens the face a touch and finds point"
"excellent stuff, short of a length again at off stump, Williamson tries to work it to the leg side but can only push it back towards the bowler...six dots after the wide"
"stays on leg stump, gives himself a touch of room, mistimes a drive towards mid-on"
"and he has three! Another short ball. Well directed, over middle and off, Bruce can't control his hook, takes a top edge and is very well judged on the long-leg boundary"
"back of a length outside off, 149kph, defended to backward point"
"and another dot to the captain, short of a length outside off, played to the leg side"
"a touch fuller, angles back and takes an inside edge...lining up the dot balls to Williamson"
"gets this one away, but just for a single, flicked from outside off behind square on the leg side"
"short of a length, a bottom-handed flick to the leg side"
"short outside off, stays back in the crease and taps to the off side"
"finds the outside edge, this was a touch fuller, but Taylor does well to keep it down, slip, who is wide, makes a good save"
"fine of slip! Could they have had two slips? Touch of width outside off, Taylor plays a slashing cut, takes a top edge and goes through the gap"
"a shorter ball, pulled to deep square"
"through the slips again, although Williamson was in control of this...a slower ball, short of a length, steered wide of the keeper but third man can get across"

"that's a wild swing across the line, a good-length ball, and it's not far from taking off stump"
"a short ball outside off, goes for the pull and he's through his shot, takes the cue end and loops towards backward point"
"gets across outside off, tries to fetch a short ball through the leg side but can only pick out mid-on"
"round the wicket, pushed into the pads, flicked to deep square leg"
"uses his feet, drives into the pitch and it bounces back to the bowler"
"down the pitch again, on the line of off stump, takes this through the leg side to deep midwicket. Good running"
tucked off the pads to deep midwicket
"full, outside off, driven to cover"
can't get to the pitch as he uses his feet so resorts to nudging to the deep leg-side field
"short of a length at off stump, flicked to midwicket"
"huge wicket! Tye strikes second ball. Short of a length at off stump, Williamson looking to work into the leg side, closes the face and the ball takes a leading edge. Loops over cover, Warner turns and takes it comfortably over his shoulder"
"width outside off, a slower ball, chopped to deep cover"
"a bouncer, just slips too far down the leg side"
"fuller outside off, he comes forward and opens the face to run it to third man"
"back of a length outside off, tapped towards point and there's some hesitation in the single but he's okay in the end"

"some turn there, from off stump, pushed to the covers"
"nicely bowled, held this back as Taylor uses his feet, nudged back down the pitch"

"plays a standing sweep, wide of short fine leg"
"length ball, straight, tries to steer it through the off side but can't beat point"
"width outside off, slashed down to third man"
"moves well across outside off then flicks a short-of-a-length ball behind square, is able to get back for the second"
"beats him with a slower ball, full outside off, and it swings away from a lunging Blundell"
pulls a short one and picks out midwicket
"another slower one, spooned in the air over the off side, and lands between the man running back from cover and the sweeper running in"
"extra bounce, a slower one out of the back of the hand jumps at Taylor and loops over the top edge...a surprised look on Taylor's face"
driven down the ground to long-off...New Zealand eventually reach fifty
"big appeal for lbw! Warner calls the <b>review</b>. Nice bit of bowling, a googly that defeated the inside edge, he's using his feet so a long way down the pitch. Third umpire rules no inside edge...but it's hit outside off stump"
"touch short, he rocks back and square drives to point"
"full outside leg, using his feet and clips off the pads to deep square"
"good length, nudged into the leg side"

down the pitch and whips down the ground to long-on...Blundell trying to be busy

"touch short outside off, cut to backward point"
"short, down the leg side, another wide"
"full outside off, driven to cover"

flicked from off stump down to long-on
"back of a length at off stump, 144kph, pushed to the off side"
"top shot! Picks up a short-of-a-length delivery and pulls it over midwicket, just short of being six"
"fuller, at off stump, played back to the bowler"
"goes for a pull, mistimes this and it dribbles into the leg side off a bottom edge"
"tight line just outside off, Taylor attempts to cut quite a full delivery and finds backward point"
"big full toss, straight at 147kph, worked out to deep square...below waist height so not a no-ball"
"full and straight, gets forward and flicks through midwicket"
"there's his power! Full outside off, drives up and over the off side...long levers"

"full outside off, driven back to the bowler"
"uses his feet, not quite to the pitch, pushes to long-on"

"full and straight, speared in at the stumps, worked down the ground"

"full outside off, has a big swing to the leg side and doesn't make contact"
"beats him again, a slower ball outside off, bounces over the top edge. Another dot"

"a short ball over leg stump, beats the top edge...that's a superb over Stoinis, Australia have sneaked one through"

"that's very high, and doesn't get further than deep midwicket...full and straight, Santner trying to go over the leg side,  pace off the ball again, can't get anything like enough distance"
flicks a full toss off the pads to deep midwicket...Australia will be pleased whenever he's off strike
"full outside off, tapped towards backward point"
"what save on the boundary! More brilliant work in the deep. De Grandhomme goes straight down the ground, looks like six, but Agar leaps on the rope, goes for the catch but knows he's going over the rope so flicks the ball back in...can't quite make it a rebound catch"
"full, wide outside off, swing and a msis"
takes advantage of the extra delivery as he flicks this high over deep square leg

"another swing and a miss outside off, no byes this time"

"over the wicket, fullish length at 135kph and curving on middle and off, bunted to middwicket"

"short ball, pulled hard and flat to deep square leg for one"
"dug in, boshed for four! Short swivels and rams his first boundary in Australia colours to the deep midwicket fence - went like a rocket"
"short again, this is a better bouncer, gets it up above shoulder height as Short swings and misses"
"<b>picks out midwicket!</b> It's a short showing from Short, latched on again to the pull, seemed to middle the shot but hit it straight to Ross Taylor, who stayed low and snagged it well"
"over the wicket, back of a length at 135kph and Lynn prods it down into the pitch"
"bouncer, Warner swings it leg side... <b>and Bruce juggles the catch smartly on the rope!</b> Went right down his schooner but he was off balance, had to step back over the boundary, but had the presence of mind to lob it up and get back inside the playing area to complete the dismissal. Two in two for NZ and this chase has just got interesting"

"short, angled across, Lynn flays it over cover point... almost goes all the way! A brutal stand-and-deliver hit"

fires the ball in full on leg stump and Lynn has to dig it out
