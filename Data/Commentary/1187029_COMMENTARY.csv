back foot punch straight to cover
"drags this one slightly wide down legside, Finch flicks it away deftly to square leg. Absorbing first over"
Shami begins with one down legside as well
"terrific shot. Dhami doesn't have the pace to bowl that line and length. Half-volley on middle and leg, and Finch leans into it, a flick of the wrist piercing the gap between mid-on and midwicket"

defended to the covers. Decent over for Australia
third consecutive over to start with a wide

"good delivery from Shami. Bounces sharply from a length, hits Warner on the top of the bat"

begins to Steve Smith with a drag down legside

"worked to third man. Smith is fidgety as ever, which means he looks good"

"gets in line again, defends. Very tidy start from Saini"
"swinging back in, and this time Smith plays uppishly to mid-on. One from Saini's first over. Best over from India this innings by a mile"
"excellent shot. Just a jab, really, and it beat mid-off and absolutely raced down the ground. The outfield looks especially fast, and it takes all the athleticism of Virat Kohli to save one run and keep it from going to the boundary"

driven into the offside
"a mix-up and Australia pay for it with a wicket. <strong>Finch gone</strong>! What on earth happened there? Smith angled it to short third man, and Finch hared off for one. Smith was always hesitant, and soon enough Finch was at Smith's end. Tried to race back, but the ball was lobbed to Shami, who comfortably removes the bails"

"good delivery, seams back in to Carey, who simply played down the wrong line and found his inside edge beaten"

"cut away, produces only a single"
"played with the turn, and <strong>the wicket finally comes!</strong>. Lofted it over cover, and looked a pretty good shot, in all fairness. But because he was reaching for it outside off stump, he never could get the purchase he needed to clear the ropes. Big wicket for Kuldeep in his final over"

"back of a length, pushed to the covers. <strong>No run in this over so far</strong>"
five in a row. Almost squared him up. Can Bumrah actually bowl a maiden over here?

"quick single, was desperate to get Smith back on strike. And now, hwre's Smith on 99"
"drives smartly to backward point, who collects sharply. Turner wanted the run, but Smith is taking no chances"
"there it is. Runs it down to third man and <strong>brings up his ninth ODI hundred</strong>, and third against India. It's been a commanding knock. Not much of a celebration. Knows there's more work to be done"
"yorker, they scurry through for one. The throw hits Smith as he lunges to get back into the crease"
"nice timing, and <strong>what's happened now? </strong> Smith ran through for a single, and Ashton Turner wasn't even looking at him. A throw at the keeper's end would have produced a wicket"
"marvellous delivery to finish. Yorker just outside off stump, goes underneath the bat. India re stifling Australia here. And what's this? India have <strong>reviewed for a caught behind!</strong> The UltraEdge shows a spike when the ball touches the bat. He's gone! Smart review by Kohli; the wicket came from nowhere"

"spanks it to cow corner, but they can't manage any more than a single. 7 off the over"

"runs this to the right of third man and calls 'two' straightaway. Good start from Australia, can they make this a big over?"
"what an <strong>absolutely nonsensical shot</strong> that is. Absolutely ridiculous. Just outside off, and SMith moves across, and simply wrists it in the air over deep square leg. Sails away for six. That was all wrist."
gets a single to the offside. 13 off the first four. Can Agar support Smith here in making this a gigantic over?
finally nails the yorker. Agar digs it out and gets Smith back on strike for the final ball of the over
"worked away to cow corner, and placed it nicely enough he was able to come back for 2. 16 off the over. Australia need at least a couple more like that"
"smacks Agar on the pad, and he runs through for the leg-bye. Right, Smith and Bumrah. What a contest"
"Smith wins the ball for now. Saw third man was inside the circle, and deliberately edges the ball fine of him to get the boundary. This is world-class batting against tough bowling"
"two in a row. Bumrah finally copping some punishment at Smiths hands. Another slower delivery well outside off stump. Poor delivery in truth, and Smith is too hot right now to miss out on that"
opens the face and runs it down to the sweeper. 10 off four balls
"gets away with that. Dragged down leg, and Agar can only get his pad to it and come through for another leg bye"
"placed it around cow corner. Realised too late he could have had two. Settles for the one. Still, a dozen off that over"
"Smith <strong>holes out to deep midwicket!</strong> Tried to play a similar shot to that flick that went for six a couple of overs ago and Iyer completes a brilliant catch charging in and diving forward. Big wicket, that, could lop about 20-25 runs off the score, potentially."
"guided through the on-side field, and comes back for two. He needs to play a big part here"
"inswinging yorker, that's the ball he needs to bowl as much of as possible. Agar can do little but run it off the face and take the single"
and <strong>he's accounted for Cummins first ball again</strong>. Just the same way as in Rajkot. The yorker is simply too good for Cummins to get any bat on. It goes underneath and castles him first ball.
Zampa tamely drives it through the covers. Surprised Shami didn't go for the yorker again
driven back. <strong>Splendid over</strong>. 3 runs and 2 wickets.
"into the pads, and Agar comes through for a leg bye. Can Bumrah clean up this innings here and now?"

backs away and Shami follows him. gets a leg bye and gets the strike back to Agar
"in the blockhole again, and they only get a single"
gets off the mark with a run down to mid-off
"superb from Shami. Finishes with another yorker, and Australia can only manage to get one off the final delivery. Superb final 10 overs from India. Only 63 runs conceded, and India need 287 to win the game, and the series."

"length, and he defends towards cover"
"length, but a lot of width on offer, and Rohit lays bat on it. Places it to the right of point, and it zips through to the cover-point fence"

"length, outside off, slants across him, and he leaves"
"short and wide, and he guides this over point. Wayward start from Starc, and Rohit is ensuring he makes the most of scoring opportunities. Seems to have hit the boundary skirting on the full!"
"length, around off, and he drives towards cover"

"length, around off, and he looks to cut. Off the outer edge of the bat, along the ground, towards third man"

tried to run this past short third man

gets off strike to long-off

"short, and he goes back and thrashes this towards deep point"

"thumps Kohli on the pad, Carey had to dive to prevent four leg byes"
angles it down to third man
"pushes back and spanks Cummins to cow corner. That's an emphatic way to <strong>bring up your half-century</strong>. Not his most fluent one, but with Rohit at the other end, what he's doing is more than enough"
"that's sigh-inducing from Kohli. One of the shots of the day. Slightly full, and Kohli leans into the straight drive. That was perfect, and why wouldn't you hold the pose?"
"wide of off, and he deserved to go for four, there. He has Starc's dive at deep point for keeping it down to two"

deflected to short third man
"driven to cover, sharp work prevents the run. Here's Debayan to see you, and maybe India, though"

"length, down the leg side. Tickled around the corner, and wants a single to square leg. Turned down by Kohli"

"length, he walks across and looks to flick this. Goes down leg side, and it has been called a wide. Australia choose to review this, but they are told they don't have enough time for this. Seemed to sound like thigh pad, or perhaps even the bat. Looks like thigh pad"

"length, wide of off, and he drives this towards deep point"
"short, across him from over the wicket, and he plays it down towards point"

"short, angles across him. He looks to tap this to square leg, and sets off. Kohli sends him back"
"back of a length, around off, and he can ease this towards deep point"
"shorter, and he bashes this towards mid-on. Played from inside the crease, and that ball just seamed a touch and foxed him"
"short ball, and he miscues an attempted pull. Doesn't get a lot of bat on it, and it drops short of deep backward square leg. <strong>Lucky Iyer!</strong>"
"short, and he backs away and looks to cut this past point. Gets under the ball, and misses out"
"fuller ball, and he backs away and smacks this inside out. <strong>Good shot by Iyer</strong>. Pre-empted the change in length from Hazlewood!"
"backs away and slashes this, one bounce into the deep point fence. Top shot again from Iyer. Kohli encouraged him throughout to play his shots, and Iyer met fire with fire on each occasion. India inch ever closer..."

"fuller, down the leg side, and he whips this towards fine leg"
"length, around off, and he drives this towards the sweeper at cover-point"
"short, and he dismisses this over mid-wicket. Nobody back at the fence, and that's four closer to that hundred!"
"yorker, and he digs it out towards deep mid-on"
"<strong>he's gone through him!</strong> Full ball, and Kohli shuffles across and tries a swipe towards mid-wicket. Misses out on contact, and the ball just kisses the pads and then smashes into the stumps. Chinnaswamy rises as one to applaud this innings. It would seem he has done enough to take India through to yet another ODI chase, though"
"full ball, just outside off, and he drives this to cover"
"ooh, a <strong>one-handed six on the off side</strong>! This is one memorable shellacking that Iyer is handing out to Starc. It's four, in fact, as that one-handed inside out drive lands just short of the extra cover fence"
"fuller length, and he drives this towards mid-on"
"length, angles in, and he drives this handsomely down the wicket. Finch dives away at mid-on and stops it"
"length, and he presses into a cover drive. Takes it to the right of the deep point fieldsman, and allows for two to be picked up quite easily"
"fuller ball, around off, and he drives that towards the bowler"
"length, flicked away towards mid-wicket, but stopped by Turner inside the circle, diving low to his right"
"fuller ball, and Pandey drops this straight back down the wicket. Top shot from him!"
"length, and he goes back and defends towards mid-wicket"
"short, but squirted down the leg side. Left alone by Pandey"
