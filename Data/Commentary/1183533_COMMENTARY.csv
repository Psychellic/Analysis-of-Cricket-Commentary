"<b>gone first ball!</b> Cummis is on fire, although Nicholls called the <strong>review</strong>. Round the wicket to the left hander, it's full and straight, Nicholls plays around it, taken on the knee roll. Will bounce save him? No, it won't! Umpire's call on hitting the top of leg stump"

"144kph, back of a length wide of off, he leaves"
<strong>an appeal for caught at leg gully!</strong> Given not out. Australia <strong>review</strong>. A brute of a bouncer from Starc. He just fended and ducked in hope. It balloon up off the arm guard and popped high to Head at leg gully. The question is did it touch the glove before hitting the arm guard. Very tough to tell. It may have hit the sweatband of the glove which counts as part of the glove. The third umpire is taking his time. Not enough evidence! The third umpire stays with Erasmus' decision!
