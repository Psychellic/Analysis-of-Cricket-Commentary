This could be a tricky one...yes there is contact with the ground, but long after the ball has passed the bat. We'll be saved some confusion then. The ball is close to the forearm as it rises into Sarfraz's gloves...and the forerarm is where there is a minute disturbance. Nothing when ball passes bat or glove. He will survive this.

"a bit of extra bounce from Shadab, and van der Dussen fends into the leg side"
"<b>beauty!</b> Shadab flights one on off stump, drawing Amla forward before the ball dips in front of him and rips past the outside edge. It takes a good ball to beat a batsman on 91*, and that was an excellent one. Sarfraz whips the bails off, but his back foot was grounded the entire time"

"<b>a high full toss is slapped down to deep mid off!</b> Van der Dussen falls seven short of a debut hundred. He went for the big shot, and it was on given the delivery, but didn't quite get enough on it, the ball going straight to Shoaib Malik in that position.

"Amla comes down the track to flay a wristy drive down the ground, but just the one"
"Miller waits on a short-ish ball, but his cut is stopped at backward point, just the single"
"<b>what a way to bring up the hundred!</b> Amla bends slow, slog sweeping and getting an excellent connection right out of the middle. Amla raises his 27th ODI ton with his first six of the innings. Not the most free flowing knock he's ever played, but then again this pitch hasn't encouraged too much strokeplay. Top effort"
"full, on his legs and Miller shuffles across to punt the ball in the air and wide of long on"
"Hasan aims full, Miller flicks off his toes to collect one to square leg"
"full and straight, Amla carves a drive down the ground, but along the turf and long on cuts it off"
"Hasan aims full once again, and Miller comes forward, angling his drive to send the ball out to the cover sweeper"

"aerial once more off the bat of Hafeez, but this time it's a pull of rather more authority, the ball dropping well in front of the square leg fielder"
"what's happened here? It's another short one from Olivier, and the ball hits Hafeez on the shoulder on its way through to Klaasen. No major drama"
"<b>they're level!</b> Olivier's bouncer terrorized Pakistan through three Tests, but this track doesn't have the same sort of pace and bounce and Hafeez dismisses the short ball from his presence with a crisp pull. Mickey is smiling on the balcony. So is Sarfraz"
