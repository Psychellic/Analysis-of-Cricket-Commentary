"full but way down leg, Kohli is disappointed he didn't get a tickle on that one past short fine leg"
"half-volley on the pads, flicked uppishly by Kohli, it almost carried to Thisara Perera at a square fine leg position, perhaps he picked it up late"
"poor ball, and punished. Straying down leg, Rahul control's the leg glance, the ball races away into the fine leg boundary"
"excellent stop by Steven Smith at cover point. It was a half-volley, struck hard by Rahul, Smith threw himself to his right to stop it with one hand"
uses the pace of the bowler to angle the back of length delivery to third man
"tests the bounce by hitting the deck hard on middle, the ball rises over Kohli's waist, he hops back and turns it to square leg"
"nearly carried to R Ashwin at slip. Rahul gets a thick edge as he plays with an open face, rolls down to third man"
"pushed with soft hands to mid-on, it was a late decision to pinch the run, but Rahul makes it comfortably"
"back of length delivery outside off, punched to cover"
"a bit of nip away from the good length area on off stump, Kohli hops back and across before offering a dead bat to defend"
"firm drive on the up, but straight to mid-on"
"no room to work with, chopped to Ashwin at slip. He tried to steer it into the gap between slip and gully"
"flicked, but not entirely off the middle. Looked like the ball rolled to KP at wide mid-on off a thick inside edge"
"the man at deep backward square leg is a mere spectator. Ishant errs by floating the length ball on middle and leg, Kohli uses his powerful wrists and bottom hand superbly to whip that over the fielder there"
"not something you expect of a bowler who has played international cricket for close to 10 years now. Wrong line again, too full and sliding back into the leg stump nicely, flicked between midwicket and mid-on. Super timing!"
"dabbed to point, Rahane hits direct at the striker's end when it wasn't needed, they take an overthrow off the ricochet"
"just falls short of Pietersen at mid-on. It was banged in short on off stump, Rahul was late on the pull, he also had to fetch the stroke, got it off the top half of the bat."
gets half-forward and bunts the full delivery towards gully
"uncertain whether to play or leave, was Rahul. It was a length ball outside off, nearly let that go before tapping with gently behind the wicket on the off side"
"width on offer, and crunched between the two point fielders. He picked the length early, used the depth of the crease superbly as he opened the face of the bat to pick the gap. Top shot"
punched off the backfoot to mid-on for a quick single
pushed off the backfoot to short cover
"third time lucky for the Supergiants. Rahul plays an ugly hoick. It was a full ball, which he tried to loft over mid-on, but the bat and feet were in no position as the ball flies off a thick outside edge to Ishant, who didn't have to move an inch at third man"
played with soft hands towards Rahane at point
off the mark straightaway. Nudges the length ball to third man
"tossed up on middle, driven inside-out to wide long-off"
"drifting into middle and leg, eased wide of midwicket"
"hint of width, and punished! No exaggerated footwork or bat swing. But the timing is sensational. Opens the bat face at the last moment to pick the gap between cover and cover point"
eased with the spin to long-off
played with soft hands towards midwicket
gets to the pitch of the ball and works it to long-off again
"a length ball outside off at 138 clicks, Kohli dabs it to point, didn't have the room to slash"
"oversteps in his quest for extra pace, oh dear! The last thing Ishant wanted after a horror start. This one was bowled just in that channel around off stump at length, pushed to point again. <b> Free-hit time </b>"
"yorker on off stump, Kohli carves it straight to point, didn't have the timing this time"
slapped with disdain! Picks the length of that short ball early and muscles the pull into deep midwicket. One bounce into the boundary
"floats a full ball on off stump, ABD is stuck inside the crease as he pushes it with soft hands to cover"
works the incoming length ball on middle to midwicket
"sashays down the pitch, rides the bounce and uses his wrists to ease it up and over the point fielder. Thisara was no more than 10 yards away from the ball at third man, but couldn't prevent the boundary. He dished in a messy dive that parried the ball into the ropes"
driven firmly to Smith at long-off
"bit of grip. Lands it on length around off stump, Kohli checks his drive, straight to cover"
"another slow leg-cutter outside off, Kohli plays a forceful shot to sweeper cover"
"he was ready for his golf swing over long-on. Went through with the stroke, but got a thick inside-edge off the pad to the off side"
"straying down leg, flicked to deep midwicket"
excellent wrist work to pick that length ball from outside off to long-on
"tossed up on middle and leg, worked to deep backward square leg"
makes a bit of room and drives against the turn to sweeper cover
plants his front foot across and turns it towards long-on
"not there for the cut, Kohli plays back to a fuller delivery, mistimes to cover"
"Dhoni's street-smart ways behind the stumps to the fore. Anticipating a late cut, Dhoni once again repeats the Karate-kick pose to prevent the deflection from crossing him, superb!"
gets forward and plays it with a straight bat to long-on
"fires one down the leg side, easy take by MSD"
"flatter one on middle and leg, whipped into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on"
"steps out, but can't get to the pitch of the ball, tapped to midwicket"
cuts it uppishly towards sweeper cover
gets to the pitch of the ball and thumps it with the turn to long-off
wrists the full ball on middle to long-on
Ankit drifts down leg ad AB uses the pace to sweep it over deep backward square leg. Dhoni immediately runs up to have a word with his bowler.
"skidder outside off, whipped to long-on"
"what does it say of a stroke when even Faf can't get to the ball despite a full-length dive? Not much pace on offer with that length ball, AB forces all the pace by making room and slapping it into the deep cover region, Faf got to the ball, but couldn't quite stop it cleanly and could only see the ball roll off his hand into the boundary"
"lofted over the bowler, one bounce to long-off"
makes room and cuts it towards deep point
"driven into the gap at wide long-off, <b> fourth half-century stand between Kohli and de Villiers this season </b>"
"takes ages for the ball to get to ABD, who was nearly through with his stroke, hit hard to long-off"
"disbelief on M Ashwin's face. Not the welcome to the bowling crease he would have expected. Fires it quicker outside off, de Villers gets across and sweeps it fiercely into the deep backward square leg region. He was hitting it towards the shortest boundary. A 66-metre hit. But that would have been six at any venue. Nearly carried 30 rows back"
"driven into the gap between sweeper cover and long-off, excellent running"
punched to deep midwicket
"too full this time, and that's a delightful stroke through cover, Kohli was certain it was four until he saw Superman Smith pull off a half-stop, half-slide to pull it back in. Saved two runs for the side"
"cry of anguish from Kohli as he runs for the single. It was short outside off, he looked to hit it too hard, got it off the bottom of the bat to long-off"
"not much room for predictability in this format. Once again chooses to fire it in flat, this one was a touch outside off, ABD went across the stumps, got into position for the pull and simply swung through. Sails over the ropes."
tickled to short fine leg
"spins back into middle and leg, punched to long-on"
"bowls the carrom ball which slides into middle and leg, not much turn on that occasion, eased wide of midwicket"
gets to the pitch of the ball and works it past the bowler to long-on again
"not quite there for the drive, but Kohli uses his wrists well to play it to long-on, milking the singles"
"there was long-off, and deep point. What does ABD do? Make room, free his arms and cuts that into the gap at deep cover. Gets to his half-century as well"
"drifts it into middle, Kohli steps out and punches it to sweeper cover"
"width on offer, slapped to deep cover"
"late turn of the wrists to play it towards the man running in from deep midwicket, Kohli wanted the second, but de Villiers wasn't ready"
"walks across the stumps, picks the short ball and pulls it towards long-on"
"driven inside-out to Rahane at cover, Kohli is annoyed with himself, wanted to get it wide of the fielder"
"pitches on middle and straightens, Kohli was looked to flick across the line, gets a leading edge towards short third man"
driven with the spin to deep cover
"brave from de Villiers. Got into position to play the reverse sweep even before the ball was delivered, it wasn't where he wanted - it was a low full toss on middle - but he still managed to generate enough power to play it wide of point. Outstanding"
"sliding down leg, misses a flick, Dhoni collects the deflection off the pad"
"and how he shows how well he can play the conventional sweep. Tossed up outside off, he walks across to set himself up for the sweep and comes through clean with the swing, ball races away into the deep square leg boundary"
eased wide of cover
"fails to take toll of a waist-high full toss, punched to long-on"
"welcome dot ball, gets forward and dabs it to the off side"
"mistimes a slog across the line, toe-ends it to deep midwicket."
"steps out to go over cover, fails to get underneath the ball, squeezed to cover"
"sees Kohli charge down the pitch and fires it short into middle and leg, whipped to deep square. Applause from the crowd as Kohli celebrated yet another half-century"
"fetches the whip from outside off, they were chancing the second off Faf's arm at long-on, but managed to make it very easily. <b> Third century stand between Kohli and de Villiers this season </b>"
makes room and eases it to sweeper cover
"carrom ball on middle, turned wide of midwicket"
"flatter one on middle, eased to long-on"
"steps out to pull, Ashwin fires it full and down leg, Dhoni fails to get any glove on it too. Handy runs these. Looked like there was a deflection off de Villiers' pads though"
"gets the direction of that drifter wrong, this one swerves away and lands well outside off, easy call"
"not much room for the reverse sweep, goes through with the shot, gets some bat on it, straight to short third man"
"tossed up on middle, Kohli misses the slog over midwicket, was perhaps struck in front of middle and leg. Ashwin went up in an appeal, a very convincing one at that, but the umpire was certain it would have missed the stumps"
"oh dear, that could prove to be a costly drop. Slogs across the line, but can only skew a top edge to Ankit Sharma, who has all the time in the world to settle underneath the ball at mid-off The ball kept swirling in the air, and he misjudged it completely in the end. Just managed to get the finger tips in the end."
worked off his hip to square leg
"straight as a dye, outstanding stop at long-off by Steven Smith. He got to the pitch and hammered it. Smith didn't think for a minute that it would be a boundary. The umpire wanted to check if his body was brushing the advertising hoarding as he pulled it back in. Full marks for the effort. All good in the end, huge cheer from the crowd"
"struck firmly, this one finds Faf at long-on"
"swung across the line, mistimed to deep midwicket. Hit it off a thick inside edge"
"squeezed to long-on, Faf was moving to his left even before de Villiers completed the followthrough"
"mistimes a pull to deep midwicket, one bounce to the fielder. <b> Kohli whacks himself on the pad. </b> Frustration creeping in? Surely"
"flat hit, the ball was dying on Faf at long-on. He had a split-second decision to make. Should I go for the catch or prevent the four? He went for the catch, couldn't get it but still saved three runs for the side"
"spears in a superb yorker on middle and leg from wide of the crease, ABD jams his bat down in time to keep that out"
"he has released all the pent up energy with a biff over deep midwicket. Half-volley on off stump, and the swing came through cleanly"
"crunches the full ball outside off to sweeper cover, Ankit Sharma does well to keep it to a single"
"reverse-sweeps the slower leg-cutter to short third man, didn't get it off the middle. Perhaps indicated to the batsman a little too early, allowing Thisara to slow his pace down"
"fires it full, but was flirting with the wide line. Fair call by the umpire"
"mis-hit again, this time to the right of Ankit Sharma, who was running from deep cover towards long-off. Thisara isn't happy with the effort"
"right into the blockhole on off, squeezed past the bowler"
"he looks to carve it over point, but misses. Umpire signals wide. It was a marginal call that"
"excellent yorker-length delivery, this one is well inside the wide line, Kohli can't jam his bat down in time to ease it wide of point"
"improvisation at its very best. Another full ball outside off, Kohli walks couple of paces down the pitch, then moves swiftly across to paddle it over short fine leg. Was a couple of yards outside the crease at the point of contact"
"another full toss, another boundary. This one's thumped over cover, Steven Smith in the deep was doing a 100-metre dash, tried to pull it back but over-ran it in the end"
bottom hand came off the grip as he mistimed the pull to long-on
"precious, precious dot. This one's closer to 140kph, but more importantly was an excellent yorker outside off, ABD went for a slog across the line, but couldn't get his bat underneath the ball"
"he's hit that into Navi Mumbai or what? The length ball sliding into leg sits up nicely for him to swing through the line, made clean connection and the ball sailed over the ropes at deep backward square leg."
"too full and way outside off, Kohli opens the bat face and slices it behind point, third man had no chance. Superb timing"
"on the sixth stump outside off. Why would you try to flirt with that line when you have so much space to bowl a yorker? This one's another easy call for the umpire, although Kohli is disappointed he didn't get any bat on it"
"saved by the wide, but gets punished for four. Kohli fetches it from well outside the wide line, takes it on the full and paddles it past short fine leg."
"no control over that pull, it was the slower one, the bat face turned in his hand as he made contact, the man at deep midwicket didn't have to move an inch. Kohli slaps the bat on his thigh pad as he walks off. He's far from happy with the shot, by the looks of it"
"slower leg-cutter outside off, ABD looked to go over long-on, gets a top edge to a nervous Ankit Sharma, who just about managed to get his hands around that one. He was off balance when the ball lodged in his hands."
"short ball outside off, he walks across to sweep, gets it on his glove, they scoot across for a run"
"slower one outside off, can't connect that slog which he mistimes towards long-on, the fielder was late to get off the blocks and they pinch a second"
"movement off the pitch from the length area on off stump, defended off the backfoot"
"wow! Delightful from Rahane. Juicy half-volley outside off, Rahane leans forward and eases it into the gap between cover and mid-off. Didn't try to hit it hard"
"full on middle, shapes away a touch, Rahane shows the full face of the bat and defends"
"right line, but not the right results. Swings away from the off stump, on the fuller side again, and Rahane plays a superb off drive. Ball hit the sweet spot as it made contact with the bat"
"misfield by Mandeep Singh at backward point, it was uppish but just landed short of him. Looked like the ball held on to the surface for a split second"
"eased behind point, deep cover went around the boundary to stop that, Faf turned blind for the second, but the throw was wide"
"starts off with a back of a length delivery outside off, bunted to point"
"not there for the drive, Rahane gets a thick inside edge to square leg"
"nips back into middle and leg, Faf gets an inside edge onto his pad as he looks to turn it wide of square leg, was off balance when ball thudded onto the bat"
"there's the early wicket for RCB, and Kohli is pumped. Not quite there for Faf to hit through the line, he stepped out to go over mid-off, but the ball got big on him and Patel took an easy catch."
"what has KP done here? Has he hurt his ankle? He's motionless at the moment. Coming back to the ball, it was short outside off, he was on his toes to defend. But something about it didn't look right. KP took off for a single, but  looked like he hurt his calf muscle as he turned to get back into the crease. <b> Oh dear. he's hobbling off the field. </b> Kohli has a few comforting words to KP. He seems to be in a lot of pain."
"another short ball, Smith gets on top of the bounce and pats it down the pitch with soft hands"
"lands it full outside off, steered wide of point"
"too straight, and punished. Smith will put those away all day. Could he have asked for a better ball early on? I doubt. This was full and into his pads from wide of the crease, a neat roll off the wrists sent it screaming into the square leg boundary"
"loses his direction this time, way down leg"
"it's all happening here. Smith is foxed by the slower one and was hit on the pad, the vociferous appeal seemed to have distracted him as he took a few paces outside the crease. Virat Kohli coming in front point saw that, picked up the deflection and hit the stumps direct at the striker's end. Smith, turned late and slipped which cost him a split-second, and was a couple of inches short of the crease when the bails were dislodged"
"floats it full from wide of the crease, it was a dipping full toss again, Dhoni gets a leading edge that falls short of mid-off"
"full on middle, turned to midwicket where Sarfaraz has a shy at the bowler's end. Rahane his hit on the elbow. Crowd doesn't like it. Kohli walks up to his India teammate and apologises"
"swinging away from outside off, pushed to mid-off"
"length ball on middle, defended back to the bowler"
"width on offer and he's crunched that behind past cover. Freebie, you have to say. Rahane won't miss out on such gifts. It was sitting up nicely for him to play the cut shot, which he did"
gets half-forward and plays it back down the pitch with soft hands
"uses the pace of the bowler and runs it down to third man, 141 clicks on that delivery"
"optimistic appeal from the bowler as Dhoni misses the tuck off the pad, it was comfortably sliding down leg side"
punched to ABD at point
"short of length delivery outside off, hint of nip away, dabbed to third man"
"as good a straight drive as you will see. Half-volley on off stump, Dhoni's high elbow and straight bat comes through in a lovely little arc as the ball flies off the bat. Mid-off had no chance"
"overcompensates by slipping it down leg, Dhoni misses the flick, Rahul collects it well. Exercise for the umpire"
"a diving Mandeep takes the pace off the ball at point, third man comes around to keep it to a single"
"back-of-the-hand slower delivery on off stump, he arches back and steers it wide of point"
"another slower delivery outside off, Dhoni steers it to square third man"
"lands the slower delivery just a touch ahead of good length, Rahane is well forward as he offers a dead bat to defend"
"looks to step out and go over midwicket, is late on the shot. The full ball hits his pad"
"inside edge as he looks to cut, rolls to the on side and they steal a single"
"uppish, but safe. Rolls along the carpet to Binny at third man"
"gets away with the half-volley, thumped straight to cover"
"slower one on middle, Dhoni was early into his whip, gets hit on the flap of the pad, but Rahane was ready for the run"
dabbed down to third man
"starts off with a short ball on middle, pulled to deep midwicket"
"lands it fuller, gets some spin back in, tucked towards midwicket"
gets to the pitch of the ball and flicks it with the spin to deep square leg
"steps out to go over the top, but has to change his stroke at the last minute, covers the line of that wrong-un and pats it with soft hands"
"lands the quicker one on middle, it's a touch short, Dhoni turns it towards square leg"
"floats it full outside off, Rahane is beaten for pace and is late on the attempted dab, Rahul half-stops it, but can't prevent the single"
"lofted over the infield, excellent work by Mandeep at long-off, ran a few yards to his right and them tumbled over to stop that"
"slower and fuller outside off, driven to sweeper cover. Looked like Dhoni was lining himself to go over the top there"
"unlucky for the bowler, but Rahane won't really mind how the runs come. Way too early into the flick, gets a thick inside edge off that slower delivery that races into the fine leg boundary. It sneaked through the gap between bat and pad"
worked from outside off towards long-on
gets forward and eases it to long-off
"welcome boundary. This one was the off cutter, had enough width for Rahane to literally dab it off Rahul's gloves. Played late and played it well wide of short third man."
"takes it on the full and flicks it towards wide long-on, excellent running. Dhoni was halfway into the second run when the fielder fired the throw"
"squeezed to long-off, a touch fuller outside off on that occasion"
"slides past the outside edge. Rahane played for the turn, but that one drifted away. Good take by Rahul"
"swept with authority into the gap between deep square and long-on. Too full, and punished"
misfield by Kohli at cover allows a single
"sliding down leg, Dhoni plays the delicate little tickle past short fine leg. Rahul was a touch late to get across, but he had no chance, really"
picks the length early and pulls it into the gap between long-on and deep midwicket
"uppish, but no damage done, Kohli at long-on mops that up"
"tossed up outside off, Dhoni reaches out for it and squeezes it to long-off"
"too short to cut, but Rahane still manages to play the shot and get enough bat on it, deep point in action"
"bunted to point, Dhoni was chancing Sarfaraz Khan's arm, comfortably makes it to the non-strikers end even as the throw was wide"
"whipped wide of long-on, called two immediately, even Kohli can't prevent the second"
lunges forward and plays it to mid-off
"this one's the wrong-un, gets more bounce that he expected perhaps, Rahane goes back into the crease and dabs it to the off side"
"punched to long-off, Mandeep was quick to get to the ball, saved a run"
"Sarfaraz Khan at short fine leg dives over the ball. It was sliding down, and Rahane played the fine sweep to near-perfection"
"cuts well, but straight to backward point"
"did he get a tickle on that? Doesn't look like. Rahane looks to dab that slider past short third, misses."
"maybe he's mindful of Dhoni giving him the charge. Fires it short and wide outside off, steered to deep point"
"drifting into middle and leg, turned to deep midwicket"
gets a good stride in to ease it to long-off
"too full outside off, Rahane squeezes that one to deep cover, looked like it hit the toe end of the bat. <b> Muted celebration for his half-century </b>"
"drifting into middle and leg, worked with the angle to long-on"
"plays it across the line to long-on, trusted the pitch on that occasion, no damage done"
makes a bit of room and squeezes the full ball into the gap at square third man
"tried to over-hit the pull, mistimed it to square leg, Dhoni was halfway down the pitch by then, so Rahane didn't really have a choice but to run"
"drops it with soft hands to Iqbal Abdulla at point, a nanosecond's eye-contact and they were off for the run"
"looks to arch back and ramp it over the keeper's head, but Rahane failed to account for the slower one, it got stuck in to the surface for a wee bit longer than he would have liked"
"play and a miss. Looks to back away and cut that one over point, beaten for pace this time"
"high tull toss into middle and leg, swung away into the deep backward square leg boundary. Spoilt what was otherwise an excellent over"
"floats it wide outside off, chopped to point, Binny's throw isn't collected cleanly at the bowler's end by Abdulla, they steal a second"
driven with the spin to long-off
steps out and flicks it with the angle to deep midwicket
"tossed up over his eyeline, Dhoni gets to the pitch of the ball and eases it to long-off"
"sees him give the charge and fires it wide, Rahane lets go, Rahul collects well"
bunted down to long-on. Wonder till what point they'd be happy to milk the bowling for singles
"drilled to long-off, Dhoni was targetting the top tier with that hit, didn't get underneath the flight"
"short, wide and Dhoni belts that into the deep cover boundary. Generated tremendous power when he made contact"
"another short one, this one's hit hard to Richardson, who is swift across the turf at sweeper cover this time"
"nice flight on that one, breaks back into middle, pushed past the bowler for an easy single"
"there's the wicket. Beautifully done. This one was a slider that went past Rahane's wild swing, didn't get to the pitch of the ball and Rahul whipped the balls off in a jiffy. Shamsi leaps high and punches the air in delight. Not a bad first wicket to have in the IPL, is it? RCB call the celebration the 'Busdriver dance'. Wonder what that is all about"
"big appeal for lbw, Thisara is foxed by the one that spins back in sharply. He was overbalanced too as the ball thudded into his pad. The umpire maybe thought it was sliding down leg side. Height wasn't an issue. Very, very close"
"and he clubs the next one into the stands at deep midwicket. Too full, he swings through cleanly and gets enough elevation"
Watson dives over the ball at cover to give away a single
"mistimes a pull to square leg, chances Sarfaraz's arm at square leg, a direct hit at the non-striker's end and he wasn't even in the frame"
"slower bouncer outside off, bunted towards point"
"right into the blockhole, Thisara's toe-ends his wild swing to long-on"
"full marks for the effort, but the execution wasn't as clean as he would have liked. The slower bouncer on middle, a little too high for the umpire's liking. Dhoni looked to pull, but let go in the end"
"touch-and-go stuff by AB de Villiers, but that's a sensational catch at long-off. This was floated full outside off, Dhoni drilled it, the ball flew off the bat, but it didn't matter because de Villiers was lurking around there. The advertising triangle behind him was no more than a couple of centimetres away. De Villiers was hardly bothered by that though, in complete control right throughout."
"dabbed wide of point, diving stop by Sarfaraz"
"gets on top of the bounce and helps it over point, third man had no chance. Bhatia was quick to pounce on that, angled his bat to good effect"
"gets some bit off the surface, Bhatia's bottom hand came off as he stabbed that to the off side for a single"
"pulled, and pulled well. Too short from Watson, and he's paid the price. Thisara was waiting for it and swung fiercely to leave the ball soaring into the deep midwicket stands"
"looks to ramp it over short fine, Watson sees that and fires it full and wide, Thisara misses"
swatted across the line towards Kane Richardson at deep midwicket
"gets it completely wrong this time, misses the wide mark by quite some distance. Thisara looks to reach out, but can't"
"another wide, this one was also flirting with that danger line, Rahul collected it and ran up to the stumps to perhaps distract the umpire. Watson isn't happy, but it was the right call in the end"
"third time unlucky. Thisara looks to walk across the stumps to play the scoop, but gets into a tange. The full ball sneaks through the gap between bat and pad to Rahul"
"is there life in this game yet? Slower and fuller outside off, Bhatia swings across the line and gets enough bat on it to carry it over a leaping Kohli at long-on."
"struck well, but Sarfaraz is alert at point"
"swings towards Pune, ball goes towards Mumbai. Wanted to biff that over the bowler's head, instead got a thick outside edge that flew into the third man boundary"
"low full toss angling into middle, Thisara swings and connects, the ball was dying on Mandeep Singh at deep midwicket. He dived, got to the ball but couldn't hold on as it deflected into the boundary"
"high full toss outside off, Thisara makes room and slaps it into the gap at sweeper cover. Muscular stuff. Harshal has lost the plot. In his quest to bowl yorkers, he has dished out full tosses. Not at his pace, no!"
"biggest over of the game! This one's clubbed over long on. Half-volley on middle, Thisara was simply waiting to tee off like a golfer, made sweet connection. There is life in the Pune dressing room now. The game has come alive, and how!"
"swings, but gets a top edge, the ball was swirling in the air for ages, Rahul was running backwards and called for it loud and clear, Sarfaraz at short fine leg had it easy as he was running in. What resulted was a total breakdown in communication as it bobbled out of Rahul's gloves. Chaos, pandemonium"
drilled down the ground to long-off
"the Thisara party is over, Watson has delivered under pressure. Fires it full and wide outside off, he got it low on the bat and it lobbed straight to Mandeep at cover. Watson lets out a roar, and that's understandable. It got a little too close for comfort, but what a knock!"
"crunched to long-off, Kohli anticipates the hit and fires a rocket throw"
"intention was right, but the execution came a cropper. Ashwin lined himself for the slog, Watson helped him by bowling short of length on off, he went through with the stroke, got it off the middle. The only issue was it was right down Harshal Patel's throat at deep midwicket"
"gets a bottom edge off an attempted swing, Rahul does well to stop that"
"half-volley outside off, drilled over the infield, Harshal does well at sweeper cover to keep it to two"
"once again it's too full, once again a drill, this time ABD at long-off runs around to his left to mop that up"
"the slower bouncer has done the trick. Bhatia fetched the pull from outside off, didn't connect well as the ball didn't arrive, too early into the stroke as it lobbed to Watson at square leg. Plucky knock but had a little too much to do in the end"
"how easy has AB de Villiers made that look? Ashwin slapped that over the infield, ABD was back-pedalling from mid-off, realised he was going nowhere, so he twirled and twisted around to set himself up and then leaped to catch the ball with his palms facing skywards. Both feet were off the ground when he took the catch. Stunning"
"mistimes the slog into the deep midwicket region, for a while it looked like the hat-trick was on, de Villiers sprints around the ropes and just manages to pull it back in"
"swings and misses, but they sneak in a bye"
