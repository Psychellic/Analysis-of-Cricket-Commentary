"back of a length, spinning in from outside off, goes back and across and works it away through midwicket"
"flat, back of a length once more, spinning in towards off stump. Tucked away to deep midwicket"
"length ball, sliding on with the angle towards the pads. Stays on the back foot to clip it to the right of short fine leg"
"flat length ball on middle stump, not a particularly bad ball, and Kohli was looking to punch it through midwicket. Ends up sliding off the inside half of the bat for an inadvertent boundary between short fine leg and square leg"
"back of a length on middle stump, punched to deep midwicket with a  pretty much straight bat"
spears this into the pads and Parthiv tucks it to the left of square leg
"length ball on middle stump, tucked away through square leg off the back foot"
"length ball, looking to maybe swing it away from middle and leg or thereabouts, ends up sliding it a fair way down the leg side"
"back of a length outside off, stops on Kohli slightly. He wanted to punch it through the covers, ends up playing a touch early and hitting it to mid-off"
"nicely bowled, a fifth-stump outswinger that Kohli jabs at with hard hands, coming forward to drive. Thick edge races away to the boundary to the left of third man, who's stationed quite square"
another outswinger fairly wide of off. Comes forward and opens his bat face to stab it to backward point
"back of a length now, offcutter, nips in towards off stump. Kohli is on the front foot to it, jams his bat down hurriedly as it comes in and tucks him up. Bounces down into the ground behind him and rolls past off stump"
"back of a length on off stump, tucked away through square leg"
"flat length ball turning in towards middle stump, worked away to the right of deep square leg"
"a touch shorter outside off, looks to dab it past short third man but hits it too close to the fielder"
flat length ball on middle and off. Looks to make room but can't manufacture enough to punch it past cover point
"fuller this time, on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
a bit more flight and wider outside off. Kohli looks to drive through cover and his outside edge is beaten by lack of turn
"flatter length ball on off stump, punched down the ground to long-on"
"length ball angling into off stump, and Kohli takes a big step across to whip it away wide of mid-on, in the air but there's no one in the infield at midwicket"
"back of a length, fourth-stump line. Stops on Kohli again. He wanted to punch it through the covers but ends up hitting it to mid-on off the inside half of the bat"
"back of a length, a touch wider outside off. Presses forward and opens his bat face to dab to short third man"
"back of a length on off stump, and now there's a fielder at midwicket to intercept Kohli's flick"
"back of a length on off stump, makes a bit of room and punches to deep cover point. I guess this was the fielder who dropped back when midwicket came into the circle"
"poor ball to bowl with fine leg inside the circle, shortish and down leg. Parthiv simply whips it away, in the air but a fair distance to that fielder's right. He was trying to bowl the offcutter and ended up dragging it down"
"back of a length, angling into leg stump. Looks to clip it away but he's a little late on it. Rolls off the thigh pad to short fine leg"
"shot. Knew third man was a touch square, and when Archer banged it in short, angling across to off stump, he simply leaned back and ramped it away nice and fine"
"four more. Short again, and it's only angling in to about off stump, but Parthiv takes a big step across to use the pace and angle and help it away fine. Fine leg is inside the circle and has no chance of cutting it off"
"back of a length, angling into the top of off stump. He's cramped for room and he jabs it into the covers"
"full now, on off stump, and Parthiv puts it away, clears his front leg and lofts it nice and clean over mid-off"
"back of a length outside off, lets it come on and dabs gently into the gully region"
"back of a length, tight on off stump, no turn. Makes a bit of room and chops to backward point"

"shortish outside off, whipped away to deep midwicket with a lot of bottom hand"
"quickish length ball on off stump, shows the full face to punch to long-on"
"flat and full on leg stump, clipped to the left of long-on, not far enough to his left to pick up two"
"shortish, slanting away from off stump, no real turn back in. Slapped to deep point"
"there's the googly. Big appeal for lbw, but I don't know why, seemed to be a thick inside edge and bat before pad. Looks to stay leg-side of the ball and jab it away through point, but ends up squeezing it between inside edge and pad flap"
"bowled him, we were talking about how he hasn't liked the googly, and he's done in by an absolute beaut of a googly. Tossed up slower than the previous one, and wider, and Kohli reaches out for the cover drive, leaving a big gap for the ball to spin back through. A strange innings from Kohli - looks like he was looking to play himself in and aiming to accelerate later, but if you get out for 23 off 25 the playing yourself in part doesn't look that good"
"another wrong'un to greet him, goes deep in his crease to work it away through backward square leg"
"another googly, shortish, and AB moves across his stumps in advance and sinks down on one knee to help it with the turn, over his shoulder and over the keeper's left shoulder"
"another googly, flatter and outside off, presses forward and jabs to short third man"
"shortish, angling into leg stump, steps across and whips it off his hip and finds the gap to the right of fine leg"
"once again a touch short, but more on middle and off. Parthiv looks to find the same gap with a similar shot, but ends up playing it squarer, and deep square leg can clean up with a sprint to his left"
"shortish, plenty of width, but the ball maybe doesn't bounce as much as de Villiers expected, and he ends up bottom-edging his cut to the fine leg boundary. <b>Didn't miss off stump by much</b>."
"back of a length, angling in towards middle stump, goes deep in his crease and works it to the left of deep square leg"
"shot! length ball angling in towards off stump, and AB shows the full face to punch it back between the stumps at the other end and the bowler, and long-on runs around to stop it at the boundary"
"short and wide, a no-no to Parthiv, who slaps it away gleefully to the left of third man"
"he's only bowling googlies today. Rocks back to punch into the covers, and ends up inside-edging into his back pad. Beaten by lack of pace off the surface, not the variation"
"again, the googly stops on the batsman. Wanted to punch through cover, ends up playing it back to the bowler"
"gottim, Kohli and AB in the space of two overs! Another wrong'un, back of a length, and again the ball stops on AB. This time it keeps low too, and in a hurried effort to jam his bat down and keep it out, he punches it firmly back to the bowler, at catchable height"
"legbreak, back of a length, stops on the batsman again and he blocks it back to the bowler"
"again the ball grips and stops. The googly this time, straightening along the fourth-stump channel. Looks to punch it through the covers and ends up beaten, played too early"
"flat legbreak, closer to off stump. Punched to short extra-cover, and that's a wicket maiden for Shreyas"
"flat, back of a length, angling into off stump, not much turn. Goes back to work it into the midwicket region, and the fielder is back on the boundary so the bowler has to give chase"
"well bowled, a little bit of inward drift and less turn than expected as Hetmyer presses forward to defend. Past the inside edge and hits the pad, but it's probably missing leg stump"
"back of a length on off stump, makes a bit of room and chops towards backward point. The pace on the ball gives him too little time to make as much room as he'd like"
"back of a length, fired in quick on middle and off, punched back to the bowler"
a touch slower on middle stump. Presses forward to defend and the ball turns less than expected. Rolls off the inside half of the bat to the left of midwicket
"back of a length on off stump, makes room and punches to sweeper cover"
"<b>appeal, and given!</b> Shreyas Gopal's on fire. What a spell. Length ball on middle, and the googly turns away from Hetmyer. Goes onto the back foot to defend, but the ball goes past his outside edge, and takes a feather edge. Sharp catch from Buttler, bending low"
"<b>appeal again</b> but umpire Erasmus turns it down. Full, just outside off, and Stoinis tries to sweep. Impact outside off, and there was a bit of glove involved too"
"length ball just outside off, and the slider goes straight through. Stoinies nudges it towards mid-on"
"length ball on off, and skidding through once more. Goes deep onto the back foot, and defends to short mid-on"
"length ball on middle, and the googly is flicked off his hips to square leg"
"tossed up on off, and he takes a big stride forward to defend"
"full, wide outside off, and <B>lifted</b> over cover point. Protection in the deep though"
"full, on leg stump, and whipped off his pads to deep backward square"

"length ball, width offered outside off, and he mistimes a square-cut to the sweeper-fielder on the off side"
"slower ball, outside leg stump, and PP uses his wrists to flick this past the fielder at short fine leg. Dangerous second run, but Parthiv is committed to it. <B>His highest score of the season</b>"
"full, just outside off, and tapped with soft hands towards cover. They scamper across for one"
"length ball on leg, and he rides the bounce to pull. Muscled to deep midwicket"
"back of a length, just outside off, and Stoinis stays on the back foot to punch. Finds mid-off however"
"length ball, slower delivery on off and angling in. Worked off his pads to midwicket"
"<B>parried for six!</b> Length ball on leg, and he swivels to pull. Top-edges the shot to Tripathi at deep midwicket, but the ball goes just over him. Tripathi did get fingertips to it, but the ball just about beat him. 100% for effort"
"<b>cut square!</b> Full, just outside off, and he throws his bat at this. Crunches a drive to backward point for four"
"full on middle, and nudged off his pads to the leg side. Pouched by midwicket though"
"full on middle, and he flicks off his toes to deep backward square. Man there"
"full just outside off, and he reaches to the pitch of the ball, before dragging an on-drive to wide long on"
"short on off, and he flat-bats a pull to long on"
"full on off, from around the wicket. Parthiv mistimes a front-foot defense back to Archer"
"<B>no ball, direct hit, overthrows!</b> Length ball, wide outside off, and he guides to short third man. Fielder from there takes aim at the stumps, and the <B>direct hit</b> at the batsman's end ricochets towards short fine leg. They scamper across for a single, and that's <B>Patel's fifty!</b>"
"<B>deposited into orbit!</b> Slower ball, full on off, and Stoinis clears his front leg before drilling a really high six over long-on. People in the stands run for cover"
"fuller, outside off, and Stoinis can't get under this. Driven straight back to Archer"
"googly on middle, and turning across the batsman. Tapped off the back foot to Gopal"
"flighted full on middle, and he turns this off his pads to the fielder at square leg. They jog across for one"

"another short ball on middle, and Parthiv pulls off the back foot to deep midwicket"
"<b>reverse paddles, but misses!</b> Length ball just outside off, and Stoinis tries to play the reverse paddle past short third man. Inside-edged onto his body"

"length ball, just outside off, and he thumps a pull to Stokes at deep midwicket"

"offcutter, wide outside off, and Parthiv makes room. Forced to reach out at it, and he toe-ends a cut to cover"
"<b>hammered</b> over cover! Full, wide outside off but Parthiv walks towards the delivery, and slices a drive over the infield"
"overpitched on leg stump, and Parthiv slaps this through the leg side for a single. <B>Timeout</b>"
"back of a length on off, and he rocks back to pull. Mistimes the shot to the man in the deep"

"offcutter, wide outside off, and he mistimes a punched shot to long off"
"length ball on middle, and angling away from Parthiv. Drags a pull to the vacant midwicket region. <B>Royals won't mind these</b>"
"length ball, just outside off, and he flat-bats a shot straight to Stokes. Ball goes through Stokes' legs, but he manages to get his fingertips to it. Saves a certain four"
"length ball, on off, and he <B>places this pull</b> to wide long on! Excellent shot, beating the fielder there"
"low full toss on middle, and the attempted straight drive takes a leading edge to deep point"
"<b>can't clear long on!</b> Slower ball, full outside off, and Parthiv goes for the slog. Doesn't pick the change of pace, and he toe-ends the shot. In the air for quite a while, but Rahane keeps calm"
"full just outside off, and he shuffles across the stumps before clipping a shot to deep midwicket"
"low full toss on off, and he punches a shot straight back to Archer. Missed opportunity"
"full on middle, and he tries to smack a drive through the covers. Ball takes an inside edge, goes through Moeen's legs, and splits fine leg and deep backward square. Lucky"
"back of a length on off, and he's through his pull too early. Mistimed to the fielder position at midwicket"
"full on leg, and he clears his front leg to slog. Mistimes the shot to deep midwicket. Moeen's looking for the big shots now"
"back of a length, wide outside off, and Stoinis flat-bats a shot over Stokes' head. Gowtham, committed in the deep, sprints across the long-off fence and intercepts"
"back of a length on middle, and Moeen tries to pull again. Bat's face closes, and the shot goes towards short fine leg"
"full on off, and Stoinis uses the long handle to shovel an on-drive past the fielder at wide long on!"
"back of a length, slower ball on off, and Stoinis waits for the ball to get to him. Muscles a pull to deep backward square, and it nearly carries all the way to the fielder. Whoops"
"back of a length, just outside off, and Stoinis looks to pull. Misses, and the ball flies over his blade. Goes into Buttler's gloves, and the English duo of Stokes and Buttler want to review. <B>Rahane's convinced: Royals review</b>. Replays suggest that the ball seems to be going over the blade, and UltraEdge agrees with that too. Not out, Royals lose a review"
"<B>clobbered!</b> Flat six over deep midwicket. Length ball, just outside off, and Moeen drags this pull into the stands"
"full on off, and he backs away to slap a shot to Stokes at deep extra cover"
"low full toss, just outside off, and he hammers a straight drive to long off"
"full on off, and he clears his front leg to slog. Struck past the non-striker, and Gowtham - at long on - can't cut it off! <B>RCB go past 150</b>"
"back of a length, short and fast outside off, and Moeen's too slow to pull. Through to the keeper and the batsmen pinch a single"
"<b>ramped over short fine leg!</b> Full toss just outside off, but Stoinis shuffles across and gets enough behind that shot to play it into the fine-leg boundary. Archer concedes 17 off his final over, <B>RCB finish on 158</b>"
"short outside off, a bit of away swing. Opens his bat face and guides it down to third man"
"again that away swing in the fifth-stump channel, short of a good length. Buttler jabs at it without any footwork and is beaten"
"no footwork again, but what great eyes and hands. Again on the shorter side, and a bit more width this time. Just stands there and punches it past the left hand of the diving extra-cover fielder"
"back of a length, closer to off stump, lets it come on and steers to the left of third man"
"back of a length outside off, punched to extra-cover"
"short, wide, slapped firmly but close to cover point and he'll only get a single because the fielder fumbled"
"that's some serious pace. 1458kph. Shortish, a fair bit of width, but it zips past Buttler's attempt at a leaden-footed slash"
"shortish, angling into the batsman's left ribcage. Jumps up and looks to work it away, but is a little late on it. The ball rolls off his hip into the short fine leg region"
"edged, and <b>dropped</b>. Fuller, but not on a driving length, in the corridor, and that's serious pace and bounce. Doesn't have the time to get fully forward to drive and he throws an angled bat at it. Thick edge, and Kohli, diving to his right to take it as it climbs to shoulder height, gets both hands to it but can't hold on. He went a little early at it, and the ball bounced off the heels of his hands"
"length ball on off stump, and Buttler shovels it down the ground, up and over the non-striker's head"
"low full-toss outside off, and Buttler takes a big step back to give himself more room to swing his arms through a flat-bat slap through the covers"
"short, rising chest-high over off stump, jumps to ride the bounce and defend towards midwicket"

"length ball angling into the pads, clipped to the left of fine leg"
"short, angling down leg, pulled round to fine leg"
"slower ball, ends up horribly off-line. Fairly full, angling down leg, and Rahane tickles it away nice and fine, to the right of the man at short fine leg"
"short, wide, and Rahane rises to his toes to hammer that away to the right of the diving backward point fielder"
"fullish outside off, and that's a fierce hit from Buttler. It's a hit, not a drive. Leans back and flays it away with an angled bat between cover point and extra-cover"
"again that full length, but now he goes a bit wider outside off. Buttler looks to launch it back over the bowler's head, or over mid-off, and he misses. The ball ended up a touch too far out of his reach"
"length ball in the corridor, angling in from wider on the crease.  Buttler throws his bat at another angled-bat drive, and the ball zips past his inside edge and Nath, diving to his left behind the stumps, can't keep it from running away for four byes"
"shortish outside off, perhaps not short enough to pull, sneaks under Buttler's attempted shot"
"more runs. Length ball outside off stump and Buttler goes for a hard-hands front-foot push, looking to hit through the covers. Ends up getting a thick edge that runs away between gully and short third man"
"length ball on off stump, punched firmly back to the bowler"
"back of a length outside off stump, past the outside edge as Rahane goes hard at the back-foot punch"
"zips past the edge again. This was short and wide, and Rahane was looking for the horizontal-bat slap through point"
"back of a length, closer to off stump, punched crisply and backward point stops it with a full-length dive to his right. Hetmyer the fielder"
"back of a length, a bit of nip back in towards off stump. Stays leg-side of the ball and dabs to backward point"
"short and wide, and Rahane would have been better served staying still. Chose to premeditate and make room for the cut, and ended up too far from the line to make contact"
"fullish, angling into off stump, Rahane pushes it to mid-on off the front foot, and denies Siraj a maiden"
"shortish on off stump, slippery pace again. A little late on that front-foot pull, and the ball rolls to the left of square leg off the high part of the bat, near the sticker"
"full, close to off stump, Rahane doesn't quite middle the drive and it rolls along towards short extra-cover. A little late getting forward, he seemed to be moving as he played the shot"
"shot. He wagered that the ball would be similar to the previous one, fullish, and just outside off stump. Took a big step across and used his wrists to whip it stylishly to the right of mid-on"
"shortish, rises stomach-high over middle stump. Cramps him on the pull and the ball sneaks under his bat and hits him on the body"
"full, too much width, and Rahane frees his arms and lofts it over extra-cover, such clean timing"
"full, angling into a fourth-stump line. Clips it to the left of mid-on and they take a fairly comfortable single, even though there's a direct hit at the bowler's end"
"back of a length outside off, lets it come on and guides it to third man"
"short outside off, and Buttler swats it away, in the air to the right of midwicket, and deep square leg has to run aroind a long way"
"full on middle stump, punched to midwicket"
"back of a length, angling in towards off and middle, blocked to midwicket"
"well bowled. Buttler looks to make room premeditatedly, and Siraj sends down a fast yorker and nearly takes out off stump as Buttler jams his bat down hard and fails to make contact"
"short, a bit of width, taps it away on top of the bounce for a single to deep point"
"back of a length, and it keeps low as it slides along with the angle, towards middle stump. Ensures he plays with a straight bat and keeps it out, punches it back to the bowler"
down the track and Chahal floats it up at his feet. Clipped to long-on
"tossed up slow again, angling in towards leg stump. Rahane stretches out for the lap-sweep, only gets some glove on it and it bounces down to the keeper"
"given! The wrong'un continues to do its magic! Rocks back to cut, completely misreads the googly, and by the time his bat can come down the ball has struck the flap of his back pad, bang in front. May have misread the length as well - it didn't seem short enough to cut, and that misjudgment left him with even less time to adjust"
"tossed up outside off, looks like another wrong'un, uses his wrists to play that back to the bowler"
"full and flighted on middle and leg, clipped down to long-on"
"back of a length, angling into leg stump, tucked away to fine leg"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to mid-off"
"short, angling into middle stump, and Buttler jumps forward and across and uses his incredible bat-speed to swat it away into the gap between deep square leg and fine leg"

"shortish outside off, keeps a touch low, Smith plays that trademark tennis-style swat to the right of midwicket"

"back of a length, turning from leg to middle, goes on the back foot to punch to long-on"
"flat length ball sliding down leg. Buttler loses his balance while missing the flick, but manages to keep his back foot grounded as Nath whips off the bails"
"flighted ball drops onto a lovely length on middle stump. Closes his bat face early while looking to flick, and the leading edge rolls away into the backward point region. Misfield from the fielder moving to his left allows Buttler to come back for a second"
"wrong'un, short enough for Buttler to go back to and work with the spin through midwicket"
"flight again, on leg stump. Good stride forward from Smith to drive to long-on"
"nicely bowled. Dangles it up slow, wide of off stump, and gets it to rip away sharply to beat Buttler's flat-bat cover drive"
"wrong'un, Buttler picks it well. Tossed up fairly wide of off and he gets a good stride in, watches it nicely, and plays a checked drive to the left of sweeper cover"
"length ball, just outside off, and he slashes a cut to deep point for a single"
"full on leg, and he clips this away - off his boots - to deep backward square"
"<b>inside-edged</b> past the keeper! Smith riding his luck. Length ball, just outside off, and he tries to pull. Takes a thick inside-edge and flies past Nath's left"
"full on middle, but angling into Smith's pads. Whipped away to deep midwicket. Wristy from Smith"
"knuckle ball, full on off, and he drills a straight drive past the bowler's left. Stopped at mid-off though"
"full, just outside off, and Buttler walks into a punch. Struck to cover"
"length ball on off, and Smith walks down the wicket to work it towards the leg side. <B>Leading edge</b> takes it to cover instead"
"<B>drilled through the bowler's legs!</b> Glad Moeen didn't get his fingertips to it, in retrospect. Tossed up on off, and Buttler hammers a straight drive through Moeen. <B>Fourth-straight fifty at this ground for Jos</b>"
"<b>insult to injury!</b> Half-tracker on off, turning into Buttler, and he swivels to pull this over cow corner. Crowd goes ballistic"
"length ball, just outside off, and tapped back to Moeen"
"full on off, and worked with the turn into the gap at midwicket. They walk across for one"
"full on middle, and nudged in front of square to deep midwicket. They jog across for the double, and bring up the <B>Team hundred</b>"

"full on middle, and driven down the ground with the bat's open face to cover"
"full on middle, and the googly is met by Smith after coming down the wicket. Looks to whip it away to the leg side, but the ball goes fine behind square"
"<B>toe-ended to long off!</b> Full, just outside off, and the extra legbreak finds the bat's bottom-half. Slices it into the air, and Stoinis makes no mistake. Buttler very disappointed, hits his bat onto the ground in disgust"
"full on off, and defended towards the on-side"
"<B>beautiful delivery!</b> Classical legbreak. Full outside off, and turning away from Smith. Smith tries to drive inside-out, but the ball goes past his bat. Nath whips the bails off, and is Smith's back foot in the air? Nope"
"back of a length on off, and the ball's gone over Tripathi's shoulders even before he can shape up to pull"
"length ball on off, and worked off his pads to deep midwicket. Tripathi wants the second, and Stoinis' misfield at the deep doesn't help RCB's cause either"
"length ball on middle, and flicked off his pads down to fine leg. Just a single this time"
"<b>edged past the keeper!</b> But this was deliberately played. Length ball outside off, and with no slip cordon Smith opens the bat's face to play a punch. Flies off the bat's face and into the third-man boundary"
"fullish just outside off, and Smith reaches forward to defend. Lobs off his bat's top half, but lands safely in front of cover"
"full on middle, and he uses his wrists to play an on-drive towards midwicket. Can't beat the fielder though"
"back of a length on middle, and he stays on the back foot. Then turns his chest, and thumps a pulled-shot over midwicket"
"back of a length on off, and he mistimes a pull to deep backward square. They jog across for one"
"length ball, wide outside off, and he sticks his bat out to guide a late-cut to third man"
"length ball, just outside off, and he opens the bat's face to run this down to third man again"
"length ball, just outside off, and Smith pulls off the back foot to deep midwicket. It's off the bat's toe end, so the lack of pace actually helps Royals collect the second"
"full on off, and he uses his wrists to whip this down to the leg-side boundary. <B>Royals need 38 off 30</b> as we take another timeout"
"flighted full outside off, and turning away from him. Smith lifts it over cover, and the ball's in the air for a really long time, but the ball pops out of Umesh Yadav's hand at extra cover! <B>Dropped</b>. One of the easiest catches you'll find on the cricket field"
"full on middle, and turning across Tripathi. Defended"
"length ball on middle, and the googly is flicked off his pads to deep backward square"
"full on middle, and he drives down the ground to long off for a single"
"full on leg, and Tripathi walks down the ground to drive. Hit uppishly, and the ball lands just in front of Chahal. Nearly carried all the way"

"<B>classy!</b> Full, wide outside off, and Tripathi prods forward to meet the ball on the up. Firmly struck over cover, Tripathi holds his pose after playing that"
"<b>falls in front of Stoinis!</b> Full and wide outside off, and Tripathi tries to slice an uppish drive to the point boundary. In the air for a while as Stoinis runs in, but the ball falls just in front of him"
"back of a length on off, and the extra bounce takes it over Tripathi's shoulders. He reckons it should be a wide, but the umpires disagree"
"length ball on off, and angling in. He mistimes a flick towards the leg side, ball rolls away to square leg"
"slower ball, really wide outside off, and Smith gives the ball a chase. Tries to muscle a cut through point, but misses. Umpire Erasmus calls it a wide though"
"full, just outside off, and he slaps a square drive to deep extra cover"
"<b>clobbered over cow corner!</b> Slower ball, full outside off, and Smith has given this an absolute hammering. Stays on the back foot, sees the ball come to him, and then absolutely swings the bat as if it's a katana. Beautiful sound off the bat, and the ball soars into the stands"
"back of a length on off, and he flat-bats a pull to long on for a single"
"full on off, and he swings across the line to hammer a leg-side swipe to deep midwicket"
"back of a length on off, and the ball hurries onto Smith. Mistimes a pull, but it lands safely near square leg. Nobody there"
"<B>fast!</b> Back of a length on middle, and angling down the leg side. Tripathi ducks under it, happily"
"full toss on middle, and Tripathi backs away to make room. Fast hands from Tripathi makes him slice a square-cut, and that's been struck past third man for four"
"back of a length on middle, and his attempted pull goes to midwicket on the bounce. AB picks up and has a shy at the bowler's end, but can't get the direct hit"
"goes for the yorker, but Tripathi gives the bowler a chase, effectively turning it into a low full toss. Mistimed back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off, and pulled off the back foot to deep midwicket"
"length ball on middle, and angling into his ribcage. Pulled to deep backward square for one"
"back of a length, wide outside off, and Smith flat-bats a shot straight back to Siraj"
"back of a length, wide outside off, and the attempted pull nearly goes straight to midwicket! Pawan Negi <b>drops</b> a tough chance diving forward"
"<B>another drop!</b> Look ma, no hands in real life from the RCB fielders. Short on off, and the pull is top-edged to the leg side. Moeen runs in from deep backward square to take a catch, but he slides along the grass and the ball pops out of his hand. Oh dear"
"full, just outside off, and Smith has hammered this off the back foot. Over the non-striker's head, but the man at long on is there. <B>Smith falls, Royals need 5 off the final over</b>"
"back of a length on off, and the pull along the ground finds deep backward square. Enough time to take the second"
"back of a length just outside off, and he clubs an attempted pull off his glove. Ball rolls away to short fine leg"
"length ball on middle, and he taps this to short midwicket. <B>Dot ball!</b>"
"length ball, just outside off, and the attempted cut has gone to point's right. Negi gives to stop the ball, but they can't stop the single"
"<B>pulled for six!</b> What a way to win the game. Length ball on off, and Tripathi absolutely hammers this over deep midwicket. <B>Royals win by 7 wickets</b>"
