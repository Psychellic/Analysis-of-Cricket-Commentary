"<strong>FIVE FOR OLIVIER!</strong> He pitches this up, and Amir is rooted to the back foot, and his feet go nowhere.

"shorter, outside off, and he stays in the crease and defends away on the off side"
"<strong>fuller, and hits him in front</strong>. Gone up for the review immediately, as the umpire gave it out initially. Nothing wrong with the front foot, and the line of where it pitched. The only question seems to be if it might have slipped down the leg side. Shah was falling over in trying to play the flick, and in the process got quite close to the stumps.

"Steyn has gone up for an immediate review, the South Africans think they've got Babar Azam caught behind. This was a beauty, great comeback by Steyn after those boundaries. On a length, moving away, and there's a noise. But it's the thigh pad! Looks like Babar will be safe. Steyn was so confident he didn't even appeal, and only asked for the review when the umpire gave it not out."

"slightly fuller than good length but moving late, a tentative drive finds cover"
"good length on middle, hint of a movement towards off, defended back"

"ducks under a bouncer that doesn't rise quite high. went down with bat hanging in air, and the ball went just past the bat. Wasn't that short actually and contined to rise after going past the batsman"
"another bouncer, and Quinton has hurt his fingers going for it. The batsman was flat on the floor again, bouncer going down leg, Quinton tried to go for it but the ball clipped the outside of his fingers. He seemed to be closing his hands before getting to the ball, which was also going with the angle. Painful blow"
"wild swipe results in an edge, flies to Quinton's right and high. He leaps up and gets a palm on it, but it bounces off. Difficult to call it a proper 'drop'"
"another wild heave, gets it high on the bat and it travels straight instead of over midwicket, but falls short of mid-off"
"and he's got him with a short ball. Another well-directed one, angling across him, but very close to the body. It seems to have clipped his bat on the way to de Kock, there was certainly a noise. He was walking away, but his partner told him to review, given that it's the last wicket. What if it's a no-ball? But it isn't. The review also confirms that there was an edge, with Afridi not able to get his bat out of the way in time. Six wicket for Olivier"

"given room outside off and short, he slashes it down to a square third man"
"good line and length, angling in to him pitching on off and straightening. He is forced to defend from the crease"
"big shout, not given and Sarfraz reviews it immediately. That looked mighty close. Pitched on a length and went on to hit him on the pads. Maharaj's forward prod was completely down the wrong line. Perhaps he thought it would straighten like the last one, but this went with the angle. No bat involved. Three reds on Hawkeye! And Maharaj will have to go. Pakistan strike just after South Africa have taken the lead, and this Test is still balanced."
"angled into him from around the wicket, Rabada shows a straight bat to defend it back to the bowler"
"<b>peachy</b> too full outside off and a firm push by Rabada, but with such great timing that it races into the cover fence"
"and that's flicked off his hips for another boundary! Too short and sat up, asking to be hit. Rabada coolly went back, swivelled and flicked this to the square leg fence. No.10? What No.10?"
too full outside off and he's able to carve it to deep point. Takes the single. He's got faith in Rabada clearly
full ball on off and Rabada brings his bat down straight again to push it towards cover-point
"back of a length on off and solidly defended again. But Amir's over-stepped once again, so it's a no-ball"
"beats him with one that holds its line outside off. On a length, and I suppose a lower order batsman cannot resist having a poke at it. Rabada does well to pull his bat out though"
<b>beauty</b> angled into Rabada but then straightens to whistle past the outside edge off a length
he's beaten him on the outside edge three balls in a row now. pulls the length back a tad for this one and gets it to rise nicely. Passes Rabada above waist height and beats his edge again
"finally gets some bat on ball, defended back to the bowler"
"back of a length and rising, he goes on the back foot to pull it through midwicket. Takes the single again"
"pitches on leg, back of a lengthy and moves across to take a thick outside edge that squirts through cover-point"
"too full and on the pads, flicked to midwicket's left and placed well enough to yield two runs"
"short ball, reasonably well directed on leg stump, but dealt with well too. Swivels and keeps the pull down even though it was head high, and send the ball to deep square leg"
crunches the drive towards point where the fielder flings himself to his left to stop the ball
"bouncer, but mis-directed down leg and he lets it go through"
"good length on off, he gets behind the line to defend with a straight bat"
"back of a length outside off, and pushed past point"
"that kept low. A bit wider outside off and just scooted through on a length. Rabada hung his bat out, but it went below the bat"
he's just been teasing that outside edge of Rabada's. Another one on a good length and he gets it to move away a touch. Rabada is playing for the angle and the ball whistles past his prod
"that one held it's line and was pitched fuller, but Rabada still can't lay bat to ball on those in the channel"
"fuller and on off, he jabs at it and it takes a thick edge to go past point"
"<b>goes for it but doesn't time it well</b> not quite full enough to attempt the straight hit back over the bowler's head perhaps and the bat twists in his hand. The ball lands safely though, clearing mid-on"
"beaten on the flick, and struck on the thigh pad"
"short ball and he pulls it forcefully, but without great timing. The ball trickles to deep square leg"
"short ball, and Rabada goes for the pull but doesn't connect. It passes past his head to the keeper"
"<b>gorgeous</b> too full on off and Rabada's cover drives are top-notch. Leans into this one, full flow of the bat and the ball purrs all the way to the boundary"
"back of a length outside off, doesn't bounce a whole lot, he stays beside the ball and pushes it to point"
"back of a length but straying on the pads, and he tucks it to deep square leg"
"back of a length on the stumps and bounces a bit, jabbed towards gully"
another great shot. Too full and Rabada nonchalantly flicks it past mid-on and into the fence
"fuller on off stump, and he blocks it back watchfully"
"review for a caught behind. Short ball angling into him and Rabada moves inside the line to pull it from shoulder height. Seemed to miss it and Sarfraz caught the ball. Both bowler and keeper went up immediately in appeal. And the review confirms there was no bat involved at all, so correct decision by the umpire."
another bouncer but he saw it coming and had enough time to duck under it
"goes for the pull but the ball doesn't bounce as much, and hits his pad to roll towards the slips"
pushed towards point
"<b>finally the ball catches Rabada's outside edge</b> Another one on a good length, inviting him to drive and straightening. Rabada went for the drive but got an outside edge that was snaffled by second slip. It's been a good hand by Rabada though, and he's given his team a useful lead"
bouncer and he's late to react but it's pitched too short and flies over him anyway
"fuller ball and he's equal to it, coming forward and defending"
angled into him from round the wicket. Very full and defended back
very full and he goes for it with a full swing of the bat. Was targetting cow corner but manages to get it only to deep square leg. They don't take the single that time
"bowls this wider outside off and moving away, and Quinton moves across to try and deposit him over midwicket, but his big bat swing connects with air only"
"too full and this is smart batting. Gently taps it into the leg side and with the field back, they are able to get two runs. What's more Amir has over-stepped again, so it's another no ball"
"went for another big shot, trying to pull this back of length ball from off stump, but only inside edges it onto his body"
"almost a mix-up. Taps this softly into the off side and sets off for a run, but both men then decide against it and scurry back to their creases."
"fuller outside off and tapped into the offside again, but not as softly. The bowler moves to his right quickly to intercept"
"<b>got him with a slower ball</b> clever bowling. It's not something you expect perhaps in Tests, but Amir knew de Kock was looking to tap and run. Bowled it at 116kph, and de Kock was too early into his shot, only spooning a catch to cover"

"length, straightening into him at 138kph, and he defends from the crease after getting behind the line"
"<strong>DROPPED!</strong> Length ball, that angles across Imam and catches his outside edge, but Hashim Amla at first slip is slow to get to it. Gets his hands to it, but cannot latch on to it as he rolls to his right!"

"length ball, and he shapes to flick it, but cannot get the ball away as it straightens into him"
"shorter in length, and straying down the pads, and he plays it with soft hands towards long leg. Good running to push for two, and they make it comfortably"
"length ball, straightens into him after pitching on leg. Perhaps a bit too much height on it, as it beats him for pace and pops up on the offside off his pads. A man with a helmet moving closer to the batsman now, on the leg side"
"fuller ball, straighter, and he jams his bat down to play it down towards long leg"
"length ball, that he leaves from just outside off stump"
"pitched up, and he looks to drive it. <strong>Goes off the outer edge of the bat</strong>, but goes through gully along the ground!"

"back of a length outside off, and he defends it back to the bowler watchfully"
"<b>short ball does the trick again</b> back of a length and rising, he shaped to pull it but it probably rose higher than he thought. It also homed into him and got very close to his body. He would have been better off swaying out of the way or rising up on his toes to defend. Instead he gets into a tangle with the pull, the ball takes the top edge and Rabada runs in to complete a tumbling catch at short midwicket"
"and that one keeps low, just after one that bounced a lot took out Azhar Ali. Slanted across the left-hander, and pitches outside off goes to the keeper"

"<b>rapped on the pads and given</b> Asad Shafiq has reviewed it, and I don't think he'll survive. Great length, but it's nipping back a bit and hits him on the pad. Shafiq was right across and in no position to play a shot, just pushed his bat limply completely away from the line of the ball. But he's lucky because that is <b>missing</b> leg stump. So he survives. Atrocious shot though."
"<b>you cannot deny Steyn for too long</b> Another bad shot, but Steyn deserves that wicket. He brought the last ball back into him, he bowled this one outside off and it was moving away. Shafiq's feet were rooted to the crease and he tried to slash that away from the body. Gets an edge that is gleefully snaffled by Quinton. It was a bad shot in any case. Given that he had just survived an lbw appeal and Pakistan's position, it was a terrible shot"

"tossed up on off again, a touch too full, driven but again to mid-on"

"angled across, left alone outside off"
"good length around off, he defends it from the front foot"
"angled across again, and he lets it go outside off."
"gets the line straighter, forcing the batsman to play. He defends from the crease, gets a thickish inside edge onto pad"
"<b>ooh that's hit Quinton</b>angled across, back of a length, he lets it go through, de Kock has his gloves in front of his face but somehow, it goes past and strikes him. He's okay though"

"fired in, but strays down leg, and is clipped to square leg"
"back of a length outside off, there's room to punch and he does, but can't get past point"
"good length, nipping back in and bounces a touch higher than expected too. Babar does well to play it down with soft hands"
"nipping back in again, but pitched on middle. He flicks it off his pads, but the fielder at midwicket intercepts"
"very full outside off, he drives with authority, but straight to mid-off"
"good length on off, dabbed down. They think about a quick single but wisely decide against it"
"<b>cleaned him up</b> What a beauty of a ball, from a bowler who is going to rule world cricket for a while. No second innings heroics from Babar Azam. Pitched on a length and moved away, all at great pace, leaving the batsman stuck in his crease. Beaten by pace as much as movement, by the time he had completed his intended push towards cover, the stumps were in disarray. Take a bow Rabada, that is a crucial, crucial strike"

"<strong>GONE AGAIN!</strong> That is irresponsible from Sarfraz, who goes for a blob! A teasing ball outside off, and he gets led into chasing it, edging it down to Faf du Plessis, diving away to his left. <strong>That's a pair for the captain!</strong>"
"angles across him, and lifts off a length, and he goes for a waft and misses!"
"outside off, and he has a slap at it. It goes along the air towards third man, where Maharaj dives to his right and saves two"
"full ball, way outside off, and he looks to drive, but misses this ball delivered at 138kph"
"length ball, outside off, and he lobs this over covers. Not quite off the middle, but hit safely"
"short ball, and he tucks it off his pads. It goes in the air, but just wide of Markram at square leg. Good bit of timing, too!"
"short ball, and he looks to hook this. <strong>Not given, but South Africa have reviewed this immediately!</strong> The foot lands perfectly well, and the line of the ball was going down leg, and Masood had a waft at it as it was going down leg. Quinton de Kock was up immediately, as were the slips fielders, but this is not close to glove, for sure. Could it have taken a feather? Nope. <strong>Will stay not out, and South Africa will lose a referral!</strong>"
"short ball, and he fetches it from outside off and pulls it down towards short midwicket"
"short ball, and again down the leg side. Seems to swing late, after eluding an attempted pull from Masood, and then carries on towards off and beyond, almost beating de Kock entirely!"

"<strong>THROUGH HIM!</strong> Length ball, on the stumps, and <em>keeps low</em> too! Amir didn't get behind the line of this, and ended up playing a tentative poke at it. This Rabada spell is threatening to hasten the end of this game, and at <i>this</i> moment, there's only one team winning this one!"
"short ball, and he flicks it down to long leg. Takes a single, that brings new man Yasir Shah on strike"
"dug in short, and he edges it through to de Kock. <strong>TEN IN THE MATCH FOR OLIVIER!</strong> Olivier's twist has completely turned this match around, in both innings. Bowled so well on day one, and today he came on and undid all the good work that the Pakistan openers had done."
"dabs a length ball towards off, and looks for a quick single, but has to turn Shan Masood down"

"short, and he hooks it down towards fine leg. Takes the single on offer"

"length ball, outside off, and he drives it towards short cover"
"fuller ball, and he looks to drive this straight, but the bat turns in the process and goes straight back towards Steyn"
"length ball, angles across him, and he comes forward to defend"
"length ball, outside off, and he drives it towards short cover. Hasan Ali had backed up quite a bit, but the direct hit doesn't take place. He might have made it back anyway"
"short and wide, and he doesn't seem convinced about what to do. Ends up missing it"
"short ball, and Ali ducks inside it. Clumsy, but effective!"
"short, and better directed this time. Ali ducks, and <em>just</em> about evades it!"
"fuller, and he drives it through the point region. <strong>'Shot', says Masood from the non-striker's end</strong> in appreciation!"
"short, and he ducks under it again"
"fuller, and he drives it down the ground this time. Gorgeous bit of timing, but Bavuma gets to it. Only just, but does well!"
"length ball, angles across him, bowled at 138kph, and beats the outside edge as Hasan Ali looks to defend this"
"straight ball, and he drives it down the ground towards mid on"
"<strong>AND ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST!</strong> The short ball works for Steyn, as Masood takes on the man at midwicket, one of the five boundary-riders, three of them on the onside. It goes straight to him, and that will probably hasten the end of this innings now."

"slides down the leg side, and he can glance it down to fine leg"
"<strong>OLIVIER GETS ELEVEN FOR THE MATCH!</strong> It was dug in short, but Afridi looked like he had done enough to ride the bounce, and was looking to just nurdle it towards long leg.

"length, outside off, and draws the outside edge! It's been taken by Azhar Ali, but they want to check this. <strong>The soft signal from the umpires is OUT</strong>! Superb ball, pitched in that length that drew him forward, took the outside of the bat as he poked at it, and flew low to Azhar's right at first slip. He went low and gathered it, and <strong>seems to have done enough</strong>! He was confident immediately after completing the catch, and Elgar was also looking to walk to the change rooms immediately afterwards.

"yorker but he's equal to it, and defends it back"
too full and Elgar is the kind of batsman who can put away loose balls after copping blows and playing and missing for half hour. Doesn't miss out here and executes an on-drive. Nobody manning long-on so it's a boundary

angled across again but pitches outside off and moves further away. Left alone
"squirted to the point boundary off a thick outside edge. stays in his crease, no footwork, and goes hard at one pitched up on off. Perhaps not exactly where he intended to send it, but he'll get runs"
"<b>big appeal</b> And they've gone for a review on the lbw. pitches in line with leg, and he gets it to straigthen a smidge, and thus hits him on the knee roll. Amla was playing down the wrong line, perhaps expecting it to angle away like the other balls had. Bat was behind pad, so no inside edge. Pitched in line, struck in line, but surprisingly enough, it's angle is going to take it past off stump. Didn't straighten enough. So Amla stays and Pakistan lose a review"
"good length on the stumps, he stays in his crease and seems a bit stuck there to be honest. Punches off the back foot past the bowler, but without any conviction, and mid-on is there to clean up"

"angled across again, and Amla doesn't move while watching it go past off"

"good length and coming back into Elgar, that kept a bit low. But he was looking to come forward and defend so was able to crouch more and block it"
"play and a miss. keeps it in the channel and on a good length. Elgar plays inside the line, but Amir gets it to straighten a touch. So close to the outside edge"
this one goes with the angle and Elgar jabs his bat down a little late to keep it out
"<b>Elgar's pinged on the forearm</b> kicked up off a length, perhaps off a crack, and Elgar has copped it on the left forearm. Looks like a painful blow. It ricocheted off towards square leg and they take a leg bye, but Elgar is down on his haunces at the non-striker's end and getting treatment. He reacted as soon as that had hit him. Possibly struck him on an awkward spot, because if there's anything Elgar is, he's tough as nails. Getting a bit of magic spray and a drink, and he's going to continue batting."

moves across and defends
"shorter, but spinning into the left hander from around the wicket. Elgar stays back and plays with the turn, but can't go past midwicket"
"too full and given some room outside off, which allows Amla to free his arms into a flowing cover drive that splits the in-field and purrs to the boundary. Opened the face at the last moment to send it more square"
"back of a length outside off, Amla shaped to play but pulled his bat out. That's the first time I've seen him do that this innings - he's generally not shaped to play anything that can be left alone"
"short ball on off, and that is the Mighty Hash in full flow. Stands up tall and pulls with authority to deep square leg. T"
length ball on off and he defends it watchfully back
"fuller ball outside off, Amla defends firmly, and the timing is so good it runs past the in-field and allows a single. Amla's timing is looking like it's coming back. Ominous"

"too full on off, and Amla brings out the flowing drive. Straight to wide mid-off but Yasir mis-fields and allows runs"
"huge shout for lbw, and Amir is particularly excited. Not given and Pakistan have opted to <strong>review</strong>. This one also looked close, but height may be the issue. Pitched on a length and Elgar played for the angle into him, but it straightened past his bat to hit him above the pads, on the inside of the thigh. Painful blow that had him hopping, but ball tracker confirms that it's going over the stumps. Pakistan lose both reviews"
"fuller on off, he comes on the front foot to defend. The ball rolls away off a thickish outside edge"
"very full, and pushed firmly by Elgar back past hte bowler, but Yasir at mid-off dives and stops the ball. Good timing on that, but hardly any follow through. Even when looking for a run, Elgar was limping."

"fuller ball on off stumps, he nudges it to midwicket with an angled bat"

"goes round the wicket, but keeps the line well outside off and Amla shoulders arms"
"great bouncer, surprises Elgar. Perfect height, rises up to Elgar's head. He wasn't quite expecting that and ends up fending it awkwardly away, with the ball hitting the bat handle. Luckily for him, there is no one close in and it lands safely"
"this one is fuller and shaping away a touch, goes past the outside edge of a tentative poke"
"angled into him and fuller, Elgar shuffles and turns it to midwicket with soft hands. Fielder running in from midwicket to pick up but quick single taken. Direct hit would have been interesting"

"too short, outside off that time and rising well over the batsman. The umpire thinks its high enough to be called a wide. One more added to South Africa's total"
"better length, outside off, pushed to extra cover for a single"
"<b>outside edge goes for four, but half deliberate</b> Length ball on off that was moving away, he pushes at it but seemed to want to run it down. Gets it past second slip"
"genuine edge that time, with the ball keeping low, but the surface has no pace because it drops well short of the slips"
strays on the pads and is tucked to midwicket
"fuller on off, driven but extra cover fields"
keeps low again. Pitched on a length outside off and coming in a tad. He has to go down low to defend
"length ball outside off, defended solidly to point"
"short ball but well outside off. Amla makes as if to sway out of the way, but he doesn't really need to, because it's not coming into him"
"short and wide outside off, he goes for the cut, but only manages to chop it down to point"
short ball and he goes for the pull that time. Connects it well from in front of his face and deep midwicket has to run around to square leg and put in the dive to stop a boundary
"short ball again, but going down leg, and he helps it down to deep square leg with a swivel pull"
"ooh, Amla's getting adventurous suddenly! short ball outside off and he tries an upper cut. Misses connecting though."

"fuller ball on the stumps, nudged to mid-on"
"length ball on the stumps, defended towards extra cover"

"fuller outside off and driven with more conviction that time, but straight to mid-off"

"good length on off, he stands tall in his crease and punches to cover"
"fuller outside off and punch-driven, but can't beat point"
"back of a length, coming into him from outside off. He stays in his crease and shows the full face of the bat to defend"
"fuller and on driving length, which invites Amla to go for it, but he inside edges on to pad"
"back of a length outside off again. He tried to move across and flick it away, but gets a leading edge that pops in front. well short of the bowler, who can only stand with hands on hips and stare"
"drags it down short and going down leg. He pulls it pretty easily from just above waist high, down to fine leg"
"that's a bit of a waste. Four wides because that was bowled very short and was rising even while passing Sarfraz. He leaped up and got a glove on it, but was never stopping it"
Amla adjusts quickly. He was expecting a short one and was pre-mediatting a pull. Moved very far back and across. but Shaheen kept it short of a length only and it didn't bounce as much.had Amla eventually fending it down from his chest

"short ball outside off, he dabs it down towards point"
another bouncer outside off but that is climbing and Elgar wisely pulls out of any intended shot. Sways out of the way too and brings his bat down
that's a well directed bouncer. Elgar had to duck away quickly because it was on target to take his head off

"<strong>GONE THIS TIME!</strong> Length ball, that angles across him, and his bat gets to the ball but feet don't follow. The ball rises on its way to Sarfraz, who takes a solid catch away to his left. <b>It's a maiden Test wicket for Shan Masood as well</b>!"
"length ball, outside off, moving further away, and he lets it pass"
"length ball, nips back in after pitching on leg. There's a loud appeal as it beats the attempted flick, but it might have both missed leg stump and gone over as well. There are no reviews left, either!"
"full ball, that he drives straight back down the pitch, and Masood fields. Feigns to throw"
"flighted, and he presses forward to defend"
"tossed up, around the leg stump, and he looks to sweep fine, but misses out. Polite enquiry, but a short one"

goes back to a shorter ball outside off and punches it towards cover
"digs it in short, and Amla can let it pass"
"length ball, angling across him, and he defends from the crease"
"short, and he pulls it away towards long leg. The fielder makes a half-stop, and then literally helps it along to the fence. Two fielders there, in fact, which made the whole effort look a bit more comical."

"<strong>GONE THIS TIME!</strong> Yasir strikes at last, as de Bruyn pre-meditates an inside-out shot by advancing down the track. Yasir lobs it wider, it's the top-spinner, and he misses it all ends up. Easy for Sarfraz, and that ends a tidy little cameo from de Bruyn"

"short ball, and he has swung it straight down the throat of long leg! <strong>TWO PAIRS FOR TWO CAPTAINS</strong>! Just reward for Afridi, who will feel he probably should have struck with the Elgar catch to Azhar Ali that the TV umpire overruled. Too little, too late, though for Pakistan"

"length ball, and he gets on top of the bounce and nudges it towards midwicket"

"length, outside off, and he defends from the crease"
"<strong>THOSE ARE THE WINNING RUNS!</strong> Befitting that Bavuma gets them, getting down on his haunches to sweep a length ball aimed at the stumps, down to long leg. Terrific batting from Bavuma in the first innings that was largely responsible for setting this match up today. Today's effort was down to Amla, who finishes unbeaten on 63, and Elgar, who scored a gutsy 50 himself. South Africa lead the series 1-0!"
