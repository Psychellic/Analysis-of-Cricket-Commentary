"lovely line to start from Russell. Fuller than a good length on off, Rahul defends solidly. Full face of the bat. not much movement"
a tad too straight from Russell and nudged to deep square leg. Easy delivery to get off
"ooh, nice delivery. Full and swinging back in to middle at 140 kph. Ended up too full - a full toss - which was clipped to mid-on"
beauty. Bangs it in on a good length but shapes this one away. Gayle is convincingly beaten
"138 kph. Russell generating good pace, and hitting good lines. On a good length and defended"
slightly leg side-ish on a shortish length. Gayle works it away towards midwicket to retain strike
"lovely start. 133 kph, on a back of length, more by default because of his height. Nagging away on off and Gayle blocks with his wide bat"
"Gayle gets going. Races down the pitch, gets a delivery in his half. because of his shimmy, he made some room for himself and then just clobbered the muscular loft straight over the bowler. big six"
"six and out. Gayle goes. Big big wicket. Wonderful comeback for Morne. Goes back to his trusted length, the shortish length, on off. Gayle looks to pull, but fails to connect with it. the ball hustles off the pitch and hits the splice of the bat. Lobs straight up. uthappa waves all other fielders off, and completes the easy take"
"shortish length on middle and leg. Poor ball to this man. Kohli flicks to backward square leg, and eases back for the second."
"nice bowling this. Short on middle, pushes Kohli back, tucked to square leg for one."
"pretty good over that. Exploited that back of a length. Another shortish delivery but widens the line, slightly too wide and Rahul sees and opportunity to ramp the upper cut over slip. Doesn't make contact"
already looking splendid is Kohli. Good length and very close to off. But Kohli allows the delivery to come to him before deflecting the ball past point
Rahul does the same. Slightly wider and dabbed to third man
"fuller length this time, outside off. Kohli lunges forward and defends under his eyes. May have kept a little low"
"too short and too straight, Kohli nurdles it off his chest, to backward square leg. Piyush is quick on it to prevent the second"
"massive appeal from Robin, but ump Erasmus isn't fooled. Short down leg, Rahul tries to pull, but misses."
"through Rahul. Full but down leg, Rahul backs away and looks to biff one down the ground. Russell follows him and some inward movement takes the ball past"
"yorker to finish. On off. Nothing Rahul can do, but jam it out to point"
"nice line that. pushes it slightly wider outside off, forcing Kohli to defend the good length delivery"
good run. Another nagging delivery around off on a good length. Tapped towards extra cover for a quick single
"shot. Lovely. Back of a length again on middle, Rahul gets inside the line and pulls, meets it early to get it behind square. Past short fine leg for four"
"a very de Villiers-like shot. Good length outside off, Rahul lets the ball come to him before deflecting the bat down to third man, with a straightish bat."
"good length on off, or slightly outside off. Kohli drags his clip in front of square this time. An easy brace"
"once more. Very easy from VK. Not a bad delivery at all, goo length on off, But Kohli is in sublime touch. Walks across and tucks to deep midwicket, for two"
"slower offcutter, haven't seen Russell use that delivery too often. Too slow and wide, Rahul steers it down to third man"
"another slower delivery, fullish on off. Kohli closes the bat face to get the ball to deep midwicket. No two there"
"excessively full on middle, Rahul hurriedly nudges past wide mid-on for a couple"
"excellent batting. Good length on off, top-of-off stuff. Rahul pats the ball down with a straight bat, just lets the ball run onto the bat. Beautiful."
superb bouncer on leg. Hurries Kohli who is forced to duck underneath. Kohli thought of pulling but withdrew late
"tight end to a tight over. Good length on middle, Kohli comes forward and laces a square cut to point"
too full to start from Narine. Overpitched and smashed. The cover drive is beautifully timed and bounces over a diving Piyush at cover
"four more. Gets low this time, Narine's slow full delivery is easily read and swept past square leg. Great batting. Well executed"
"slow again, on off. Not much turn either. Defended back"
"good use of the feet to get to the pitch. Fullish on off, played back."
"slightly shorter outside off, Rahul gets back to dab a cut to point. Kohli calls him through"
"very flat, very short. But straight. Kohli rocks back and punches a drive to long-on"
poor delivery and what did you expect to this man? Drifting down leg and Kohli times his flick. Meets it late to get the ball behind behind square
"better adjustment. Good length outside off, forced to extra cover. An easy run to Gambhir"
"another bad ball. Short on middle and leg, rahul sees it early, gets in a good position and swivels on his pull. Rolls his wrists on it to keep it down. And finds the gap behind square for four more"
"slower legcutter on leg, Rahul waits for the ball to come to him before flicking to square leg"
"slightly wide outside off. Kohli looks to hit the drive too hard, mis-times to cover"
"slower delivery on off, pushed down to long-on"
"flat down leg, extracts a bit of turn. but too short, so plenty of time for Kohli to go back and turn to deep midwicket"
"decent amount of flight on off, Raul steps down to nudge to long-on, against the spin"
"much better. Slow on off, wonderful line. Kohli defends"
"poor delivery. Short, too short.  A long hop, Kohli susses everything up early. Goes back and purposefully, lofts the pull over midwicket"
"sensational shot. Manufactured that. Short but straight, Kohli goes back and punches the drive past cover. Pathan makes a boundary-saving dive"
"may have been the googly on off, Kohli reads it like he normally does, and tucks the ball to square leg"
"rather full outside off, not too wide. Kohli backs away and forces a drive past cover"
"offcutter on off, cuts back in to Rahul who is through the shot early. Skews the ball back to the bowler"
"legcutter outside off, Rahul chops a cut to point but that doesn't stop Kohli from scampering through"
"lovely delivery. Jags back in from a good length, Kohli was shaping to steer to third man but the ball hits the glove to square leg"
good variations these. A slightly round-arm action and the wide offcutter cuts back in to sneak past Rahul's flaying bat
"nice over that. Fullish on off, Rahul drives to cover for one."
"nicely bowled, may have been the Googly again. Wide, and Rahul scythes a cut to  deep point"
"what a shot from Kohli. Too wide and full, Kohli reaches out for it and flat-bats the cover drive past cover. Pathan makes another boundary-saving dive"
"slowish on off, tapped to point for a run"
"superb shot. Ran to the pitch of the flighted delivery, got there and thrashed the lofted drive. With the spin, and carries over the boundary with ease. Nicely played."
"oh superb. Shot of the day. Very full outside off, Rahul was shaping for the sweep but knew he couldn't drag it from so wide outside off and so full. And so, he opens the face of the bat to lace a late cut between point and third man. Awesome"
"slow on off, driven to long-on"
six more. Easily done. Rahul shuffles across and Narine helps him with a leg side-ish delivery. rahul gets down early and slog sweeps it over deep square leg
"this is great batting. Quite full outside off, Rahul brings out the reverse dab. Ensured he got just enough bat to get it past short third man. Another fifty for Rahul."
"slowish on off, nudged to deep midwicket"
"short and wide, smashed for a run to deep point."
"pushed wider outside off, nicely bowled. Rahul comes down but has to reach for it, drives to long-off"
"too short outside off, pummeled off the back foot, but Kohli finds cover"
"this is gone. Wonderful bowling from Chawla, bowls it slower and wider outside off. Rahul looks to loft it over cover, but the ball was too wide. Ends up slicing the ball to deep cover. Excellent innings"
"tossed up outside off, slashed to deep cover. Nice shot"
"tossed up outside off, Ab strides forward and pushes the ball past cover. So easily does long-off has to sidetrack to field it. Not run in."
"massive appeal, but that was way too wide outside off to even be in contention for a leg before wicket. Full outside off, Ab tries to sweep, gets his front pad outside the line and misses. Easy call"
"slower on off, pushed to deep cover"
"reverse sweep from Kohli this time. Hits it nicely, but finds short third man. Easy run for these two"
"poor delivery. Short and wide, an easy offering. Kohli smashes it in front of cover. Didn't move his feet too much but found the gap with ease."
"a half-volley on off, Kohli smashes it again. but finds cover this time"
"amazing shot. Just sensational timing. And how did he find that gap? Very full outside off, Kohli sweeps powerfully and finds the gap at deep midwicket. What a talent"
"shortish again on off, flat-batted drive to cover"
"nice, tossed up on off, no turn. Worked to deep midwicket"
"wonderful bowling. AB doesn't pick Narine. A slow offspinner on off, AB gets across the line but the ball spins in to hit him on the thigh. Convincingly beaten"
"bludgeoned but straight to deep midwicket. Flight on off, Kohli clatters the stroke to deep midwicket"
on the bounce to deep square leg. AB gets across and connects with the powerful sweep.
"tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"
"the very fast variation. Seam-up and gone. <strong>AB fails</strong>. That's a terrific delivery. Rushes AB and the ball may have seamed back in a tad too. AB clearly did not pick that either and tried to get his bat down in time, but the ball struck him on front of off. How big will that wicket be?"
"78 kph, nicely bowled, slower and wider outside off. Cut to point"
"well bowled. Very slow on off, extracts a bit of turn. Worked to midwicket"
"good length outside off, pushed down to long-on. Kohli may have to push it around for a bit, here"
"good length on off, 136 kph. Played down to point."
"back of a length outside off, 137 kph. Outside off. Kohli works it away to deep midwicket"
nice lines. Nagging away on off. Watson cuts to point.
"back of a length on middle, Watson gets across, looking for the paddle. But the bounce takes the ball past Watson's attempted scoop"
"another dot ball. 144 kph. Really good over from Morkel. Shortish and wide, Watson gets on to of the bounce and slashes to point. Gambhir collects and claps."
"a bit of flight on off, Kohli tucks with the spin to deep midwicket"
"clears deep midwicket. Did not get all of it, but enough. Tossed up but pushed it wider outside off, Watson got down on one knee and slogged it over midwicket. Even Russell can't haul it in"
"carrom ball outside off, pushed to point"
"86 kph, again wider outside off, Kohli drills a drive to long-off."
"nicely bowled. Short and straight, Watson backs away attempting a cut. But the offbreak means Watson can only pat it back to the bowler"
"a low full toss and dispatched. Great batting from Watson. Hammers the ball in the gap, at deep midwicket. Really clever batting. End of a horror spell for Narine"
"fifty for Kohli. Not anything new. Good length outside off, pushed to long-on. very intentionally giving the strike to Watson. He knows he has to stay there till the end"
"low full toss outside off, Watson looked to go straight but the ball skewed off the outside edge, to deep cover"
"<strong>dropped. Gambhir drops a clanger.</strong> And it is of Kohli. Nice bowling from Morkel, shortish length outside off. Kohli comes down and looked to go for a pull but the line meant he had to attempt a forehand. Takes the top edge, and hangs in the air for eternity. Gambhir settled under it but it hits the hard past of his hand, and bounces out."
"gone this time. Russell won't drop those. Full and wide, Kohli looked to go straighter over cover. But got too far away from the ball, ended up reaching for it. The ball skewed off again, off the outside half. Russell takes a good low catch. Fist-pump from Gambhir."
"another low full toss from Morne. Outside off, Watson smashes it, all along the ground to Russell at sweeper cover"
"superb spell from Morkel. Ends with an offcutter outside off, Baby taps to point and gets one"
"superb change-up. The slow offcutter on a good length, at 119 kph. Baby is through the shot too early and ends up getting pinged on the ribs"
"no-ball called. Very wide outside off, may have been above the waist too. yes, was above. Baby cannot connect with his cut. Free-hit coming up"
"another one, surely. Yes. Another no-ball. This is the first official warning. Outside off and miscued to point. The umpire didn't deem the first no-ball as dangerous and so Umesh is allowed to continue"
"another low full toss, sliced over point this time. Umesh struggling in this over. lands just inside the boundary"
"finally hits the pitch - on a fullish length. On middle, Watson backs away and pushes to long-on"
"awful delivery. Way down leg, another extra."
"too full this time. A half volley on off, Baby drills the drive right over the bowler. Finds the long-on boundary. Right in the arc for the big hit. Baby did not get under it enough for six, but timed it well."
"four more. Massive over for RCB. Good length on off, swatted away over midwicket. Just inside the boundary"
"huge, this is six. A humongous over, 23-run over. Full and follows the backing away batsman. Baby gets it in his slot and heaves the ball, well over deep square leg. This is some cameo"
"excellent from Russell, another offcutter on off. Watson is through his swipe early, toe-ends it to the keeper"
four more. Scythed over short third man. Not sure that was the right delivery. Full and wide with short third man. Watson looks to go over cover but gets a thick slice to clear short third man
"and again. Better delivery though. This was full and straight, Watson looked to go straight but a thick outside edge clears short third man again."
"well bowled but that will be four more. Really really good batting from Watson. Low full toss on middle, Watson finds the gap at midwicket. Got it off the toe end but timed it well nonetheless"
"shortish on off, Watson mis-times his pull to square leg."
"111 kph. Another offcutter on off, Baby looks for a scoop. Toe-ends it back to the bowler, Russell takes an easy catch. But such was his frustration with the preceding events, that he hurled the ball back at middle stump. Could have done some serious damage to that stump."
"another full toss, on middle, well below waist-height. Mis-timed to long-on"
"six for local boy Binny. Off the first ball. Umesh isn't having a good end. Another slower ball on off, Binny cleared his front foot, waits and then hammers the lofted drive over long-off"
"terrific batting. Shortish delivery on off, Binny backs away and then ramps the ball over short third man. Binny on fire."
"six more. This is huge. Another slower delivery on off, Binny bludgeons the heave well over long-on. Umesh has conceded 40 off his last 10 balls."
"taken this time. What a cameo though. Another low full toss, on middle and off. Binny wanted another six, went after it. But toe-ended it to long-on. Great knock"
another low full toss to finish. Another miscued drive to long-on. The throw back to the keeper is decent and Robin whips off the bails to find Watson well short. Great over for RCB again
"lovely start from Binny. Good length, shaping nicely away. Uthappa defends under his eyes"
quick run. On the move while playing the drive to mid-off. Nice and full outside off. Push and run
poor delivery. Wanted to go short but Binny isn't quick enough to trouble Gambhir. 131 kph. Gambhir pulls past short fine leg. Rolls his wrists on it. Great shot. Good start
"nice adjustment. Brings the inswinger back from wider outside off, towards off. Gambhir gets on his toes to chop towards gully"
beauty. Goes wider of the crease and bowls it on a  good length. Shapes away. Uthappa beaten
"gone. Uthappa falls. Beautiful bowling from Binny. Very full outside off, the ball moves away again. Uthappa brings out hard hands to push at the drive. Reaches out, away from his body. The direction of swings helps take the outside half of the bat. In the air and swallowed at point by Kohli"
"poor start, full on leg and clipped to deep square leg. Easy for Gambhir if you bowl there"
"nice, shaped away from the outside off but Lynn leaves. Too wide and called."
"lovely delivery. Good length and shaping away, just enough movement to take the ball past Lynn's half-prod. From the crease."
"angled away again. A little fuller and inside the tramline, another leave"
"pushes at this one, poor technique but this is T20. Good length outside off, moving away. Lynn pushes at it, away from his body, leaden feet. One to mid-off"
"not a great ball to Gambhir. Short and wide outside off, slapped to point. Lucky Aravind"
gets some more movement. Moves away outside off and starts the outswinger too wide. Called
"and now too straight, worked to deep square leg for a run"
"lovely shot. Overpitched outside off, Gambhir leans on the drive, offers the full face of the bat. Mid-off (Aaron) runs around to his left to cut it off"
"massive. Full on off, 129 kph. Not much movement. Lynn stays in his crease, doesn't bother moving his feet and chips it over long-off for a huge six. Nice swing of the bat"
"adjusts the length immediately. Good length on middle, nudged past short fine leg for a couple"
"a good option but played it too early, back of a length outside off, hit to mid-on. Not timed too well"
"a half-volley on middle, clipped straight to midwicket."
"changes it up, 124 kph offcutter on off. Nudged to square leg. One of Gambhir's favourites"
"very full to start, 118 kph offcutter on off. Clipped towards midwicket for a quick single"
"yes, very straight. Full on middle, Lynn bunts the ball past mid-off. AB at long-on gets to the ball to cut it off"
"not a great option. Short on off, Lynn chose to pull and top-edged it. But it landed beautifully between AB at long-on and a backtracking Shamsi from midwicket. Lucky for Lynn"
"another offcutter on off, tucked to midwicket again for one. Onto you Lynn, says Gauti"
"overly full on leg, worked to deep square leg for one"
nice shot from Gambhir. Premeditated the big hit and executed nicely too. Shimmied down and heaved the ball over midwicket. Cleared the infield easily
"massive appeal for lbw, drifting down says the umpire. Nice delivery from Chahal. Flat on middle and the ball skids on, hits Lynn in front of leg. Was that going down? Was that clipping? That was close."
"very flat again down leg, clipped to midwicket."
well played. Feigns a forward shimmy. Chahal fires it short and wide. Gambhir stays in his crease and steers to point
"gone. No doubt about that. This one turned. Flight on leg, Lynn stays in the crease and pushes. But since the length was short, it allowed the ball enough room to turn. And it did. Spun past the outside edge and hit off stump. Great legspinner's dismissal."
"lots of flight on middle, patted back to the bowler."
"excellent start for Chahal. Flat on leg, clipped to midwicket. Just 2 and a wicket off the over"
"overpitched on off to start from Aaron, driven to mid-off for one."
"shortish length outside off, another poor shot to choose. Instead of choosing the off side, he tried to drag the pull through midwicket. Ended up flat-batting back to the bowler"
"sensational fielding from AB. Very full on leg, clipped to the left of square leg. AB dives, stops, recovers, throws to the bowler but the pair get through for one"
"inside edge. Very full on middle, Gambhir swiped across the line but lucky that he got some bat on that. Plumb in front if he hadn't"
"shortish and wide, Gambhir looks to cut but fails to connect. Another dot ball. Great Powerplay this for RCB"
"back of a length on middle to finish, Gambhir misses a flick after closing the bat face too early. off the thigh pad towards gully for a leg bye"
"low full toss to start, clipped to deep midwicket"
"lots of flight, ends up in a yorker. Drilled to long-off"
"superb shot from Gambhir. Very flat from Shamsi but too full, Gambhir heaves it over wide long-on. Timed it really well. Got sufficiently under it too."
"the wrong un. Some sloppy fielding from backward square leg. Too short and Gambhir helps it on its way, Aaron had some ground to cover and got there but the ball went through his feet"
"superb batting. Flat and straight again, but Gambhir plays his nudge very late, against the spin, to square leg"
"another googly on off, chipped to wide long-on, two more. Good over for KKR, need more like these."
"outside off and steered past point, to third man. Opened the face of the bat"
"good length outside off, slapped to cover. Kohli collects and fires a throw to the non-strikers end. No back up and an overthrow ensues"
"too wide, very full outside off. Outside the wide line and called"
"short delivery on leg. Gambhir gets inside the line, looking to pull but cannot collect. A big appeal  but that wasn't very close to the glove"
"143 kph, another big appeal but looked like it pitched outside leg. Yes, it did. Gambhir missed a flick but an easy leg bye"
"nicely played. Looked to go over midwicket but couldn't quite find that gap. Shortish length on middle, swiped to long-on"
"offcutter strays down leg, another wide. Another extra."
"nice delivery to finish. Good length outside off, glided off the open face to third man"
"short outside off, drag-pulled to midwicket"
"slower delivery outside off, cut to point. They go through with a non-existent run. Gayle picks up and throws but misses the stumps at the bowler's end. Pandey had given up"
"short outside off, a nice delivery for Gambhir but he misses his cut"
"another short delivery, that looked like it was down leg. But Gambhir had walked across and misses another pull."
that will be wide. Lots of extras for KKR. Extremely wide outside off and Gambhir ignores
"superb shot. I think Gambhir is standing on off and so anything straight opens the leg side, like this boundary. Full on middle and Gambhir heaves it in the gap at midwicket"
"gone this time. A well-executed yorker on off, Gambhir misses a straight ball and he knew straightaway. However, the ball struck him outside the line of off. Unlucky for Gambhir. Umpire Ravi gives him out. Decent innings, but KKR slump further."
"tossed up on off, Manish looked for a mow over midwicket. Squeezed to square leg"
"huge appeal, Rahul collects, whips the bails off and appeals. The third umpire is called for the stumping. Nice googly on off, Yusuf missed a big heave. Yusuf's back foot was inside the crease comfortably"
"another googly outside off, Yusuf goes back to slap the ball back to the bowler"
"another googly outside off, yusuf dabs to slip this time. Pressure building every ball"
"low full toss this time on middle, drilled down to long-on"
"nice legspinner down leg, Pandey doesn't pick this one either, but the ball pings off the pad to square leg"
"short and taken. Big wicket for RCB. Short on off, Pandey forehands the ball straight to long-on. Baby takes the catch. The umpire checks for the no-ball. Looks like there is a smidgen behind it. And he's given. Pandey fails today, KKR misfiring."
"another short delivery, this is very clever bowling. Yusuf struggles with the pull; again, doesn't time it at all. Bounces just in front of deep square leg"
"good start from Watson. 122 kph legcutter on leg, Russell taps the ball towards midwicket for a run"
"another legcutter on off, punched off the back foot to deep cover. Just one more."
"full and wide, shapes away in the air. Hammered to the sweeper cover"
"a full delivery to end, on off. Skewed to cover, another dot ball. KKR falling well behind"
"starts with a flat delivery on leg, played back"
"oh huge. A drag down from Chahal, too short outside off, Russell hangs back and pummels the pull over midwicket. Way back into the stands"
"better, slightly fuller and slightly wider. Russell slaps to long-off"
"pushed wider outside off again, Yusuf toe-ends a muscular drive to long-off. Just one more"
"nicely bowled, full and straight, forcing Russell to defend. nice pace from Chahal"
"very wide outside off, too wide. The legbreak spins and a wide is called"
"straighter on leg, clipped towards backward square leg. Russell scampers back for the second"
"all of Yusuf's power takes this over long-on. Really good shot. Stays in his crease, gets a shortish length and muscles the mow over long-on. Absolutely no chance for any fielder"
a low full toss on leg. Yusuf gets some bat on his flick to long-on.
slower legcutting bouncer and Russell ducks underneath. Nicely bowled
"ooh, big hit attempted but missed it completely. A good length outside off, the legcutter deviates away just enough and the pace taken off deceives Russell. Just misses off stump"
another bouncer at 136 kph. Russell looks for another pull after clearing his front foot. fails to connect again
"an offcutter outside off, slapped to cover. Aravind dives over the ball and concedes the extra run. Nine off the over, a sub-par over for KKR"
"very slow and very wide outside off, Yusuf tries to heave over long-on but misses."
"flat on middle and leg, Yusuf gets some bat on it, squeezed to square leg"
"that could have been the game but it ends up in four runs. Flights it enough down leg, Russell comes down and looks to hit over long-on but somehow misses. Rahul gets up too early, and the ball sneaks through. Four byes"
"very nicely bowled, slowed up on off and the ball rips past Russell's mow."
flat down leg this time. Rahul fails to collect again and five free runs this time.
"very flat on off, fired in. Pushed to deep cover."
"tossed up outside off, Yusuf gets an inside edge on his heave to square leg. Just one."
"very flat on off, pulled to deep midwicket. Yusuf should have put that in the stands."
"another flat delivery outside off, pushed very wide. The ball skids past Russell's flaying bat"
"how has that gone for six? Flat on off, did not look like Russell got near enough. His pull cleared long-on by a distance."
"six more. Lots of flight this time on off and despite it being a googly, Russell could get under it. Once he did that, all he needed to do was connect. And that he did. Sailing over midwicket"
"what a shot. Great batting this. Tossed up again on off, sufficiently to prevent Russell from getting under that but Russell drilled the cover drive through cover"
"shortish and wide, better to be there than anywhere else. Russell laces a cut to deep cover, just one. The over KKR needed."
oh no. Looks for a slower variation outside off but misses his mark by a few feet.  Wide
"ooh, 141 kph full toss on leg. Could have gone anywhere. A thick leading edge goes to third man"
a loopy tennis ball bouncer on middle. Have to get the direction right to Yusuf. Another free run for KKR
"slower delivery outside off, drilled past cover. Kohli runs around from long-off to haul it in. Good stop by the captain"
"superb shot from yusuf. Aaron looks for the yorker on middle, Yusuf shuffles across and times the pants off his flick. Whistles to the midwicket fence,"
"slower offcutter outside off, chopped to Gayle at point. Easy single"
"just clears the boundary but six more for Russell. This is the problem with defending at this ground. A mis-timed six. Full outside off, allows Russell to get under the ball. Russell doesn't time it too well but enough to clear the cover boundary"
the ball of the day! And to the same batsman too. An inch-perfect yorker on middle and leg. Russell hurries to gtet his bat down and somehow manages to keep it out this time. Very similar to the Mustafizur delivery to Russell.
"in the gap for four. Again, yusuf did not quite get under that sufficiently but found the gap at midwicket. Overpitched on off and Yusuf drills the ball in the gap."
"four more. Lands just inside the boundary. Watson chooses to go wide outside off, Yusuf uses all his muscle to bludgeon the lofted cover drive. Sensational batting"
"three in a row. Watson opts for the change of length. the bouncer on off, Yusuf anticipated that length and pulled that nicely. past the square leg who is in the circle and Yusuf is on fire"
"six this time. four boundaries in a row. One over could always change this game at this ground. this surely has to be that over. Full again on middle, this was shorter than the first ball and allowed Yusuf to get under it again. His muscular lofted swipe clears long-on"
"looks for another one of those mows, doesn't get it though. Squeezed to midwicket, in the gap and that will be two more"
"another boundary. All going wrong for RCB. Shortish legcutter outside off, Yusuf looks to smear over midwicket but a thick outside edge flies to the third man boundary. Was a very clever delivery but such is the nature ..."
"slightly short on middle, Russell hammers the pull to midwicket, on the bounce"
"floated up outside off, nicely bowled, forcing Yusuf to stretch for it. Toe-ended to cover"
"would have been called wide had he left it alone, but Russell chooses to go after it and holes out. Is that the play that RCB needed? Very slow outside off, Russell stretches out for it and doesn't time the drive. Holes out to deep cover. Binny takes a pressure catch, reverse cupped."
"tossed up on off, driven to long-off with the spin. Good batting, good bowling"
"flat down leg, good batting from Yusuf. Just works the ball with soft hands towards square leg. Looked for two and got it comfortably"
sees the batsman coming and drops it short and wide. Yusuf smashes the cut to deep cover . Great spell from Chahal
"clears long-off to bring up a sensational fifty from yusuf. Fullish and wide outside off, Yusuf powers his stroke over long-off. Fist-pump, what an innings"
"great batting. Expected the flatter delivery outside off, Yusuf waits for it and then opens up the face to guide the ball past third man for four. Superb"
"another tossed up delivery on off, skewed to deep midwicket"
"the googly on leg, Suryaklumar gets down low and sweeps the ball behind square. Four more. No chance for square leg. All over I presume"
"another googly outside off, Suryakumar misses his late dab."
"flat on middle to finish, Sutryakumar pushes to long-on to tie the game. Scores are level."
full down leg and clipped behind square to finish the game. A morale-boosting win for KKR.
