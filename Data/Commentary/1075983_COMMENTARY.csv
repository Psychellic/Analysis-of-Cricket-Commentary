"<strong>holds its line!</strong> On a length outside off, 126 kph. Khawaja is careful of not leaving his off stump vulnerable so he plants his bat in line but the ball does not move. Beaten."
"<strong>edged and gone</strong>! And again, it's the replica of the previous delivery. Full outside off, he could have let that one go, but Philander is getting some inward movement. So Khawaja has to cover his off stump. He pushes at the ball, hoping the ball would move back. But it does not. The last ball followed the same modus operandi to beat the bat, this ball catches the outside edge. Amazing bowling from the Big Vern."

inswinging yorker just outside off. Jams this into the pitch and feels that in the bottom hand
<b>outside edge</b> as this straightens in the corridor. Length ball and he's on the back foot
"<b>inside edge and it's another wicket!</b> De Kock completes a low catch. Rabada is making it happen! Reverse swing on this, hooping in at a length from outside off. Looks to drive on the up and it kisses the bat on the way through"
"edged and gone first ball! Rabada on a hat-trick! Cummins must have been told multiple times in the dressing room to watch for the full, straight one. So he is crouching low, waiting for the ball to come to him but it doesn't. Instead, it pitches, moves away and takes the outside edge. Sensational bowling from KG."

"big appeal again. Too much bounce? Smith ponders a review and decides against it. Philander plays all around this length ball angling in and is hit on top of the knee roll. <strong>This would've gone over?</strong>. Hawkeye suggests it would've clipped, so would've been umpire's call at best. So Australia wouldn't have lost a review even had they taken one."

"brain freeze from Maharaj, has it cost him? AB can't believe what he's just seen. This was nicely tossed up by Lyon, Maharaj is lured into this big, big heave with the spin. Didn't get to the pitch of the ball so didn't get the timing and power he would've liked. This would have still carried all the way if not for Khawaja's awareness. He kept his eyes on the ball, but may have miscalculated where the ropes were. As he caught the ball, his backfoot was in contact with the turf behind the ropes just before he lobbed the ball back up to catch it inside the field of play. Let-off technically. <b> Maharaj and SA will heave a sigh of relief </b>"

"massive shout for lbw as AB is struck on the pad attempting a reverse paddle. <b> Given not out, Australia review immediately. </b> Was it turning too much? Would it have missed leg? Plenty of questions. This ball was nicely tossed up but lands on middle and leg, misses AB's paddle and hits him just below the knee roll. Hang on, there's a very very small spike, possibly off the glove. So they didn't even look at ball tracking. <b> Onfield decision of not out stays. </b> Australia have exhausted their reviews"
"angles a short ball into the stumps from around the wicket, Maharaj looks to duck but ends up having a swipe at it, beaten."
"delightful off-drive. This was floated full, Maharaj was quick to pounce on it. Intended to bowl a yorker, turned out to be a half-volley"

"drilled over the bowler's head, Warner comes around and slides in a long-off before firing a throw. AB was willing Lungi on to get back and he just about manages to."

That's the end of that. AB walks off to a huge round of applause, South Africa have a big lead. He walks off unbeaten on 126.

Rabada hits that in-between length - neither driveable nor pullable - and gets the ball to move back in against the angle from outside off. He slices through the defences of the opener and tilts the off stump back. No shoulder brushes, no contact. More sedate celebrations from Rabada, if one could call that. He just screams in the face of the defeated Warner, but then again it's likely to attract unwanted attention. Cool off, Rabada"

Marsh rides the bounce of this short ball outside off and places it between point and cover
"back of a length and just a shade outside off, jabbed into the covers"

<strong>Rabada returns and pins Khawaja in front</strong> with seven minutes to go for stumps. Khawaja chats with Marsh and decides against a review. This looked pretty adjacent and the three reds confirm it. Rabada lets out a roar and celebrates. Speared full on middle and tails away late to beat Khawaja's outside edge and ping the back pad. It would have carried onto hit the top of off stump. Khawaja's tendency to camp back in the crease works against him in the end

full and marginal movement away from the corridor. Solidly behind this time as he pushes on the front foot and steers it through point
"good length on off stump, defended on the front foot"
<b>struck in front of middle</b> and the lbw appeal  is turned down. He was wide of the crease again and this shaped back a touch. Appears to have gotten an inside edge as he looks to nudge this into the leg side...yes he has.
"<b>bowled him!</b> Boom, right through the defence. They've checked for no-ball, he's fine. What a sight. Marsh is an unfortunate man to get this ball so early in the day.

good length and wobbly at a middle stump line. Defended solidly into the leg side
"<b>that's mean</b> from Rabada. 141kph bouncer rising sharply at Paine's back shoulder. He hangs the bat up fr the hook but that fizzes past him. And he nearly falls onto the stumps. Anyone other than a keeper might have struggled to stay up, I imagine."

"back of a length, slanted into the corridor before cutting away. He leaves with off stump exposed"
good length and in at off stump. Solidly blocked on the front foot
<b>thuds his pad on the full</b> but that's going down. Might have been an attempted yorker
yorker fired down leg side. QDK leaps and manages to get his left-hand on it. Can't gather but he's taken the fizz out and Amla cleans up

"good length on middle stump, off the thick outside edge as he offers the full face to defend"

"gorgeous. Inswinger onto the toe, he shuffles quickly, opens his body up, stands tall and punches this to the midwicket boundary"

"into the gap at midwicket for two. On a length, nicely worked away. Not over-hitting, just relying on timing."
"shortish and wide, slapped to cover from the back foot"
"edged and taken! Too good from Hazlewood. Australia not giving up. It's another stunning delivery, on a good length, the ball moving away. Markram is lulled into playing because of the threat of reverse swing and the threat of bowled or lbw. It doesn't come in, it goes away. Takes the outside edge, flies in between first and second slip. But Smith steps up, moves well to his left and takes a smart catch. Excellent stuff"

"82 kph, short outside off, coming back in, off the pad towards slip as Amla shoulders arms."
"short outside off, turning back in, 85 kph"
"84 kph, big appeal! No again. Smith again thinks he has not offered a shot, but what Amla is doing is putting the bat behind the pad. It depends on the umpire, what he thinks. He was struck well outside the line there."
"this is a better appeal, <strong>Australia review this time</strong>. Flat outside off, turning back in, hits Amla in front of off, or just outside the line. On a pitch with plenty of turn, it's always a problem that the ball is turning too much. Think Amla has been struck in line, but Lyon is bowling from over the wicket, so the ball was always going to miss the leg stump, as HawkEye indicates."

"full and wide, the ball moving away late, but beats the bat as Amla drives. Well bowled."

"overpitched around off, blocked to mid-on"
"good length outside off, left alone nicely"
"straight to short leg. 94 kph. That's an excellent piece of bowling from Lyon. He sees AB coming and shortens the length just a touch, which means the ball isn't full. AB works the ball away into the leg side, but short leg is patrolling that region. He stays low, moves forward with the batsman, sees the ball off the face and takes a catch inches from the ground. Terrific piece of cricket from Lyon and Bancroft."
"every run is going to be cheered now. Full outside off, a thick inside edge down to fine leg, who runs to his right and misfields."

"nicely done. Sees some flight and it's full and wide, so he opens the bat face and guides the ball through cover."
