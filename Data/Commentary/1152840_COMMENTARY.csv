"fullish length around off stump, no swing and Fakhar punches in front of mid-off, pinches a single to get going"
"sliding across from over the wicket, towards the tramlines, again no movement and Babar accepts the freebie"
"goes fuller, 79mph on off and Babar slices one down to third man"
"pitched up in the corridor outside off, 82mph and Fakhar steps out to drill to the right of mid-off, just a single again"
"length ball, around middle and off, blocked back to the bowler"
"what's this, chance of a run-out... <b>Foakes misses from five yards away with Babar sprawling!</b> It was a controlled punch into the covers, comfortable two but they then started for a third, Fakhar changed his mind and left Babar having to do a U-turn. But Foakes collected the throw in front of the wicket and somehow missed the stumps!"
good length and prodded watchfully into the covers
<b>flayed through the covers for Pakistan first boundary!</b> Sweet connection as Fakhar scythes through a full ball outside off
"fullish, room the free the hands again, this time he picks out cover"
"pitched up again, 84mph and there's a sweeper out for the drive now"
"over the wicket to Babar, no slip in and he drops back to angle the ball wide of the keeper, <b>just a cheeky late dab and it runs to the rope!</b> First four for Babar"
"straighter line, worked off the hip towards square leg"
"gottim, <b>plucked above his head at cover!</b> Maybe that was Curran's plan all along, just feed the drive... Fakhar was trying to hit that into the pavilion but mistimed the shot, still could have picked up four had Morgan not timed the jump right; had to go one-handed in the end but took it supremely well!"
"pitched up, 83mph and driven crisply but straight to extra cover"
"shorter length, worked off the pads"
"length in the channel, softly played behind square"
full on the pads and this is clipped in front of the sweeper at square leg for two
"just a hint of wobble outside off, <b>Babar dabs at it late and is beaten</b>"
"too full, in the slot, <b>belted through the covers for four!</b> That's a strong area for Babar - and he's not No. 1 in the world for nothing"
"full of a length, 83mph and Imam decides to show his colours, lashes a straight drive but picks out mid-off"
"on the pads this time, but he can't work it past midwicket"
"touch shorter, angled across and Imam glides it off the back foot, goes quickly to backward point and there's no single on offer"
"again on the short side, 82mph outside off, dropped towards cover and the fielder races in"
throws the hands at one and drags it through midwicket for on
"slower ball from Curran, who then races down the wicket to field as Babar looks to his partner retreating to his ground at the non-striker's"
"full from over the wicket, clipped off the pads behind square backwards square"
"full and straight again, <b>clocking 90.8mph on the speed gun</b>, worked in front of the square and they run well for two more"
"outside off, pitched up at <b>91mph</b>, Imam chops down on it and they scamper through"
"length ball angling in on off, taking the pace off this time, 76mph and Babar waits for it to dab one to third man"
"dug in, Imam pulls but can only connect with the glove - <b>and Archer strikes on debut!</b> (Not for the first time this week.) Sharp bouncer, 88mph this time but it was enough to surprise Imam, and Archer is off and running, England trailing gooey-eyed in his wake!"
"short of a length on off stump, Haris shows it a straight bat in defence"
"fired in straight, drifting leg side as it deflects off the pads... Jordan goes up in appeal, but umpire Gough isn't interested"
"dug in, room for Haris to have a swing outside off, gets it right off the toe and Archer gives it his all running from third man to try and spare his mate a boundary - in vain"
"full now, in the channel and Haris drive, hits Morgan in the covers"
"good length, 85mph and this is jabbed with an open face to backward point"
"takes the pace off this time, pushed square but Duckett is across to field this time"
"another slowie, 70mph and clipped off the pads, picks up a couple behind square"
"tossed up nice and full on middle and off, Babar drives it back to the bowler"
"wide of off stump, possible a googly and it's whipped through midwicket coming forwards"
"advances down, <b>smashes this to...</b> well, only about halfway to long-on. Came off the toe of the bat, there was a man coming in but he had no chance of getting to the catch"
floated up and tapped to leg
flicks the googly away behind square for one more
flighted and worked with the spin for another single - tidy first over from Rashid
"Jordan hits a good length on off stump, 84mph and Haris blocks"
"offcutter, Haris goes big and this time <b>gets it out of somewhere neat the middle of the bat!</b> Only just clears the short boundary at deep midwicket, Willey gamely jumped for it one-handed but no dice - first six of the innings"
"pushed across the left-hander, who plays at it and misses"
"fired well wide of the off stump, making Haris go to the longer boundary... but he reaches out and slaps this firmly behind backward point, Denly's dive in vain"
fullish on the pads and clipped for a single
"bit of width, 85mph and Babar uses that to his advantage to larrup a cut through backward point for four more - <b>15 off the over</b> and that's a timely bump for the Pakistan run rate"
tossed up and worked off the pads
"Babar's on dance floor, <b>raising the roof with a lofted drive into the stands!</b> Sweetly struck and they're taking cover in the crowd at long-on!"

"slips in a googly, Haris waits and clips off his pads"
"flighted, Babar comes down again and punches through mid-on"
"another wrong'un, steered away through point playing back"

"width and Haris throws the hands, 86mph delivery and a thick edge travels lickety-split to the rope at third man!"
"zips this one through, slightly short and Haris looks to make room, can't lay bat on ball"
"round the wicket, <b>91.2mph</b> on the stumps, calmly worked into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on"
"ooh, streaky! <b>Foakes flings himself to his left and can't quite get there!</b> Backing away, Haris dabs and gets a thick edge but with Foakes going down the leg side he has to adjust... and can only get fingertips on it!"
pitched up and punched into the off side
"sliding on, another googly to the left-hander, squeezed into the off side"
"bat and pad together as the batsman gallops down the pitch to negate the spin, a bit of an appeal but he was so far down"
"once again, way down the pitch at the point of impact ... Morgan thinks of the review as the ball deflects to the off side, but no"
"back in the crease this time, eased into the covers"
"dragged down, hauled out to the leg side, that's a loose one from Rashid, and punished with a rollicking pull"
"nurdled to wide long-on, a decent finish to a previously tight over"
"back of a length, a bit of width, dabbed to deep point"
"opens the face, glides a cut to backward point"

"rolls the fingers, a dab to the leg side, picking the slower ball, they turn for a tight second, but the throw is wayward"
"very full, in the slot for a slog, but instead pressed very firmly to mid-off, who gathers on the bounce"
"<B>a slow-turning pie!</B> Like a tin of Fray Bentos in the microwave, pongo-ed up and over midwicket!"
"oops, <B>another half-tracking honker</B>, absolutely leathered over cow corner! Get those fingers warm, Joe!"
"better length, tucked to the leg side, and up comes a 31-ball fifty for the world's No.1 T20I batsman"
"flashed to deep cover, another easy single"
"fuller, straighter, pressed to cover"
"tossed up on a better length, Denly clawed that back well, as Babar settles for a measured push to cover"
"banged into the ribs, pulled calmly round the corner"
"short again, well directed, thudding into a mistimed pull as Babar loses sight of it"
"outside off, unlucky for Willey, Haris was retreating to leg so it was the right idea"
"line and length, bursting past a wild mow. A valuable dot"
"retreats to leg, opens the face on a full length, stabbed down to third man. Well played and placed"
"wide line, attacking the tramlines, and that was marginal but correct"
"outside off once more, stabbed to point as Haris chooses to chase it. Had he left it alone, it would have been another wide"
"<B>flashed in the air, up and over backward point!</B> Willey aims fuller, but Haris is alert to the line now, and chops uppishly, loads of bottom hand, skewing the cut away through the field"
chopped into the covers
"loops in the yorker, dabbed out to deep cover, and Haris joins Babar on fifty. Pakistan are cooking!"
"<B>slammed on the up, and over the covers!</B> It's an outswinging half-volley, picked early and panned to the rope, with an open face to beat the field. Lovely tonking"
"yawned into the leg side, Jordan pounces with intent on the boundary's edge"
"slower ball, looped onto a good length, well played but more or less picked, rolling out to no-man's land at deep midwicket"
"back of a length, cutter, chopped to cover"
"slower ball, angled into the top of the stumps, calmly deflected through third man"
"spears in the yorker from round the wicket, excellent delivery, squirted to point"
"hauled out to deep midwicket, but that's the slower ball, banged into the pitch, and <strong>Haris hasn't got hold of it! </strong>Willey steadies himself on the edge of the rope, and that's another vital scalp from Archer!"
"hopping across the stumps to a full length, flicked to the leg side"
"<B>two wickets in the over!</B> And though this won't count as Archer's wicket, he's made it happen. Chasing down the leg-side flick in his followthrough, gathering well, with two stumps to aim at, and pinging down Babar's timbers as he strove to make his ground!"
"pumped into the covers, excellent timing to end a superb innings-changing over"
"slower ball, outside off, dabbed to point"
"outside off, chopped to third man"
"slower ball again, so slow it barely reaches the batsman, let alone bouncing high enough to connect with his ambitious slap across the line"
"spanked back to the bowler, <B>dropped, one-handed in a reflexive leap!</B> Nearly caught on the rebound too, but instead gathered with the non-striker ambling out of his crease, and <strong>under-armed into the stumps!</strong>"
clocked into the covers
"another slower ball, tight line on off stump, tapped to cover"
"right up to the toes, clipped firmly to midwicket, and <B>another mix-up between the wickets</B>. Careful now!"
"outside off, zipping through to the keeper from round the wicket. Lovely change of pace, proper wheels on that one"
"very full and straight, thumped with intent to mid-on"
"flipped to the leg side, timed it well, using the pace and the slight error in direction"
"yorker, lovely length, can't do much with that, except not get out"
"turns his stance inside-out, can't connect with a flick over the leg side. Another fine over from Archer, whose spell has made the difference so far"
"reverse-slap, can't connect properly"
<B>pounded hard back over the bowler's head!</B> That's a proper wallop
"flatter googly, can't get this one away"
"another googly, Faheem opens his stance, but can't get it away properly, through point"
"a smear across the line, this is a fine over in the circumstances"
"tossed up on the legs, flogged to deep midwicket, Rash's day is done"
"good pace, banged into the hip, and Imad can't connect on the pull"
"right up to the blockhole, flashed back to the bowler and <B>dropped!</B> Though, intercepted is probably fairer. He stuck out a mitt and stopped the run"
"attempted yorker, and that is <B>utterly flogged on the up over long-off!</B> Picked the length early, right underneath the shot with oodles of lovely bottom hand. Like a left-handed Jos Buttler"
"clears the front foot, smashed high and hard, but <strong>straight to Denly at deep cover!</strong> Easy as pie, and Pakistan's momentum is stymied again"
"very full again, and thumped off the toe of the bat, <strong>straight through long-off!</strong> Placement over timing, and valuable runs!"
"<B>supreme finish!</B> Whipped with brutal wrists, clean past the sweeper at fine leg! Offline from Jordan, and punished behind square. That's a much healthier total than appeared likely after their wobble."
"fired in and drifting into the pads from round the wicket, Vince flicks and it comes off the pad behind square"

"pushed through on middle and leg, Vince clips this regally into the leg side, finds a big gap in front of deep square leg, they hustle back for three"
"touch short and wide, Vince doesn't move his feet and swishes outside off, fails to connect"
presses out and taps this into the covers
"smashed off a length, <b>that's flown hard and flat over long-on!</b> About as agricultural as Vince gets, but that was belted out of the middle of the bat"
turned off the pads into the leg side
"short, 84mph and it sits outside off, Vince roundhouses a pull straight down the ground, long-on is in place now"
"shortish, not much room but he plays late and opens the face to steer a couple in front of backward point"
"full and wide, Duckett doesn't need a sighter, <b>hands flowing through a cover drive that leaves the fielder in the dirt!</b> Comes on quick, leaves even quicker"
"slower ball, 78mph and tucked to the leg side"
"pitched up, 86mph outside off, Duckett creams it in the air - <b>bagged at mid-off!</b> Sheehan pulls out the Star Man pose, living up to his namesake Shahid! Struck it pretty well, maybe off the toe, but Duckett won't trouble the scorers any longer on T20I debut"
"stays over the wicket, fullish and driven along the carpet to point"
"short ball down the leg side, Root pulls at it and Sarfrarz goes up in appeal.... Alex Wharf signals wide"

"goes for the full bunger but that's a gimme, crunched past the infield to the cover-point boundary for four"
"skiddy, short of a length, 84mph/136kph and Root fends it short fine leg"
"dug in, room outside off for Root to guide a cut down to third man for one"
"back of a length, Vince chops off the back foot without timing"
"takes the pace off, Vince baseball-bats down the pitch, <b>direct hit from Hasan after fielding in his follow-through...</b> But Vince had grounded his bat and they steal one"
shortish and dabbed behind point off the back foot
"shortish and a touch wide, 86mph/139kph and <b>cracked behind point with princely timing</b> to pick up four more"
"banged in, 85mph outside off and tapped square"
"short and on the hips, Root swivels and swats behind square on the leg side, they come back for two"
on the pads and worked into the gap at backward square once again

"flat on the stumps, into the pads but probably sliding down"
"lobbed up outside off, Root makes room to drive inside to out"
"Vince opens the shoulders and hits down the ground, just a single there"
"flighted, outside leg and Root paddles it past the keeper"
"worked into the leg side, a misfield gives Vince a second"
"drifting leg side again, Vince overbalances playing across the line, half a chance of a stumping... <b>But Pakistan think there was an edge and Wharf's finger goes up!</b> Vince, though, looks bemused and calls for a <b>review</b>. What does Ultra Edge say? There's something on the graph, a thin spike as ball passed bat - and that's enough for Tim Robinson! Vince looks forlorn as he walks off, maybe thinking he hit the ground, but again he fails to convert a good start"
"short of a length, pulled fine for one"
"back of a length, 88mph and Morgan swats it away for his first run"
"short of a length, Root fails to connect with a pull - the ball then rebounds up out of the gloves to hit Sarfaraz in the hooter. Owee!"

"clonked onto the on-side, Imad's fine spell is through"
"speared into the pads on a full length, Root should have clipped that mercilessly through fine leg, but settles for the deflection off the legs"
"very full, angling away from the left-hander, Morgan slaps an air-shot"
"<strong>spanked high and not entirely mighty!</strong> Wafting through the line, right under the stroke, but Hasan and Shaheen can't decide who should go for the chance, and it plops inches over the long at long-off!"
flogged with pre-emptive disdain through the leg side. Big over brewing ...
"<B>a bottom-handed battering ram!</B> All in the wrists, as Morgan meets the full length with a free-flowing yahoo over the covers!"
"hauled out to the leg side, he was swinging for the hills once again, and a better connection would have vanished into the Taff. Instead, it was inside-edged through square leg"
"full toss, very straight, which was all that was going for it. Root is too surprised to take full advantage, and cloths a slog to midwicket. Up comes the hundred"
"wicket-to-wicket,  but pitching outside leg as the ball skitters through to short third man off the knee-roll"
"yorker, very full, well dug out"
"full once more, Root can't do much but defend this again, just a hint of swing on offer too ..."
"<B>this is tremendous bowling!</B> Tailing in, yorker length, 91mph, Root is flat-footed as he stabs his bat down late and barely connects"

"short, swivelled out to deep midwicket, another single as Root keeps the strike."
"down on one knee,<strong> lovely contact!</strong> Eye on the ball all the way, meeting it on the full and deflecting to perfection through fine leg"
"yorker, well directed, but flicked to the leg side"
"back and across, and dabbed to the off side for the cheeky single"
"charging out of his crease, and rather shocked by the full-bunger. A cramped pull at 88mph to midwicket. A glance at the umpire, but had he been back in the crease that wouldn't be above waist-height"
flicked off the hip to midwicket again
"very full, Pakistan are nailing their yorkers right now, and England aren't quite getting the rate they need, but they are keeping in touch"
"tailing in once more, deflected behind square"
"<strong>hoisted out to deep midwicket!</strong> Lovely pick-up from outside off, and it's utterly clobbered that over the leg side boundary. It's an over-step too, so a <B>free hit coming up...</b>"
"very well bowled in the circumstances, another yorker, thumped on the up to long-on"
"<B>scooped straight to Sarfraz!</B> Looking to get the elevation over the keeper's head, but was suckered by the cutter, and feathered a thin edge to the keeper. A decent knock, but a timely breakthrough!"
"chipped on the up, but short of long-on"
"banged in short, pulled with intent behind square, and <strong>Haris makes an utter mess of that one</strong>, attempting to scoop in one hand, he instead fell over his own feet, and pulled down his own pants as the ball rolled into the rope!"

"tight line, attacking the top of off, dabbed to third man"
"good scampering from Denly, beating the shy from mid-off"
"short, too short, launching high over the batsman's head"
"flogged to deep point, another single"
"right up to the toes, flicked to midwicket, a fumble, thoughts of a single, the throw goes wide, a lot of drama for not a lot"
"very full, outswinging yorker, this is quality containment. Can't do much with that"
"low full toss, but this time <B>Denly's drive pierces the field! </B>Deeper in the crease this time, giving himself leverage, and filleting a vital boundary"
"full toss, <strong>a slap over the head of mid-off!</strong> Morgan got that one very high on the bat, but got enough on the shot to inflict the damage"
boshed out to cover
"back of a length, a slower ball, Denly dabs to cover and a quick single"
"round the wicket, cramping for room, eased to the leg side"

"wafted across the line, Denly keeps the strike. England are in command"

"a hint of width, nailed out to the sweeper in the covers, Morgan's back for the second to <B>bring up his fifty</B>. Job almost done"
"<B>sealed with a six!</B> Spanked high over long-off! And Morgan is seriously pumped about that win, toppling the No.1 T20 team in the world is no mean feat, and he's done it in style!"
