"healthy away swing for Praveen, but considering how far outside off it had pitched, I'm not sure Praveen expected it. Left by Kohli"
"nicely adjusted by the bowler. Knew there is some assistance early and probes in the corridor. Kohli waits until the ball pitches back of a length and seams away, then he dabs it to deep third man"
"the slip had moved wider for Watson as PK bowls a fuller ball outside off, Watson, perhaps since it is is first ball, restrained himself. Checked drive to cover"
"the second one is shorter and Watson is still a tad reluctant to flex his muscles. Cut, and inside edged, to point"
deep square leg moved to deep midwicket and PK used it to bowl straighter - targeting lbw - Watson was on the back foot. Tucks it towards midwicket where Dwayne Smith runs up to the ball from mid-on and would have had Watson had he hit direct
steers a shortish delivery to point. That's the end of an over where neither team wanted to blink first
"that's what happens when Watson times it, even with midwicket on the boundary! Kulkarni's first ball - on a length - is too straight and he flicks it away. DJ Bravo was the man there, a very good fielder, can't move fast enough to his left"
"good length ball outside off, pushed into extra cover. Noticeably more confident"
"think that straightened on off stump, Kohli was right behind it and taps it through midwicket. Lovely wrists"
"safe as houses! They say Jaddu is a fielder first, bowler next, batsman if necessary and this is why! Settled under a skier and looked at ease every second of the way. Credit to the bowler too, after being hit for a boundary by Watson first ball, he bowls the offcutter outside off. Watson thinks it's a simple, straight forward length ball and goes boom. But the straight drive skews off the outside edge. Jaddu ran in from cover point, got under the swirling ball and them moved his hands to his right to make sure they were right under the ball."
"shortish and outside off, steered to deep third man"
"squares up <i>and</i> beats the best batsman of this generation, according to Kohli. Absolute jaffer to end the over. He had got the ball to straighten earlier in the over, now he gets it to jag far enough away off a shortish length to leave AB groping outside off"
"shortish and outside off, struck into the covers"
"they were quicker! AB makes a quick single, would have been safe even if Raina had hit. Teams have to watch out for that. The rapid singles between these too. Kohli just blocked it with soft hands, and AB responded. Raina running in from cover and underarming the ball at the strikere's end is all for nought"
""
"steps down the track to a slower ball on off stump, defends and runs for a single. Nothing there with Raina making good ground"
"brilliant shot. It was made so by the footwork, moved outside leg to create the room for his arms to scythe the ball from fourth stump"
he was deceived by the slower pace! What can a bowler do after that? Just admire Kohli's skill I suppose. He had hared out of his crease early and sly old PK slowed it down and slid it outside off to make sure the ball wouldn't be overpitched and would bouncing up on the batsman if he wanted to drive on the up. But Kohli adjusts with his hands and cover drives all along the ground
"on the pads, AB clips it through midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, defended"
"back of a length and off pace again, dabs to deep third man"
"whipped - through the covers. It wasn't all that short, but AB waited deep in his crease and that crouched stance he takes helps him. Gains power from a strong core"
"shortish on middle and off, picked away to the right of mid-on"
on off stump - and yet Kohli's wrists make sure he can nudge it away through midwicket
"flowing cover drive from Kohli. A tad over pitched, but it was at the stumps. The batsman though moves inside the line and times it. No over-hitting"
"that's flatter, and the cover drive is still too powerful. Pure cricketing shots, pure cricketeting instinct to pick the gaps. And even when the ball was on fourth stump and not a half-volley, those lovely hands make do"
picked away through mid-on
"tossed up outside off, gently driven to long-off"
that's well bowled. Adjusted his flight and eased it a touch wider outside off to tempt Kohli to over-hit it and what happened? He gets an inside edge
that's better. Controlled push with a straight bat to long-off.
"and he fares no better. Off the back foot this time, Kohli sizes up length so well and then does what he likes. A tad short and he laces it through the covers"
"slowed it down and tossed it up wider, Kohli blocks to the left of cover and gets off. Signs to AB 'not much turn'"
length ball - flat and aiming for top of off - punched to long-off
"pushed through on leg stump, picked away to midwicket"
goes wider of the crease to generate a greater angle into the stumps - what does it even matter though? He offers up a half-volley on off stump and AB laces it through the covers
"tossed up on the pads, clipped to midwicket. That's the end of Powerplay and usually this is when teams and the pitch start slowing down"
"darted in on middle, Kohli jumps back and punches it to long-off"
"stays back and clips towards square leg, they wanted two but the fielders are up for it. Good work. This is a large ground to cut twos"
"superb bowling! That's his natural variation. The one that is fired in with the same rapid pace on leg stump, grips on the pitch and has beaten AB. Made him look rather inept actually. Could easily have tipped the bail on leg stump off"
"good length ball, driven through the covers"
"waits on the back foot once he read the length to be short and the line to be a tad wider, late cut to short third man"
used the depth of the crease nicely. Moved back and whipped a relatively good length ball to deep square leg
that's short. That's gimme bowling. But the fact that this may well be a slow pitch makes itself shown as AB is in position for the pull shot and plays a touch too early
stays back and slices it to the sweeper
stays back and cuts from off stump to short third man
"he's picked out short cover! That's a huge wicket and this sell-out crowd knows it. At 38 C, most of them would have come to watch AB bat with Kohli. Except AB has chipped a good length ball to the Gujarat Lions captain Suresh Raina. Batsman made room to just gently hit it over the off-side infield. Failed."
"shortish and outside off, chopped to point"
jumps down the track and turns a flatter delivery from outside off to deep midwicket
"flighted on middle, driven to long-on"
"on leg stump, Kohli taps it on the head and it runs away crying to deep midwicket"
"moves away from the flatter ball just outside off, steered to point"
"goes for a reverse sweep, even with a slip there. That's the pressure Rahul is under in this format. Needs to create new shots to keep pace. Gets a glove on the ball because it was a flatter delivery that was bouncing on him too much"
comes down the track and pushed to deep midwicket
"gets on top of a shortish delivery and tucks it through the vacant midwicket area, set on two runs. Jadeja his India team-mate knows that perfectly and sets off after the ball himself. So rapid across the turf. Prevents the second"
"made him reach there. This is lovely bowling. Slowing it down, making Kohli use his power. No run to short cover"
"tossed up just outside off, slashed down the ground to long-off. That was all wrist."
"lunges forward for a lap sweep on leg stump, single to short leg"
"swept away. That's a new addition to his armoury. Hit against the turn, or rather there isn't much turn, races away to deep midwicket"
believes that was a googly. Kohli moved to the leg side and smeared it into the covers
goes back and slaps a short ball down to long-on. First runs down the ground for Rahul today
"sliding down leg, Rahul looks for a single towards fine leg. Nothing doing"
"95 kph, wide outside off, Rahul wanted to slap it through the covers but misses. Keeper misses as well and Kohli pounces"
"on leg stump, patted towards long-on and Kohli yelled 'two' straight away. The fielder runs up as quick as he could, had to move to his right too. That's more than enough for him"
"slung it through on off stump, Kohli dabs it to point"
"goes back and punches to deep midwicket, almost with a straight bat"
"another one round-armed in on off stump, maybe just a bit outside. Rahul stays back and cuts to deep point"
goes back and cuts a flatter delivery on off stump to point
"tossed up on middle, worked around the corner to short fine leg. Decent sweep shot"
stays back on off stump to meet a flatter delivery and whips it to long-on
"neat work with the wrists, and all of it is because he can look for two. The fielders have been told of this tendency. Deep midwicket races in and prevents the extra run"
"flighted on off stump, comes down and flicks to long-on"
"that's an inside edge as Jakati bowls slower on middle and leg, but even then deep square leg is on it very quickly. Kohli had hoped for two there too."
"on the pads, sent flying to deep square leg"
"that's the slower ball, but it was a full toss as well. Rahul takes excellent toll of it with a lovely cricket shot. Front foot extra cover drive. Gently done"
"it'll be a steady diet. Shortish slower ball outside off, Rahul played the length and set up for the cut shot too early. The lack of pace defeats him"
"rising delivery on middle and off, clipped to the right of long-on"
"gets on top of a shortish delivery on off stump, dabs it to the leg side Bravo's onto it in a flash"
"full toss on off stump, picked away through midwicket"
pushes from the crease for a single to long-on. The Lions spinners have cut down the boundaries handsomely
runs at the spinner and slams him down the ground. Good thinking and better execution. RCB needs the man at the other end to pick up the slack if Kohli is fading. Rahul does so with fast feet
"premeditated the sweep, and Jakati firing the ball on a length outside off doesn't help his chances. Could have slowed it down. Single to deep square leg"
"shortish and outside off, steered through the covers and here Kohli can amble across for a second to bring up his fifty. He's been churning them out - fourth in five innings."
"thumped down the ground. Head over the ball, wrists coming in to belt an overpitched delivery to long-on"
"dipping on off stump, hacked to deep midwicket"
"that's the big dipper slower ball, only it dipped down leg. He cut it right over the top of the seam to make it hurtle down on the batsman. KL was running down and can't make contact"
"slower ball, more noticeable off cut there and this dips too. Rahul can only defend it down the pitch"
comes down the track and works a slower ball from outside off to deep midwicket
"picked the change of pace and turns it to deep midwicket. Kohli scampers across for a second run, but he's made to sweat even on such a large ground because spears in the throw right next to the stumps"
"attempted yorker, but Kohli has worked on countering it and it shows in how well he execute the slice behind point. He knows bowlers want to bowl wide at the end of the innings to ensure the batsman can't reach it. That's mostly because batsmen premeditate to hit to the leg side. But Kohli rarely premeditates. Responds to the ball in front of him, as he does here, giving it direction. Amazing strokeplay"
"slower ball, dipping on the batsman, Kohli is prepared for it, waits and flicks to the the right of deep midwicket"
""
"waits on a slower ball, takes it from outside off stump and flicks to deep midwicket"
"that's at full pace and Rahul ran down the track too early, then hurts himself by slogging across the line. Beaten comfortably as the ball sneaks under him and just missed leg stump"
that's the offcutter - on a perfectly hittable length outside off - Rahul swings across the line again and gets a bottom edge to the keeper. RCB losing momentum
"that's three dot balls, and three slogs. Kohli walks up to Rahul now. After an offcutter pitches on a length and misses off stump by the mother of all whiskers"
"so a guy misses three slogs and the fourth makes him look like a hero. Kulkarni bowls a silly old short ball, at his usual pace, Rahul belts it over deep midwicket"
"that's excellent! Kohli's awesome even with his pep talks. The two balls after he went up to speak with Rahul have disappeared. This was length and outside off, Rahul carves it over long-off"
"McCullum misfields at long-on. He'd loathe that. Kohli had jumped down the track and met a low full toss with a flick of his wrists. The fielder, it appears, was intent on flicking the ball up to his team-mate to try and prevent two. But in the end gives away too more"
"full on off stump, drilled down the ground for a couple"
"another full toss, to which Kohli advances and steers through point"
"whipped! How's that for emulating your captain. Course, it was a full toss on leg stump, Rahul makes sure to keep his shape, gain power from his balance and thump it through midwicket"
"one-handed! Comes down the track, takes another full toss, opens the face of the bat and gets a four knowing that the deep cover had just come inside the circle"
dabbed to third man to retain strike
"good slower ball, deceives Rahul who was charging down. Wanted to close the face and take one from outside off to midwicket. Leading edge to long-off"
"cuts Kohli in two with the angle into the right-hander. That was at 137 kph. The good old double bluff from one of the best end-overs bowlers. Prevents the batsman from getting any room, and Kohli trying to defend is beaten on the inside edge"
"makes up for that misfield now! McCullum runs to his right from deep point, leaps at the ball head first, and legs high up in the air - high up because the legs were behind the boundary and could well have touched the skirting had he dived along the ground. McCullum pats the ball away before gravity takes hold of him again and saves a single. Kohli had timed the pants off it with a down-the-track cover drive too. Great work"
"good length ball on off stump, picked away through midwicket"
"just fell short of the sub fielder! This is at 81 kph, didn't even hold the ball tight in his hand. It left out of two fingers. Kohli wasn't deceived. Waited and waited and waited and then pulled to long-on. Tye ran in, looking for the catch, dives forward but if falls short and bounces up to hit his chin"
"goes full and wide outside off, speared through point."
"good length ball on middle, picked away to deep midwicket"
"that's his fifty. His first in IPL. Length ball on middle and leg, pushed to long-on. Gets a hug from his captain"
"slower short ball, but Kohli has picked it up and bashed it to deep midwicket"
"shot! But Jadeja is impeccable at deep midwicket! So quick is he that he has stopped a ball desited for the boundary. Kohli had made it so when he waited a tad on the length ball and whipped it with every bit of strength in his wrists. But Jadeja hared to his left, dives and kept it in"
"offcutter, banged in short, Kohli blazes it away to the cover boundary. Only 16 away from a maiden T20 hundred!"
"fired into the blockhole on leg stump, jams it out and retain strike., Also, this partnership has added over 100 runs too."
"full toss on leg stump, picked to deep midwicket. Kohli wanted two, yelled for it, came down for it, but Rahul signs he hadn't heard it!"
"shortish at 129 kph, Rahul hacks at it and gets an inside edge to long-on"
"he's missed one! The cramps are getting to him, maybe. This was rather short and wide, Kohli was stuck in his crease. Normally he would have pushed forward a little more than that while playing the slap through cover"
"carries well over the ropes! That's the long boundary too. Kohli stays perfectly poised at the crease, because Bravo bowls an overpitched delivery. Full swing of the arms"
"picked the line early, knew it would slide down leg, halted his bat swing and just watched it slide past. Lovely concentration"
"that's 96 for him! One ball left. Full toss on middle, belted down the ground and neither long-on or long-off had a chance"
"he has it! <b>Maiden T20 hundred</b>! Helmet goes off, Bat raised up, primal roar and a big smile. Kohli has bossed the game, that too with a cramp! He hit himself the last match - when he made 80, thinking he could have faced 10 fewer balls for that - now he has 100 off 63 balls, not out too as the crowd yell his name with pride. It's that lovely lash over point again. The bowler was looking to bowl that wide yorker, but Kohli has played that shot superbly since the World T20. Moves across towards it, has his eyes on the ball all the way and lifted it over backward point and short third man. The wide yorker just does not work against this man!"
can't reach a slider down leg with the sweep shot.
concentrating on firing them in and preventing any room for the batsman to exploit. Smith nearly slips over himself as he plays a forceful flick through midwicket
"good length ball on off stump, no room, nothing to get under either, Baz defends"
stays back and clips a flatter delivery on middle to deep midwicket
"shortish on off stump, Smith goes back and pushes to mid-on"
"with Smith reluctant to come forward, Chahal tosses it up on off stump. Excellent judgment from the bowler. Punch to the covers becomes a dot"
lovely over from Chahal. He began with flat darts but understood Smith doesn't move his feet early and so tried to exploit it by tossing the ball up and demanding he come forward. Tentative block to cover
"simple cricket. It's a good length ball on middle, McCullum blocks and gets across to the other end. Reducing dot balls can do wonders in a chase"
"monstered over long-on! And he did it so lazily! Barely a press forward, but ample work with the hands. Swung it away with such power."
"so the bowler immediately goes short, which is fine for Smith who doesn't like coming forward. Patted into the covers for a quick single"
"short fine leg dives over the ball. It's a short one, but not rising as far up as McCullum expects. More of an inside edge, but it finds the gap to the left of Chahal"
"good length ball, slower as well, McCullum pats it into the covers and set off. But Smith isn't keen on the single. Good call that, sent him back early and that really helps"
"shortish and outside off, goes for the cut and inside edges it to cover"
"no turn, simply going on with the arm and Smith tucks it to deep midwicket"
"that's going to hurt RCB! A spinner has overstepped - not by much, the replay shows; its touch and go - and bowled a dart down leg. Smith bashes it past short fine leg's right"
"it's another short ball and Smith loves it. Heaves it away over deep square leg. Pure power, nothing doing with the footwork."
goes back and punches down the ground to long-off.
goes back and cuts through square on the off side
"down the track, but Yuzi spotted the danger. Slowed it down and shortened his length. McCullum adjusted and blocks"
"good length ball on middle, inside edge through midwicket"
"pitched on a good length on off stump, picked away to mid-on"
"there is nothing pretty about this innings from Smith. But it is going to make the bowlers wilt very quickly. Length ball on off stump, slugged over mid-on"
"flatter delivery on leg stump, lap swept to short fine leg and Watto does well with a dive to his left"
threaded the gap through the covers. Spin is not working in the powerplay. There wasn't any cover on the off side and Smith had just enough room to spear a near yorker through
goes back and nudges through to deep midwicket
"shortish and outside off, stands up tall and drills it through extra cover"
"on leg stump, picked away to midwicket"
"smoked down the ground. He steps down the pitch, made room while doing so and even with Watto following him Baz has just enough room to punch past the bowler himself"
"low full toss, curling in late at McCullum, tries to get it away with an angled bat, gets an inside edge to short fine leg"
"shortish on middle, nudged to midwicket"
"another indipper of a yorker, keeps Smith tied down on middle"
"on the pads, Smith works it to deep square leg and keeps the strike"
"115 kph, good slower ball. Those wide ones still work on batsmen whose names are not Virat Kohli. Smith can only jam it to point"
"poof, and he's gone! That was a cross-seamer, gaining a lot more bounce after presumably pitching on the seam. Smith was going for that pick-up shot again, perhaps only wanting a single. Didn't want it to carry all the way to long-on, but it's AB down there so he runs up quicker to takes any opportunity that comes his way"
"that's not going to help. Kohli's anger is certainly clear. It's a full ball slanted too far down leg, Rahul the keeper can't get across to his left quickly enough"
deep square leg was a fair way inside the circle and McCullum sends a flat missile over his head.
"well done, Sarfaraz running to his left from deep square leg, but wait, he doesn't stop it. Dives, intercepts the ball, but it gets away from him. Deflects off his body and then goes to the midwicket boundary. Pull shot with a fair bit of power"
"Sarfaraz again, made to sweat! This was ripe for the pick up shot - length ball on the stumps, McCullum cocks his wrists and lifts it away intending for the ball to always sail over the square leg boundary."
"and then he plays a pristine straight drive that brings a big smile to his son Rilee's face in the crowd! Low full toss, dispatched and even AB is not quick enough to run it down"
"lovely push to long-on. The front foot is working perfectly, and it was a composed hit with a straight bat from Raina."
"well bowled. Slower through the air and tight on middle and leg, no room for McCullum to work with and he isn't the best at those dinks behind square leg"
on the pads and Raina finds the gap behind square leg with a closed face
"that's a full toss outside off, McCullum sweeps and find deep square leg"
"some turn for Shamsi, even off a shorter length and at rapid pace. Raina stays back, pats it into the covers and sets off"
"flighted on the pads, McCullum doesn't seem to be reading him off the hand. Tentative push forward and a wristy flick through square leg"
"shortish and outside off, pulled away to deep midwicket"
"well bowled, Abdulla! Saw Raina coming down, pulled his length back and did not allow the room to free the arms. Big old hoick over midwicket - a shot that Raina loves - is foiled"
stays back and dabs the flatter ball through the covers
width on offer and McCullum slashes it to the sweeper. Has a few words of advice to Raina before he can take strike
"comes down, but can't get under the flatter delivery on leg stump, so Raina simply turns it to deep midwicket for a single"
"goes back, gets on top of a shortish delivery and forces it to long-on"
"bisects deep midwicket and deep square leg, Kohli is the fetching the ball off the boundary. Didn't look happy. Full toss, it was too."
"that should cheer the RCB captain up. Was it the chinaman's googly? Yes it was. And McCullum hadn't picked it. He was closing the face of the bat, and the leading edge pops up so Shamsi can complete the catch himself. And then celebrates it with a jig. Dee Jay's got some competition here, fellows."
"there's evidence straight away. Picks the googly outside off, goes back and punches to cover"
"another googly, DK waits on it and guides the ball to backward point. Raina was haring out of his crease for a run, but is sent back and he is hit by the throw coming in. Didn't change the direction of his running, so no appeal. Of course, had he not been hit by the ball, he may well have been run out."
steered towards point
"tossed up on off stump, defended. Lovely control of flight from Shamsi that over."
"back of a length and just outside off, 'yes, yes, yes, yes,' says Raina after dabbing it in front of point"
"fuller ball outside off, driven to cover where Kohli prevents the single"
"lovely batting! Just the way he waited on the ball to find the gap behind point. Then he imbues enough power on the short to beat third man on the boundary. Course, it was a short ball outside off and had to be put away"
falls safe between the sweeper and the cover running back as Karthik plays a swat off the back foot after he is surprised by the bouncer! Watson is getting the ball to misbehave like kids when the teacher goes out.
comes down the track and tucks a slower ball on leg stump to deep midwicket
"fuller delivery on off stump, pushed back at the bowler and though Watson misfields, he does recover quick enough to prevent the single"
closes the face against the googly and the leading edge wanders away to short third man
"another one that goes away, Karthik steers it to point. Seems to be a run-out chance, the fielders yell 'bowler' to help point out, but he had slipped and by the time he recovered and threw, Raina was safe"
flicks a flighted ball on middle to deep midwicket
"smeared down the ground! He took the risk. He felt he had to, with the running, now he hits the chinaman bowler back over his head after running at him"
"bit appeal for lbw, it was the wrong 'un. Raina was haring down the wicket as well and he lost all his shape slogging at the ball. He did that because he wasn't to the pitch and panicked not knowing which way the ball would turn. Comes into him, hits the back pad, but because he was so far down, he was safe from the lbw"
"shaping to cut, but Shamsi bowls it flatter and gets some turn to refuse the room Karthik wanted. Lovely, lovely over!"
shimmies down to the fast bowler and meets the short ball on middle through midwicket
"slower ball forces Raina's timing to desert him. Stands and delivers a slog on middle and leg, gets an inside edge to square leg"
"well played, Karthik. Swayed his body away from the line of a shortish ball in the off stump corridor and late cuts"
"goes for the heave, but the ball doesn't come onto him. Mistimed to long-off. Lots and lots of slower balls from RCB"
"top shot! Timed well enough to beat de Villiers at long-off. He had to run to his right, dive as well but he was never going to pull this on-the-up drive back. Richardson's top pace does not work"
"moves around the stumps, slides down leg."
"slower ball to round it off, Raina works it off his hips to deep square leg"
"shortish and outside off, cut off the bottom of the bat and they get across for a single. Shouldn't have been so easy. Watson was the culprit"
"good length ball outside off, stands tall and drives on the up through the covers."
"'Watto,' is the yell, but he still can't stop the single. Raina cuts and runs. They're picking on him"
"good work from Karthik again, waits on the shortish delivery outside off and guides it well behind point which gives Richardson a lot of work to do"
"back of a length and outside off, DK punches to long-off"
"down the track and driven gently through the covers, deliberate work to make sure he gets two. Both teams have adjusted to a large outfield very well. Taking twos instead of blindly hitting out. That brings us to another time out."
"offcutter, length pulled back to make sure DK coming at him doesn't get the leverage he wanted. Inside edge onto pad and Raina takes the opportunity for a quick single"
"goes for a yorker on off stump, Raina clips it to square leg"
strides forward and drives on the up to long-off.
"finds the gap! Raina's timing has been exquisite the last two matches. More so is his composure, and shot selection. Relatively bad ball from Watson, half-volley on the pads, but the ease with which he picked it away was striking"
shuffles across and takes a ball on middle to find a single to square leg. Would have been lbw had he missed the ball. Watson knew it
"another offcutter at a fullish length, Karthik steers it to point and runs with the shot"
"starts with an 88 kph length ball on off stump, slog sweep to deep square leg"
"<b>run-out chance</b>! Raina had gone back and cut towards point, but it's not Watto there anymore. Karthik had hared down the pitch, and has to hare back. The throw comes to Shamsi, he takes it low and underarms it at the stumps. Direct hit, but not out"
"quicker delivery! Does Raina in. It went right over the wide line, and a little too quickly for the late cut that he was looking for"
swept to short fine leg
there's the leading edge again - just like how Shamsi dismissed McCullum - but this time DK is lucky enough that the ball travels high and far enough past the bowler's left. Superb googly
goes back and flicks a shortish delivery through to deep square leg. Another couple. Good work from Lions. They've handled one danger well enough. Still Watto left
lifted over cover to bring up the fifty partnership. Raina did well to reach that far as Chahal looped the ball wide of off stump to try and stump the batsman
"short ball, slapped to the deep cover fielder who fumbles a bit to allow an easy two"
"that's quicker, and fuller and it turns as well. Karthik does well to keep his base and push through the covers. Didn't work against the turn even if the innings is reaching its end"
"too high, not long enough. RCB will be thrilled! Raina walks off, looking at the bottom of his bat, because that's where he made contact. Yuzi does well to drift this ball outside off and ruin the batsman's balance. Raina was reaching, and he didn't pull out of the loft. Mistimed shot lands safely in long-off's hands"
"shortish on middle and off, picked away through mdiwicket"
"shortish and outside off, cut away to deep cover"
"pushed through outside off, Jaddu lets it go hoping it would be wide. No luck"
that's the longest hit of the evening! Jaddu gets down low and slog sweeps it way over midwicket. The big screen yells 'SIR JADEJA'
"well bowled, Abdulla. He's bowling into the left-hander, who was going for the slog. Brave to toss it up and beat him outside off"
"this is the flatter ball on leg stump, turned to deep square leg"
perhaps he preempted the batsman running down at him. Fires in a wide delivery and Karthik does not play a shot
picked away to deep midwicket for a couple. Raina claps with gusto from the dressing room
flicked to long-on and they pinch a second again! Jaddu is freakishly quick
"low full toss, pushed to cover for a single"
"<b>dropped</b> by the bowler! It's the back-of-the-hand slower ball, deceived Karthik who was driving on the up and did not time it at all. Came at a decent height, but just didn't stick"
"shortish and outside off, Karhik backed away and dabs it to short third man. Shamsi there dives to his left and keeps it to a single."
"lovely hit to long-off, but that actually works against him. Kohli hares in from the boundary and it is only one"
"de Villiers saves the boundary at extra cover! Beautiful shot from DK, came down the track, took it on the full and sliced it past the extra cover fielder's left. AB is rapid enough, puts in a dive and does well"
"that's his escape shot. The lap sweep, but Richardson had read him well and bowled it quick and back of a length. Came at him too quickly, struck on the body"
"right-hander can do it as well. DK is so good against spin - especially with fine leg up. Shuffled across, goes for the lap sweep, gets under the ball and gets the boundary he wanted"
"into the blockhole on middle, picked away through midwicket"
"low full toss on middle, picked away to deep midwicket. This partnership is becoming more crucial by the ball"
"swept in front of the wicket, and I think that's the second time Jaddu beats AB's arm from long-on"
"swept away over the infield to deep square leg, Jadhav can't send in a flat through and the two becomes easy"
"beats AB at long-on! Raina is up on his feet in the dugout! DK has played a superb innings today. Held himself back in the partnership with his captain, now he's taking over against bowling he likes. Runs down the track, takes it on the full and thumps it straight. The fielder had too far to run to his left"
"shortish and outside off, Jadeja slices it to deep third man. Oh boy, he has overstepped! <b>The next one is a free hit</b>. Checking with the umpire, planting his leg on the line and he doesn't believe it. Fine call though from the umpire, as the replay indicates."
"goes full on off stump, Karthik lifts it to long-off to complete a very important half-century"
"he's called it! That's very very difficult to do. The wide yorker, and put the ball beyond the batsman's reach. Fair call again from Bharatan. Quite far outside that guide line"
"sensational catch from Rahul! Low to his left. Jaddu was simply trying to run the back of a length ball to third man, but the keeper saw him shaping for the shot, kept low and moved nicely towards the ball to take it one-handed"
belted down the ground and Lions win! And Bravo brings out the Champion dance. That's the exclamation point to finish the game. He was able to get underneath a length ball on middle and the full swing of a very straight bat made sure the hosts more or less cruised the chase
