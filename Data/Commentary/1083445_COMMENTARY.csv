"full and moving away from off stump, defended gently back down the pitch"
"touch short and moving away further from the fifth stump. There for the cut, but Dimuth decides to let it go"
gets on top of that length ball and taps it to the man coming in from point
"angles a length ball into middle from wide of the crease, not much movement off the deck on this one, worked to midwicket"
plays a full ball from the crease. Half-heartedly to gully. Should have gone forward to that one
"hint of swing again, Dimuth gets a good stride forward and defends with soft hands. Maiden to start with"
"gets this to angle across the batsman from wide of the crease, left alone"
"plays inside the line and watches the ball nip away and whizz past the shoulder of the bat. Superb seam position, good carry to Mushfiqur"
"lovely, lovely delivery. Floated across at length, just around the off stump channel. Tharanga is unure whether to play or leave. Lets it go in the end"
this time there's much more confidence in the forward defense. Negates the away-going delivery easily.
"nips away off the seam from outside off, touch short as well, Tharanga watches it through to the keeper"
"length ball on middle and leg, tucked to the leg side. Sri Lanka yet to get off the mark"
"that is a jaffa! Dimuth had little clue about that. Feels for the delivery outside off, this one shapes away a wee bit to miss the outside edge by a whisker."
"shuffles across to whip that away off his hip, but the ball came back in a wee bit to hit him high on the thigh pad"
"a touch ahead of length outside off, he defends off the back foot to cover"
hits him high on the pad as he prods half-forward and defends. Once again that in-between length that creates doubts in the batsman's mind
"scoring opportunity missed. Ripe for the picking, he could have just tickled this past the wicketkeeper to fine leg. Wrong line. Looks like he was worried about the delivery that nips away that he missed one that slides in nicely"
"this is full and angling in to middle, there's just a hint of deviation back in. Dimuth is overbalanced as he looks to work it to the leg side and is hit on the pad. It may have missed the stumps. Don't think height was an issue."
"hit on the glove, rolls to square leg as they get off the mark. He played outside the line of that delivery"
stays inside the crease and defends the away-going length ball to the off side
"floated full on middle, once again there's uncertainty in footwork as he looks to defend, rolls off a thick inside edge to midwicket"
appeal for lbw. Shuffles across to work it to the leg side again but the ball pitched outside leg. He was on the move when the ball struck him on the pad
"magnificent delivery. How did that miss the edge? I'm not sure. Looks like he was expecting a length ball, but this i full and nips away late to beat the forward defense."
"second and third slip were way too close for each other. And so it is bound to create confusion. The batsman jabs at at away-going delivery, gets a thick edge that lands short of the cordon and races away to the boundary. They're creating opportunities here"
"full and tails back in late, Tharanga plays with hard hands. This one rolls off the inner half of the bat to square leg"
"this one's a touch fuller in length and just around off, nips back in off the seam to hit him high on the bat as he defends"
"invites the drive by pitching this up outside off, left alone"
gets on top of the bounce and bunts the back of length delivery to gully
beauty of a delivery. This one angles in and swerves away late to square up Tharanga. He must be thanking his stars. Feet glued to the crease as well as he pushed at that
"driven straight down the ground but not off the middle, rolls to mid-on."
"angles a length ball across the batsman, left alone"
"big shout again but the ball pitched way outside leg. He was high on the flap of the pad as well. Mushfiqur was moving down leg, and so is quite sure there was no way that pitched in line. Sensible decision to not review that.  Good call from Aleem Dar"
"pitches this up on middle and leg, he gets forward and defends to the leg side. The bat face turned in his hand as he played at that"
"thick edge but straight to Sabbir at gully. Much fuller, drawn forward. He played with soft hands this time. Probing stuff"
gets on top of the bounce and tucks the short of length delivery on leg stump to square leg
"much more authority in his forward defense this time, pinged the middle of the bat, but straight to cover."
"angles a full delivery on middle from wide of the crease, he gets forward and defends"
"gets a good stride forward to negate the late movement, defended carefully to short cover"
"picks the length early. This is a touch short, he gets back and bunts the short delivery to point"
"gets forward, shows the full face of the bat and defends the full ball back to the bowler"
"tests the bounce of the surface with a short ball that flies over the batsman's head. It was still going up, up and over even as Mushfiqur leapt high and put out one glove to stop it, but he had no chance. Wides called."
hangs back and defends the full ball on off back to the bowler from the crease. Got it off the inside edge again
"looks to cut but something hinders him from having a proper go at that, bunted gently to point in the end"
"slow turn away from outside off, defended with an opened bat face to point"
"drifting into middle, Tharanga prods forward and blocks that"
"not much turn, this one slides back in. Firm drive to extra cover"
"touch short, but not there for the cut. Tharanga rocks back and defends towards point"
"pushed through quicker on the stumps from wide of the crease, Tharanga plays outside the line and gets an inside edge onto the pad"
"either it's great judgment from Tharanga or a very, very nervous leave. This one drifts back in, pitches just a touch outside off and holds its line. Wasn't far away from off stump. Collective cry of anguish from the wicketkeeper and the close-in fielders. Excellent first over"
plays forward and gets a thick inside edge into the gap at square leg.
"gets a good stride forward, covers the line and defends to short cover"
gets to the pitch of the ball and squeezes the full-length delivery outside off to point
this was on the cards. Mehedi has taken a stunner at gully. Loose drive again from Dimuth; has paid the price for playing well away from the body with an angled bat. It flew off the thick outside edge. Got sucked into a shot he could have well not attempted. Mehedi held on as he landed on his back. Persistence has paid off this morning for Bangladesh.
"delightful seam position, super line and that teasing length. Full, angled away and just a touch outside off, Kusal plays inside the line as he watches the ball zip past the outside edge"
"in the off stump channel, going across the batsman again to bring the three slips into the picture, left alone"
"too short and skidding back in, Tharanga is hit way outside leg. This one hurried on, cramped him for room and hit him on the back leg."
"gets forward and defends with an opened bat face to point. This was bowled much slower through the air, Tharanga had to reach out"
"this one's a touch flatter and quicker, Tharanga defends from the crease, the inside-edge rolls to the off side. Tharanga is looking nervous here."
"too close to cut, goes through with the shot and chops it to point."
"too full this time, punched into the gap at cover. A single that will give Tharanga so much relief"
"first sign of aggression. Mendis has announced himself with a sweep over the infield. Fetched it from off but he was hitting with the turn. Hit very, very well too. One bounce into the deep midwicket boundary. That will surely give Mehedi something to think about"
too full for the cut. <b> There was a click as the ball passed the bat. </b> No reaction from the bowler or keeper.
"a cutter this time and Tharanga climbs into the short ball. Frees his arm and flays that into the gap between point and cover point. Poor ball that deserved to be punished, handled well by Tharanga"
this time he cuts the short ball straight to backward point
"nips back in from length on middle to cramp Tharanga, worked to square leg"
"nothing wrong with the front foot. This is a cutter that is floated at length on middle and leg, there's clearly daylight between bat and pad. He's hit on the pad even as Tharanga was overbalanced. At that instance, leg stump was visible but the ball was was angling down leg and would have missed the stumps. <b> Decision overturned. </b>"
"looks to drop it gently into the off side for a quick single, is nearly halfway down when Kusal sends him back. Gets back in time, the throw from cover was a weak one and didn't hit the stumps either."
turns the incoming delivery to square leg
leans forward and works it with the spin to wide mid-on for an easy single
"drifting in on middle, it's too full as well. Tharanga deadbats it back down the pitch"
"plays outside the line, the inside-edge rolls wide of midwicket as they jog the single"
"the drift has done the trick. The ball dipped on Kusal as he lunged a long way forward but this one held its line. Mushfiqur rode the bounce, collected it cleanly and whipped the bails off. He was a long way forward and foxed by a beauty. Mehedi is pumped. This is a fabulous start by Bangladesh."
"tossed up outside off, he gets forward and defends gently back to the bowler"
"floats this full and across Tharanga, who gets forward and defends to cover"
"this one angles back in to take the thick inside edge and run down to fine leg. Very, very close. Could have been plumb had he missed that"
"firm drive but straight to mid-off. This was too full, not much deviation on the delivery."
gets on top of the bounce and punches the short of length delivery outside off to cover
"skiddy short ball outside off, Chandimal quick to get onto his toes and play with soft hands"
works the short ball on middle and leg to fine leg as they jog the single
"ohooooo, playing for turn when the ball fizzes through straight on. Squared up as the edge rolls wide of gully and they take a single"
"misfield at cover gives away a couple. Shakib the culprit there. No, bad bounce wasn't a reason"
"too short, shapes to cut, chops to point"
driven with the spin to long-off for an easy single
goes onto the back foot and turns the short delivery to the leg side
"pushed to point off the front foot, quick single taken. The fielder was caught napping. Should never have been a single there."
"digs a short ball into middle and leg, way over Chandimal's head for him to fret over that"
"nips away off the seam from the length area outside off, left alone"
punched off the back foot to extra cover. Too short to cause much trouble for Chandimal
"this one's a touch fuller outside off, watched through to the keeper"
"this is a crunching cover drive. Too full, leans into the drive, the elbow nice and high as it comes down. The bat flows in a lovely arc as it flies off the blade and into the gap between cover and mid-off. So good to watch"
gets back and across as he hops back and defends the incoming length ball to mid-on
gets his bat well in front of the pad to keep that in-drifter out
"edged and taken at first slip. He slowed it down beautifully, imparted plenty of revs. The ball dipped on him, spun away to square him up. Tharanga made the mistake of jabbing at that with hard hands, got a thick edge that flew low to Soumya, who got his hands properly underneath the ball to take the catch. Bangladesh on a roll"
gets outside the line of the stumps and defends the full delivery with soft hands
spins back in but Asela is well forward as he smothers the spin
"this one drifts in and straightens, but Asela is behind the line of the delivery in defense"

driven with the spin to mid-off
"looped up nicely outside off, Chandimal is a long way forward as he defends"
"drifts in and skids on, pushed to mid-off"
"not all that short to play the cut, Chandimal chops it to point"
"drifting into the pads, touch of spin away, worked with the angle to mid-on. 'Bhaalo, bhaalo,' yells the skipper"
driven with the spin into the gap between cover and point
"too short on middle and leg, there's a hint of grip off the surface, and so Chandimal carefully defends to the leg side"
lunges forward and blocks
touch short but this one takes a while to get to him. Two-paced? Off the pad to leg slip
"slow turn back into middle and leg, tucked to square leg"
"flatter and fuller on the stumps, Chandimal gets outside the line of the stumps and defends"
gets outside the stumps and sweeps with the spin to deep fine leg
steps out but covers the line of the delivery and nurdles it to square leg for a quick single
gets a good stride forward and defends the tossed up delivery back to the bowler
"pushes outside the line of the delivery, the ball skids back into roll off a thick inside edge"
went for a full-blooded sweep but quickly changed his stroke the moment he saw the ball fired in. Squeezed to cover
"grip and turn from middle, adjusts late and defends"
"ohhhoooooo, plenty happening. Full on the stumps, he's caught on the crease as he defends that in-drifter. Gripped the surface and hit him high on the bat."
"played inside the line. The ball drifted in, skid on and took the outer half of the bat. Absorbing stuff. The batsman forced to guess which one will grip, which one goes on"

gets on top of the bounce and turns the short delivery to square leg
"sharp turn back into middle and leg, played with soft hands towards where short fine leg would be"
"fuller and flatter outside off, he lunges forward and defends"
"on the pads, worked with the spin to the left of Shakib at square leg, quick single taken"
"top-edges a sweep but races into the fine leg boundary. There was no one round the corner. Sabbir ran around from slip to get to the ball, but couldn't. Extra bounce on that delivery, but just about enough bat on it on that occasion"
driven with the spin to cover
"too short, stays inside the crease and punches the short ball to cover"
"slow turn from outside off, he drops it to the man coming in from point and scampers across for a quick single"
""

"drawn forward, he gets a thick edge to backward point"
"touch short, gets back and on top of the bounce as he eases it into the off side for an easy single"

"drawn forward by the flight, bunted to cover"

goes back into the crease to punch to cover
"this one is too full and skids on, defended gently"
"cleverly done. Gets outside the line of the stumps, uses the pace of the bowler and paddles with the turn to the fine leg boundary. Eliminating the risk and then rolling the wrist to good effect. Nicely done"
"leading edge but rolls to point, quick single taken"
pads away a full ball fired outside off
"cuts and misses. This one fizzes off the surface from outside off, didn't miss the edge by much"
gets forward and outside the line as he keeps out the quicker delivery
"no stroke offered again, pads away but struck way outside the line. Wouldn't have done enough to hit the stumps though"
"big mix-up. Chandi wanted the single, Asela wasn't keen. Lucky escape. The cover fielder swooped in quickly but was off balance as he threw to the keeper's end. No damage done in the end. Good work from Bangladesh"
leading edge but rolls to the off side. Played inside the line
driven with the spin to cover
"drifting in from wide of the crease, worked with the angle to midwicket for a quick single"
"drifts in and slides past the pad, Mushfiq was blinded and so can't collect cleanly, they sneak through for a bye"

"width, too full and crashed into the cover region. Just about pulled back in by Mustafizur."
"punched from outside off towards mid-on, hurrying Sabbir who fires a throw at the bowler's end. Comfortably in"
"too full and way outside off, and he's smashed that into the cover point boundary. Too full for the ball to really turn and fizz. Lovely timing"
gets outside the line of off stump and defends back down the pitch with soft hands
"once again too full, he gets a good stride in to keep that out"
"slow turn into middle and leg, worked into the gap at midwicket"

"hits the deck hard and gets this to lift off the deck from length on off, Asela's back hand comes off the handle as he gets on top of the bounce and defends"
solidly behind the line of that length ball on middle as he keeps that out
gets a thick inside edge onto his boot. Asela seems to be in some pain. <b> He's smashed it onto his toe. </b> That will hurt.
"big, big wicket at the stroke of lunch. This is angled in full from wide of the crease at 136 clicks, Gunaratne makes the cardinal sin of playing all around it rather than try and ease it to mid-on. He knew the moment he was hit on the pad that it was plumb. He didn't even bother referring it upstairs. Moments of inspiration like these can lift an entire side."
gets half-forward and bunts the length ball to the off side

"banged in short from wide of the crease, nurdled to midwicket for a quick single"
nicely punched down the ground. Gets to the pitch of the ball and eases it into the gap at mid-off
"short delivery outside off, Chandimal sways out of the way and watches the ball zip through"
"was there an inside-edge? This is a ripper of a delivery that sneaks through a big, big hap between bat and pad. Even if there was, it must have been a very faint one. But it didn't matter. Mushfiqur didn't collect it. Replays confirm it deflected off the back leg, so no potential damage anyway."
lets this rip at 140kph. The ball jags back in late to hit him high on the thigh pad. Chandimal late on the shot

"pushed through a lot quicker outside off, bunted to the off side"
"eased into the gap between cover and point. Too full, Chandimal pressed forward and caressed that nicely"

"gets this to jag back in from the short of length area outside off, defended back down the pitch with soft hands"
"plays down the wrong line again. Short of length and coming back in, Chandimal stabs at the delivery with a degree of uncertainty. Rolls off an inside edge"
"much more authority and confidence in his forward defense, eased to cover"
"slow turn from middle and off, punched to cover where a misfield allos the single. Mehedi, the fielder in question"
"full and drifting into middle, defended back to the bowler"
"drawn forward by the length, covers the line properly and defends"
"no, they decide against it. Chandimal looks to sweep, but this was too full for him to attempt. Hit on the elbow. May have been struck outside the line. Close call. Yes, replays confirm the ball would have missed the stumps as well"
gets a good stride forward and smothers the spin
"rocks back, makes room and cuts the short delivery to deep cover"
fetches the pull from outside off towards deep square
"short outside off, way over the batsman's head for him to be bothered by it"
"commits himself forward, the ball reverses back in late from outside off, but it doesn't matter. Defended back towards the bowler"
"fails to account for the late inward movement. Tails back in to deflect off the inside edge onto the pad and boot. This is a superb spell so far. Very, very impressive."
"length ball on middle, defended back down the pitch"
"on a length, angling in to middle and off, defended"

"tries to push the batsman back with a short ball. Chandimal goes back deep into the crease, gets on top of the bounce and plays it back down the pitch with soft hands"
"this is much fuller, Chandimal was expecting it to be short and didn't commit himself forward. Ended up defending with minimal feet movement."
"a direct hit at the bowler's end and Chandimal would've been walking back to the shower. Too risky a single to mid-off. Shakib came in quickly and fired the throw. Chandimal was running diagonally. Not very good, but gets away this time"
"short of length on middle, defended with a dead bat"
"this one cuts back in but the length is too short, carefully defended off the back foot"

the ball skids back in to take a thick inside edge and roll behind square on the leg side
"tossed up on middle, Chandimal stretches forward and defends to cover"
"nowhere near the pitch of the ball as he steps out, slices it wide of cover. Lucky break. The ball spun away late. Could have so easily gone down the throat of the point fielder. Shakib saw him coming and slowed it down."

"gets forward, covers the line of the delivery and blocks"
"drifts in but skids straight on from outside off, pushed to cover"

"off-cutter this time angled across the batsman, who shoulders arms"
"angles a short of length delivery across the batsman, who lets it go again"
"the ball drifts back in from around the stumps, beats the inside edge and deflects off the pad to the slip fielder. They went up immediately. Looked like a call for lbw initially, but the angle would have definitely taken it down leg. The slip fielder then appealed again, for a deflection off the inside edge. That's what they went up for. Number of replays later, Marais Erasmus cannot ascertain there was any inside edge. <b> The original decision has been overturned. </b> Chandimal survives."
"too full on off, Chandimal stretches forward and blocks"
"driven inside-out to mid-off, a misfield results in a second work. Good work by Roy in getting to the ball but couldn' quite recover in time to hurl the throw"
makes a bit of room and punches the short ball past cover
"touch short, solid punch off the back foot to cover"
"whipped into the midwicket boundary. Not all that short, he used the depth of the crease and then brought his wrist out and across to unfurl it and pick the gap. Lovely from a young batsman wanting to prove his side did the right thing by giving him an opportunity here"

eased back down the pitch to the bowler
"delicate little reverse paddle. Changed the bat grip, got outside the line of the stumps and played it against the spin. It didn't matter to him that there was a slip in place. Ah, the fearlessness of youth."
punched into the gap between cover and point. Nice timing
gets to the pitch of the ball and works it with the spin into the gap at square lg
swept and swept really well. Hit flat and hard to the man at deep backward square leg. Risk-free because he was negating the lbw threat by going well outside the line of off to play it
"slower and fuller on off, squeezed back to the bowler"
worked off the pad to midwicket
"floats this full and across the batsman, who gets forward and across as he defends"

tossed up over the batsman's eyeline but Chandimal isn't lured by that and simply gets forward to smother the spin
leans forward and bunts the full delivery to cover
beaten for pace. It wasn't all the wide as well for him to use the pace and ease it behind point. Through to the keeper. Not far away from the edge
gets forward and across as he keeps the off-cutter out
"way too full on middle from around the stumps, covers the line and blocks it back using the full face of the bat"
"once again the cutter that  he's famous for, too full and so it's easy for Dhananjaya so simply press forward and keep that delivery out"
"pulled, not entirely convincing but into the gap at fine leg. Kept floating it away and then dug this one in short. Dhananjaya was sucked into the pull but only managed to top-edge that. Fine leg was too square. Lucky break for the batsman."
"slower and fuller outside off, left alone"
"too full on middle, defended back to the bowler"
"slowed it down nicely, the ball drifted in and came in with the angle to roll off the inside edge to short leg"
"Chandimal was living dangerously, went to sweep that from outside the line but only managed to get a top edge. The man at fine leg ran in a long way, the ball was dying on him but he kept his eyes on the ball, tried to get his hands underneath the ball and pull off a stunner, or nearly one. Benefit of multiple replays may not be enough to overturn that decision. Too much doubt, the ball may have just dipped into the turf as well. Who would want to be the third umpire for a decision like this? Tough, tough decision to make but take nothing away from Mehedi's effort."

"loopy delivery on middle, he stretches forward and eases it back to the bowler"
"touch of width, played wide of point to end an eventful over"

gets back and across as he defends the back of length delivery to short midwicket
appeal for lbw but he was a long way down the pitch. Didn't get to the pitch of the ball but stabbed it away with the pad.
"relief for Bangladesh! Looked to pull but this wasn't all that short for him to attempt that stroke. The ball kept a touch low and he ended up playing all over it. Beaten on the length, I'd say. The ball skidded through as well and in the end hit middle and leg. Wicket against the run of play, Bangladesh really needed that."
fierce sweep down to deep square to get off the mark

"good looking shot - hit back down the ground to the bowler, who picks it up on his followthrough and threatens to fire the throw back to Chandimal"
"digs one in short on off but this one doesn't bounce as much as expected, Chandimal still ducks. On the bounce to the keeper"
"too short and way down leg, avoided without a hassle"
too close to cut. Shaped to play that but this was too full. Good take by Mushfiqur
stretches forward and bunts the full delivery back to the bowler
"risky, risky single. Driven to mid-off, but the good thing is he was already a couple of steps down and so could stretch back in time."
"grip and turn, stays inside the crease and taps it gently"
"slows it down nicely, he lunges forward, opens the bat face ever-so-slightly and defends"
gets forward nicely and eases it back to the bowler
"short, wide. He rocks back, makes room and cracks that behind point. Lovely timing, even better placement."
gets forward and covers the line of the delivery as he defends
"looked to sweep, but missed it completely. This was tossed up from around the stumps and would have certainly gone down leg. Optimistic review from Bangladesh. Mushfiqur was shaking his head even as he asked for the review."
gets half-forward and pushes the tossed up delivery to cover
"chopped to the off side, not all that short to cut"
uses the pace of the bowler and then late cuts it past short third man. Cleverly done
"too full on middle, squeezed back to the bowler"

"tossed up on middle, he gets forward and turns it to the leg side"

worked off the pad towards deep midwicket
"slider back into middle and leg, defended back to the bowler"
"firm push back down the ground, past Shakib, but straight to mid-off"
"too full outside off, squeezed to cover"
starts off with a bouncer way over the batsman's head. Rightly called wide. The line was also way outside off
"this is a delightful stroke, probably even the shot of the day. Picks the length early, gets onto the back foot, on top of the bounce and punches it behind point. Third man was no more than 15 yards away from the ball, but couldn't quite get there. Delightful timing"
"right into the blockhole on middle and off, Dickwella jams his bat down in time to keep that out"
punched into the backward point region as they jog the single
"angling into middle and leg, whipped off his hip to deep square leg"
"rapped on the pad. Hurried into his attempted work off the pads, but the ball pitched way outside leg."
"just short of the keeper. Floats a length ball across the batsman, this one keeps a touch low. Even nipped back in ever-so-slightly to take the inside edge as Dickwella played outside the line. Mushfiqur moved swiftly to his left but was dying on him and managed to stop it on the half-volley."
gets forward and blocks
"drifting into off, driven to cover"
drawn forward by the flight but he gets there and then bunts it to cover

""
"cut away into the gap behind point. Commentator's curse? This is a poor ball. Short and angling away, he uses the width to flay that away"
"full and reversing away from middle, pushed to cover"
"easy pickings. Too full and on the leg stump, he's tickled that into the fine leg boundary. Looked like he was trying to reverse it back in. He's clearly trying too hard here. Full marks, but in the process he may be tiring."
"yorker-length delivery outside off, squeezed to point"
"ball-watching and could have cost them. Chandimal kept looking at the cover fielder, Dickwella was halfway down the pitch when his partner responded. In the end they complete the run. Chandimal didn't even bother grounding the bat and may have been out even though he was inside the crease had that hit"
we may have seen the last of Subashis for the moment. Too full and sliding into the pads and he flicks that imperiously off the pad into the midwicket boundary.
gets forward and outside the line of the stumps as he keeps out that length ball
driven straight to cover
"short and drifting into middle, he makes room and plays the late cut past short third man. Wouldn't have thought it was cheeky had that hit the stumps. Too much risk for two runs"
"this time there's enough width for him to rock back, open the bat face and glide it nicely towards third man. Top work by the fielder. Sabbir the man there"
worked with the angle to square leg. Too flat and on middle and leg on that occasion.
"shapes to sweep, went far too across to ease it with the angle, didn't get any bat on it. There was an appeal for lbw but the ball was sliding down"
"too full on middle, eased to mid-on for a quick single"
"what a poor shot that is. What was he trying to do? Shakib bowls this full on leg stump from around the stumps, Dickwella tries to be too cheeky and looks to reverse sweep that past point. Played too early, missed it completely and saw the ball cannon into the stumps."

eased with the spin to mid-off

"gets this to come back in with the arm from wide of the crease, he gets a long way forward and defends"

"driven with the spin to mid-off, the fielder was caught napping. Tamim Iqbal"
"tossed up over the batsman's eyeline, he gets forward and drives with the spin to cover"
"eased with the spin to mid-off, not for the first time have they chanced a risky single. A direct hit at the bowler's end would have made things interersting"
"he's hit that long, long way. Down to the pitch of the ball, free swing of the arms as he deposits that way over the sightscreen. As straight as it can get."
worked off the pad to midwicket
eased with the spin to mid-of again
stabs forward with the bat well in front of the pad to keep that out
"touch too full on middle, eased to Tamim who is way too deep at mid-off, easy run again. Bangladesh have gone off the boil despite picking up a wicket after tea. All too comfortable for the batsmen at the moment"

"gentle cutter angling away to begin with, left alone"
"full and tailing away late from middle, defended with a straight bat"
firm push down to mid-off
"edged and taken. Mustafizur is all smiles now and why not? Perera chased a wide delivery. It was too full as well, the bat came down at an angle and flew off the edge to second slip. Soumya took it with over his head. Pouched really well"
"this is a ripper of a yorker! Rangana had no clue, lost his bat as he jammed the bat down on middle to prevent hit from hitting the base of leg stump. Can't ask for a better first delivery. Mushfiqur saw the funny side of it"
"the heel is down just in the nick of time. Herath pulled from outside off to midwicket. Chandimal had his back to the fielder as the throw came in, but just about managed to get back in. He tried to take evasive action to avoid the throw but the left foot and the bat was grounded when the stumps were disturbed. Third umpire Erasmus has had a really busy day so far"

toe-ends a cut to the off side
"how has that not hit the stumps? Rangana stylishly leaves, only to see the bowler pop his eyes out in disbelief."
"another leave, there's much more conviction in this. Anticipates the ball coming back in from outside off and shoulders arms"
"has he gloved it? Angled into the ribcage, Herath looks to hop across and help it on its way but misses"
"too full on middle, driven down to long-off"
why would you want to risk so much for nothing more than a single? There is deep point in place. Rangana looks to play a reverse sweep and gets a bit of glove and then onto his boot. <b> Decision overturned. </b>

bounce. Bottom hand off the grip as he defends that length ball outside off
"right into the blockhole again, squeezed to cover"

"slow turn back into middle, goes back into the crease and blocks"
"swept with the spin, this hits the boot of the short leg fielder as he tries to take evasive action. <b> Almost parried to short midwicket. </b> Mushfiqur was excited and instinctively shouted 'catch.' Kayes is in some pain and the physio is out to attend to him. There seem to be a lot of swelling on his toe, <b> he's limping off the field </b>"

"fired full on middle from wide of the crease, Tamim plays all around the delivery. There is sound as ball goes past the bat; that's perhaps the bat hitting the ground. Nothing to suggest there's an inside-edge. The next question is was it hitting the stumps? Remember, since the onfield decision is not out, more than half the delivery should hit the stumps. Herath doesn't have to worry this time as the ball is crashing into middle and leg. <b> Aleem Dar's decision is overturned again. </b> They got two reviews wrong, finally Sri Lanka get one spot on."

"fuller and flatter on middle, he lunges forward and defends"
"sliding into middle and leg, he looks to nurdle this fine, but misses. Good take down leg. Strong, strong appeal but they went silent after the umpire's decision. Replays indicate there was some noise as the ball went past the bat. If there was a deflection, it was a minute one."

"the wrong'un has done the trick. What a comeback! Looped this up nicely, the ball breaks back in a wee bit. Soumya was deceived in flight and was sucked into the drive and so didn't account for the turn. The ball beat the inside edge by sneaking through the big gap between bat and pad and cannon into the stumps."

"excellent bouncer, dug in just outside off, Mushfiqur sways out of the way"

"nearly chopped on. The ball reversed away from length, he played from the crease to a delivery he should have been forward"
"gets away with another poor stroke. Fetches a pull from way outside off, top-edges it towards deep square, where Chandimal, coming in, lands on his shoulder. Oh, dear. So much drama. He's holding his left shoulder. But coming back to the shot, how poor can it get from one of the best batsmen in the team?"
"pulled again, this time all along the ground to deep square"

"another short delivery, this one's down leg as well. Once again, Mushfiqur has nothing to do with the delivery"
"two deliveries short, followed by a full ball and the captain is up to the task. Gets a good stride forward and drives on the up past mid-off. Good work by Chandimal to run all the way to pull it back in"

another big appeal for lbw but the ball was sliding down leg and would have missed the stumps. The ball is reversing back in a long way for Lakmal. This one started on middle and was going further down. Mushfiqur was clearly beaten for pace in attempting to flick
super stroke! Overpitched outside off and that has been driven into the gap at cover. The ball picks up pace as it rolls towards the boundary. Sweet
"gets this to nip back in from off stump at length, tapped to the leg side"
"full and angling in from wide of the crease, squeezed to mid-on. Mushfiqur nearly yorked himself"

"drifting in from around the stumps, squeezed back to the bowler"
"drifts into middle and leg, Shakib moves to the leg side and then eases it with the turn"

"slow turn from middle, eased to the off side"
"this was too full, Mushfiqur gets a long way across to sweep. Fortunately for him the ball pitches just as the bat comes down to sweep. Had he been hit on the full, the trajectory would've been assumed to be straight on. Because it pitched, there is some deviation on this, which saves him in the end.

That should rejuvenate Sri Lanka. Bangaldesh were on the ascendancy"
beaten by a beauty! This one is full and moves away late to whizz past the outside edge
"too full and angling down leg, he misses a flick. Scoring opportunity missed"
drives and misses. Feet nowhere to the pitch of the ball as he plays away from the body. Nerves? Surely has to be. Shakib goes up to have a word with him

"fired full on middle from around the stumps, turned to the leg side"
"lucky to get away with that shot again. Another pull, once again in the air for a long time, but Sandakan at deep square wasn't on the ropes. Had he been there, it would have been straight down his throat. Here, he was running backwards and was never in position to catch. Hit really well, but you have to wonder if it is worth the risk?"
"floated full outside off, driven firmly to cover"
toe-ends an attempted drive back to the bowler

"gorgeous! What is he doing batting at No.8? This is just an extension of his forward defense. Played it on the up and managed to caress the ball superbly between cover and point. Lovely timing, better placement. Opened the bat face ever-so-slightly to find the gap."
"compulsive pull this time, just short of Sandakan coming in from deep square. He was in no position to take the catch. Picked it up really late. Stuttered to his left and then came forward. Difficult catch, got to laud him for the effort nevertheless. Had the risk of injuring his jaw."

"it's the wrong'un, Sandakan fails to pick the variation, sticks the bat out and gets beaten"
"and there it is - <b>the hundred</b>. Flighted and sliding in on leg stump, gets down to sweep and works it fine. Shakib runs into an embrace from his team-mate and soaks in a well-deserved applause from the dugout. How he began yesterday and how he has changed the complexion of this Test."

Looked to clear mid-on but ended up being a flat hit there to Chandimal, who took it really well - hands facing the sky and then fell backwards along with the momentum. This was drilled hard, and credit to the catcher. Shakib has to drag himself off the field, he knows the timing of this dismissal was very poor."

Direct hit was needed but it misses. Could have been close. And they get the single anyway off the overthrow. Sabbir was the fielder with the throw
"on a length, defended from the crease to short leg"

"good length ball, stays in the crease to defend it"
"full and shaping away late, left alone"
"oh, beauty! <b>The bowler goes up in a late appeal</b>, after seeing the fielders behind excited. They have asked for a review for a caught-behind. Fuller ball, angling in, Mendis plays the angle but the ball straightens after pitching and goes to the wicketkeeper as the batsman sticks the blade out. The third umpire has a long hard look and deduces that there is a noise. It still seems touch and go but the on-field decision has been overturned. Not entirely sure if it is conclusive evidence, however"

"sensational bowling. Herath has used the 1-2 to get rid of Sarkar. The previous one he was undone in flight and loop. So he thinks he needs to attack. He runs down to a flatter delivery. Sarkar isn't close to the pitch because Herath is wily enough to realise that the length needs to be shorter. Sarkar goes through with the shot and gets a leading edge which is well held by long-off running in. SL draw blood, Herath using all his experience"
"edged and gone. Herath is on fire. What a display of spin bowling. Just terrific. This one is flat and quick outside off. Kayes, sitting in the pavilion would have been seeing the ball turn. So he gets forward and plays for some, but there is none. He gets a thick outside edge which is sharply taken by slip to his right. Another beautifully executed trick of spin bowling."

The off bail is tipped off. Looks like <b>Shakib has played on</b>. Or did the bail get dislodged via a deflection off Dickwella's pad? The on-field umpires refer it to the TV umpire. Drama at the P Sara. Short but this is too close to off to cut. Shakib attempts a forcing cut and chops it back onto the off stump off the bottom edge. The bail falls. The ball grazes the pad of Dickwella and rolls behind. Can Sri Lanka pull off a Houdini act?
