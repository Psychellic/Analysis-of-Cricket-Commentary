beautifully done. Goes for an expansive drive but this one spins away a mile and comfortably beats the outside edge of the flashing blade.

comes forward to this fuller ball that is sliding in and pushes it down to long-off
"floated up outside off, driven off the front foot to covers and McCullum at short cover is at it again, flings himself to his left and stops it"

Kamran's foot is outside the crease as the keeper was collecting the bails and he tries to land the foot entirely but it seems as though no part of the shoe is behind the line.

cuts this shorter ball i front of point and they set off for a quick single. The ball is picked up and a direct throw is fired at the bowler's end. They take the overthrow off the ricochet and there is another throw at the keeper's end that narrowly misses the stumps. Could have been gone there if a direct throw was fired
Samuels' painful stay comes to an end. Narine gets one to skid in and Samuels is looking to force it through the off side. Neither forward nor back and ends up making a weal attempt at a cut shot from too close to the body. He misses as the ball crashes into the stumps

"Run out chance and it is referred upstairs. And that's gone. Afridi is well short of the crease and the big scoreen flashes the big three red letters much to the dismay of the crowd. Coming to the delivery, it was a fuller ball outside off and Shakib slices it over the backward point region. The ball drops short of the third man boundary and Afridi calls for a third but cannot make it back as the wicketkeeper collects the throw and takes the bails off"

full ball and Shakib tries to loft it down the ground. Gets a lot of elevation but not the desired distance as there is not much pace on that delivery. Umar Akmal at long-on settles under it and snaffles it
flicked uppishly into the leg side and the ball goes on the bounce towards the deep square leg fielder running to his left

looks to hit through the leg side but is beaten by pace and wears it on the thigh pad
"comes down the track and looks to go big over the off-side, gets a healthy outside edge and the ball goes on the bounce to the fielder at third man who runs to his right and fields it"

"fired full on off, gets down and sweeps through square leg"
comes down the track and meets the pitch of the ball before crunching it down the ground for a straight boundary. The ball goes over the long-on boundary on the bounce
drags the length back and fires this on leg stump. Overcompensates with the length and it is pulled away through the fine leg region
"oh, dear. Long-on came up to mid-on and the batsman steps down the track and lofts this cleanly over the fielder who is inside the circle. Comes down early and flicks it straight down the ground. Not much turn on the ball and he is able to easily loft it"
"backs away to this short ball, waits for this one to spin and come on to him before knocking it through covers"

"short ball, mistimes the pull to square leg as it hit the high part of the bat"
"short ball, tries to pull it away but it is pushed across the left-hander and the angle makes it hard for him to make contact as he went at it with his feet rooted to the crease"
"this time he backs away and tries to pull. It's not as wide this time, in fact too close to pull and hence he makes no contact"
backs away and responds with a pull shot to this short ball but he mistimes it and chops towards wide mid-on
finally makes proper connection on the pull shot. Sits up nicely for Delport and he rolls his wrists over it as the ball runs away into the deep backward square leg boundary
"well, well, that is some brave bowling. Persists with the short ball and it fetches him reward. He saw Delport taking his eyes off the previous ball late into the shot and probably had the feeling he was not as comfortable against the short ball. So he bangs one in and Delport came down the track and looked to pull. Skies it off the top edge and the wicketkeeper and bowler converge. Hasan says mine and takes a superbly-judged catch. That stayed up for a long time and he did well to get under it"
"tossed up on leg, pushed back to the bowler"
chipped straight down the throat of long-on and Zaman falls for a second-ball duck as Hafeez strikes almost immediately after being brought in. He came down the track and lofted it but did not get hold of it. Cannot clear the boundary as it goes to Wahab Riaz who takes it comfortably. And a <b>mild drizzle had begun</b> even as Zaman is walking off
tries to come forward and flick this away into the leg side but skews it off the leading edge to backward point
"yes-and-no and McCullum is back, seems like. Umar came forward and pushed it straight to mid-on. Umar calls McCullum for a run and realises he has hit it straight to the fielder and sends back his captain. All the fielder needed to do was fire a direct hit and he does it superbly and McCullum is a mile out"
stays in the crease and turns it away to the midwicket region
"fuller, clipped off the pads between midwicket and mid-on"
"traps him in front and that looked close. Umpire raises his finger and Umar Akmal is on his way back. Just like that four wickets have gone, for the addition of just one run. It was a loopy delivery from Shakib, comes on with the arm on middle and leg channel. It does not turn much and comes on with the arm. Umar was playing for the turn and the ball beats his inside edge and strikes him on the pad. Boy are Lahore unravelling here"
"sliding in with the arm again and this one spins a lot more, goes off the outer part of the bat as the batsman comes forward to defend and goes into the off side"
defended into the covers
"looks plumb and gone again. Elliott came forward to play this one but the ball again comes on with the arm and hits him below the shin. That was a lot more plumb than the earlier one. Seemed to be hitting in line with middle. And the <b>rain has arrived again</b>. They are continuing for now, though"
"<b>stumping chance, referred upstairs</b>. Narine comes forward and expects it to spin. But it does not and he gets beaten as the ball comes on straight and beats the outside edge. The backfoot did not come off and he is safe"

"short, wide, backs away to make room and cuts through covers, gets it to the left of the fielder there"
stays back to this length ball and defends off the inner part of the bat

"absolute peach from Hafeez. Takes the outside edge. Length ball, Rizwan is forward looking to play for the turn. But it straightens and goes the other way, takes the outside edge, hits him on the back pad and that is a smart, sharp catch by the keeper. Came on to him quickly and he did well to close his hands around it"

blocked into the off side
comes forward and pushes it off the front foot to long-off
"stays in the crease and tucks it away into the leg side, through the square leg region"
"shot. Pitched up outside off, offers up enough width for the batsman to free his arms and in the slot for Yamin as he opens up his arms and crunches it straight down the ground. Heaves it muscularly and that goes clean and some distance into the stands"
comes down the track and lofts this after getting on top of it straight down the ground as the ball goes on the bounce and over the boundary
pitched up generously and Narine comes down the track to get on top of it before crashing it straight down the ground again. This time the connection is even sweeter and as is the result as the ball crashes into the sightscreen
"flat ball, worked to long-off"
comes down the track and Hafeez does well to drag the length back forcing the batsman to defend it
switches back to a fullish length and this one's heading down leg after being tossed up. Yamin gets down to slog sweep and the ball goes over deep square leg
slog sweep again and this time the ball goes to the deep backward square leg fielder as he does not make as good connection

"short and wide, backs away and cuts but Maqsood at backward point makes a brilliant diving save. Slight mix-up in the middle but they get back safely"
"full and angling in and Narine superbly picks it up off the toes and flicks it away behind square. Asghar at deep backward square leg runs across and dives to his left, just in front of the ropes, to make a stop. They go upstairs to check and he has done fine there"
gets it off the outside edge to third man and Tamim Iqbal fails to stop it entirely. Dived to his right and got his hands to it but the ball rolled away with the momentum after he tried stopping it
opens him up with a length ball in the corridor of uncertainty and Narine is beaten as he sticks his bat out. All squared up
and the entertaining partnership comes to an end. You just got the feeling if nLahore were wresting back the momentum and Wahab has struck. Short of a length ball does the trick as Narine tries to get the front leg out the way and pull it. But not enough room to play the shot convincingly as you can see from the stifled follow-through and deep square leg takes the catch
"short of good length, defended off the backfoot"

pushes this on off and Yasir gets forward to block
"length ball, tucked wide of square leg for a quick single"
"floats it up and pushes it across the left-hander, drilled down to long-off"

superb dipping yorker on middle and leg. That looked like a full toss right till the end and Tanvir jams the bat down. Gets an inside edge that goes to the right of the keeper who dives to his right and stops. That was a fantastic yorker
"full, wide, yorker again, Tanvir fails to squeeze it out through the off side as he jams the bat down. Nice mixing up of length from Wahab"
"goes for the slow, dipping yorker again but fires a full toss that is whipped away between deep midwicket and long-on. What an over from Wahab. Just two off it"
"that's a mile into the stands at long-on. Full, wide, and Tanvir fetches it from way outside off. Drags it over long-on and it has sailed comfortably into the bottom-tier. Can Tanvir do something special here? He's striking the ball well here"

"fuller on off, goes for a drive and bottom-edges it to the keeper. Got that off the toe end"

"full and wide, works a late angle away from the left-hander, and Tanvir drills it to mid-off"
short of good length and wide outside off. Yasir flays it with a flat bat through mid-ff and Sammy runs back and puts in a vigorous dive. Could have hurt himself as he landed on his wrist there. The ball goes across the ropes nonetheless
"short ball, fetches a pull from outside off and he has got hold of this one nicely. The ball sails comfortably over deep midwicket. And that brings up the <b>fifty of the partnership</b>"
"stays rooted to the crease and swings wildly at this delivery anging away outside off, makes no connection"
"full toss, flicked off the pads straight to deep midwicket"
gets down to slog sweep and does not get any elevation as the ball goes along the ground. The fielder running across from deep midwicket slides with his foot forward instead of diving with his arms outstretched and the ball goes past the boundary
"advances down the track to slog and misses the ball altogether. Kamran whips the bails off in a flash. That was quick from Afridi and Yasir was beaten by pace. Nice hand, though"
chips this in the air to well to the right of the bowler and the ball goes towards mid-on
"what a catch that is from Sammy! He is not sure though and they have to refer that upstairs. Seems like he has hurt his fingers too slightly. . Slogs it from the crease and Sammy runs in and dives forward at long-on. Seems like he has his fingers underneath it but it is touch and go. Not out is the call. It was not convincing and the umpire, not being 100 percent sure, does not give it"
"short ball, gets big on him and he responds with a hurried pull as the ball goes through midwicket"
