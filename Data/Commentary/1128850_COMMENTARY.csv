"short of good length, angles across, fends it away off the outside of the bat towards third man"
"short of good length, drifts away prodigiously outside off and leaves him squared up and beaten"

"short, pulls from the confines of the crease to deep midwicket"
"short of a length, pitching outside leg, nudged into the on side"
"slightly skewed, goes away for six. Gets it well over long-off. Gets the front leg out and doesn't quite hold his shape as he smacks this down the ground but effective"

"short around the sixth-stump channel, opens up for a cut without making enough room and chops it into the surface"
he's mistimed almost everything tonight but this one goes for six nonetheless. Comes down the track and slashes hard and the ball is shortish and goes off the top of the bat over third man
"slower short ball, another mistimed attempt at a pull and gets beaten"
"slower full ball outside off, worked to point as he waits and opens the face"
advances down the ground to force a cut and finds point
"short of a length, not quite enough room to free up his arms and he whacks it through deep midwicket haphazardly with a flat bat"
"too short, banged in halfway down, and Akmal has all the time to rock back and heave a massive pull over midwicket"
"now he overcompensates poorly with a full gift on the pads, this one's come with a ribbon tied around and it, and Akmal helps it along to the fine leg boundary"
"oh, dear! He's having a nightmare here, Usman Khan. Gets a slower one all horribly wrong, back of a length, down the leg side, and Akmal turns around and pulls past the keeper diving to his left"
"now he switches to a much straighter line but because it's short, all it does is give Akmal enough room to free up for a pull through cow corner"
"he's not learning anything from his mistakes here, Usman Khan. Another short dart, fired in on middle and leg, slapped through square leg fora flat six"
"full around leg stump, flicked through midwicket. Twenty-five off the over. Big, big one for Zalmi"
"length ball with some width, opens the face to third man"
finally Fletcher makes decent connection on one. Steps down the track to a back of a length delivery and thumps him over mid-off with a half-angled bat
"shortish and slower, chops a cut to point"
"slower full ball outside off, steered to short third man"
"comes down the track and drills a drive to long-off, where <b>Amir lets it slip through the hands and legs</b>. Embarrassing gaffe from the skipper, but to be fair to him, it's seriously slippery"
"gentle length ball around middle and off, Fletcher gives himself room and carts it straight over for a tremendous six!"
"short and spinning away, and he's cut it past the point fielder diving to his left"
gets down to slog a length ball but it slides in with the arm to go to short fine leg off the inside edge

"flattish, steps down the track and slices this fuller one off the toe-end of the bat over long-off"

"short of a length on middle and leg, defended down the pitch"
"shot, huge, huge hit! Every bowler is being taken to the slaughterhouse here by Akmal. Length ball, slogged into outer space over cow corner"
fuller still and bigger still. Curves it in around off and Akmal is sussing out the lengths so early. Another slog over the same region. This is carnage
goes for a repeat but the length is shorter and he inside edges to wide long-on
"shortish outside off, flat-bats it to long-on"
steps down the track and the bowler takes it away from him. Reaches out and slaps it out to sweeper cover
"short of a length, punched to long-on"
"has that been taken cleanly? Oh, yeah! Seems like. Joe Denly with a fine balancing act at the long-on boundary! It needed a moment of brilliance like this to end this stand. Fletcher stepped down the track to a length ball but the delivery follows him. He goes through with the swing and chips it towards the boundary where Denly moves back, snaffles it reverse-cupped and nearly tilts over but manages to just about hold his balance"
"welcome to the crease, Mr. Dawson! Gets a lolly first up, a short one that's been pulled through square leg. The fielder Mills flings himself to his right desperately but the ball gets past him, just about, and has it carried all the way? Seems like it's just bounced before. Oh, hang on, it's given a six. Was dipping, but must have hit the ropes just on the full"
"full, driven to cover"
"short of a length, jumps and flicks to wide long-on"
"back of a length, angling in from outside off, uses the angle by clearing the front leg and thumping it over long-on fir his eighth six"
and he's gone! Finally some respite for Karachi. Tries to slap a short one but gets it slightly off the toe-end as it's a tad out of his reach. Skies it to the cover region where point runs to his right and settles under it
Hafeez tries to cut late but turn and bounce and pace beats him
"pitched up on middle and leg, driven to long-on"
"short and spinning away, flays an uppish cut to sweeper cover"
"advances down the ground, gets to the pitch, lets it turn away and carves it over extra cover"

""
opens the face to third man
"back of a length, slower, he just waits and opens the face for a deft punch through the left of point"
"short, angling in, pulled on the bounce to deep midwicket"
"<b>run out chance, safe!</b> Full and curving in around off, tries to slog and mistimes it to wide long-on. Hafeez has taken off for a second but Dawson is least interested. Hafeez charges back and the throw from the deep catches him on the shoulder and deflects away"
swing and a miss outside off
chips it back tamely. Catching practice for Bopara as a length ball nips in and stops slightly on the surface to mess up the batsman's timing
"short, wide, cut to point"
"shortish, angled across but not giving enough room, slashes and misses"
"width on offer, flays at it and runs it down to third man off the outside of the bat"
"full, down the leg side, tries to flick and misses"
"short around leg stump, pulled gently to midwicket"
reaches out and punches to sweeper cover
"short, gets a top-edge as he tries to pull with no room and lands in front of deep square leg running forward"
"dipping yorker, lands just outside leg as he backs away, and he makes no contact"
"full on leg stump, Sammy backs away and uses those powerful arms to shovel this over cow corner. That was all bottom-hand power. And Usman has overstepped"
"short of good length, down the leg side. Tries to pull and misses as the ball makes contact with pad"
"short ball, slower and drifting away, makes a weak attempt at a pull and manages no contact"
"full on leg stump, again lots of bottom-hand power as he shovels it off the pads. Doesn't find enough elevation or distance as it was too full and he couldn't get underneath it. Deep midwicket runs across, slides to take the catch"
"short of a length, another delivery down the leg side. This is tripe. Got to get your lines right"
"like that. A yorker on middle, squeezed out to the on side. More of those"
"Sammy doesn't get hold of a pull a tall, top-edges it and it lands safely, in the middle of nowhere"
brilliant save at sweeper cover. Sammy backed away to a shorter one and thumped it over point. Sweeper runs across and sticks the left hand out to pull it back even as his foot just about crosses the boundary
gets hurriedly out of the way to let this go down the leg side
""
"short of a length, zero room, weak attempt at a pull results in a top-edge that lands in front of square leg"
"shortish on middle and leg, drags a pull with hard hands to long-on"
"short and wide, swings and misses"
swivels with a pull too early and gets hit on the back shoulder
"fullish length on the stumps, Sammy gets in line, just takes the front leg and just shovels it effortlessly over long-on. Ugly but effective from the skipper"
now he switches to a shorter length and gets a bottom edge on the pull that races away to fine leg
"Sammy attempts another one of his bizarre slaps. Whatever you call it, it's been caught at long-on. It's short and on the stumps and Sammy jumps up from inside the crease and just hoicks at it. Couldn't get entirely on top of it"
"complete miscommunication, results in a wasted wicket. Saad Nasim ends up sacrificing his wicket. He simply stayed at the crease and swung at one angling away from him. Missed and the ball went straight to the keeper. But Wahab was eager to steal a bye and ended up at the striker's end even before Nasim had any idea about what had happened"
what's with this late rush of wickets? It's hurting their finish. Wahab gets a shortish one that has its pace pulled back. Musters all the power he can but his slap only carries as far as long-on running to his right for a simple catch
"dipping fuller one outside off, makes no effort to get behind the line as he swings and misses. They take a bye, however"
"length ball that nips away a touch from outside off, steered to third man"
"opened the bat face late to steer this nicely, beats square third man to the boundary."
uppish but over Sammy's head at wide first slip. <b> Not in control of that at all. </b> Pushed hard at this delivery away from the body. Lucky to get away with that
a half-hearted poke and a miss to a length ball that shapes away from off stump.
"floats this full delivery on the pads, Denly's balance and poise is immaculate as he flicks this to the midwicket boundary. Delightful wrist work"
beaten as he looks to flay this length ball on the up. Zipped through to the keeper.
beaten as he looks to loft this length ball over mid-off. Gets some shape away off the seam
"thick outside edge and this is a sensational catch by Sammy at first slip. Mukhtar's first outing in PSL is a very brief one. He looked to hoick this across the line but only managed a thick edge that flew, Sammy was swift to move to his left and take a sharp catch at face height."
"angled into middle and leg, turned to the leg side"
"squared up by a beauty....<b> almost snaffled by Sammy at slip! </b> Very quickly signalled that he took that on the bounce. Lovely delivery, late movement off the seam from middle"
"steps out, backs away to swing to the leg side but is cramped for room, beaten again."
whipped uppishly towards Dawson at deep square leg
"driven firmly but can't pierce the packed off side ring, straight to cover point"
"zips away from length outside off, Babar plays inside the line as this whizzes through to Kamran Akmal"
has a poke but is beaten by the late movement again.
looks to force this on the up but is beaten by the pace and carry. Kamran takes it above his shoulders. Outstanding bowling

turns this short of length delivery on middle to square leg
whips this length ball towards mid-on where Wahab comes up with a tumbling stop
looks to hoick this across the line but this length ball angles in from wide of the crease and hits him on the body.
banged in short but this is way over the batsman's head. Kamran had to use every bit of his leap to stop that
"clean strike. Magnificent strike. Sashays down the pitch, makes some room and goes over cover. Sailed over the ropes. Would've cleared any boundary in the world."
looks to swing this towards the leg side but Gul cleverly shortens his length and cramps him for room. Beaten
"<b> dropped by Gul off his own bowling </b> but a magnificent effort. This length ball stopped on Denly, who chips it back. Gul did all the hard work in running to his right and diving full stretch to his right on the followthrough but just couldn't hold on."
"steps out and looks to flat-bat this over the bowler's head, misses."
stands tall and punches this short of length delivery to cover
works this down towards deep square as they jog the single
"slower and fuller on off stump, dabbed towards point"
manages to swing this deep into the deep square leg boundary. This was a slower length ball angling in and he just helped this along. Got more elevation but the timing wasn't half as bad as it looked.
"slower and fuller outside off - a bit too predictable, really. Babar holds his shape and slaps this to the point boundary"
"yorker-length outside off, angles in late, Babar beaten as he plays outside the line of this."
"big, big appeal for lbw as Denly is stuck on the pad as he looks to play across the line. They scamper a leg bye. Replays suggest this may have just missed leg stump."
"length on off stump, steers this down to third man"
"big swing, big miss from both the batsman and keeper. This was angling in from wide of the crease, dying on Akmal as he tried to move low to his left. Should've grabbed that"
"length on off stump, chopped down to third man"
plays the short-arm jab towards deep midwicket
"hoicked and this sails over midwicket. Lovely hit, made sweet sound as it made connection with this full delivery. Didn't matter that he dragged it from outside off."

"chops this down to third man, did well to get on top of the bounce"
"play and a miss. Touch fuller and slanting away again, looked to steer this behind point"
"hustled for pace, threw him off balance as he tried to work this square on the leg side. <strong>Denly nearly slipped onto the stumps. </strong> This hit him so close to the box. Ouch"
"off the thigh pad as it deflects to the off side, they scamper a leg bye"
sways out of the way of this short ball outside off
steers this down to square third man for an easy single
backs away to leg stump and then angles his bat to nudge this wide of the keeper to the third man boundary. Kamran may have been influenced by Babar's shimmie towards leg.
"full and straight on off, belted over the bowler's head, long-on comes around to cut that off"
"back of length outside off, steered straight to point"
"thick outside edge that beats third man. Looked to slash this over point, genuine edge but he'll take the runs"

"steps out and swings this length ball down to long-on, can't pick the gap again."

"length outside off, steers this to point, excellent stop"
looks to swing this over long-on but gets a thick outside edge that bounces away past the diving third man fielder. Lucky runs
"belted down the ground, beats mid-off. Wahab goes full but misses the yorker. They're now getting a move-on but is it coming a little too late?"

makes room and glides this short of length delivery to third man
"length on middle and leg, whipped to deep square"
"full and straight on the stumps, squeezed to long-on"

"mistimes a pull towards deep midwicket, backed away and was cramped for room"
"drills this square drive to point and scampers a quick single to bring up his half-century. Applause from the dressing room but a sheepish acknowledgment from Babar. He knows there's a long, long way to go"

"full toss outside off, carved away to deep point"
"full, straight and outside off. Denly is beaten as he looks to slap this over cover."
"goes over the infield, on the bounce to sweeper cover"
"hammered, deep cover wasn't more than 10 metres away but he couldn't get there. Jordan went for a yorker but missed his mark by very little. Is there life in the game yet?"
"superb yorker, jams his bat down in time to keep that out."
"no control of this big hit, sliced towards deep cover."
"backs away to go over cover, but ends up getting a thick inside edge onto his pad off the knuckle ball"
"sits up nicely on middle, he pulls but can't get much power behind that. Down to deep midwicket"
"hoicked straight to deep midwicket. Surely Karachi fans won't be disappointed with that? Hasan Ali will take that into his kitty. Looked to clear his front leg and swing over the ropes, no timing."
"clean strike down the ground to beat long-on, who was running around the ropes to get there. This was slower and fuller, he backed away and belted this superbly."
"beats mid-off. Too full, he backed away and hammered it away off the middle of the bat."
"helped to the fine leg fence. Slower and fuller down leg, looked to swing over square leg but this flew off a thick inside edge past short fine"

"drags this from outside off towards long-on, lovely slower delivery"

"slapped over cover, good strike, clean strike. But this won't do."
pulls this short ball on middle to deep square. <b> Game over. </b> Karachi's hopes extinguished.
"backs away and slaps this short delivery to the wide long-off fence, but it doesn't matter. <b> Sammy roars, Zalmi fans roar. </B> Karachi had two shots at the final and they've failed in both. <b> PSL 2016 champs v PSL 2017 champs to contest the grand finale in 2018 </b>"
