"<b>Warner is off and running with a first-ball four</b>. Overpitched and slanting away outside off with the angle, Warner plunges forward and creams a drive in the gap at the covers"

"fuller and attacking middle stump, Warner inches forward and pokes it towards point to close out the first over"
"<strong>Ooooooh, Finch has been given out lbw by umpire Dharmasena</strong>. Finch reckons he has snicked it? Finch has a word with Warner and challenges the on-field out decision. Archer begins with a full inswinger, Finch is very vulnerable to it, particularly early in his innings. Starts outside off and nips back in towards middle, Finch gets too far across, plays around his front pad, much like how Kohli did yesterday v Boult, and is struck on the flap of the front pad. This is cannoning into middle stump. The tracker returns three reads and off you go for a golden duck in the semi-final, Finch"

"<strong>Nasty, prancing delivery and Warner has been bounced out</strong>. Woakes wheels away in celebration. England could not have asked for a better start to the semi-final. Back of a length and slanting away outside off from over the wicket, explodes from the deck, seams away further. Warner is squared up. He fends at it and tickles it to second slip where YJB grabs a sharp chance in front of his face"
"Woakes bowls the full inswinger now, Handscomb now falls over. Umpire Erasmus shakes his head. England review. Handscomb plays down the wrong line and is rapped on the front pad well above the knee-roll. Reckon height may be a concern here. Impact in line, but the tracker returns umpire's call on leg stump. So, England don't lose their review"
"pitched up and outside off, Handscomb leans out and drives sweetly to extra-cover, the ball bursts out of the fielder's hands. It was captain Morgan, I think"

"pitched up, starts outside off and curves away late, the sort of ball that tempted Rahul yesterday. Smith tucks his bat inside the line and lets it go"

"pitched further up, wobbling away against the angle, Smith judges it well. Nothing doing from him"

"back of a length and homing in at off stump, Handscomb is happy to camp back and pat it towards point"
"back of a length, angling in towards off, tricks Handscomb into playing for the angle but it straightens away at 145ks to beat the outside edge"

"shorter and outside off, Handscomb rides it down to square-ish third man"
"<strong>The nip-backer from Woakes, bursting through the defences of Handscomb</strong>. Nice and full, bends back in towards middle, Handscomb has a loose drive at it, sitting back and leaving enough bat-pad gap for the ball to zip through and rattle the furniture.

"back of a length on middle, Smith gets inside the line and whips it away towards short midwicket"
"back of a length and on a fourth-stump line, defended to the right of cover. <strong>Morgan swoops down on the ball</strong>, but can't throw the stumps down at the bowler's end. Smith dishes out a sprawling dive"
"back of a length on off, punchily driven to the man at mid-off"
"Another nasty, prancing delivery from Archer. <strong>So nasty that it detaches Carey's helmet</strong>. 86mph, Carey looks away, ducks into it, cops it on the chin area, and the helmet flies off. Carey is bleeding and gets some treatment on his chin in the middle. The ball just about bounced over the stumps. Tense faces in the Australia change room. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VNpNtUzjiI' target='_blank'>Remember, Harmison v Ponting</a>?"
"fuller and wobbles away outside off, Smith simply watches it through to the keeper"

"<strong>crunnnnnnnnnnnched between extra-cover and mid-off</strong>. It was overpitched alright, but Carey leans into it and drives it away like a boss. Fetch that"

"driven coming forwards, well struck but Stokes does well to cut it off on the dive at extra cover"
"skips down, flicked leg side... but too well! <b>Picks out deep midwicket on the fence!</b> That's the partnership broken, and it came from a lapse rather than any great delivery, just a wander down the pitch and chipping to the fielder! A shot without due Carey attention and England have their fourth"
"pushed through on off, Smith runs it to backward point"

The ball actually hit the thigh pad, skidding on inside a woolly waft from Stoinis, and after an <I>age</i> Dharmasena's finger went up!
