"close, close, really close. Too full to be playing the sweep. Warner is through with the shot and misses. Hit him on the back leg. Make no mistake, the ball didn't have to travel much. Would've crashed into leg stump, surely? Played all around a leg-stump yorker. Uh-oh, Hawkeye says would have just missed."
"short, he rocks back, makes room and slaps it past cover. Super shot"
"looks to reverse paddle an indrifter on middle and leg, plays it straight to Nair at slip"

"right into the blockhole, Warner jams his bat down in time to keep that out"
"slow turn from middle, he's right back inside the crease as he defends"

"another one on middle and leg, wrists it to Corey Anderson at deep square leg"
looks to biff this across the line but Rabada hits the deck hard at length and hustles Warner for pace. Defends from the crease in the end
chipped but just short of mid-on. Looked to whip this full delivery on middle and off over midwicket
"full, doesn't get underneath the delivery properly but goes through with the shot and just about manages to scoop this over cover. The bat face turned in his hand but the blade is so broad that even the mistimed ones will go"
works a length ball into the gap between midwicket and square leg. Jayant pulls it back in
"sliding into the pads, flicked to Rabada at deep midwicket"

"<b> the switch hit has sailed over the short boundary at deep point. </b> Sees the ball drifting in, changes grip and position in a split second and then sweeps him over like a right-hander"
slaps the pull to deep midwicket. Too short
"steps out and turns one to mid-on where Morris misfields to give away an extra run. Dhawan had to scamper for the first, and that had Morris scrambling in to fire the throw but didn't pick it up cleanly"
<b> Another misfield. </b> This time the cover fielder dives over the ball.
"length outside off, Dhawan uses the width to flay that on the up through cover point. Exquisite timing"
solidly behind the line of the length ball on the stumps
"beaten by a slower one. Gave him the charge too early and looked to go cover, missed the line altogether."
"this is a typical Dhawan heave. Length on middle and leg, Dhawan had made up his mind much before to go through with the swing. Met that off the middle, sailed over deep midwicket."
<B> Jayasuriya-esque. </b> Gets on top of the bounce and uses the width to slap this behind point. Third man had no chance
"full on the pads, flicked into the gap at deep midwicket"

"full toss on leg stump, looks to whip it but once again played too early and got a thin inside-edge onto the pad. Run off the deflection"
"slower and fuller on the pads, worked to deep backward square where Shami is swift to get to the ball and fire a direct hit at the striker's end"
"starts off with a length ball, Warner picked it early and plays a short-arm jab over midwicket. Short boundary, easy pickings"
"takes the off stump out with a rip roaring yorker. Warner backed away to make room and looked to squeeze this behind point but was completely beaten for pace. That was delivered at 141kph. Perfect yorker, Warner was on the move as the ball came in. Relief for Daredevils"
"poor first delivery to a new batsman. Slides a short of length delivery down leg, Kane looks to nurdle this fine but gets it off the pad. Enough pace to beat the keeper."
"turns one to short midwicket and scampers a quick single. Corey Anderson, who was backing up for the throw, misfielded to give away five runs. Shreyas Iyer was the fielder who swooped in quickly and fired a direct hit. <b> Williamson was well in, unnecessary throw. </b>"
"slower length ball on middle and leg, tucked to square leg"

spins back in to beat the inside edge as KW looked to back away and go inside-out over cover
skids back in to hit him on the left pad. Bounce from the deck. Tossed it up nicely as well
"this is a gift of a delivery. Fires a short ball down leg, Williamson is down on one knee as he lifts this over short fine. Carries all the way. Wonder if Jayant anticipated Williamson dancing down the track. 'Was trying to bowl the carrom ball,' he gestures to his captain"
backs away and cuts the short ball straight to cover
"slider across Dhawan, who bunts it to Samson at point"
"<b> The googly has done the trick. </b> Top-edge flies to deep square, where Shreyas Iyer does well to run in from the ropes, maintain his composure and take it running in. Dhawan, for some reason, seemed to hold back as the ball dipped on him, and so couldn't generate the amount of power he would've liked."
"flatter one angling in from wide of the crease, turned to deep midwicket"
"fires full on off, steered wide of point to get off the mark"
punches the short ball outside off to wide long-off
lunges forward and turns the ball from length to the leg side
"deflects one off the pad to midwicket. Pant does the hard work in getting to the ball, but ends up flicking the ball further away even as he looks to fire a throw at the stumps. Comedy of errors"

wrong'un that spins back in sharply to take an inside edge to square leg
squeezes a full delivery back to the bowler
"angles a length ball on middle and leg, played to midwicket"

"right into the blockhole, Yuvraj works it off the pad to deep square"
"makes the cardinal sin of looking to fetch a bouncer from the fifth stump outside off, ends up top-edging it to Morris at deep square leg. Once again the extra pace that Shami brings to the fore has resulted in a breakthrough. Warner's wicket with a super yorker, Williamson's wicket with a bouncer."
"length on middle, defended solidly to cover"
"full on middle, tails away late, Yuvraj plays this down to long-on"

punches a shortish delivery with the spin to long-off
"slider across Yuvraj, who punches it to long-off"
floats a full delivery across Yuvraj. Plants forward and punches to mid-off
"that  is a Yuvraj special! Too full on middle, he was waiting deep inside the crease to showel this back over the bowler's head. Long-on didn't have more than 10 yards to run to his right, but he had no chance"
"picks the bones out of that full delivery on the drive, hit hard to mid-off, who deflects it towards long-on"
"dabs it gently into the gap at cover for a quick single. Yuvraj had to hurry, responded immediately to his partner's call"
thump a full delivery on off to sweeper cover. Sweetly timed
pulled in front of square to Morris at deep midwicket.
"slider on middle and leg, worked behind square on the leg side for a quick single"
fires a short ball way outside off. Perhaps expected Yuvraj to step out
"spins back in from off, driven straight to cover."
"bottom hand, brute force, pure muscle. Full on middle, big back swing of Yuvraj as he drills this to the long-on boundary."

cut away but an excellent stop at backward point to keep it to a single
eased with the spin to long-off
works an incoming length ball towards midwicket
"searches for a leg-stump yorker but ends up missing the mark. Could've been a fine tickle to the boundary, but he played too early and missed."
"this time, Yuvraj does what he missed off the previous delivery. Shortens his length a touch but this is outside leg, Yuvraj deflects this to the fine leg boundary. No chance for the boundary rider, he was too square"
"looks to use the pace and glide this length ball behind point, but played too late this time"
"skiddy length ball on off, punched to long-off"
slower delivery but Henriques can't find the gap. Driven straight to sweeper cover
"has Mathews effected a tumbling stop at deep square? They're checking. Full marks for the effort. Yuvraj cramped for room but he swivels on the pull and times it well. Mathews does well to five full length and pull it back in, but his back leg may have touched the advertising triangle. Harsh, harsh. Full mark for the effort."
steep bounce but the change of pace means it stops on Henriques who gets a leading edge to the off side
dabs the length ball to point and scampers the single
"length on middle and leg, whipped to deep square."
"<b> Samson has made a right royal mess at deep square. </b> Missed one the other day, Misha stares from square leg. Yuvraj is beaten for pace as he looks to pull the bouncer, top-edges it towards the deep. Got the feeling that Samson had too much time in the end. Oh, dear. He didn't look settled under that at any stage, was on the move when the ball bobbled out"
drills a full delivery on the bounce to deep cover.
"yorker on middle and leg, squeezed to deep midwicket"
"poor ball first up in a new spell. Slides a length ball down leg, Henriques uses the pace and tickles this to the fine leg boundary"
"flicks a full ball from outside off towards deep midwicket, Samson swooped in quickly"
"beaten for pace again but this one flies over short fine leg. That was dug in short at 144kph, Yuvraj looked to fetch it from outside off. With fine leg in, it kept going away after bouncing. Shami had no chance"
"this is the Yuvraj flick of old. The kind you saw him do against Brett Lee at the World T20 in 2007. Length on middle and leg, Yuvraj's swagger to the fore. Clears the front leg and swings this over deep midwicket. Sensational"
"right into the blockhole on middle, squeezed to point"
"backs away and squeezes the full delivery between point and short third man. Super timing, even better placement. Opened his wrists late to find that gap and steer it away. Henriques showing there's more to his game than just big hitting"
"dabs to short third man, risky single. Henriques was miles out had the direct hit struck the stumps at the striker's end"
makes room and drills the full delivery outside off to sweeper cover
"what placement. Yorker-length delivery that tails away from the stumps, Yuvraj makes room and squeezes this past the diving short third man fielder"
muscles the pull into the gap between deep midwicket and fine leg. <b> 25th T20 fifty. </b> This was sitting up nicely for Yuvraj's swing
"squeezes a wide yorker to point, had to reach out to get some bat on it"
"yorker-length on off, Henriques backs away and squeezes this back past the bowler. Long-off and long-on converge"
"threads the gap on the off side. Made room to generate power on the swing, powered to the deep cover boundary. What's better is it will be a <b> free-hit </b> as Rabada overstepped"
"looks to flick this leg side but this is a super cross-seam yorker that pin Yuvraj plumb on off as he beats the swing. Can't be out, though"
"misses his mark by an inch. This is a leg-stump half-volley, Yuvraj is deep inside his crease, anticipating a full one. Flicks this to the deep square leg boundary."
flays a length ball outside off to deep point
"low full toss outside off, squeezed to long-off"
"<b> Oh, Jayant. What have you done? </b> Over-ran the ball at third man. Low full toss, Yuvraj looks to go over point but gets a thick edge down to third man"
"the helicopter is out. <B> MS Dhoni, are you watching? </b> Rabada bowls this full on middle, Yuvraj was standing outside leg. The ball tailed away late to come into his swinging arc and Yuvraj drilled it straight over Rabada's head. Sensational. Shot of the innings"
"length ball outside off, a tiny bit of shape away, slapped to cover point"
"another outswinger on a good length, a bit closer to off stump, comes forward and eases with an open bat-face to backward point"
"fullish and fairly wide outside off, flat-batted to cover point"
"this one isn't quite as full, and Samson has some width again. The shorter length allows him to slice this deliberately over backward point, and Siddarth Kaul, chasing to his right from third man, puts in two dives to stop the ball in two installments"
"onto the pads now and Bhuvneshwar has square leg back, tucked away to that fielder for a quiet single"
"back of a length, a bit of nip back in off the track to cramp Nair for room. Tries to force it through the off side and the ball beats his inside edge and hits him in the hip area"
back of a length on off stump and Samson just swats that away. Takes half a step forward and launches this up and over wide long-on
"slower ball close to off stump, lets it come on for the dab to third man"
"back of a length close to off stump, and Nair makes himself plenty of room, exposes all three stumps, and simply lifts the ball over the covers. Not much pace at all, and Nair had plenty of time to steady himself and time that shot"
"back of a length, this time he follows Nair's movement away from leg stump. Dabs it down towards point"
"length ball, looks like the offcutter coming in towards off stump. Samson plants his front foot down the pitch, ends up a little cramped for room, and is forced to defend"
"again that offcutter, this time Samson expects it, plays with the turn from outside off through midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked back towards the bowler"
"length ball close to off stump, punched on the up to the right of extra-cover. Warner chases to his left from mid-off to stop it"
"once again, punched on the up. This one is closer to off stump, and it doesn't matter to Samson, just leans into it and finds the gap between cover point and extra cover"
"length ball on middle and off, straightening off the pitch. Samson adjusts to the movement and defends off the front foot into the covers"
"shot! That's a good-length ball on off stump and he whips it with a lot of bottom wrist, down to the left of the fielder at long-on"
"shortish, plenty of width, and that's put away easily. Sits up nicely, and Samson rolls his wrists over at the top of the bounce to find the gap between extra-cover and mid-off"
"a step down the track from Nair and Kaul bangs it in a little shorter, angling it into the batsman's body. Looks to pull over wide mid-on, doesn't quite time it. The ball stops 2/3rds of the way to the boundary"
"ooh, back of a length outside off and Samson looks for that stand-still pull he plays so well. This one skids through, though, and beats him for pace"
"slower length ball on middle and off, defended into the off side"
"length ball close to off stump, punched down to long-on"
"short outside off, and Nair has ramped this over the fielder at third-man. It seemed to come off the pitch slower than Nair expected, and gave him the time he needed to play it, but it still came on quickly enough for him to comfortably clear the fielder"
"fuller now, and this is smashed back with venom. Into the gap between the stumps and the non-striker and it races away to the straight boundary"
"slower ball, and Samson picks out cover point. Full and wide outside off, and the drive was on, but Samson was a touch early on that, and hit it in the air and straight to the fielder at waist height"
"in the blockhole on leg stump, clipped away to deep square leg"
"looks to back away for that ramp over the keeper again, but this is the slower, loopier bouncer from Siraj, and he fails to put bat on ball"
"slower ball again, this one is full outside off, and Nair, making himself room, lifts it over the covers. Didn't quite middle it, but there were no fielders out on the boundary, and it slowly trickles into the rope"
"ooh, looks to make room for the big loft over mid-off or extra-cover, but this one's full and quick outside off and its past his edge before he can complete his batswing"
"<b>dropped</b>. Nair saw short fine leg inside the circle and moved across his stumps to try and scoop over the fielder. Siraj saw him move and bowled a wide-ish yorker. Nair looks to chip it over short fine anyway, doesn't get the desired elevation, and Bhuvneshwar, getting both hands to the ball over his head, fails to cling on to it"
"There's that shot again, and this time it's perfectly executed. This is back of a length, angling down leg, and he uses his wrists extremely well to whip it over the short fine leg fielder"
"back of a length on middle and leg. Nair, looking to back away and make room, is denied that room, and he swats it along the ground to long-on"
"back of a length on off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
"length ball angling into middle stump. Nair makes himself swinging room by moving away from leg stump, and he swings through the line, head nice and still, and lofts straight back over the bowler's head"
"shortish, angling down leg, and fine leg is on the boundary this time but he's too square to stop this swivel-pull from Nair, nicely placed with a roll of the wrists at the top of the bounce"
"slower ball now, back of a length and angling into the pads, clipped to square leg"
tossed up on leg stump and Pant sweeps it away to the right of short fine leg
"length ball pitching on leg stump this time. Looks to flick but misses, the ball spins past his inside edge and hits his pad"

"tossed up on leg stump, whipped to long-on"
"googly, pitching on middle and turning towards off stump. Goes on the back foot to work it through square leg"
"tossed up full outside off, driven to long-off"
"back of a length fairly wide outside off, Nair shuffles across and guides down to third man"
"quickish, shortish, angling across towards off stump. Another of those Kaul deliveries that skid on quicker than expected. Looks to pull, hurried into it, can only send it rolling slowly to midwicket"
"this is the slower short ball, sits up at waist height, and Pant absolutely smashes the pull, all along the ground and straight to the man at deep square leg"
"Long-off is back, however, and Nair has picked out the fielder. A sweetly-struck flat-bat hit, off the knuckleball, and it was clever from Kaul not just in terms of the change of pace, but also the line. Saw Nair advancing, possibly looking to go over mid-on, and bowled it full and wide of off stump. Nair took on the long-off fielder, unwisely in the end"
"greets him with the bouncer, and he ducks it. Signalled wide for height"
"length ball outside off, slogs at it, doesn't time it, and hits it to midwicket on the bounce"
"slower length ball close to off stump, blocked back to the bowler. Wanted to lean across and flick, but it came on much slower than expected, with a bit of leg-cut, thereby endangering the leading edge"
"tossed up on off stump, ends up as a full-toss thanks to a huge stride from Pant, sweeps hard and and finds the gap between deep backward square leg and deep midwicket"
"quickish on leg stump this time. Looks to flick and ends up with his head falling over. Misses, a bit of an lbw appeal, but that was turning down leg"
"down the track now, gets too close to the pitch for an attacking shot, whips it through square leg instead"
"quick, sharp legbreak outside off. No footwork from Iyer, and in the end, seeing how much it turned, no stroke either"
"back of a length now, shuffles across to work it into the mid-on region. Long-on was back, and Rashid had to chase that himself"
"back-of-a-length legbreak on Pant's pads, tucked away to deep backward square leg"
"short, wide slower ball, slapped to deep point"
"That field prompts him to try and bowl as straight as possible, ends up sliding a full ball down the leg side"
"better now, length ball angling into off and middle, worked away through midwicket"
"short, wide, and that bounced up shoulder-high. No problem, says Pant, just swats it away with a horizontal bat, over extra-cover"
"full and wide this time, and he has a man at deep point but he's only a spectator as Pant gets a big stride forward and across and slaps this over cover"
"back of a length outside off, stabbed away to deep point"
"overpitched on middle stump, and that's an old-fashioned boundary off a regulation bad ball, clipped away elegantly to the wide long-on boundary"
"full outside off, driven to the left of sweeper cover"
"tossed up slow on middle and off, gets on the front foot to clip this towards long-on"
"googly, and Iyer picks it. Stays back to a length ball that's turning into his pads, and flicks through backward square leg"
"back of a length, turning towards off stump. Squares Iyer up a little. He wanted to flick, has to adjust and poke into the covers"
"quick turn wide of off, not quite short enough to cut, beats the outside edge"
"back of a length, slower this time, goes back and across to try and push into the mid-on region for a quick single. Rashid runs to his right quickly and Iyer has to run back into his crease. Back home comfortably by the time Ojha gets the bails off, but they check with the third umpire anyway"
"length ball on middle stump, slower one, clipped away through straight midwicket. Ran the first one hard but there wasn't really the chance of a second"
"yorker close to off stump, jabbed away to long-on"
"shot! That isn't really short, but he picked the slower ball, went back and across in a flash, and pulled with a full swivel of his body, transferred so much power into that - it just flew over the square leg boundary, flat"
"gone! The previous ball was slower, this one is quick and full. Looked to bring his bat down and flick, the ball was too quick for him. Hit his front boot and cannoned into the stumps"
"full on middle and off, blocked back to the bowler with the straightest of bats"
"quick bouncer angled across Anderson. Thought of pulling, but it was too quick for that, and the line was too wide of off stump"
"back of a length on off stump, makes a bit of room to stab down to short third man"
"short outside off, makes a bit more swinging room by stepping away from leg stump and clubs this down to long-on"
"flat and fairly full outside off, slogged along the ground to deep midwicket"
"flat and short outside off, swatted down to long-on again"
"length ball wide of off, and Iyer's bottom hand sends that soaring over the long-on boundary, such quick hands through the ball there"
"again! This time it's shorter, a little closer to off stump, and this time he stays on the back foot and pulls over midwicket. Again, the quick whip of the bottom hand generated so much of the power"
"shortish outside off - Sunrisers are giving Anderson too much swinging room here. He slaps it away over the bowler's head, and Williamson, running to his left from long-off, manages to stop it despite almost overrunning the ball"
"shortish slower ball outside off, dragged away to deep backward square leg. Didn't time this pull at all"
"slower ball, shortish outside off, Iyer waits, adjusts, and uses his wrists well to clip that towards deep midwicket. Didn't put too much weight on that shot, allowed him to scamper two"
"slower ball outside off, Iyer doesn't quite read the pace of it. Wanted to dab to third man and in the end he just stood there with his bat at the top of his backlift, not sure when to bring his bat down"
"another slower ball, back of a length on off stump, shuffles across to work it to deep midwicket"
"full on off stump, and Corey clobbers it. Clears his front leg and just smashes that over wide long-on"
"slips out of Rashid's hand this time. Thigh-high full-toss on leg stump, swiped away through square leg"

"full on off stump, clears his front leg and drills it towards long-on"
"back of a length on the pads, whipped away to the left of deep backward square leg"
"googly, pitching outside leg and turning towards the stumps. Anderson exposes all his stumps to make hitting room, and flat-bats to long-off"
"wide legbreak, Iyer looks to hit that over the covers, and it turns more than expected and skews up off the edge of the bottom part of his bat. Henriques chases back desperately from extra-cover, and it drops between him and Dhawan coming in from sweeper cover"

"full on off stump, clears his front leg to drag this along the ground to long-on"

"full-toss on middle stump, swiped away to deep midwicket"
"full on leg stump, drilled down to long-on"
"well bowled. Saw Iyer looking to make himself room, and followed him with the slower bouncer. It was crucial that it was the off-pace bouncer, because both backward point and third man were inside the circle. Iyer looked to ramp it over short third man, didn't have too much pace to work with, and could only plop it straight into his hands"
