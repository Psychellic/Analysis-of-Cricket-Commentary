"de Kock struck on the back pad as he prods outside the line of that length ball.

Kusal Mendis swooped in quickly and then fired a accurate throw on the bounce to Dickwella who smashed the stumps down to catch Amla at least a foot short. Tired end to a fabulous knock.

"back of a length on leg stump, defended into the on side"
"<b>dropped</b>! He may have had more time than he thought, but it was still a return catch. Short ball, angling across Tharanga, and he is in no position to pull this from outside off stump. Bounced up to head height as well. Only manages to pop it back to the bowler, who got both hands to it at waist height, but couldn't hold on"
"length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"146kph bouncer angled across the left-hander. De Kock has to jump to collect that, and Tharanga barely had to duck. Signalled wide"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"pitches outside leg, angling towards the pads, and Tharanga misses out. A little late to get his bat around to flick, and the ball pops off the pad into the square leg region"
"length ball on off stump, stays back to defend into the cover point region"
"once again he exposes all his stumps while attempting to make room, and Parnell follows him with a back-of-a-length delivery. Defended into the off side"
"makes room again, and this time Parnell bowls it full on off stump. Goes for the loft over cover, and ends up slicing it off the outside edge, way over the slips"
"now, in an attempt to follow Dickwella, Parnell slips a full wide down the leg side"
"back of a length on middle stump, tucked away quietly through midwicket"
"length ball on middle and leg, whipped away to long leg"
"slower ball on off stump, full, and Dickwella puts it away beautifully. Makes room again, and slices it up and over point"
"follows Dickwella now, fires it at his feet as he steps away from the stumps. Clipped away to deep square leg"
"shot! That's a pick-up whip, from off stump, against the angle, and it flies over forward square leg and rolls away quickly to the boundary"
"<b>half-chance</b>. Again, straight back at Rabada. This one's full on leg stump, and Rabada denies him room with the full ball. Goes through with the drive and presents a hard, flat, low chance that he gets his right hand to but can't hold on"
"full on leg stump, clipped away to the right of long leg"
"full, a bit of width, gets down on his back knee and drives to wide mid-off. Rabada has overstepped by a fair margin"
"full, slanted away from off stump, opens his bat face to steer it to deep point"
"steps across this time rather than away from leg stump. Bowls a length ball on leg stump and he misses the flick, rolls off the outside of the pad towards long leg"
"short ball, gets up to chest height while cramping Tharanga for room. Swivels into his pull with his eye off the ball and it hits him on the body"
"back of a length on leg stump, looks for that pick-up shot again and ends up scooping it up without achieving the distance intended. Clears the man running towards the boundary from square leg"
"angles this down the leg side, and Dickwella gets a little tickle of pad on it to send it racing away to the fine leg boundary"
"full outside off, stabbed to backward point"
"ooh. Finally a straightforward, good-length ball in the corridor, and Dickwella pokes at it with no footwork. Thick inside-edge rolls away past the stumps"
"short now, on off stump, and Tharanga smacks it away, opens up in a flash to pull to the right of midwicket"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, blocked into the covers"
Doesn't adjust immediately to the change of angle. Looks for the short ball and slips it a long way down the leg side
"shortish, angling into off stump, makes himself room and slaps to backward point"
"off-stump yorker, jams his bat down to stab it back to the bowler"
"makes a lot of room again, and Rabada angled a quick bouncer straight at his body, getting it up to shoulder height. Somehow, he swayed his upper body away to create some room for his hands, and swatted it away to third man"
"bang. Looks to follow Dickwella again, bowls a length ball, and he just opens up at the hips to whip it away over midwicket"
"Oh, shot. Brilliant. Length ball on off stump, and Dickwella uses his wrists this time to whip it over square leg"
"looks to follow Dickwella with another bouncer, and slants it too far down leg once again"
"yorker on middle and off, clipped to midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and tucks it softly into the leg side"
"fullish outside off, a bit of width but not a half-volley, and Tharanga slashes and misses, looking to drive on the up"
"this one is overpitched, a little closer to off stump, and he just leans on it, shows the full face, and beats cover point to his left"
"short outside off, and again Parnell's short ball has sat up to be hit. Tharanga pulls it away wide of mid-on"
"length ball on off stump, stays on the back foot and whips to the right of short fine leg"

"length ball angling in towards off stump, pushes to the left of mid-off with a straight bat"

"back of a length on off stump, jumps to ride the bounce and defends towards point"
"back of a length, fourth-stump line, defended to backward point"
"short this time, on off stump, and Mendis puts it away. Takes it from just over chest height, rolls his wrists over, and pulls it through straight midwicket"
"oh, super. Full, angling into the pads, and Mendis clips it sweetly over midwicket"
"ooh, good ball. A bit of extra bounce in the corridor. Tharanga looks to drive on the up and the ball beats his outside edge"
"full outside off, and he just loves width. Especially when it's also overpitched. Opens his bat face slightly and sends the ball racing away to the left of cover point"
"ooh, beauty. Length ball in the corridor, a bit of nip away off the pitch, beats Tharanga's defensive push"
"fullish on off stump, gets on the front foot for a push to mid-off"
"lovely. A touch short, a tiny bit of width, and he leans back, waits, and chops it away to the left of third man"
"Parnell's short balls have been disastrous today. Whenever he's tried them, they've sat up at pullable height. This one's outside off, and Tharanga swivels stylishly to put it away between mid-on and midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and defends with soft hands, manages to squeeze it past Duminy, who dives to his left at backward point to try and stop it"
"ooh. Back of a length, angling into off stump and straightening slightly. Looks to use the angle to work it leg side, ends up getting a thick edge that rolls away to third man"
"shortish outside off, gets on top of the bounce to push towards point"
"shortish again, a bit more width. Plays with a more horizontal bat this time to slap it away past Duminy, who muffs up a fairly straightforward stop after moving quickly to his right from backward point"
"short, a bit of width, Tharanga misses out as the ball sneaks past his attempted cut"
"length ball on middle stump, clipped away quietly through forward square leg"
"back of a length, angling across to off stump. Lets it come on and dabs it down to third man"
"back of a length, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"back of a length outside off, punched to deep point"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and dabs softly into the point region to enable the quick single"
"taken! Mendis picked up one boundary with an uppish flick, but this time AB has stationed himself at a straight short midwicket. The ball, angling into the stumps and pitching on a good length, stopped on Mendis slightly, maybe, and AB jumps, times it just about perfectly, and plucks the ball out with an outstretched right hand. The ball was almost behind him when he caught it"
"full outside off, nice stride forward to drive with an open face to the left of backward point"
"short outside off, left alone"
"fuller now, outside off again, Chandimal leaves again"
"a third leave in a row. Hits the deck, just back of a length, in the corridor"

"short, angling into the body and gets up to rib height. Jumps to ride the bounce and tucks it away to long leg"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"length ball, nibbles into the left-hander off the seam to beat Tharanga's inside edge and hit back pad as he looks to defend. Pitched outside leg, though, so not much of an appeal"
"slanting away from off stump this time, Tharanga tries to cut and misses. Not short enough for the stroke"
"back of a length on middle stump, worked gently into the midwicket region"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"full, angling into middle stump, whipped away to the left of long leg to bring up Sri Lanka's 100"
"length ball angling into off stump. Gets on the front foot to defend and a bit of extra bounce ensures the ball hits high on the bat, near the sticker"
"pulled from outside off towards deep midwicket. Steep bounce, so it's risky. Kept it all along the ground this time though"
width and he's crashed that into the point boundary. 'Hit me' ball from Morkel.
shoulders arms to a back of length delivery that nips away from outside off
"in that drivable channel outside off, left alone"
offers the full face of the bat to defend the incoming delivery
gets a good stride forward and defends
"Gangulyesque timing. Width on offer, opens the bat face to steer that away to square third man. Sublime timing"
"punched away to deep point. Not much of a followthrough. Nice, high elbow as ball met bat. Morris on the shorter side at the moment"
slides a length ball down leg. Chandimal misses the tickle because of the angle
gets forward gently to keep out that incoming length ball
"slants back into the pads, worked wide of midwicket"
"beauty. Awkward length, awkward angle. Tharanga caught on the hop as he looks to fend. Steep bounce nearly had him"
"short ball angled into the body, Tharanga on the move with both feet off the ground as he bunts it to the leg side"
length ball that stops on Tharanga as he looks to work it to the leg side. Briefly in the air but away from Morkel on his followthrough
hit on the thigh pad as he looks to work the length ball off his hip to square leg
ill-directed delivery. Once again looking to tickle it fine but the direction was taking it down the leg side. Wasted effort
half-stop at square leg takes pace off the ball. Tharanga struck the pull quite well. Rolled his wrists o ver the ball to keep it down
too easy for any batsman worth his salt at this level. Leg-stump half-volley which Chandimal flicks into the gap at deep midwicket
"in-between length. Not all that short, but not a half-volley either, Chandimal caught on the crease as he defends"
"worked behind square, fine leg comes around to cut that off"
"slider on middle and leg, whipped straight to midwicket"
the celebration in the South African camp tells you why that is a big moment in the match. Chandimal struck this firmly but de Villiers anticipates the dive and moves swiftly to his right from extra cover to slide and half-stop. Then quickly recovers to run a few paces to pick up the ball and hit the stumps direct at the bowler's end to catch Chandimal at least a feet short. Stunning
"quicker one outside off, steered to point"
"fired full on off stump, eased down to long-off"
"the wrong'un has done the trick. Didn't look like Kapugeradara picked it. This one drifted back in a long way from wide of the crease, Kapu plays for the turning legbreak, stabs outside the line in an attempt to nurdle it to the legside and is struck plumb in front of middle. First-ball duck. Sri Lanka are sliding here"
"pushed through quicker outside off, pushed to cover"
"skiddy bouncer angling in from wide of the crease, Tharanga arches back and sees this zip past his helmet"
"wrong line, slides this one down leg as de Kock collects"
mistimes a drive but it's wide of cover as they scamper a quick single
"sweetly driven on the up over the infield, to sweeper cover"
"squared up by the length on middle, turned to the leg side nonetheless"

"punched through the line to deep cover, Parnell little late to get off the blocks but they don't risk the second this time"
lunges forward and defends
"tossed up on middle, Tharanga gets forward and defends"
"slider outside off, steered to backward point"
"fired on middle and leg, nurled behind square"
beaten by the weong'un. De Kock was keen on the stumping and didn't appeal. They decide against a review. Tharanga is deceived by the slider. Played inside the line of this googly that hit one particular spot and deviated a long way.
"pushed through quicker on middle, solidly behind the line."
backs away and cuts to the left of short third man. Didn't have the width to play the full-blooded stroke
eased with the spin to deep cover
"fired full on middle from around the stumps, he lunges forward and blocks"
"too full on middle, defended back to the bowler"
"fired down leg, looks to paddle it fine but is beaten by the pace. Good glove work by de Kock, who may have been blinded by the batsman. They went upstairs just to be sure the backfoot wasn't in the air as the bails were knocked off. All good in the end."
"drifting into middle and leg, looks to work it with the angle but is hit on the pad"
"slider on middle, bunted back to the bowler"
gets forward and eases it down to long-on
"too full on the stumps, squeezed past a diving Tahir to long-on"
leans forward and turns the flighted delivery to short midwicket
picks the googly off the hand and is right behind the line as he blocks
"on the shorter side, whipped to square leg"
went for the full-blooded drive but this one spun away sharply as Tharanga ended slicing it wide of point. Miller with a wayward throw from the deep. Could've been a lot closer had it been quick and accurate at the bowler's end. Kusal was struggling
"looks to force this through cover but doesn't have the room, gets a thick inside edge back to the bowler"
walks across to sweep this low full toss from off stump to deep backward square leg. Hint of risk but he made a conscious effort of getting outside the line to play it
"drifting into the pads, can't get this away as it beats his defensive shot to hit pad"
"fired full outside off, can't get underneath the delivery, squeezed back to the bowler again"
"off a thick inside edge to mid-on. Looked to drive, drift did him there"
squeezed with the spin to cover
"that is a freebie and Tharanga pounces on it. Rocks back and pulls this half-tracker into the midwicket boundary. The percentage of such deliveries have considerably come down, and when it comes your way, you better take toll"
"follows it up with a full delivery, a wrong'un, on off stump, eased wide of cover with the spin"
"a messy effort by Rabada at point. Over-ran it, also didn't account for the spin as Tharanga punched that away"
width but he smacks it straight to the man at the edge of the ring at cover
cut away but a diving stop by Morris at point. Threw himself to his right to effect a one-handed stop
"too full on middle, eased down the ground to long-off"
struck firmly but straight to point
"back of length on off stump, bunted to cover"
"length on off, punched straight to cover"
misfield at mid-on gives away a run. Rolled off a thick inside edge as Tharanga tried to drive. Lazy effort from Parnell too on his followthrough
mix-up but safe. Whipped to midwicket. Was halfway down the pitch when he turned back
"veers back in from length, he gets a thick inside edge towards square leg"
"too full on off, eases to long-off"
"is that the game for South Africa? Tharanga has hit this straight to Miller at deep cover. He read the googly, got to the pitch of the ball to go over the infield. It was almost as if he forgot there was a man there. Miller was running in with the sun right in his eyeline but he did well to keep his balance"
lunges forward and works the full ball with the spin to the leg side
chops the cut to slip. Picked the length but this was too close to the body
"on the bounce to long-off, no timing whatsoever  behind that one. Wasn't sure if he wanted to hit that over the ropes or just chip it. Checked his shot at the last moment"
gets a good stride forward and defends
"back of length on off stump, punched to mid-off"
"slides into middle and leg, worked to Amla at deep square leg"
good leave. Full and angling across the batsman. Two slips waiting for the nick so he's watchful
opens the bat face late to steer this down to third man
"back of length on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
"hops back and across to pull, mistimes it to midwicket"
"slider on middle and leg, turned to the man coming in from square leg"

"too full and too straight, drilled to long-off"
lunges forward and blocks
steps out to flick but the ball dips on him to beat the stroke and hit him on the pad
"looks to work it fine, the ball deflects off the pad to square leg"
"full and angling away, firmly driven to mid-off"
crunching drive through the line to sweeper cover
"much fuller on off stump, he gets half-forward and defends"
slapped away but straight to deep point
dabs it gently to short cover and scampers across for a quick single
"stabs forward with the bat well away from the pad, straight to cover"
sliced to extra cover. Looked to hit him with the spin but didn't get to the pitch of the ball and spooned a simple catch to the man at the edge of the ring. Sri Lanka right on the edge.
"tossed up full on middle and off, driven firmly back between the stumps and the non-striker, and long-on moves left to stop it"
"slants this across and lands it on a nice length close to off stump. Kusal is unsure if it'll turn in or not, and he defends into the off side after it comes back in"
"ah, excellent fielding at slip. Floated this up slow outside off and he brought his quick hands to play to play a flat-bat reverse-sweep. Amla dives to his left and stops it"
"tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"
"length ball close to off stump, slapped towards backward point"
"back of a length on off stump, punched firmly down the ground but Morkel denies him a possible boundary, moving quickly to his right from mid-on and stopping it with a dive"
"full outside off, defended towards backward point"
"beauty. Length ball angled across the stumps, and Prasanna doesn't get any real stride forward to defend, beats his outside edge"
"slants this a little wider, again a good length. Prasanna is a little late moving across, looks for a dab towards third man, can't put bat to ball"
"and again. This one's fuller, slanting into a wide-ish channel outside off. A push and a miss, again not too much footwork"
"full outside off, driven to long-off"
"tossed up full outside off, driven to long-off"
"a touch short on leg stump, and Kusal puts it away, crouches a little since it wasn't a rank long hop, and then swivels quickly to pull to the right of the man at backward square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, goes back to work it to midwicket"
"full now, on off stump, looks to clip to long-on but midwicket moves quickly to his right and stops it with a dive"
"flighted much slower now, wide outside off, gets a good stride out, head over ball, to drive to long-off"
"length ball, a bit of late movement in towards middle stump. Kusal didn't really move his feet, cleared his front leg as if he was shaping to hit hard down the ground. Adjusted late to defend towards midwicket"
"shortish on off stump, hops across to ride the bounce and whip off the hips through square leg"
"another play and miss. Prasanna is struggling against Parnell's angle here. Nice length, slants this across and fairly wide outside off, looks to get forward and push into the covers and can't connect"
"shuffles across a long way to cover the angle, and ends up perhaps overdoing it, gets a thick inside-edge into his back leg"
"wow. After all those plays and misses, goes for the big slog against a length ball pitching on off stump. Lucky that his thick inside-edge, which ricocheted off his back thigh, didn't lob straight back to the bowler"
"and he closes the over, and his spell, by beating Prasanna's edge again. Subtle variations in length, this one was just a bit shorter than the previous few balls, and Prasanna, looking to defend, was still on the shuffle when the ball went past his bat"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump, defended into the point region"
"length ball on off stump, punched towards mid-off"
"short now, and this one gets up to just the right height for Kusal to play his favourite short-arm pull, swivels and swats it away to the right of the deep midwicket fielder"
"length ball on off stump, opens his bat face to dab towards point"
"full on middle stump, clipped away through forward square leg"
"back of a length outside off, goes deep in his crease to try and shorten the length a little more, but can't beat point with his cut"
"length ball on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, poked away into the vacant cover point region"
"back of a length on leg stump, worked away through square leg"

"shortish in the corridor, gets on top of the bounce to defend"
"back of a length on off stump, swatted away to deep square leg"
"slogged. Slogged hard. Bam. That was a back-of-a-length delivery in the fifth-stump channel, and he took a step forward and across and just clubbed it over straight midwicket, baseball-style"
"full, angling into off stump, shuffles across even before the bowler has released, and clips it away to long leg"
"shortish, angling into off stump. Shuffles across and works it to long leg"
"full on off stump, clipped towards midwicket"
"short outside off, really digs this into the pitch and Prasanna has to pull from over shoulder height. A difficult ask, and he doesn't quite middle it, but gets it into the gap to the right of mid-on"
"back of a length on middle stump, defended into the covers"
"length ball on middle stump, stays leg-side of the ball and punches firmly but short extra dives left to ensure he won't get any runs for it"
"bouncer over leg stump, and that's nicely hooked, it was quick and skiddy and got up over his shoulder, but he stepped across the line and helped it away to the fine leg boundary"
"shortish, angling across to off stump. Looks to whip it into the leg side, ball beats him and hits high on the thigh"
"shortish, leg-stumpish. Can't quite connect with the tuck off the hips, ball hits his thigh and rolls down towards the keeper"
"back of a length on leg stump, tucked to backward square leg"
"floats this full on off stump, he's half-forward in defence"
"this one snakes back in from length on off stump, Prasanna pushes outside the line and is comprehensively beaten. Hit above the knee roll, closer to the flap of the pad. Ball tracking shows the ball would've gone on to hit the top of middle and leg. Three reds, Sri Lanka sink further. Prasanna had taken a step across with his front foot as the bowler released, and ended up in a completely closed-off position"
"full, angling into off stump, driven to the right of mid-off"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"back of a length on off stump, clubbed along the ground to mid-on, and is that another run-out? They think of a single, hesitate, turn around, and Tahir's direct hit catches Lakmal well short at the striker's end"
"in the blockhole on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"gone, Sri Lanka are nine down. Malinga stepped away to make room, Rabada banged it in short outside off. Was off-balance as he tried to cut, only managed a bottom-edge into his stumps"
"ooh, back of a length, angling into the stumps. Pradeep is nowhere in line to defend and the ball zips past his outside edge and over the stumps"
"back of a length, angling into leg stump. Moves away from the line again, defends into the off side"
"oh my. Snorting bouncer over off stump, the inward angle following the batsman all the way. Pradeep doesn't get his feet in line, which is good for him. Just about sways his upper body away"
"fuller now, on leg stump, defended to midwicket"
"back of a length on middle stump, shuffles away from leg stump and pokes it towards point"
Down the track and the bowler responds with a full ball at the batsman's feet. Punched back to Morris

"yorker on middle and off, defended into the covers"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched to extra-cover"

"shortish outside off, moves away from the line and tries to dab into the off side, can't connect"
"another short ball, over leg stump this time as Pradeep steps away and exposes all three. Swats blindly at it, makes no contact"
"full on middle stump, Pradeep exposes his stumps again and swishes it away, over the top, into the cover boundary"
"full-toss on leg stump, punched away through cover point"
"short, rising over off stump. Looks to make room to slap it over point but it bounces too much for that"
"full on middle stump, clears his front leg and flat-bats powerfully down the ground, to the left of mid-off, to bring up Sri Lanka's 200"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"googly, pitching just short of a length well outside off. Surprised him but he coped well enough to defend into the off side"
"and that is that. Tahir finishes with four. A bit of flight, and Pradeep gives it the big yahoo. Connects pretty well, to be fair, but only manages to hit it as far as the man at long-on"
