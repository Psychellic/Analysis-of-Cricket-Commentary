"length outside off, cuts it towards point"
goes for the slog sweep but gets a top edge that clears the short fine leg and lands safely
"flatter on middle and leg, looks to pull but misses and is rapped on the pads"
"length ball around middle and leg, no room for Zazai who gets an inside edge onto his thigh"
"short and pulled away, Zazai rocks back and pulls it over deep midwicket, six right from the moment it hit the bat"
"<b>falls well short of the incoming third man</b>. A touch fuller and wider outside off, Zazai went for the big heave but ended up slicing it towards third man"
"length ball around off, Gurbaz moves across and pulls it over deep square leg, <b>for a 69 metre six</b>"
"short and wide, cuts hard but cannot beat the man in deep, a single to deep point"

"looped down on middle and off, tapped back to the bowler"
"he backs away this time, hacking a big shot towards mid off"
"quicker one, speared in towards his legs, Gurbaz walking across and paddling a sweep to short fine leg. A sloppy return from the fielder results in an overthrow"
"arm ball from Williams, on a length and headed in towards the pads"
"<b>boom!</b> Gurbaz walks across again, changing the line of the delivery, and sends the ball over deep backward square with a pick-up slog sweep"
"worked off the pads, Williams sticking to a straight line, and a quick single to end the over"
"short ball to start, but an expansive pull is bottom edged down to fine leg"
"<b>sloppy!</b> Mpofu comes around the stumps and angles a length ball in to beat Zazai's heave to leg. Cracking delivery, but it catches Taylor on the wrong foot behind the stumps. He'd been moving to his left, and then dives right as the ball passes him"
"full and wide outside off now, and Zazai leans across to thump a square drive behind point with plenty of bottom hand"
"<b>spliced, but safe!</b> Another short one, and Zazai aims a slug down the ground. The ball takes the splice and lobs tamely towards mid on, dropping in front of him"
"<b>another short one, another boundary</b>. Mpofu angles a bouncer in and Zazai steps back, checking a scooped pull up and over short fine leg. He's got enough on it to easily beat the fielder"
"on a length, angling in, and he flicks to the midwicket fielder, in the ring"
"<b>swatted over square leg</b>, Gurbaz making the most of a long hop loosener by rocking back and hammering a pull over the boundary"
"a much better length catches Gurbaz in the crease, the ball coming off the inside half of the blade and rolling to leg"
"speared in towards the pads from around the stumps, he misses a flick and it goes nowhere"
"speared at the pads once more, and this time Zazai adds a little more vim to his swipe. Ball kisses bat, and runs away to fine leg. That was a freebie"
"much better, floated up outside off and Zazai defends"
"a big bottom-handed swing sends the ball bouncing out to Burl at deep midwicket, and <b>up comes Afghanistan's fifty</b>. The openers are in a hurry tonight"
"<b>ouch!</b> Zazai swats across the line at a length delivery, inside edges, and is struck amidships. He's down, and breathing hard. Eventually Zazai stands, but the ache has set in and he walks around gingerly. Eventually, he's good to go."
"another length delivery shapes in towards Zazai's legs, and he toe-ends a big heave back to the bowler"
"slower ball, 110km/h, and pitched right up to him. Zazai taps to cover and they set off for a quick single"
"on a length and in the channel. Gurbaz angles towards point, and they chance another sprinted single"
"Jarvis rolls his fingers over another short one, Zazai aiming a pull out to Chakabva in the deep"
"a good over is spoiled. Gurbaz backs away and misses a hoick at a full one, but Jarvis has over-stepped. Or has he? Replays show that Jarvis actually had a sliver of heel behind the line"
"Gurbaz can't punish the Free Hit, smearing a length ball into the leg side, but nowhere near the middle of the bat"
"nicely bowled, Gurbaz is neither forward nor back as he pokes to cover"
"accurate stuff, and there's no run to be had as Gurbaz flicks to midwicket"
"quicker one, cramping him for room, and midwicket is in quickly to keep the batsmen at home"
"a touch too full, and he drills a drive down to long off"
"<b>much too short</b>, and Zazai steps back and across to send a muscular pull over the deep midwicket boundary"
"speared in flat and fast, outside off, Zazai cracks it back to the bowler"
"and he starts with a rank long hop, spinning away outside off. Long on and midwicket are on the ropes, but he picks the gap right between them with a lofted pull"
"<b>too short</b>, and Gurbaz gets right underneath another lofted pull. He was aiming for the stands, and doesn't quite get the distance he's looking for, but enough on it to clear the rope"
"Gurbaz stays on the back foot, punching down to long off"
"slider, angling across him. Zazai has a look, and opts to defend"
"tapped down just wide of point, a single the result"
"nicely bowled, much more full and drawing him forward. But Gurbaz finds the gap at cover with an angled push, and keeps the strike"
"slower ball bouncer to start, dug in at 111km/h, and Gurbaz ducks under it"
"another slower one, this time a yorker that dips on him outside off. He drives off the toe of the bat to cover"
"<b>dropped at deep midwicket!</b> It's Chakabva out there. Gurbaz slogged a length delivery high, but almost straight out to him. Chakabva settles under it, but the ball pops straight through his cupped hands and dribbles over the rope"
"another slower ball, on a length and out of the back of the hand. Gurbaz mis-reads it and swings over the top of it as the ball bursts past his off stump"
"full pace delivery, very full outside off, and it's dug out to cover"
"very slow cutter, down to 101km/h, and Zazai pulls off the front foot out to deep midwicket"
"full, on his legs, and it's slugged out to wide long on"
"pushed through flat on off stump at 92km/h, on the drive down to long off"
"<b>top edge, and this one is held!</b> Zazai bent down low to set himself for a slog sweep, but the ball bounced a little more than he was expecting, ballooning off the top edge. Mutumbami settles under it at short third man, and holds a simple chance"
"quicker ball, out of the front of the hands, and it's tapped to point"
"floated up full outside off, and a drive brings a single to long off"
"<b>beaten!</b> Beautiful googly from Mutombodzi. Shafiqullah didn't have a clue as he groped forward, the ball spinning in through a big gap between bat and pad. Fortunately for him, it scoots <i>just</i> past the stumps"
"very full, dug out to cover"
"uses his feet this time, getting close to the ball and driving to long on"
"held back a touch, and spinning away outside off. Tapped back to the bowler"
"this one goes on with the arm, squirting off the inside half of the bat into the leg side. The fielders are deep, and they push very hard for a second"
"<b>dropped!</b> This was a very tough chance though. Shafiqullah slogs in the air, and Chakabva has plenty of ground to make, running in and around from deep midwicket. He dives forward, and gets the fingers to it, but can't hold on. Good effort"
"<b>confusion!</b> It's tapped to cover, one batsman wants a single and the other doesn't. Gurbaz is late being sent back, but the throw isn't quite on target. A better throw would have had him"
"<b>up and over cover</b>, driven in the air. Shafiqullah spotted a full one, outside off, and aimed his drive for the gap between long off and cover"
"he's almost done in the flight by a full one, but manages to put bat to ball on a paddle sweep"
"quicker one, short outside off, but he can't capitalize as the cut is stopped at point"
"slog swept into the leg side, the ball skidding along the turf into the deep, where Burl dives at midwicket to save runs"
"<b>handsomely driven</b>, Shafiqullah's eyes lighting up as Tino offers up another full, wide one. Deliberately lifted over wide long off, and <b>up comes the hundred</b>"
"angled to point, who is in quickly to stop the single"
"slow cutter, on the stumps, Gurbaz whips across his front pad to <b>raise a maiden T20I fifty</b>"
"short ball, rising over leg stump, and he swivels into a pull down to fine leg"
"Gurbaz backs away, Mpofu follows him with a back of a length delivery. But he lays bat on a swat to leg, picking the gap too"
"another short one, but the pull is bottom edged into the leg side. Possibly tried to hit it a bit too hard"
"bumper, once again, and it fizzes past a wild pull, thudding into Taylor's gloves"
"<b>big appeal, and it's given!</b> Shafiqullah was aiming for a slog sweep, but swung past the ball, which hit him on the upper thigh. He was down on one knee in front of the stumps, and adjacent by the looks of things. But he <b>asks for a review</b>, which only serves to confirm the dismissal. No bat on it, three reds, and that's plumb"
"slogged out towards long on, and the fielder is a little slow getting in off the rope, the ball dropping well in front of him"
"glanced off the pads, just wide of short fine leg"
"<b>reverse sweep</b>, over point and it bounces away. Gurbaz turned himself around and lifted it cleanly over the infield"
"<b>caught at cover, but it's a no ball!</b> That is a massive error. Gurbaz sliced his drive into Masakadza's hands, but Williams has over stepped and rather than a wicket, it's a Free Hit"
"fired in full and fast, and he can't quite put it away, just the single to cover"
"short and wide outside off, and it's cut out to the cover sweeper"
"<b>now he gets him!</b> Gurbaz walks across to the off side but leaves his stumps exposed, Williams firing in a full ball that scoots behind his legs and clatters into the timber. The umpire asks them to have another look for the no-ball ... but this one is a legitimate delivery, just! Williams really pushing the line though"
"almost chopped on! Mpofu angles one in from around the stumps, and Najibullah bottom edges his cut <i>just</i> past the stumps"
"and now he <b>beats the drive</b> outside off. It was a slower ball, well wide of off, and Najibullah drove over the top of it"
"short, and he splices an aerial pull out towards long on. 'Catch it!' Mpofu shouts, but it's well short of the fielder"
"<b>top edged, over the keeper!</b> Nabi didn't know too much about this. It was a slower bouncer, and he played too early at it, taking his eyes off the ball, which strikes the bat - or is his helmet? - and flies over Taylor's head for four"
"<b>caught at short fine leg, simple chance</b>. Three wickets in three overs, and Zimbabwe are clawing their way back. Mpofu delivers another slower cutter, on his legs, and Nabi top edges his flick into the leg side. Jarvis takes a few steps in from fine leg, and makes no mistake"
"angled in to him, and rising off a length. Najibullah hops and fends towards midwicket for a quick single"
"tapped down just wide of point, quick single"
"floaty, low full toss on his legs, and it's clipped down to long on to get off the mark"
"<b>a big heave, sliced and caught!</b> Tino delivers a googly, going across him and taking the top edge of Najibullah's slog sweep. Madziva and Mutumbami are both interested in the catch, but it's Madziva, running across from short third man, who calls for it and holds on"
"another low full toss, and it's tapped to cover"
"googly, spinning in to him, and Niazai picks it at the last moment, defending to point"
"slogged into the leg side, but it's poorly timed and just the single. But his international account is now open"
"nicely bowled, angling in to him, and it's pushed softly to cover"
"off the inside half of the bat now, the ball rushing straight on, and it bounces down to fine leg"
"very full, nicely straight, and he drives to long on"
"crunched down to long on, one more"
""
""
"speared in full, and he drives to cover"
"dug in back to Williams, who fires a throw back to the keeper"
""
"<b>clears long on!</b> Pitched up, and Gulbadin holds nothing back on the drive. He gets enough on it to beat Burl down at the boundary's edge"
"tapped to leg, and Williams himself sets after it, keeping them to one"
"pulled away, in the air but falling well short of Mutumbami in the deep"
"very full, aimed at the stumps, and he drives down to long on"
"slower ball bouncer, and it loops up and past Gulbadin's pull"
"this time it's the full pace bouncer, and it rushes on to him, hurrying another attempted pull. The ball bursts off the splice, and Ndlovu holds the skied catch at deep midwicket"
"<b>no ball, and it's slashed away!</b> Jarvis over steps as he delivers a full, wide one outside off that is slashed down to third man. Free Hit coming up ..."
"slow legcutter, 113km/h, and it's cracked to Burl at point"
"slow bouncer, jammed into the pitch. Rashid buckles his knees as it rises past his pull. There's some confusion as the square leg umpire calls no-ball, thinking Jarvis had bowled too many bouncers in the over. But it's the first one, as the bowler himself points out"
"offcutter, on the stumps, and it's punched down to long on"
"down the track comes Rashid, swatting a short one over wide long on with a fierce tennis-style forehand. It pings out of the middle, and over a leaping fielder near the boundary. And that brings up the 150"
an inside edged heave brings a single to fine leg
"<b>Mpofu has another!</b> He delivers a slower cutter, full and outside off. Niazai aims for the stands down the ground, but can't get enough on it, Burl holding a regulation chance down at long on"
"Mpofu pushes his line wide outside off, Rashid fetching the ball down to long on for a single"
"<b>gone first ball!</b> Asghar has come in down the order, and fallen first ball. The ball was full and wide outside off, and he sliced underneath it to present a steepling chance to Ndlovu, running back from short third man. He tumbles over as he takes the catch, but holds on to give Mpofu his career-best figures in this format"
"cracking finish from Mpofu, delivering another full, wide delivery that beats Rashid's booming drive"
"starts with a fuller one straying down the leg side, Taylor sweeps it fine and beats the man at 45"
"goes down the ground this time, it was fuller on the stumps, Taylor took a big stride forward and lofted it over long-on for a six"
