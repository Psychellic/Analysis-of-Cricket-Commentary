fuller and driven towards long-on
"length ball angling in, punches it towards long-off"
"<b>a brilliant catch from Allen</b>. Was fuller outside off, Gunathilaka went down on one knee and looked to smash it down the ground but ended up mistiming and instead hit it just to the right of the bowler, who showed great reflexes to take it one-handed to his right and cling on to it"

down the track and drives it along the ground towards long-off

use of feet. Isn't to the pitch of the ball but chips it over extra cover for a couple
"<b>a top edge this time and Holder pouches it.</b> Length ball around off and middle. Dickwella went for the slog sweep, was aiming to go over midwicket but got a top edge and the ball ballooned towards wide mid-on. Holder took a few steps to his left and grabbed it. Sinclair brings out the somersault"
dropped short but flat and quick. Hurries on to the batsman who pulls it towards deep square leg

"length ball on middle and leg, flicked towards midwicket. A brilliant stop by Powell to his right to keep it to one"

"length ball on middle and leg, flicked towards deep square leg"
"length ball angling away. Mathews was looking to work on the leg side, gets a thick outside edge towards point"

"length ball, 111kph, on the stumps. Chandimal defends it into the offside and they take a comfortable single"
"an aggressive shot after a while, and thanks to a misfield at fine leg, it yields a boundary. This is a shortish ball at Chandimal's waist and he swivels to whip that powerfully through fine leg. Sinclair, down on the boundary there, lets it burst through his hands"
"this is shorter and at the ribs. Chandimal pulls it, but without a lot of power. Sinclair gets behind this one easily at fine leg"
"short of a length - comes up to about waist high for Bandara, who tries to pull it but is through the shot early, and it hits the toe of the bat. they take one as it dribbles off to the offside"
"slower ball I think. Chandimal lets it go expecting it to be a wide, but the umpire doesn't call it wide. Just inside the tram lines I think"
this one is a wide. Just on the other sie of the tram lines
"length ball on the pads, clipped to fine leg for a single"
"short of a length delivery, angled across Bandara from over the wicket. Pitches on the stumps and goes away, and Bandara can't connect with his cut shot"

"length ball angled into the stumps. Bandara defends into the offside (towards point) and looks for a single, but is wisely turned back"
"loopy slower ball, very full and just outside off. Bandara tires to hit it back past the bowler but can't beat Bravo who gets a hand to it and stops it dead"

"loopy slower ball again, at 92kph. Fullish and on the stumps. Bandara gets over the top of it and turns it around the corner to short fine leg for one"
"fullish ball, pace-on this time, just wide of off stump. Chandimal tries to flay this through mid off, but can't time it. Can only hit it back to the bowler really, who runs to his right to field it"
"fullish ball, on the stumps, driven down to long on for one"
"fullish ball on the stumps, and Chandimal plays his best stroke of the innings so far to get a boundary. He's over the top of this and whipping it aerially over square leg for four. Helped by the fielder out there who misjudged the trajectory at first"
slower ball bouncer outside off stump I think. CHandimal gets bat to it and runs to to third man for a single
"fullish again and on the pads, clipped along the ground for a single"
"slower ball, length outside off. Chandimal gets back and drags this with a cross bat to long on. They look for two but there's only a single"
"incredibly slow slower-ball bouncer at 86kph. This is coming very slowly at Bandara's helmet. He stands up and swipes it to the legside, and finds enough space to get a single"

"yorker on off stump, an offcutter, drilled down to long on for one"

"fullish ball outside off, pace-on. Chandimal tries to flay this between mid off and cover and misses."
yorker on the sumps at 132kph. Chandimal whips this to deep midwicket for a single
"oof, hit in the air towards that deep midwicket fielder, but it falls short. This is another slower ball, length, on the stumps. Bandara gets low to sweep it through the air but doesn't connect well. It lands a couple of metres in front of the fielder running in"
"length ball outside off, Bandara has an almighty swing at that one as well, trying to slam it with a cross bat over long on. But again mis-hits it. It falls short of the fielder running in yet again"
"slower ball I think, length on the stumps. Chandimal swivels to hit this around the corner to fine leg"
"slower ball, at 102kph. It's fullish and Bandara is through his big swing across the line way too early. gets to the keeper after a couple of bounces"
"he connects finally. Back of the hand slower ball from McCoy, who pitches it on a length, on about off stump. Bandara gets low and brings that big sweep out again. Hits it behind square on the legside and just clears the boundary. First six of the innings"
"another big shot across the line to this fullish ball outside off.  There's pace on this one though, and it flies off the outside edge over short third man and on to the boundary"

"that's powerfully struck! Full delivery outside off stump. Bandara gets low in his stance and blasts this past mid on, slightly aerially, for four"
"gets the yorker right this time. This is right in the blockhole, and Bandara can't dig it out. It zips past leg stump"
"slower bouncer outside off stump, takes an age to get to Bandara, who bashes this to leg in the air. Again it bounces a few metres in front of the deep midwicket fielder and they take one"
"fullish delivery outside off stump, driven powerfully to long off, but there's only a single there"
"fullish ball, 128kph, Holder going for the wide yorker I think. Bandara throws his bat at it and hits it to long off for a single"
"a three! This is a slower ball, shortish outside off stump. Chandimal tries to crash it through cover point but doesn't time it as well as he might like. But the offside sweeper has a lot of work to do, and just manages to pull it back from the rope with a dive. They have enough time to run a comfortable third"
"yorker on the stumps, which Chandimal tries to bash down the ground, but it goes off the inside edge into his own pads. They run one as the ball stops on the pitch"
"fullish ball, which Bandara tries to hit to leg, but mistimes it, and the ball dribbles off behind square on the off side. They scamper through"
"another full ball, almost a yorker. Chandimal takes a couple of steps forward and whips this ball to deep midwicket, and gets it far enough from the fielder there that they can sprint two"
"yorker again, on the stumps, hit down to long on for a single. That's Chandimal's fifty off 42 balls. Valuable innings"
"fullish ball wide of off stump, which Bandara tries to scoop over his shoulder, having shuffled all the way to off. Doesn't connect through."
"length ball, slower one wide of off stump. Bandara tries to drag it to the legside, but is through the shot early, and ends up hitting it out towards cover and they take one"
"attempts the wide yorker first up. Bandara reaches for it, but that's too wide, and the umpire calls it"
"gets it right this time, angled way across the batsman, and yorker length. Bandara throws the bat at it and hits it to the offside sweeper"
"full delivery again, wide of the stumps once more. Hit to deep backward point"
"wide yorker again, and Bandara can't connect. Could probably have been called wide"
"again it's the full, wide delivery, which Bandara slaps past cover and the they sprint two as the sweeper runs around to cut that off"
attempted yorker again but closer to the stumps this time. Hit down to long on for one
slower ball I think - length outside off. Chandimal tries to clobber this down the ground but only gets it as far as mid off and they amble through for one
"oh wow, that was so slow it took an age to get to Chandimal, who is trying to play a pre-determined scoop/sweep over short fine leg. But this is a full toss outside off stump at 70kph. He ends up shoveling it to short fine leg for just a single"
"clean strike! The cleanest of the evening. This is ion the stumps and in the slot for Bandara, who swings through the line and sends it high over the bowler's head for six."
"slower length ball outside off stump - an offcutter - which Bandara wallops down the ground again. He hits it with a cross bat past the bowler, and gets enough power into it that the deep fielders can't get across to it"
wide-ish yorker which Bandara throws his bat at and misses
"yorker on middle stump, which Bandara drills back past the bowler but without a lot of power. They take one."
"yorker on the stumps. All Chandimal can do is clip that, off balance, to deep midwicket."

length ball outside off from around the wicket and Lewis cuts it between cover and point for four
"a touch fuller outside off, defended on the front foot"
"fuller again, pushes it towards extra cover"
"short of length around off, rocks back and pulls. Manages to just clear the fielder, Ashen Bandara, who ran to his left and dived but it was still away from him"
"<b>an appeal for lbw</b> but given not out. A length ball on the pads, misses the flick and is struck on the pads. Was going down maybe"

"length ball around off, Lewis looks to smash it over mid-off but gets a thick outside edge towards third man"

"length ball on the stumps, tucked away towards square leg"
"fuller around off, looks to defend but gets a <b>thick outside edge</b> towards short third man"

"fuller outside off, comes forward and drives it towards extra cover"
"fuller and quicker on the stumps, goes for the pull and beats short fine leg. Sandakan there, he puts in the chase but fails to flick it back"
"length ball around off, goes back and flicks it towards midwicket"
"fuller and wider outside off, smashed by Lewis but fails to find the gap. Straight to Bandara at extra cover"
fuller outside off and this time Lewis goes aerial. Over the mid-off fielder for a one-bounce four
"a bouncer from Chameera in response. Lewis, who loves to pull generally, ducks under it"
"length ball at the batsman, Lewis attempts the pull this time but the ball skids on to cramp him. An inside edge on to the back leg. Gets a single as the ball dribbles behind point"
"fuller on the stumps, clears his front leg and goes over the bowler's head. Not the best of the connections but still enough on it to clear mid-on with ease"
"length outside off, guided towards third man by Simmons. West Indies are not looking to smash everything out of the park tonight"
<b>dropped!</b> Gunathilaka drops a sitter at long-on. Was a full toss and Simmons took a step or two down and backed himself to clear long-on. Was into the wind and therefore it didn't go all the way. An easy chance but grassed
"fuller on the stumps, defended back"
"<b>a big appeal for lbw</b>. Given not out and Sri Lanka opt for the review. Was a length ball on the stumps, Lewis went for the sweep but failed to connect and is hit in front. The only question in my mind is if it pitched in the line of the stumps. No, it didn't. Just outside leg stump and the on-field decision stays as it is"
"<b>this time it's plumb</b>. The finger goes up and Lewis doesn't review. Sri Lanka have got a breakthrough. Was a googly from Hasaranga, landed on middle and leg this time. Lewis once again went for the sweep and missed. Was hit on the pads in front. Think it would have clipped the off stump. Replays show it would have smashed the off stick in fact"
"fuller on the pads, flicked towards midwicket to get off the mark"
"length outside off, goes for the cut but there isn't enough room. Chopped towards short third man"
"fuller around off, comes forward and blocks"
"length ball on the pads, looks to glance but misses. Gets a leg-bye to short third man nonetheless"
"dropped short but it's straight at the batsman. Simmons backs away and hits it down the ground. A brilliant stop by Thisara at mid-off, diving  to his right to keep it a dot"
"too full and Simmons gives it his all, clearing his front leg. Thisara once again puts in the dive but had no chance this time"
"length ball at the stumps, rocks back and pulls it over the deep square leg fielder. All the way for a six"
"short, some room outside off and Simmons is in no mood to miss out tonight. Cuts it hard through covers and the fifty comes off for West Indies inside the powerplay"
"fuller on the pads, pushed towards short midwicket"
"pitched up on the stumps, driven gently towards long-off"
uses his feet but Hasaranga pulls his length back. Pushed on the off side in the end
"fuller on the stumps, pushed towards extra cover"
loses his patience. I thought the plan was to play Hasaranga out. Skips down the track and looks to smash it over the bowler's head but his feet are nowhere near the pitch of the ball. Misses it altogether - kept a touch low as well - and Dickwella whipped the bails off
"length ball around off, Pollard pushes at it. Was early into the shot and a result the ball goes in the air but well short of the bowler even though Hasaranga dived forward"
"length ball outside off, defended by Gayle"
a short one but angling down the leg side. Gayle lets it go and encashes a wide
another attempted short ball. This one hardly rises but the lines is once again down the leg side. Another extra for West Indies

length ball but straying on the pads. A tickle from Gayle to pocket a boundary to fine leg
"length ball around off, punches it towards mid-off and sets off for a quick single. Easily done in the end"
"fuller around off, comes forward and defends it towards point"
"<b>big wicket, Pollard falls for a duck.</b> It was a length outside off, Pollard fished at it, looking to get a single to third man but managed only an outside edge. A good tumbling take by Dickwella as the ball was dying on him"

"fuller on the leg stump, Gayle looks to push at it but is off-balanced and almost falls down. A wide though"

too full and Pooran hits it square of the wicket on the off side. Sweeper cuts it off
"pitched up outside off, Gayle looks to hit down the ground but fails to middle. A single to long-on"
"length outside off, cuts it towards sweeper cover for one more"
"short, wide ball, slapped away in front of square to the sweeper on the offside"
darted into the pads. Gayle gets bat to it and works it around the corner on the legside for one
"shortish ball, pitching on the stumps and straightening slightly, Pulled away powerfully behind square on the legside but there's a man there"
tossed up way wide of off and turning away. Gayle reaches for it and slaps it out towards point for a single
"flattish ball on the stumps, swept fine but without a lot of power. Short fine leg chases it down"
"flatter ball outside off stump, just bunted to point"
"shortish ball, pitching outside off and turning away. Pooran pulls it and gets it to wide long on, but its' cleaned up by the fielder there"
"flatter stock ball, pitching on middle and straightening. Gayle blocks"
"got him in the flight! Gayle's struggles in this series continue! This is tossed up beautifully from Sandakan, who lures Gayle into a big drive. But then Sandakan has it dipping, pitching on about middle, and turning to beat the shot. It clatters into the wickets. Sri Lanka are keeping themselves in this"
"slower, tossed up ball, pitching on off and straightening. Played back to the bowler"
"tossed up, pitching outside off, straightening. Hit down to long off for a single"
"floated up outside off again, and straightening. Pooran gets on the back foot and punches this wide of mid off for a single"
"this is tossed up wide of off stump, slapped away through cover for a single"
floated up on to the toes. Holder clips it straight to short midwicket
"darted in, pitching on middle. Holder hits this to long on for a single"
"darted in again, angled from around the wicket. This length ball is just hit into the offside infield and they can't run"
"quick, flat and into the pads. Pooran goes back and hits this to long on"
"floated up outside off, driven hard, but straight to cover"
"Pooran's sick of nurdling it around. He takes aim at this floated up delivery pitching outside off, and sends it hiiiigh over long on for six. First boundary in a bit and West Indies will feel a lot better after that"
"flatter ball, pitched outside off and turning away slightly. Pooran cuts it but it goes off the outside half of the bat to Mathews at short third man. They take a comfortable one"
"floated up, pitching on middle and straightening, played back to the bowler"
"flatter, and full, pitching outside off driven by Holder straight to cover"
"slower through the air this time, but pitching full again outside off stump. Driven to long off"
"this is hiiigh, and Pooran hasn't hit that cleanly. It doesn't matter though. There's enough power in the shot to send it sailing over the long off boundary. He cleared the front leg, and opened his shoulders - the ball pitching wide of off stump. It came off the top half of the bat and the long off fielder might briefly have thought he was in with a shout"
"length ball outside off, defended by Holder. It takes the inside edge, ricochets on to pad, and they run one as it rolls out into the offside"
"bowled! That's a special delivery from Chameera. Sri Lanka are not going down without a fight, and for the first time in this game, it's a quick bowler that's imposing himself. This was a length ball angled in from around the wicket to the left hander. But when it pitches, it leaves the batsman slightly, and Pooran is playing down the wrong line. It beats his outside edge and clips the top of off stump. Chameera is ecstatic"
"length ball into the pads, defended into the legside, where Mathews fields it at midwicket"
"short of a length ball at 140kph, angled into Powell's midriff. He blocks it"
"played and missed. This is almost Test-match bowling from Chameera. It's a back of a length ball outside off stump. Powell pokes at it and misses, because this has hit the seam and bounced a bit"
"length ball on the pads, defended to midwicket."
legbreak to start. Pitching wide of off stump and straightening. Holder plays it back to the bowler
"legbreak again, tighter into the stumps and a little flatter this time. Holder goes back and knocks this to long on for a single"
"slider, I think, floated up wide of off stump. Powell reaches for it and paddles it around the corner towards fine leg"
"leg break. He beats Holder in the flight and hits his pad, but that one is sliding down leg. There's an aborted appeal."
"big shot from Holder. This is also a legbreak I think, and he aims a big heave and gets an inside edge, which skims off towards fine leg. They run one"
just about keeps it out. A flattish legbreak pitching on the stumps and heading towards off. Blocked back down the pitch
"slider to start, angled across the right-hander and keeps going with the arm. Holder prods at it and misses"
"tossed up, pitching outside off, driven hard down the ground, but Thisara Perera is there at long off to keep it to one"
"Powell's taken a risk and it's paid off. He rocks way back into his crease and turns a fullish delivery into a shortish one, and pounds it over long on. The fielder thought he was in the game but that's over his head. Didn't time it perfectly, but got it well enough"
"gone now. Whenever West Indies get themselves some breathing room, Sri Lanka keep pulling themselves back into it. This is another slider, which Powell goes back to again and makes a mess of. It skids into the top of the off stump and Sandakan has responded strongly to that big shot."
"two in two for Sandakan! He tosses one up outside the leg stump to Bravo to start with, and it's the googly, so while it's pitched way outside leg, it's coming back into the stumps. Bravo gets down to paddle sweep it, but the googly has bounced a bit and it takes the top edge and floats out to short fine leg where a simple catch is taken."
"oof, googly again. This is pitching on about leg stump, and is bowled very slowly. Turns away from Allen, who gets back and blocks it"
bit of a loosener to start. Shortish ball pitched outside off and it's hit to long off. What's this? Holder isn't trusting Allen with the strike. He turns down the single.
"leg break again, shortish again, hit to long on, and they are turning down the single again"
"legbreak, floated up outside off, and Holder gets forward to defend. But it's a no ball."
"oh dear, Hasaranga has bowled so well, but this could be a big moment. This is a flattish legbreak wide of off stump. Holder clears the front leg and swings it high over long on for six"
"legbreak again, not turning a lot, defended back to the bowler"
"tossed up this time, a big-turning leggie, which pitches outside off and turns away from Holder's forward defence"
"googly I think, but Holder's back in the crease waiting for it. He blocks it out"
"That has gone miiiiiiiiiles. It's been an off-night for Dananjaya, and this is a terrible way to start this over. This is a shortish ball on the legs. Allen gets back and absolutely lays into it, sending it high over deep square leg for six. That's on the roof!"
"googly I think, floated up on to the pads. Allen aims a big heave but it takes the outside edge and goes skimming off towards short third man"
"Dananjaya is a bit rattled here, and he sends down a gift to Allen - a full toss at about shin-height on leg stump. Exactly the ball he would have wanted. He doesn't miss out. It's another huuuuuge six over deep midwicket. the  roof is taking a battering"
shortish wide ball outside off. Allen reaches for this and slaps this to the cover sweeper
"tossed up on the stumps, almost a full toss, driven to long on. West Indies don't need to be ambitious now"
"Allen finishes it off with another huge strike! This is tossed up on the stumps. Allen gets low and clobbers this high into the night, over cow corner to seal the match and the series. That's not as big as the others, but it's massive nonetheless."
