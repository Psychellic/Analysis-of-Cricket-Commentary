"gone, Wagner is causing all kinds of discomfort here. Mahmudullah has been jumping back and across at everything, and this one isn't all that short. It's angling across towards off stump, and it stops on the batsman a little. Ends up playing a nothing flick at it, and popping the simplest of catches to square leg"

"beauty. Length ball, angling into the fourth-stump channel and straightening off the seam. Latham comes forward to defend, and the ball slides past his outside edge. Did well to play close to his body and not follow the movement"
"back of a length on leg stump, defended back towards the bowler"
"bouncer, goes through to the keeper at gentle pace after Raval sways away from the line"
"good ball, shortish and straightening late over the top of the stumps. Raval leaves it on length, raising his arms high over his head"

"full on middle and leg, defended back to the bowler"

"back of a length, fifth-stump line, left alone. This one leaves the batsman off the seam"
"pretty good bowling so far this over. A fuller length than the previous ball, in the fourth-stump channel, and Latham gets on the front foot and has a close look before electing to leave it"
"back of a length. slightly wider, left alone"
"fullish, angling into off stump, clipped neatly into the on side and Mominul dives right to cut it off at midwicket"
"back of a length, close to off stump, lets it come on and blocks towards backward point"
"big appeal for lbw but this is pitching outside leg, surely. Looks to defend, showing the full face of the bat, and this nipped in off the seam to beat the inside edge. Lots of bounce too, so height may have also been an issue"

"some inswing on this occasion, a full ball that's nearly in the blockhole, on middle stump. Keeps his front pad out of the way and blocks to mid-off"
"big appeal, and umpire Palliyaguruge says not out. Excellent delivery, angling in and straightening towards off stump from a good length. Latham is stuck on the crease and hit on the back leg. Looks close on replay too - not sure why Bangladesh didn't review this. Height may be an issue. It is, according to Hawkeye, which says it's comfortably missing the top of off"
"and again, angles in before nipping away off the seam. Shorter and in the corridor, and Latham pokes and misses"
"gone, what a great sequence of deliveries this is. Again some seam away from the left-hander, but this time he pitches it full and outside off stump, enticing the drive away from the body. Latham obliges, and sends a thin edge to Liton Das behind the stumps. The length was just perfect, because it was full without being a half-volley, and there was just enough of distance between where the ball pitched and where it met Latham's edge for it to move that small, lethal amount"
"zips past the edge again. Back of a length from over the wicket, pitching on leg stump and jagging away considerably to beat the back-foot defensive"
"full on the pads, clipped to deep backward square leg"
"ooh, full and curving away late in the fourth-stump channel. Good leave from Williamson"
"full again, angling into off stump. Brings his bat down beautifully straight to drive to mid-off"

"length ball outside off, left alone, a bit of nip back but it started wide enough to not worry Williamson too much"
"ooh, extra bounce. Back of a length, angling across towards off stump. Looks to defend off the back foot and it takes off and hits him on the back elbow. Ouch"
"and now he slides one past the edge. Back of a length, lands it on off and middle with the seam upright, and it sneaks away to beat Raval's back-foot defensive"
"length ball, very close to off stump, but he trusts the bounce and leaves it alone"
"on the pads now, clipped into the backward square leg region"
"back of a length, and it jags back in with extra bounce to beat Williamson's hopping back-foot defensive and hit him on the stomach"
shortish in the fifth-stump channel. Jumps to ride the bounce and punches into the covers
"excellent leave. The angle was inward, from round the wicket, and the length was on the fuller side of a good length,and it leaves Raval off the seam to end up a foot or so outside off stump"
"length ball, a little straighter, gets on the front foot to block it back down the pitch"
"spoons it, and Jayed has sent back both openers! Full outside off, looked like a driving length, but it's stopped on the batsman and left him ever so slightly, and he's hit it uppishly and straight to the man at cover"
"what a start. Full outside off, and Taylor's batting outside his crease so this turns into even more of a half-volley. Taylor leans his weight into the drive at the perfect moment to send it scudding away wide of mid-off"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"full again, some width on this occasion, and Taylor's bat flashes down like a scimitar to drive this to the cover point boundary"
"length ball in the fifth-stump channel, left alone"
"ooh, that's a lot of seam movement back into the right-hander. Lots of bounce too, and it roars over the top of off stump after Williamson leaves it"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump. Steps neatly back and across to tuck it through square leg"
"in the blockhole on off stump, some late inswing too, and Taylor pulls his front leg away from the line and jams down to dig it out towards mid-on"
"shortish, angling into off stump. The angle and extra bounce open Taylor up but he plays close to his body so the ball stays down in the point region despite hitting him on the gloves"
"back of a length, angling down leg, Williamson misses the glance, or gets a tiny tickle of glove on it, but the more significant contact is off thigh pad and it rolls away to the fine leg boundary"
"shot, and that's excellent fielding at gully. Not particularly short or wide, but it doesn't need to be for Taylor to play that trademark square cut of his. Gully dives full-length to his right to stop the fierce hit, however"
"back of a length, closer to off stump, defended into the cover point region"
"length ball angling down leg. Plays around his front pad to work it towards fine leg. Off pad only, the umpire signals"

"back of a length, extra bounce in the corridor, and Taylor goes at it with hard hands. An angled-bat punch, and the thick edge flies away to the right of second slip"
"Taylor's going for his shots today. This is barely a short ball, just short of a good length on off stump, and Taylor plays a bottom-handed whip-pull to the right of the tumbling mid-on fielder"
"length ball close to off stump, lets it come on and drops it into the point region with soft hands"
"wide length ball, left alone"
"back of a length, fourth-stump line, jumps back and across to block it back to the bowler"
"back of a length again, a touch wider, punched to backward point"
"length ball angling down leg. Misses the flick, and the ball clips his thigh pad on the way to the keeper Liton, who fumbles after moving left to concede leg-byes"
"shortish, angles into the batsman's hip and Williamson puts it away easily, tucking it away to the fine leg boundary, a long way to the right of the fielder on the rope"
"length ball straightening towards middle stump. Williamson plays back and defends, showing the full face, careful not to close his bat face and expose the leading edge"
"beauty. Late movement in the corridor from the shorter side of a good length, and extra bounce too. Williamson doesn't really get forward or back, just shuffles a half-step and pokes at it, and is lucky not to edge it"
"fuller now, fourth-stump line. Nice smooth stride forward to defend into the cover point region"
"well bowled, a fullish length slightly wider outside off stump, asking the batsman to go for the drive away from his body. Williamson resists the temptation and leaves it alone"
"short and wide, perhaps too wide for Taylor to cut. Reaches out for the shot and fails to connect"
"back of a length, a bit of inward movement towards middle and off to cramp Taylor, who lets it come on and clips it watchfully, on top of the bounce, to midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, gets back and across to turn that to midwicket"
"ooh, not short or wide enough for the cut. Taylor is capable of cutting even those balls, but it nips in slightly with extra bounce and hits high on the bat, on the sticker, and bounces down into the pitch, just behind him"
"back of a length close to off stump, and Taylor isn't sure whether to play or leave. Decides late to defend, and meets the ball almost behind his body. Ball rolls down towards the slips"
"a touch too straight now, similar length to the previous two balls, and Taylor tucks it away to long leg"
"is that a <b>drop</b>? Looks like it. Fullish outswinger wide of off, continues to leave the batsman late as he reaches out to drive. Ends up hitting it in the air, to the left of Mahmudullah at short extra-cover, and it's at catchable height as he dives but he can't hold on"
"wow. Shortish in the corridor, and it takes off and zips past the edge as Taylor shapes to punch off the back foot"
"<b>another drop!</b> This one's a harder chance, Shadman Islam diving to his left from second slip, in front of first slip, and it's dying as it reaches him, but he gets both hands to it. Lovely length in a tight fourth-stump channel, and Taylor has a little push at it"
"length ball on off stump, gets across and defends into the on side"
"fullish on off stump, stops on Taylor slightly as he looks to punch down the ground. The shot hangs in the air briefly, but out of reach of the bowler and to his right"
"goes wider of the crease and angles this one in sharply towards off stump. It's quite full, but Taylor doesn't really get a stride in to drive, just throws an angled bat at it, aiming into the covers. The angle nearly does him in, but a thick inside edge onto his back pad saves him"
"back of a length outside off, a bit of nip back in. Williamson hops to ride the bounce and punch into the covers, and ends up hitting it to mid-on off the inside half of the bat"
"bouncer, angling a little down leg. Williamson ducks down low to get under it"
"short, wide, and Williamson rocks back and across to cut it away fiercely between cover point and backward point"

"much fuller now, angling into a fourth-stump line, jabbed to short extra-cover"
"shortish again, plenty of width. Throws his bat at it and slashes it away between second slip and gully"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, much better line and length, clipped watchfully towards mid-on"
"ooh, interesting. Taylor takes a couple of steps down the pitch before the bowler releases, and he sends one down the leg side in the attempt to cramp Taylor for room. Aims to whip over square leg, can't connect"
"length ball angling into middle stump, defended into the on side"
"ooh, streaky. Shortish, angling away into the sixth-stump channel, and he gets some extra bounce. Williamson goes for the back-foot drive, away from his body, and sends a thick edge flying between second slip and gully"
"past the edge. Wobbly seam, lands on a good length, angles this across the stumps, pitches on about middle and off and forces Williamson to play. A little bit of away movement too. Doesn't push at it, though, keeps bat close to body, and allows it to zip past his edge"
"once again, angling away from off stump, and this time Williamson leaves it alone"
"back of a length, a bit of seam movement away from Williamson, pitching within the stumps and drawing him into playing at the ball. Pulls his bat away at the last moment"

"on the fuller side of a good length, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"well bowled. Late swing from a good length, going away from a middle-and-off line. Williamson plays the initial angle, looking to clip towards midwicket, and is opened up, sends a leading edge rolling into the point region"
"and Williamson sends one running away between first and second slip. Back of a length, and again Mustafizur's line makes him hesitate between playing and leaving. Defends late, close to his body, and that ensures the edge drops down into the turf, between the two diving slips"
"back of a length, a touch wider, left alone"
"extra bounce from just short of a good length, and Williamson defends nice and close to his body, causing the ball to bounce down a few feet away from him and climb high over the gully fielder"
"ooh, beauty. Back of a length, angling across Taylor. Pitches on off and middle or thereabouts and leaves him a touch with some extra lift. Taylor pokes at it and misses"

"back of a length, finishing around off stump, jumps back and across to clip it away to the right of midwicket"

"short, wide, cuts it hard but too close to backward point, where Mominul tumbles to his left to stop it"
"well bowled, not as short but a little wider, trying to entice Taylor into chasing this. Taylor ignores it"
"well bowled. Length ball angling across towards off stump, and Taylor's open stance makes him play across the line in defence, bat coming down from gully towards midwicket, and he sends a thick edge running towards backward point"
"full outside off, overpitched, and Taylor opens his bat face and plays a lovely square drive to the right of the diving backward point fielder"
"back of a length outside off, chopped away to deep point"
"lovely shot. Full, angling into off stump, and Taylor brings his bat down beautifully straight, showing the full face, and punches it back down the ground, ramrod straight, and umpire Palliyaguruge does well to jump up and over the ball as it hurtles towards him"
"length ball angling down leg, misses the flick and the ball rolls off his pad into the square leg region"

"overpitched outside off, gets on the front foot to ease a drive to the left of short cover"

It's swung away wickedly, squared him up with extra bounce, and he sends a thick edge to third slip where Southee takes it at waist height"
"full, slanting away from off stump, left alone"
"back of a length, angling across into the corridor, left alone"
"back of a length, swings back in towards off stump, blocked back towards the bowler"
"length ball swings back in and beats the inside edge of Shadman's half-forward defensive, lots of extra bounce too, to hit the thigh pad"
"trusts the bounce of this pitch and leaves on length, or he's completely misjudged the line - take your pick. Southee angles this across initially, and then it swings back to straighten into an off-stump line. Soars some four inches over off stump"
"back of a length now, steered into the point region"
"in the blockhole, swinging back in towards leg stump. Shadman hurriedly gets his front leg out of the way and looks to jam down on it. Thick edge runs away quickly past leg stump"
"full, angling across to off stump, gets his front leg out of the way again and defends into the covers - he's immensely aware of Southee's lbw threat, but that could open up other modes of dismissal"
"back of a length outside off, jumps across and frees his arms to punch through cover point"
"full, angling in towards off stump and threatening to swing away. Defended into the covers"
"drifts onto the pads, no swing on this occasion. Tucked away to long leg"
"back of a length, angling into a fairly wide line outside off, left alone"
"ooh, that nearly sneaks through. Full, swinging back in towards middle stump after angling across. Does well to get his front leg out of the way and jam his bat down to squeeze it towards midwicket off the inside half"
"shortish, rises up awkwardly towards the left ribcage. Jumps up to ride the bounce and fend awkwardly into the leg gully region"
"short again, slanting away into a tight line close to off stump. Does well to lift his hands high over his head and keep bat and gloves out of the way"
"full, angling across to a fourth-stump line, looks to drive and his bottom hand takes over a little. Hits it back towards the bowler instead of mid-off as, I suspect, he intended"
"lovely length, pitching on off stump and testing Shadman's judgment acutely - will this swing in or will it not? He watches it well and leaves it alone. It didn't swing back in enough to force a shot"

"full on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"shortish outside off, hops back and across to punch this away through cover point"
"full on middle and off, driven to mid-on"
"starts with a ripper, back of a length, slanting across the left-hander, threatening to swing back in but continuing across with extra bounce. Does well not to chase it with his hands, plays close to his body in defence and allows himself to be beaten"
"slants it across a little wider, left alone"
"sharp bouncer now, rising high over off stump. Thinks about hooking and then decides against it, choosing to weave out of the way instead"
"shot. Short, the angle gives Shadman a bit of width, and he uses the extra bounce of this surface to deliberately uppercut over point"
"beautiful. This is a length ball angling into a fourth-stump line, and he stays on the back foot to punch with a vertical bat through cover point"
"another good-looking shot, a cover drive to the full ball angling in from round the wicket. Can't beat the fielder at short extra, though."
"length around off, comes forward and defends"
"fuller on the stumps, clips it away towards square leg for a couple"

"length ball, pitching on off stump and continuing on with the angle across, good leave"

"on the pads, clipped into the square leg region"
"great delivery to start. Just short of a length, pitching on middle and off and curling away late to open up Soumya and beat his outside edge. Does well to keep his bat close to his body and not push at the ball"
"full now, on off stump, punched back to the bowler"

"full now, angling across into the fifth-stump channel, left alone. Didn't really get his front foot forward to that - may have been the effect of the previous two balls"
"length ball slanting across, pitching on off and continuing along the left-arm-over angle. Mithun leaves again"

"very full on off stump, almost in the blockhole, opens his bat face to squeeze it to the left of backward point"
"length ball, slanting away into a fifth-stump line, and Soumya throws his hands at a drive, a long way from his body. Southee has the covers packed, for a shot just like that, but on this occasion he slices it square, to the right of backward point"
"<b>dropped</b>. Knee-high full-toss on off stump and Soumya punches it back to the bowler, at about waist height, and he can't grab on while tumbling to his left in his follow-through. It didn't come off the bat with too much power at all"

"bouncer over leg stump, this time the line is more at the body and Mithun has to duck in a hurry"
"full outside off, driven to the left of short extra-cover"

"length ball in the corridor, left alone"

"fullish, just outside off, punched firmly to mid-off"
"and he gets his man - he's bowled a few like this today. Back of a length, hits a tight line close to off stump and gets it to straighten with extra bounce. Sarkar isn't behind the line to defend this, his feet are off the ground, and he gets a thick edge that Ross Taylor holds onto at first slip, catching it in front of his chest and falling backwards"
"awkward delivery to get first up, back of a length and nipping away slightly after pitching within the line of the stumps. Gets squared up and the thick edge doesn't carry to third slip"

short ball rising to chest height over middle stump. Stays leg side of the ball and gets off his feet to defend into the off side

"back of a length on off stump, blocked back towards the bowler"

"bouncer over off stump, rises steeply and he evades it with a half-crouch"
"good ball, back of a length and angling in towards the top of off stump. Mithun's bat comes down at an angle, from around gully - the open stance contributes to this - and he ends up slicing across the ball a little in defence, gets a thick outside edge towards point"
"fuller now, punched to mid-on"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, gets on the front foot to defend back towards the bowler"
"full on off stump and that's nicely put away, clipped away in the air, but into the big gap to the right of mid-on"

"what's he done here? Jumps away towards the leg side as Wagner bangs this in, angling across to off stump, and looks to ramp over gully. Can't connect, though"
"short again, attacking the left ribcage. Jumps back and across and tucks it towards fine leg"
"another bouncer, now Mithun steps away to the leg side to attempt that ramp over the slips. Bounces too high for him to connect"
awkward. Jumps back and across to another bouncer angling across towards off stump. Was he trying to fend it or leave it? Ends up basically letting the ball hit his chest - I hope he's wearing a chest guard

"<strong>falls in the no-man's land</strong>. Short one at the batsman, Mahmudullah fails to keep the pull down, ends up top-edging it towards square leg, Bocock chases it but cannot reach there, Raval was coming in from the deep square leg but I think he pulled out when he saw the keeper charging in, short leg was late to react anyway and had to turn around. In the end, it falls well away from Bocock"
