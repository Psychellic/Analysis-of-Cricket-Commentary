oof good short ball at 142kph. This is about chest height and angled into the body from slightly wide of the stumps. Abid bends out of the way like Neo from the Matrix
"another one! Pakistan have lost three wickets for one run, and this one is thanks to an outstanding catch from Aiden Markram at short leg. The ball is angled at the body again, and arrives at just above waist height for Abid, who attempts to get inside the line and turn it around the corner to fine leg. Only manages to get an inside edge to it though, and the ball hits his midriff and pops out toward Markram, who follows the ball beautifully to his right and snatches it before it hits the turf. Superb short-legging... he stayed low, stable, watched it perfectly."

"ooof thinks about hooking that. This is about head high and oh my it's over 150kph. That's serious, serious pace for a bouncer! Fawad gets inside the line and for a split second thinks about throwing his bat at it. Pulls out of the shot and it goes through to QdK who collects it above his head"
