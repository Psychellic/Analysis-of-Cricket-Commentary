He misses his leg-side flick and the ball hits his front leg. Tentative review from Lakmal, and the replays say he's gone. Pitched on off, and hits him in front of middle and leg.

"<b>appeal for lbw!</b> But not given. Went for the reverse sweep again, but the ball's fuller on off. Impact may just been outside off though, but <b>Bishoo wants to review.</b> It did pitch in front of off stump, but the ball spun away from the wickets, and impact was outside off. That should save Chandimal. And yes, impact outside off. He'll stay alive. <b>West Indies lose a review</b>"

"full and moving away from off stump, steers this towards deep point but refuses the run"
"punched into the covers, has no choice but to take the single this time. Chandimal wasn't too keen for a run but by the time he decided it wasn't worth the risk, Rajitha had already crossed him!"
"goes from around the stumps and bowls too short down leg, he ducks under it"
"cops a blow on the glove as he fends, rolls towards the slips. Ouch"
"is that the end of Rajitha? Is there some glove as it lobbed to slip? Aleem Dar doesn't think so, Holder reviews. This short ball was angled across from around the stumps, got big on Rajitha as he looked to avoid that. Perilously close to the left glove, but the ball appears to have brushed the right shoulder. The ball misses the front glove, clipped the bottom glove but the hand was off the bat at that point, <b> so that can't be given out </b>"

"floated full on middle from wide of the crease, defended back"
"edged and gone! Loose shot outside off, went for an expansive drive but was late on the stoke, only managed a thin edge through to Dowrich. Not the best shot to be playing when your captain is batting past his century at the other end."
"full outside off, this one nips back in but not enough to get him playing."
"full and wide, once again left alone"
"sees this short, there's no midwicket so he climbs into this. Slapped away to that region. He's going to play shots now"

"that's the end of that, or is it? Chandimal last man out, but what an innings this has been. Looks to work this through midwicket, only to get a leading edge that has been held at point. But, hey. Oh, wait. Roach has overstepped, <strong>so Chandimal survives. What drama!</strong>"
goes back and across to squirt this length ball to point
"taken this time! Full ball that swerves away late, he went for a drive, found a thick edge that has been snaffled nicely at gully. They checked for a no-ball again, no drama this time as his front foot is well behind the line."

"full on off, and shapes inwards after pitching. Blocked off the back foot to Lakmal"
"length ball on leg, and going down the leg side. Dickwella can't stop it with his diving effort and that's the first boundary of the over! <b>Byes though</b>"
"length ball outside off, and going to Dickwella from near his face. Left alone"
"length ball on middle, and ends up in Dickwella's gloves down the leg side. Uncontrolled swing so far"
"<b>bounce!</b> Full outside off, and takes a crazy bounce after pitching. Takes off - dust and all - after pitching and Dickwella has to jump to try and stop the ball. The batsman attempted to defend for the incoming ball, but the delivery held its line"
back of a length outside off. Brathwaite tiptoes and taps it to cover point
"full on off, and with some late tail added to the delivery. Flicked off his toes to wide long on, and they call late for the three. <b>Could be close</b> but Brathwaite manages to finish the third before the bowler can whip the bails off"
slides into the pads - in the attempt to keep the ball at the stumps - and Brathwaite picks him off to deep square leg
full and tantalisingly wide outside off. Smith is hungry for runs but not quite that hungry
shifts around the wicket and sends down a short delivery outside off. Smith ushers it through to the keeper like a gentleman
tucks this back of a length delivery off his hip to square leg
"draws him into playing with half a bat, but Lakmal doesn't quite have the same pace as Kumara and so Smith has that extra millisecond to correct his mistake. Softens the grip on his bat and blocks the short one towards point"
"snarls in off the pitch, but Smith plays a charming little nudge to fine leg."
"full and straight and it has the left-hander falling over. That late movement Kumara is getting is keeping Smith on the back foot, keeping him unsure about whether to come forward or back. The last-minute flick is absolutely useless"
"digs it in, hoping for the rib-cage, but the variable bounce on this pitch only allows it to get up to the stomach. Smith pulls it to fine leg"
"another one, speared in full and at the stumps. Smith tries to turn it to square leg but gets struck on the pad and weathers the lbw appeal"
"<b>there's the first boundary of the innings</b>! Clearly, the 100th ball is the charm! Comes out a full toss outside off and Brathwaite steers it behind point"
<b>steep bounce</b> as he hits the deck outside off. But that line isn't going to make Brathwaite play.
"that's better. He hits the pitch - and this one is being extremely friendly with him - and targets off stump. Brathwaite knows he needs to protect it and does so, squaring himself up and getting a bit of an outside edge"
"tosses it up from around the wicket, Smith lunges forward, trying to get to the pitch of it and blocks"
"heeeeyyy, you can't do that! This innings has been going along like a walk in the park but suddenly Smith leaps out from the hedges and scares the bowler silly with a heave over midwicket."
"all the way!! What is going on?!? Who flicked the T20 switch while I was asleep? Smith charges out again, much like he did the last ball, and smears a length ball over long-on. Stupendous"
nudges it off the back foot through midwicket
"tosses it up on middle, Smith is forward with a straight bat"
"the ball slides down leg and Smith is all set to flick it away. Then he decides he needs to be a bit more brutal. Attempts a pull shot. But to no avail. Have to be more decisive, mate. Like you were earlier in the over."
"good length on off stump, keeps it out"
shuffles in line with a fuller delivery on middle and off and turns it towards square leg
"<B>bottom edge</b>! And a panic-stricken Brathwaite turns back to survey his stumps, expecting wreckage, but the ball has taken a detour to the keeper. Another lucky escape for the opener. These short-of-a-length but not outright bouncers from Kumara, on and around off stump, are a real sight today. Brathwaite is set up to block, then wonders if he should leave, finally he plays a nothing shot and survives"
"bouncer outside off, sways away"
gets in line with a back of a length ball on and around off stump
"yorker on off stump, Brathwaite's defences are #Swag-like"
"loops it up on off stump, from around the wicket. Smith thinks of lofting it again - the backlift goes nice and high. But the ball dips lovely and low, making him defend instead"
goes back to a shortish delivery outside off and slides it to point
he's getting the offbreaks to dip nicely and as a result he is not letting Smith get to the pitch to smother the spin. A little extra bounce. And a knock on the splice of the bat
knocks it down to long-on
"<b>squares him up</b> with Brathwaite expecting the ball to turn in from outside off, but it just goes straight on"
"hangs back to a good length ball on off stump, reading it off the pitch and nudging it towards short leg"
"<b>inside edge</b> and the ball evades the stumps again. Oy, who stole Sri Lanka's luck?! Smith fell in this fashion in the last Test, lured by a full and wide delivery. He only just survives here against a similar delivery"
"<B>beaut</b>! This pitch with its patchwork quilt grass pattern is making some kick up and some keep low. This one hits back of a length and surges at Brathwaite's chest. He tries to block it, but ends up being beaten"
""
"goes full on off stump, and that hint of away seam secures the outside edge. Good on Brathwaite to play with soft hands"
"<b>sooo close to off stump</b>! The ball was practically whispering in its ear... 'I'll come for you later. Just wait.' Lovely stuff. Goes wide of the crease, and with that slingly arm action too. Hits a good length outside off, has the batsman leaving, and then sighing in relief"
"good length on off stump, defends"
"<b>picks the legbreak</b> and smears it through the covers. Oh, this is top-class batting from Brathwaite. Strong stride forward - so much that he was outside the crease when he makes contact. And then the full face of the bat wrapping up the image"
"good length offbreak, he goes back to block"
"quicker through the air, flatter in trajectory, straight at the stumps, Brathwaite is untroubled"
"veering to leg stump, Brathwaite turns it to short leg"
"looks for a single through mid-on, but Dananjaya dives across to his right, braving a collision with the non-striker, and grabs the ball"
shifts back to nudge a shorter delivery on leg stump to short leg
forces him back with a short ball but Smith knocks it down easily enough
"defends a shortish delivery on off stump. Rajitha, by the way, is continuing around the wicket with three slips"
"full, juicy and tempting outside off. Smith licks his lips but the voice in his head says 'it's not time yet.' So he leaves"
on the pads - the reward for his patience - and Smith accepts gratefully with a single behind square leg
"digs it into the middle of the pitch, but Brathwaite handles it well enough, getting up off his toes and blocking on top of the bounce"
"back of a length on off stump, blunts it again"
"looks ever so good on the forward defence. Head nice and low over the ball, front foot making way towards the pitch.."
shifts back against a shorter delivery on the stumps and blocks it
strides forward and judges the line of this one to be outside off. So no need to play
goes back to block a good length offbreak. Dananjaya is bowling slow. The pitch is taking pace off. Smith has all the time he needs
"another one that he plays from the safety of the crease, even though this time Dananjaya ramps his pace up"
presses forward to block a tossed up delivery outside off.
"<b>squares him up</b> with late movement away off the pitch. Brathwaite, however, by playing late and with soft hands makes sure the edge goes down"
"good length, outside off, Brathwaite ignores it like a text from an ex."
"<b>leading edge</b>! But it doesn't carry to the man at gully! Looks like the extra protection on the on side is a good idea. It's helping Rajitha bowl straight and the late movement is putting Brathwaite is big trouble. He's closed off, trying to flick through midwicket, and it's credit to the bowler for him making that mistake. The angle into the right-hander, the late movement, just lovely..."
"<b>given caught behind</b> but Brathwaite reviews immediately! Regardless of the decision - made by Aleem Dar - this is such a good cherry. Nice and full. Movement off the pitch. The batsman is caught in the crease, poking in front of his body, and Ultra-Edge confirms he has edged it. Special occasion for Rajitha - it's his maiden wicket in Test cricket. And what a ball it is too."
"flicks it through midwicket - late swing, who cares?! He gets a ball that starts off angling towards the slips, then it curls in off the pitch. Powell though is good enough to take it on. Key to that is not plonking his front foot too far across"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"<b>now we have turn</b>! Proper big turn, snarling past the outside edge. The length is short though, which is why Smith survives"
"<b>lbw appeal</b>! The wily Dananjaya pushes through the straight one, into the pads, right after the big offbreak. An inside edge saves Smith"
presses forward to block a fuller delivery on middle and leg
quicker but still full enough that Smith has to come forward and block
slower through the air and drawing Smith outside his off stump. Defence again
"full on off stump, keeps it out."
nudges a length ball off his pads through square leg
shifts back to present the full face of the bat to a short delivery on off stump
"full and outside off, draws Smith into a drive and beats him"
"targets the stumps, but with that slingy action and his going around the wicket, Smith has an easy put away through midwicket"
defends a good length ball in line with off stump
"looks to drive on the up but ends up inside edging a fuller delivery outside off through mid-on. And on that note, we head off for lunch"
"back of a length and outside off, from around the wicket, of course. Smith lets it sashay past"
shortish and a good distance outside off. Smith stands and waves buh-bye
hides the ball outside the off stump and Smith is all too happy to play this game. Or more accurately not play (a shot).
ventures a little closer to off stump and Smith punches the short ball to cover
short and wide. Smith shoulders arms and walks away to square leg. Deep breaths now.
"pitches it up, searching for the drive, and the outside edge but Smith remains boring. Excellently boring."
skews away to the third man boundary! Powell sees the opportunity to get on the front foot and drive on the up and he is not the kind to let it pass. Thick outside edge for much profit
"<b>direct hit would have had him!</b>! Powell wants to pinch a single, knocking the ball in front of point. It's fraught with risk and if Dananjaya had nailed the target at the non-strikers' - he was only inches away - West Indies would have lost another wicket"
"goes for the bouncer, the line goes down leg and Smith, the more composed left-hander, lets it go"
blunts a back of a length delivery on leg stump
covers the stumps and defends the good length ball on off stump to point
"bangs it into the deck, hoping to seem menacing, but Smith is not impressed. Rocks back and pulls it dismissively through midwicket"
full and only a shade outside off. But Smith's judgment of line today has been spot on. He knows he doesn't need to play
short and way too wide to draw Smith into a shot
"good length angling into the left-hander, but not quite enough to threaten the stumps. Smith plants his front foot and then hoists the bat skyward. Good stuff."
another leave as Lakmal keeps pitching it up but continues to be shy about approaching the stumps. Aw.
"either Lakmal is seeing a hologram of Smith batting five feet to the left of where he is, or bowling wide of off stump is part of the plan"
"nips in off the pitch, does this good length ball, and Smith leaves once again. Although this is a much tighter leave as the ball whooshes over off stump"
defends a fullish delivery on middle and leg stump
lashes it over the boundary behind point! Sensational strike - even more so because at first it almost seemed like he was about to leave this rank short and wide delivery. Eventually he realises he has runs for the taking and upper cuts beautifully
"back of a length on middle, keeps it out"
flirts with this short delivery angling across him and <b>almost nicks it</b> through to the keeper
"<b>another run-out chance</b>! Phew! What is with Powell and quick singles today?! He thumps the ball to mid-off, looking nothing short of a boss. But then he decides he wants runs for a shot as good as that and sets off. Puts in a full-length dive to try and beat Chandimal's throw and lives to tell the tale only because it isn't a direct hit"
"full and on off stump, Smith drives through cover"
"shortish on middle and leg, turns it around through midwicket"
<b>sharp inward movement</b>. Perhaps this's why Lakmal was bowling wide outside off..He wants Smith to leave on evidence of the initial line - as he does here - and then hope that the angle from around the wicket and the additional seam movement brings the stumps into play
"pitches it up outside off, Smith lunges forward and across - covering his stumps - and then leaves"
smashes the short ball through point. The outfield though isn't quite the most considerate.
spears it through the gap between point and gully. Excellent shot to a pretty rank half-volley.
"full on off stump, drills it to mid-off"
pulls the short ball to the left of midwicket. But Rajitha does well not to give away a single.
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
<b>beats him</b> with a fuller delivery at 143 kph. The width on the ball draws Smith into a shot. He see's a scoring opportunity but the movement off the pitch - which happens heinously late - foils his plans
"<b>just short of gully</B>! Smith is prepared for a short ball, but this one seems to be cramping him for room, and also bouncing a little higher than he wants it. Does his best to chop down on top of it and only just survives"
outside off and so he lets it go
"<b>nicks past second slip</b>! Well, he certainly has earned his luck today, even if it was these very deliveries that he was leaving not so long ago. Good length, on and around off stump. Forces his hands at the ball and benefits, even if he didn't quite plan it all perfectly"
goes back to a length ball sliding on with the arm from around the wicket and works it to wide mid-on
slices a shortish delivery outside off to cover point
"good length and outside off, Powell ignores it"
""
stands up tall and punches a shortish delivery down to long-on
"good length outside off, no shot"
"searches for the blockhole from around the wicket, and finds it too. But the batsman brings down a straight bat and negates its threat"
"bouncer now, a shade outside off, Powell ducks under it"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
presses forward to a fuller delivery on off stump and blocks towards mid-off
leans into a drive and has enough power on the shot to make the boundary at cover. Width on the ball brings out an aggressive shot from Smith
"<b>peach</b>! An absolute peach. Especially from around the wicket. It pitches in line with off stump, demanding the batsman to play, and then straightens off the angle, snarling past the outside edge. Even a set batsman has no chance"
shimmies down the pitch to defend a tossed up delivery on off stump
defends a full delivery on and around off stump
"reads a shortish delivery, goes back and blocks it"
"short again, allowing Powell to stay in the safety of his crease and block"
drives sweetly down the ground to long-on
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> but it's likely the ball has come off the inside edge first. Quicker delivery, flatter trajectory, somehow hurries off the pitch and catches Smith in the middle of his defensive push"
"another appeal for lbw, but this one is probably high. Kumara using the angle from around the wicket to target the stumps. A little movement in off the pitch helps beat the inside edge"
bangs it in short and slants it well down the leg side. Smith is happy not to do any work on this ball
pulls the short ball to deep square leg and raises his first Test fifty since comeback. Very gritty innings.
"<b>beats the edge</b> with a rip-snorter. So says the umpire at least, but Chandimal wants to <b>review</b> for caught behind. What a ball though. A Kumara special. Back of a length. Straightening off the angle from around the wicket. Surprising Powell. But luckily for him, he isn't anywhere close to the ball. Pretty poor review from Sri Lanka."
"sharp bouncer, looking for the throat of the left-hander. Powell does well too, not shying away, yanking the bottom hand off the straight bat. The perfect way to deal with a spitting cobra"
<b>beats the edge again</b> with a slightly fuller delivery. This angle from around the wicket is making the left-handers feel for balls they may not need to.
"full and on off stump, he lunges forward to block"
"pushes it through on middle and leg, Smith has to hurry into his defensive push"
"shortish and outside off, he cuts to point"
goes back and flicks a flatter delivery off to backward square leg
"nudges a length ball off his pads towards short fine leg. Powell wants a single, but he's sent back"
shifts back and blocks a good length delivery down the pitch
"bouncer, no need to bother with that, says Smith"
"full on off, and driven on the up. Struck firmly, but straight to mid on"
"length ball outside off, but taking a lot of bounce after hitting the deck. Goes through to the keeper as Powell shoulders his arms"
"back of a length on off, and gets big on Powell! He tries to defend off the back foot, but the ball hits his bat's shoulder and falls just short of second slip. Comes off the bat's handle, indicates the instant replay"
"full outside off, and that's been <b>caressed</b> through the covers. Half-volley in Powell's slot, and he's quick to shuffle onto the front foot. <b>Fifty partnership</b>"
"length ball outside off, and going through to Dickwella. Left alone by the batsman"
"length ball on middle, and that's been clipped off his hips to fine leg. Gets across to the other end"
"full, but wide outside off. Dickwella has to run to first slip to try and stop the ball. Does well, though"
"back of a length on off, and going further away from him. Shoulders his arms"
"back of a length on middle, in a bid to cramp the batsman. Does well, but Powell is up to the challenge. Tiptoes and works it to midwicket"
"length ball on off,and angling across his body. Left alone by Smith"
"back of a length outside off, and the ball's angling in slightly. Forces Smith to play at it, and he fends it to cover off the back foot"
"full outside off, and <b>drilled</b> through cover. Hit well, but the surface has been slowed down after the spell of rain. Chandimal races after it, and manages to cut it off from inside the boundary"
"length ball, but outside off stump. Powell steps forward to drive through cover, but the ball angles in and hits the inside-half of his bat. The ball trickles away to mid on"
"back of a length on off, and angling into the batsman's body. Tapped back to the non-striker"
"soft appeal for caught behind, but the bowler was never interested. Went short on middle, and sends the batsman swaying away from the ball's line. Tries to leave by dropping his hands, but the ball was perilously close to his glove"
"short outside leg, and this time it really does take off after pitching. Goes down the leg side, but Dickwella has to jump really high to intercept the ball"
"attempted yorker on off, but ends up as a low full toss. Driven to the on-side, but mistimed to midwicket"
"length ball on leg stump, and clipped away to square leg. Man there"
"<b>the extra ball fetches him a wicket!</b> Pretty rare. Full on off, and forces the batsman to drive. Takes the bat's outside edge, and goes in front of second slip. Mendis has to dive forward to complete the catch. The ball was always dropping on the fielder"
"back of a length outside off, but tailing in like crazy after hitting the deck. He shoulders his arms but the ball goes over the top of off stump. Keeps Rajitha interested"
"length ball outside off, and goes through to the keeper as Smith shoulders his arms once again"
"back of a length outside off. Angling into the batsman, and he punches off the back foot to cover"
"back of a length, but very wide outside off. No angle inwards either, and the delivery goes straight into Dickwella's gloves"
"full outside off, but shaping into Smith. He comes forward and drives towards cover. Comes off the bat's outside edge, and the delivery flies to point instead"
"full, and wide outside off. Comes tailing in though, but Smith covers his off stump and lets the ball go"
"back of a length outside off, and really does take off after hitting the deck. Goes under the batsman's armpits, and through to the keeper"
"back of a length outside off, and gets big on Hope again. He tries to defend off the back foot - and from near his face - & manages to push it towards Dananjaya at point"
"back of a length outside off, and whizzes past the outside of his bat. Could've easily taken the bat's outside edge. Hope tried to defend, but played the shot inside the delivery's line"
"full toss on off, and Hope punches it straight back to the bowler. Searching for the yorker, but slipping out of his hands"
"back of a length outside off, and takes off after hitting the pitch! Hope shoulders his arms, and Dickwella collects this ball from in front of his chest. Probing line, and asking questions to the batsman every single time"
"back of a length outside off, and Hope tiptoes in an attempt to defend. He's way inside the line of the ball though. Through to Dickwella, and that's a <b>maiden</b>"
"full outside off, and going through to the keeper. No shot offered from the batsman"
"length ball outside off, and once again carries through to the keeper. Smith's happy to let it go"
"length ball on middle, but going down leg. Smith, however, manages to nudge it behind square with the angle, and walks across for one. Fine leg cleans up in the deep"
"length ball outside off, and holds its line after pitching. On that annoying fourth-stump channel, and Hope attempts to defend. Keeps his bat hanging outside off, but the ball goes past it and through to the keeper"
"back of a length on the fourth-stump line, and almost takes the outside edge of Hope's bat. He defends inside the line of the ball again"
"overpitched outside off, and Hope comes forward for the cover drive. Mistimed, though, and that's why he'll only get two"
"length ball outside off, and jags away after pitching. Smith wanted to cut it square, but misses the shot. A false stroke from the set batsman"
"short outside off, but he was prepared for the length. Gets quickly into position for the pull, but hits this straight to midwicket"
"length ball outside off, and this time he leaves it alone. <b>The umpires have a chat again.</b> And it's stumps. Bad light."
bouncer first up! Hurries him with pace and gets it to climb pretty steeply as well. Smith scampers under it
"another short ball, Smith gets under it. Dickwella jumps and does well to gather it. Smith walks out for some gardening and Dickwella flings it towards the stumps and then appeals. Gould has a chat with him and rules the ball to have been dead by the time Smith strode out"
"make that a third consecutive short ball. Too much bounce, and called a no-ball"

spins in from a length and hits the front pad
"and again, clips the pad as it drifts in. Heading down leg"
"short of a length, angled across, Smith tries to whip across the line and gets hit on the pad. Appeal turned down and Chandimal refers this upstairs. Could have pitched outside leg. Hits the high part of the back pad, so height may be a factor here too. No bat. Waiting for ball-tracking. Pitching well outside off. Review lost"

"short of a length, angled across, pulled away to midwicket"
"short of a length, angled in, tucked to the on side"
looks to flick against the line and gets hit on the pad. Heading down with that angle
"fullish length, strides across and opens the face to work it away past the cordon, through the third man region. Chandimal runs after it. KUsal Mendis run after it. Chandimal gets low and pulls the ball back. Mendis gets low and realises he, too, may get past the boundary, so he flicks it back. In the end, boundary saved"
has to hurry into bringing his bat down as a length ball dips neatly on off stump.
no holds barred this time as Chase spots the flighted delivery and launches it over midwicket
lunges at a full delivery on middle and drives to mid-on
shifts himself leg side of a shortish delivery on off stump and slices it to cover
"for half a second, Chase thinks he is to the pitch of this loopy delivery on leg stump. Then it dips on him and so he has to bring his wrists into play to keep it down"
ends the over with a poor ball - short and wide and Chase smacks it through cover. Top shot. Doesn't overhit. Just concentrates on the basics of using the crease and exploiting the gap
"<b>beats him</b> with a sumptuous delivery! Lakmal runs in from around the wicket, hits a good length and wills the ball to straighten off the angle. Smith - even though he has faced 169 deliveries - has no clue about it. Stays rooted to the crease and feels for it outside the off stump"
"fuller delivery outside off, no shot"
"<b>past the bat again</b>! And Lakmal gives him a stare, or is it meant for the universe for denying him the outside edge? In any case, this is top class bowling, and he's pitching it up too, drawing Smith into a nearly fatal drive."
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"<b>ooooh, nearly shaves off stump</b> as Smith leaves and then prays for the inswing not to do him in. Great bowling from Lakmal, moving it both ways"
"goes full and into the pads, Smith tries to knock it down towards square leg. Settles for a leg bye"
"<b>keeps low</b> and traps him plumb in front of middle and off! This weakness - taking far too long to commit to the front foot - has been apparent all through his innings. And finally a Sri Lanka bowler pitches it up, drawing him forward. Smith believes this to be the offbreak and plays for the turn. But Dananjaya benefits from natural variation, with the ball drifting in, pitching outside off stump and then going on with the angle from around the wicket to strike low on the front pad. Umpire Gould wastes no time getting the finger up"
"tosses it up outside off, Dowrich strides forward to defend"
the ball dips sharply outside off and forces Dowrich to be circumspect as he shuffles across and defends
that's sweetly hit behind point as he moves back and across to carve a shortish delivery to the man in the deep
"manages to slant it behind point again, Chase this time"
"sneaks in the legbreak, which Dowrich handles well enough, even though it only bounces sharply instead of turning sharply. Neat little nudge down and past leg gully"

"continues to get lovely dip on the ball, bringing batsman forward, but rarely allowing them the half-volley to drive"

works a shortish delivery from outside off to mid-on
"full and outside off, Dowrich senses the danger of flirting with such a delivery and leaps under his bed to hide"
shifts inside the line of a short ball and whips it strongly to deep backward square leg
"<b>oooh, outside edge</b> as Dananjaya gets glorious drift away from the right hander, pulling Dowrich to poke at the ball outside off."
pushes forward to block a fuller delivery outside off
sharp turn off the pitch and Chase deals with it by pulling his front foot back so that he has the room to force the bat down on the ball and keep it away from short leg
"good shot - he waits for the tossed up delivery on middle and leg and launches it over midwicket. Dananjaya is a proper threat right now, getting the ball to drift away and turn in, so Chase is doing well to attack him"
turns a fuller delivery out to midwicket
stands tall against the shortish delivery and whacks short leg in his effort to score runs
"back of a length and outside off, Dowrich lets it pass"
"blocks a short of a length delivery outside off. But he isn't quite moving towards the line of the ball, and is therefore leaving a gap between bat and pad"
"short and wide, so easy decision to leave"
<b>huge appeal for lbw</B> but Umpire Dar says no and walks away. Height could be the issue because otherwise the ball nips back in sharply to pin Dowrich in front of all three stumps. There's the weakness exploited - the one where Dowrich is hanging his bat without moving his feet and creating a gap between inside edge and pad
now he takes the ball away and a muddled Dowrich forgets where his off stump is and chases after it to be beaten
"wide half-volley which Dowrich smashes through the covers, looking quite regal doing so. Lovely stride forward, knee almost touching the ground while the high elbow shows itself off"

gets behind a shortish delivery on and around off stump
"squares him up by hitting the deck but again, since there isn't much pace left in the surface, Chase has time to adjust and keep the ball down to point"
"short ball, sliding down leg. No shot needed"
leaves a short delivery outside off
"finds that secret spot on the pitch which is still taking pity on these poor fast bowlers toiling again and produces sharp movement into the right-hander. And at pace. Chase is stuck in the crease, trying to flick, and is <b>struck on the stomach</b>"
pushes it through down leg and Dowrich lets it go
shifts back and punches a good length ball to midwicket
plants his front leg outside off and works around it to send a good length ball past short leg's right

"yorker on leg stump, Cummins takes care of it, and then suffers a verbal volley from the angry fast bowler.

clears his front leg and swipes a length ball on off stump out to deep midwicket

knocks a good length ball on middle down towards a non-existent mid-on
<b>cuts him in half with a beat</b>. It's fast. it's cramping him. Then cuts in off the pitch too. Kusal tries to cut but is beaten on the inside edge. Lucky 'cause he could easily have dragged on.

"<strong>Wicket no. 12 in the match for Shannon Gabriel.</strong> Full, angling in from wide of the crease, Lakmal is pinned on the crease again. He is hit on the front pad below the knee-roll. It looks adjacent and the tracker returns three reds. Umpire Gould's on-field out decision is upheld. Lakmal's review ends in vain"

"full and a hint of width, he opens up his hips and laces it through point"
"<b>Wicket no. 13 in the game and 100 overall</b>, finally. Well done, Gabriel. Subdued celebrations from the big man. Short and angled into the body of Dananjaya from around the stumps, but it does not bounce as much as the batsman expected it to.
