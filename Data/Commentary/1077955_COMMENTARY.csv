"back of a length, starts outside off, and seams back in, Azhar covers his off stump and leaves it be"
"Gee, look at the carry to the keeper. Dowrich grabs it over his head. Back of a length, kicks up past the outside edge, having opened Azhar up. This 141ks delivery whistles past the outside edge"
"good length, bounces, and seams away outside off. Instead of leaving it, Azhar jumps off his feet and wafts at it, manages an outside edge that dies in front of gully"
"good length, on a set of stumps outside off, no shot offered"

"good length on a fifth-stump line, good wheels, 146ks, no stroke offered"

"starts outside off and spins away, cautiously left alone now"
"probing over. Maiden. Pushed through a bit quicker, bounces and turns past the outside edge"
"back of a length and angled down leg, the ball thuds into the gloves of the keeper"
"a bit too full and outside off, a loose front-foot drive to mid-off ensues"
"an appeal for lbw, not given by the umpire Oxenford. <strong>Holder challenges the on-field not-out decision</strong>. Good length, swerves back in appreciably and strikes the back thigh. Think this is bouncing over the stumps. Also impact seems outside off. Azhar was quite late in his attempt to jab at the ball. The tracker returns umpire's call on impact. Also sailing over the stumps. Good call from umpire Oxenford. Lovely ball - started outside off and skidded back in - but it amounts to nothing"
"length and outside off, left alone"

"short, quick, offbreak outside off, chopped straight to cover"

Babar pokes at this turning, bouncing ball. The keeper was just late to react, and hence can't close his hands around it. How costly will the miss prove to be?

"prompts Bishoo into bowling flatter and quicker, and Younis dabs the ball behind square on the off side"
"<b>big turn</b>. This is a good pace for this pitch. Just a tad quicker, and while doing so, he gives the ball a good old tweak. Pitches on middle and leg and rips past Younis' outside edge"

drills a full delivery on middle stump to short cover.

"full and outside off, defends"
sends a back of a length delivery away to long leg again
"<b>dropped by the wicketkeeper</b> and the West Indies captain is buckled over, the weight of his team's incompetence on his shoulders. How painful must this be? Especially after bowling a peach of a delivery, in line with off stump, and somehow persuading this dead pitch to give him some help, convincing it to make the ball move away. Misbah prods at it, he has to, it's too close to the stumps, gets a thick outside edge, but Dowrich, diving to his right, going at it with one hand, shells it"
"tosses it up outside off, blocks"
yanks a full and wide delivery outside off and sweeps it to deep midwicket
comes down the track and drives at a length delivery to cover
"<B>outside edge</b> but it skirts low and well past the right of the slip fielder. Azhar, for some strange reason, is playing a few shots now. Some of them loose"
"<b>doesn't carry</b> to slip this time. Beautiful drift from Bishoo, as he gets the ball over the batsman's eyeline on off stump, always making him play, and so making him take the risk of assessing how much turn this pitch will give him. Misbah underestimates it and nearly pays the price"
shoulders arms to a delivery outside off
"good length ball outside off, ignores it"
"full and outside off, drives to short cover"
"picks the gap to the right of mid-on. Gabriel takes too long to dive, and as punishment, he has to pick his massive frame back up and run after the ball again."

loves the flight on this one as he tries to whip the ball down the ground. Doesn't time it

"offers a little width, and he drives to short cover"

"fullish length, wide outside off, left alone"
"short of a length, punched crisply off the backfoot, just to the left of point. They take on the fielder for a quick single, and Misbah is off the mark off his 22nd ball"

"good length, angling in on off, punched firmly from the crease in the direction of mid-off"
"very full ball, outside off, Misbah looks to muscle it and hammers it straight down the ground,clatters into the stumps at the non-striker's end. Close shave for the umpire Illingworth there"

"short of a length, gets on top of the bounce and defends off the backfoot into the off side"

an indipper to keep the batsman guessing. Azhar is slow on his flick and is struck on the thigh
"having seen the movement on offer with the newish ball, Azhar wouldn't, and doesn't, tempt fate outside the off stump"
spears it into the stumps and Azhar works it away through to deep square leg
"back of a length on off stump, Misbah stands up tall to block, but he underestimates the inward movement"
"<b>inside edge</b>! The gory symptoms of a batsman in two minds as Misbah tries to protect his stumps, coming to that realisation very late. The indipper almost sneaked through"
welcomes the new bowler with a reverse sweep. Or maybe he is just shaking the cobwebs. He's been playing the block so long he probably wanted to test if his attacking shots still worked
jumps back against the short delivery and pulls to short midwicket
allows a quicker delivery to drift down the leg side

drags a tossed up delivery from outside off to deep square leg with a sweep

"flatter delivery, angling down leg, Misbah works it through square leg"
works a flighted delivery outside off to mid-on
clips a length delivery on off stump to midwicket
"good take, Dowrich. He's dropped a couple of catches, but this time, he moves quickly to his left, and despite being blinded by the batsman who is trying to sweep, he collects the ball coming in low at him"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"attempts a hook shot, but the ball, at 135 kph, climbs a bit too high. Miscues it towards midwicket and then flashes an amicable grin. Misbah, ladies and gentlemen, is having fun, having the time of his life"

covers the line of a shortish delivery outside off
"good length ball, outside off, and yet Misbah punishes it by showing no love whatsover"

"dialls up a sweep as he sees a length ball outside off, but he plays the shot too early, and it bounces over the bat, hits him on the shoulder."
"gets down the track, but Chase pulls his length back, and pushes his line wider. Flick to midwicket"

"pops out a loopy delivery on middle, Misbah is happy to send it to mid-on"
"presses forward outside off stump to greet a full delivery, but it spurns his advances and instead strikes him on the backside. Serves Misbah right for ignoring all the other deliveries pitching outside off."

clips a ball on the thighs through midwicket

oversteps in his attempt to hit the deck and get something out of it. Misbah had calmly blocked

"alert to the back of a length delivery straightening off the pitch is Misbah and upon being shut down by his straight bat, Holder implores his opposite number to edge one thorough. The man simply smiles and touches gloves with his batting partner. This, actually, is fun to watch"
whips a flighted delivery outside off to midwicket
tries to turn a full delivery outside off into a run-making opportunity but has failed to clue midwicket in on that plan
"well, that's that. Will teach him to blindly sweep at an offspinner. The only reason he goes for the shot is because the ball is tossed up. But Chase is able to make the ball dip just enough that the ball pitches before Azhar can reach it and then spins past his whooshing bat to make a mess of the stumps. Patient, painstaking innings comes to an end. Well done, Azhar."

"and he's waiting for the quicker, shorter delivery. Lovely batting by Shafiq, as he gets a single to square leg"
keeps out a flatter delivery - which is full nonetheless - from hitting his stumps
"looks to sweep a full delivery, sliding down leg, but fails to connect. Dowrich does well again behind the wicket to prevent runs"
ignores the good length ball pitching on leg stump and turning well past
"muscles a short delivery to the midwicket boundary. This is all power, and he is free to use however much he needs to, as a result of his footwork. Jumped back in his crease so early so he could do as he pleased"
"full on middle and leg, knocks it down to midwicket"
"rolls his wrists as he drives a good length ball to mid-on. Good batting considering he was originally intent on a more attacking shot, and realised the dangers of it against a pretty decent ball"

avoids a shortish delivery outside off
the bouncer sails a touch too high for umpire Oxenford
uses his hands - those lovely hands - to blunt a rising delivery on middle and leg

"shapes to play a forceful shot through square on the off side, but Chase's turn helps the shortish delivery get better than it deserves"

nudges a rising delivery of his hips to square leg
"full on off stump, drives to cover"
"tosses it up outside off, defends"
"again, a little loose with his flick and this time the ball travels a longer distance in the air. Luckily for Shafiq, it goes through the gap between midwicket and mid-on"
nudges to square leg
"loops it up over the batsman's eyeline to try and tempt him, but Misbah has rarely been so inclined."
"tosses it up on off stump, keeps it out"
good length ball bounces a touch more than Misbah expects. He doesn't connect with the flick and it comes off his body to land somewhere near short leg

The television umpire believes it to be pad first. And it is well in line with the stumps. But hello, HawkEye predicts the ball to be jumping over middle stump, instead of crashing into it. West Indies are both disappointed at amused at all that and Chase has been denied a five-for, for now"

"two in two! The flags are aloft. The school kids are roaring. And their captain is turning the match around. This is why I love fast bowling, takes a game going to sleep and kicks it awake.

"steps out and drives to mid-off, where Abbas does well to slide and stop that"
"drifts in a full delivery on middle, he lunges forward and eases it with the spin to short cover"
"floats this a touch ahead of length on off stump, bunted to the off side"
"touch fuller on off stump, defended again"
"floats a length ball across, gets this to move further away from outside off, Powell shoulders arms"
gets on top of the bounce and bunts it to short cover
"<b> beauty! </b> Induced the drive, not far from the edge. Full and angling away, much closer to off stump, Powell looked to drive on the up but was late on the shot."
flicked into the gap at midwicket. Yasir comes around from square leg to cut that off. This was too straight on middle and leg
"drifts a full ball across Brathwaite from around the stumps, squeezed to cover"
eased with the spin to mid-off. Looking to exploit the footmarks outside leg.
gets outside the line of leg stump to deadbat the full delivery
makes room and squeezes the full delivery to mid-off
gets right to the pitch of the ball and turns it to short square leg
"touch short but there's sharp turn from leg stump, keeps a touch low as well, Brathwaite squeezes this to the leg side."
"full, slanted away from off stump and inviting the drive. Goes for it, and the man at a very short extra cover fields it. Azhar, I think"
"bouncer now, over middle and leg. Powell ducks under it"
"shortish, on off stump, no real width. Stays next to the line and chops it to point"
"full now, just outside off. Gets a nice stride forward and drives to the right of short extra-cover. Ball slows down in the lush outfield and they can only get two"
"back of a length on middle stump, lets it come on and tucks it towards the square leg umpire. The fielder at square leg is a fair amount in front of square, easy single"
"length ball angled across into a fourth-stump line. Good ball, and Powell doesn't come forward, goes back and across instead and is hurried into a defensive jab into the ground"
"full, angling into off stump, blocked towards mid-on"
"length ball, angling in towards off stump. Brathwaite goes back and across to block to mid-on"
"full outside off, Brathwaite comes forward to drive, doesn't quite time it, bottom hand comes into it and he drags it to the right of the bowler, who sticks a hand out to stop it"
"length ball on off stump, stays on the back foot and pushes towards mid-on"
"fullish outside off, gets on the front foot to punch to mid-off"
"back of a length, nips back in off the track towards off stump. The length is just about short enough, and the pitch just about slow enough, for Brathwaite to adjust and defend towards midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, comes forward to defend, off the inside half of the bat past short leg"
"gives it more air and floats it wider outside off. Powell welcomes it and hits the first boundary of the day, sweeps in the air, safely, over the vacant square-leg region"
"tossed up again and this time Powell jumps out, reaches the pitch and clips to midwicket"
"goes wider on the crease and angles this one in, flatter. Looks to shuffle across and work it with the spin. The angle defeats his inside edge and hits pad - missing leg by a long way, though"
"tossed up outside off, Powell is late coming forward to defend. Ends up playing outside the line, pushing at it with his hands, and the ball beats his inside edge and ricochets off pad to slip. Impact well outside off"
"gone, he's given away another start here. Tossed up again, and Powell steps out again. Azhar had been pushed back to the midwicket boundary, Powell looked to go over wide mid-on. Didn't quite reach the pitch, dragged it squarer than he wanted, and Azhar ran smartly to his right and caught it on the slide. Bit of a soft dismissal, and it almost felt like Yasir knew it was coming."
"length ball on off stump, clipped away nicely to the right of midwicket"
"back of a length, a bit of inward movement towards middle stump. Steps across and tucks it neatly to long leg"
"back of a length, straightens a bit towards off stump, Hetmeyer defends back down the pitch. He's overstepped by more than an inch there"
"very full outside off, driven back to the bowler"
"full outside off, looks for the drive through cover. The angle from around the wicket makes him hit it back to the bowler instead"
"beauty. He's been getting the ball to nip into the right-hander and away from the left-hander in this spell, and this one went away like an offcutter from a good length outside off. Pressed forward to defend and missed by a long way"
"full on off stump, driven firmly but straight back to the bowler"
"down the track, gets too close to the pitch of this leg-stump ball, drives along the ground to mid-on"
"a touch short, rocks back but it comes on really slow and turns away. Slaps it into the ground, towards cover point"
"some more aggression. Down the track again. This time gets in a better position as Yasir bowls it into his feet, but plays a rather risky shot, lifting it over midwicket. Slows down in the grass two-thirds of the way to the boundary"
"and he puts it away for four. Azhar is still at deep midwicket, and Hetmeyer sees some flight outside off and sweeps powerfully to the right of the ducking short leg fielder and the left of deep midwicket. Desperate dive can't save the boundary"
"down the track now, some more flight, and he clips it to mid-on, who's deep enough to allow a single"
"tossed up outside leg, stretches out a long way and defends back to the bowler"
"back of a length close to off stump, straightens a little again as he goes back to defend, rolls away through the vacant gully region off the outer half of his bat"
"fuller now, angling into off stump, gets on the front foot to defend back to the bowler"
"back of a length outside off, defended to the right of short extra-cover"
"back of a length on middle stump, defended towards mid-on"
"fuller now, angling in sharply. Looks to flick, and the ball slides past inside edge and hits thigh pad. Was playing across his front pad there, nice change of angle - would have missed leg, though"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"rare bad ball from Yasir, long-hop delivered from around the wicket. Hetmeyer smashes that, rocks back so quickly and swivels through his hips to pull over the square leg boundary. Excellent transfer of weight through his hips there"
"tossed up fuller now, outside off, stretches out to defend into the covers"
"short again, this one turns down the leg side, he can't play the full-blooded pull because of how much it's turned, but he does well to help it along wide of the leg gully fielder. Shan Masood is the man back at deep backward square leg, runs a long way to his left and dives to cut it off"
"drops short again, pitches outside leg.  Brathwaite skips back, making himself room, and slaps it away in front of point"
"back of a length, turns sharply from outside off into Hetmeyer's pads, opens up to tuck it to backward square leg"
"big appeal for caught behind, and Sarfraz asks for a review. Again it's just back of a length, again it turns sharply, past the shuffling batsman down leg. Looks to tuck it away into the leg side, and did that catch some glove on its way through to Sarfraz? Looks very close. We don't have Snicko, but there seems to be a bit of noise as it passes. Yup. Bruce Oxenford has to reverse his decision, and Hetmeyer has to walk back."
"length ball, angles this into middle and leg. Clipped away quietly to long leg"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, Hope leaves it alone"
"and again, quite full, fairly wide of off. Hope ignores it"
"a touch shorter, along the same line, Hope leaves again"
"full, wide of off stump again, Hope continues to leave. For now"
"good ball, back of a length, a tiny bit of nip back in towards off stump, cramps Hope as he shuffles across, and he doubles over slightly while jamming his bat down to defend into the point region. Excellent change-up, kept dragging him across his stumps and then got one to come back in"
"tossed up, not too far outside leg, clipped to midwicket"
"just  a touch short, but it turns less than expected, towards middle and off stump, rocks back to chop it towards point"
"another risky shot from Brathwaite. Steps out, steps to the leg side of a ball pitching outside leg, swats it across the line over midwicket"
"flighted again, outside leg, defended inside-out to mid-off"
"fuller now, outside leg, gets his front leg out of the way to block"
"a touch short, pitches a fair way outside leg, shuffles across and defends with the turn into the covers"
"fullish, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump, steps back and across and defends towards the non-striker. Hasan steps across in his follow-through to stop it"
"back of a length, fourth-stump line, punched crisply to the right of cover point, who puts in a dive to stop it with one hand"
"bangs it in short outside off, Brathwaite leaves. Loses a lot of steam after pitching, bounces loopily to the keeper"
"short outside off, chopped to backward point"
"full, a bit of late shape in towards off stump. Pulls his front leg out of the way quickly to flick to midwicket"
"fullish, goes wide of off stump again, and Brathwaite leaves again"
"short, and the turn gives Hope plenty of width to go back and across and cut fiercely to the point boundary. Hit this well in front of square"
"tossed up loopily towards off stump, ends up as a full-toss, driven to extra-cover"
"full on middle and leg, gets his front leg out of the way to defend into the covers"
"tossed up wider, and Hope shapes to drive through cover before deciding to leave"
"quicker ball, and Hope plays the trajectory rather than the length, goes back and across and has to bring his bat down quickly to defend. Rolls off the outside half of his bat towards second slip"

"slower flighted ball on middle and leg, stretches out to defend with the turn into the covers"
"short again, and Hope, realising cover point has dropped back to the boundary, rocks back and deliberately further across, and pulls it through the vacant midwicket region"

"back of a length, a bit of width, lets it come on and pats it towards cover point"

"quicker, closer to off, left alone again"
"a touch short, this one doesn't turn, looks like the slider out of the front of the hand. Short enough still for a chop into the point region"

"and a wicket, another for Yasir, right on the brink of lunch! Beautifully bowled, flight and dip on middle and off. Came forward to defend, and he was undone by the dip followed by turn and bounce. Felt for it fatally, and it kissed his outside edge through to Sarfraz"
"tossed up on middle, driven inside-out to short cover"

"padded away. Fairly quick and flat, into a good-length area outside leg stump"
"more flight and fuller, still outside leg, and he moves his front leg out of the way and clips to mid-on"
"shot! Sees some flight, picks the length quickly, knows it'll be full enough to allow him to hit against the turn. Clears that front leg and launches this over midwicket. One bounce and over the rope"
"gone! Just like Hetmeyer, he's out playing too many shots against Yasir. Or is he out? He's <b>reviewed immediately</b>. Went for the slog-sweep from outside leg, looking to hit over square leg, and Younis, diving to his left from slip, made an excellent grab at shoulder height, with both hands. Chase thinks there was no bat on that. Lots of dust - the bottom of his bat may have hit the ground here. Is it bat on ground? Did the ball clip the back of the bat? I'm not sure any bat was involved. Went past the inside edge there. Flew towards slip off the back thigh, I think. Once again, a decision reversed."

"back of a length, angling into off and middle, defended back to the bowler"
"nice length there. Bowled this a bit wider, encouraging the drive away from the body, but it wasn't full enough for that shot. Chase shaped for that shot, checked himself, and the angle forced him to play it back to the bowler, off the inside half of his bat"
"short now, angling into off stump and rising chest-high. Chase gets on his toes to ride the bounce and keep it down with soft hands"
"beauty. Flight and dip on a leg-stump line, opens Hope up as he presses forward to defend, he does well to play with soft hands. Rolls down off the shoulder of the bat to the left of backward point. Chase calls immediately for the single, Hope is slow to respond. The throw at the bowler's end is wide of the stumps, so no real worries"
"drops this short, pitching outside leg, and he rocks back to pull through midwicket"
"<b>dropped</b>. Shafiq puts down a hard chance at cover point. Short again, and the turn provides width for the cut, Went very quickly to Shafiq's right, he gets a hand to it but can't hold on. The fielder was stationed closer to the bat than is the norm"

"full on middle stump, gets his front foot out of the way to drive inside-out to the right of point, who makes a good diving stop. Shafiq again, I think"
"ooh, excellent legbreak, dropping onto a testing length on middle and leg and bouncing extra apart from turning. Hope was caught in an in-between position, but he played close to his body, with soft hands, and the outside edge fell well short of slip"
Finally some runs. Drops slightly short outside off and Chase stands tall to punch into the covers
"full, angling into off stump, blocked to mid-off. Amir is holding his finger as he walks back to his mark. The ball may have flicked it as he tried to field it in his follow-through"
"good bouncer, Chase is in an awkward position. Again, doesn't get up too high, and the towering Chase can't really duck. Takes his eye off it as it climbs towards his left shoulder. Jabs at it, and it loops up and drops into the vacant short leg region"
"goes wide of the crease, length ball on leg stump, clips it and Masood is in the action straight away, dives left to make an excellent one-handed stop"
"appeal for a catch at point. Again Chase looks very awkward against the short ball. This is a difficult pitch on which to play the short ball - you don't know how quickly it will come to you and how high. Goes for the hook, is into the shot too early, and it hits the high part of the side of his helmet and pops up to the left of point"
"another bouncer, this time Chase semi-ducks it, and it does that loopy tennis-ball thing into the keeper's gloves"
"short outside off, chopped away and point dives right to stop it"
"tossed up outside off, and Masood is in action again, sprints to his right from point and throws himself horizontally on the ground to stop this drive from Hope"

"tossed up on middle and off, driven to long-off"
"gone! Azhar has delivered the breakthrough. The slowness of the pitch undoes Hope, and again, a wicket on the stroke of a break. Tossed up full on leg stump. Shapes for the inside-out drive. The ball stops on him, he checks his shot, fatally, and pops up a simple low catch to Misbah at short extra-cover"
"starts off with a full delivery on of stump, defended gently to short cover"
"attacks the stumps with a length ball, this one keeps a touch low but Chase is right behind that as he defends"
drags a pull from outside off towards Abbas at fine leg
flicks a juicy full toss on middle straight to midwicket
"oversteps in his quest for extra pace maybe, this one's floated full on the middle, turned to  short leg. Playing with hard hands. Vishaul was also overbalanced"
"this time, he moves across the stumps swiftly to defend the incoming length ball"
"digs in a short ball at 133 clicks, Vishaul sways out of the way without any hassle even though it didn't bounce as much"
"short outside off, cut away to Yasir at deep cover"
"tossed up on middle, he gets well forward and defends"
leans forward and turns the legbreak on middle to short midwicket
"steps out to flick, but the ball dips on him. Defended in the end"
"goes back to a delivery he should have played forward. Breaks back in sharply after pitching, somehow manages to keep that out"

"back of length on off stump, defended to cover"
"back of length outside off again, punched to the off side"
"excellent short delivery, just around off stump. Chase sways away but the umpire reckons it was way over his head. Tennis-ball bounce that time"

"back of length delivery angling into middle, defended with soft hands to the off side"
leans forward and defends an incoming full-length delivery
"bounce from length outside off, Chase punches this to sweeper cover"
"full toss and put away. Too easy, sashays down the pitch and flicks this past midwicket. Slow outfield, and so enough time for deep square to come around to stop it"
"short and sliding down leg, helped into the gap behind short fine leg"
"skids across from length on middle, Vishaul goes back deep into the crease and blocks"
"googly that pitches at length on leg stump, Vishaul picks it off the hand and goes back to block"
"short and spinning down leg, helped down to Shan Masood at fine leg"
safely negotiates an incoming length ball on middle
steered off the backfoot to Yasir at point. Not all that short for him to play the stroke
deceived by the back-of-the-hand slower delivery. This one angles in and bounces off the deck to take him by surprise. Vishaul struck on the glove as he jabs forward. Silly mid-off should feel encouraged by that
"full and angling into the stumps from wide of the crease, squeezed wide of silly mid-off"
"Hasan has overstepped by a long way, so everything else can be forgotten. Vishaul hit on the back pad as he plays inside the line. Would have been not-out anyway as the impact was outside off. Misbah has a wry smile on his face. Maybe he knew it was an optimistic review"
goes back and across to defend the incoming length delivery
"full and straight on middle, Vishaul solid in defence"
"drops it short, Chase uses the depth of the crease to slap that into the gap at deep extra cover"
"turn and bounce from the rough outside the right-hander's leg stump, Vishaul looks to help this with the spin but the ball gets big on him, somehow manages to scoop it over legslip. Couldn't ride the bounce this time"
gets his front pad outside the line of leg stump and bunts the full delivery
stabs one wide of Younis at slip. Extra bounce again for Yasir from the rough outside leg.

"drifts in a quicker ball on middle and leg, lets it go, keeper collects"
"short ball outside off, Chase arches back and watches it through to Sarfraz"

"good ball, full, straight on middle. Late reverse back in, punched on the full to mid-on"

"<b> Just wide of Babar at short leg. </b> Vishaul stepped out to flick, checked his shot as the ball dipped on him"
"spins back in sharply, lifts off the deck as well, as Vishaul leaves. Safraz collects it in front of his face down the leg side"

"half-tracker on middle and leg, pulled to deep square leg"
gets well forward and defends the tossed up delivery outside leg

"angles a length ball on middle, defended back down the pitch"
"short of length delivery sliding into middle and leg, turned to midwicket"
"width and he's crashed that behind point. Super timing. Just marginally short and he climbed onto it in a jiffy. New ball, so it will travel"
"back of length delivery that nips away from outside off, left alone"
"floats one in at length on middle and leg, tucked to short midwicket"
"<b> lucky break. </b> Nearly chopped on. Shaped to cut but didn't have the width, just the length. Threw his hands at that. got a thick inside edge that flew past legstump into the fine leg boundary"

"sliding into middle and leg from length, tucked to deep backward square leg"
"swerves away late from off stump, much fuller in length, Vishaul defends from the crease"
"late swing for Amir. Lands this full on off, invites the drive, but Vishaul is right behind the line as he defends"

"excellent delivery, angles it full on middle. The ball swings late but Vishaul is right behind the line as he blocks"
"full and swinging away from outside off, left alone"
"shapes to cut but realises the ball was much closer to the stumps, let it go in the end"
"floats it at length on middle from wide of the crease, shows the full face of the bat as he defends"
hops back and across to punch the away-going length ball to cover
Sarfraz had to use every bit of his leap to stop that short ball. Wide called and rightly so
"another short ball, this one is into the body, Chase ducks unde that one comfortably"
"angles a short of length ball on middle and leg, helped down to fine leg"
stands tall to bunt the away-going length delivery from wide of the crease
"angles one across the batsman, who goes back into the crease and defends"
hit on the elbow as he's hurried into a pull shot. This one skidded off the pitch. Close to 140 clicks on that one. He's in some pain
"thick edge, flies low to Younis at second slip.  <b> Doesn't quite carry. </b> Superb first ball."
defends a full-incoming delivery from the crease
"slants a length ball across Dowrich, who lets it go"
not far from the outside edge. Looks to steer this delivery wide of gully but this was too close for him to try and execute that shot
"floated full on middle and leg, flicked to square leg"
"back of length delivery on middle from wide of the crease, defended back down the pitch"
"beaten. Looks to punch away from the body, the ball nips away off the seam. Playing from the crease again"

"looks to induce the drive by bowling it full and outside off, Vishaul is happy to leave this time"
"snakes in a short ball on middle from wide of the crease, Dowrich is right behind the line of the delivery as he bunts it to the off side"
turns an incoming length ball to short midwicket
"shapes back in from wide of the crease, Dowrich hops back and across to defend"
"has him looking to sway out of the way. The short ball is well-directed into the body, Dowrich was looking away as the ball whizzes wide of the helmet. Keeper had no chance"
"punched into the gap behind point, off the mark"
"gets this to swing back in from off stump, defended gently with the angle"
"appeal for lbw. This one's sliding down leg. Misbah thinks of a review, but they won't take it. This was full and sliding in from around the stumps. Vishaul looks to flick this behind square"
"<b> plumb. </b> Stone dead. Vishaul has paid the price for minimal feet movement. The ball bends back in late to trap him plumb in front while he's on the hop to defend. Should have played forward but the ball angled back in to beat the inside edge. There was no inside edge whatsoever. The height wasn't an issue either. Vishaul chanced his luck with a review, but it doesn't work."
hops back and across to nurdle this behind square on the leg side to get off the mark
"slides a length ball down leg, Dowrich misses the faint little tickle past the keeper"
flicked but straight to Yasir at square leg

"full again, a bit wider, pushed to short extra-cover"
"low full-toss on off stump, whipped to the right of mid-on"
"ooh, big turn and a bit of bounce. Bowled quick and flat, just back of a length, pitching on leg stump and taken well outside off, above shoulder height, by Sarfraz, after Dowrich leaves"
"fuller now, outside off, driven to deep point"
"full, a bit of swing in towards off stump, punched to mid-off"

"shifts to a fifth-stump line, just short of a good length, and Dowrich watches it through to the keeper"
"full on off stump, blocked to mid-off"
"bouncer, and Dowrich ducks while taking his eye off the ball. Will keep Abbas interested if he keeps doing that. This one bounced enough to clear his head comfortably"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to mid-on"
"full on middle and leg, gets his front leg out of the way to defend to short extra-cover"
"short, pitches wide enough outside off to telegraph the googly. Doesn't turn much anyway. Goes on the back foot to  whip it to midwicket"
"tossed up full on middle stump, defended to short extra. Needed to be a couple of inches shorter to trouble Holder's edge"
"this one's quicker and flatter, and Holder goes on the back foot to defend and it beats him by a long way with turn and bounce. Pitched on leg stump and missed the seventh stump"
"and again. This is a lot of turn and bounce. Too short to get anywhere near Holder's edge, though"
"fuller length now, on leg stump, Holder gets on the front foot to clip to short leg"
"back of a length, slanting across towards off stump, blocked back down the pitch"
"full and wide, Dowrich reaches out and stabs it away between point and cover point"

"back of a length, angling into off stump, tucked away to square leg"
"back of a length on leg stump, goes back to defend back down the pitch"

"floated up full on middle stump, driven inside-out to short extra"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"length ball, a bit closer to off stump, a tiny bit of movement away off the pitch. Easily dealt with by Holder, who shuffles across and defends into the covers"
"length ball on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"wide of the crease, angles it into the fifth-stump channel, just back of a length. Defended into the cover point region"
"and again, delivers an awkward bouncer. He's managed to get them to rise shoulder-high consistently today, and trouble the taller West Indies batsmen. Ducks awkwardly, ball pops up off his left shoulder and loops over the keeper"
"bouncer again, over off stump this time. Holder stays leg-side of the ball, keeps his eye on it, and ducks, just in case"
"back of a length on off stump, looks to make room to punch and this hurries on quicker, without too much turn. Manages to bring his bat down quickly to defend into the covers"
"fuller now, gets on the front foot to push into the covers"
"tossed up slower on leg stump, Dowrich gets down nice and low to defend back down the pitch"
"short, wide, slapped away to deep point"
"full, flighted ball on off stump, driven to long-off - why exactly does he have a long-off for Holder, right now?"
"quicker now, full on off stump, defended towards short extra"
"full on off stump, Holder plays a checked drive to mid-off"
"fullish, pitching on off and slanting away. Left alone. That was a really good ball and a really good leave. It wasn't quite up there for the drive"
"length ball slanting away from off stump, another good leave from Holder"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to short extra"
"bouncer, this one loops high and dies as it reaches the keeper, and Holder can crouch fairly comfortably under it"
"another bouncer, this one's slanting away from off stump, and Holder leaves it alone"
"short, skips back and makes room to punch this away to the right of backward point, brings up West Indies' 200"
"short again, this time the initial line and the sharp turn provide Dowrich with even more room, and he slaps it with immense power, straight into Babar Azam's left forearm at silly point. Ouch. Out comes Pakistan's physio. He doesn't look in undue pain, though."
"fuller now, outside leg stump, looking to sneak one around Dowrich's legs, maybe. Pads it and it rolls away to the left of the keeper"
"full outside leg, clipped away nice and fine, to the right of the man at 45"
"short again, pulled into the ground, and midwicket fields it"
"shortish, this one rips away with extra bounce, and Dowrich does well to go back and across and get his hands up high to keep the ball down"
"full on off stump, driven to deepish cover. That area is well protected - they have a cover point and a short extra-cover as well."
"length ball on off stump, defended towards point, plays nice and late"
"bouncer, this is the one that skids through at shoulder-height. Holder does well to duck nice and low and evade it"
"another bouncer, this bounces much higher and slower, easier one for Holder to duck"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended towards cover point"
"length ball, slants this wide and invites the drive away from the body. Holder declines the invitation"
"drops this on a good length outside leg, Dowrich kicks it away into the leg side"
"shorter now, goes back and defends to short extra-cover, this one was spinning towards off stump"
"unneccessary lbw appeal as Dowrich comes forward to defend, playing for more turn than there was. This one pitched two miles outside leg stump and made impact one mile outside"
"another short ball, and he rocks back and pulls it away to the midwicket boundary"
"flighted ball outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
"ooh, that's a little loose. Floats this up wide of off stump. Holder's front foot comes forward but not across, and he ends up driving at this with just his hands, away from his body, and slices it uppishly towards backward point"
"starts with a bouncer over middle and off, Dowrich squats low to get under it"
"drifts into Dowrich's pads, clipped away to the left of long leg"
"back of a length, again a little too straight, flicked into the square leg region and Yasir chases from midwicket and stops it with a dive"
"back of a length, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"full, angling into off stump, blocked to mid-off"
"short  ball on off stump, rides the bounce - it got up to chest height - and dropped it into the square leg region. A bit of hesitation as Yasir sprinted to his right from midwicket, but they take the single comfortably enough in the end"
"tossed up on off stump, defended into the covers"
"flighted ball outside off, left alone. A touch shorter than the previous ball."
"and Holder launches a six over that fielder. More flight on this one, and it ended up pitching right in Holder's arc. Such a clean hit, this"
"short and flat outside off, no turn, goes back and across to whip this to mid-on"
"googly. Rare sight from Yasir. Dips onto a good length outside off, but Holder picks it and gets a good stride forward to smother it"
"oh, ends the day with an absolute ripper of a legbreak. That spun like a Stuart MacGill legbreak. Flat, quick, pitching on middle and leg and causing Sarfraz to stretch his arms out to his right to collect it after it beats Holder's outside edge. He shaped to defend, and then simply let it beat him - didn't have too much choice"
"covers the line of a back of a length delivery on off stump. 'Six and seven, boys. Six and seven here, boys,' comes a call from behind the stumps"
"brings the right-hander forward, whilst ensuring the line is just outside off. Solid defence from Dowrich"
"tests him, and the pitch, with a bouncer. The results will not please a bowler. Dowrich spotted it early to duck and the ball doesn't get the kick it should"
"a wicket in the first over. Amir is thrilled, as most fast bowlers will be after they break a set of stumps. He doesn't do it all on his own though. Dowrich, ever so kindly, provides an inside edge that allows a back of a length delivery outside off to crash into his castle"
shifts around the wicket for a bouncer - predictable - and Chase is able to avoid it easily
rock solid behind a shortish delivery aimed at the top of off stump
"starts with a low full toss - so Yasir does bowl looseners, and he misfields the drive that comes back at him"
"keeps back to a flighted delivery, which he can do on a slow pitch. Blocks with an open face"
leans into a tossed up delivery and drives to cover
"picks the length early, leaps back, stands up tall and tells the short ball what's what. Authoritative drive through the covers, to the left of the fielder saving a single. We have a quick check on a run-out because there is a direct hit from the deep. All is good."
"<b>drift</b>, just enough of it that Chase's attempted cover drive skews back to the bowler off the inside edge"
"shifts himself leg side of a tossed up delivery, allowing his hands the freedom to flow through the line of a tossed up delivery outside off. Lovely balance."
hip-high short ball is defused through the vacant spaces at midwicket
"the line is impeccable. Right over off stump. And since it is also too early in the morning to do anything more than the necessary, Holder defends"
fishes at a good length delivery because of the left-armer's angle and is beaten. Amir is such a lovely bowler to watch. The way he plans his wickets...
shifts back and plants an open face on a good length ball moving away from him
"firm push to the left of mid-off, and Misbah does well, putting in a dive and keep it to a single"
"fine judgment of line. Crouches in his stance, shuffles across and then seeing the ball still outside his eyeline, he shoulders arms"
"lovely shot. He spots Yasir's mistake early - the line being on leg stump - and punishes it. Gets a good stride in, brings the bat down on the ball so that there is no risk of the top edge and nails the sweep to the long leg boundary"
brings his front foot to the pitch of the ball and blocks on off stump
"quicker, but full nevertheless, and Holder keeps it out"
"gets back, and right behind a flatter delivery outside off stump"
"good bounce, as Holder leaves a good length ball outside off and Sarfraz collects it against his shoulder"
"<b>kick off the pitch</b> and it surprises Holder. Originally, he thinks he could pull a shortish delivery angled into him. But the ball spins and bounces more than he expects and he has to check his shot to mid-on"
punches a shortish delivery on off stump to cover
"the slightest bit of movement into the right-hander, and Chase spots it, even if he does so a little late, to block in front of off stump"
this is the good length ball meant to slant across the right-hander. Chase reads it well and then ignores it
"digs it in on leg stump, which is a decent line to Chase who is shuffling across to off stump. A decent line on a quick pitch. This is not one and so the batsman is able to get on top of the bounce and pull it to long leg"
"fullish delivery on off stump, blocks"
ducks under a short delivery on middle and leg
gently nudges a flighted delivery outside leg stump to the right of mid-on
stays back to a good length ball on middle an defends with a straight bat. The rough outside leg is playing on Holder's mind
keeps back to block a good length ball
"slips back, in front of all three stumps, and defends a good length ball spinning from outside leg"
"eeish, he shoulder's arms, and almost loses his off stump! Padding up to balls pitching outside leg is a good ploy. But for that Holder, who has a long reach, needs to put his front leg close to the pitch of the ball. Here he doesn't and worse, allows a free path for the ball to spin and do some damage if it so liked"
"now, having seen the turn, the massive turn, he looks to whack a flighted delivery outside leg through midwicket. Looks to essentially whack Yasir out of this line of attack and nearly gets a leading edge"
"another short ball, on middle, but since it comes off the pitch so slowly, Chase has to stop the pull shot in its tracks and instead bunt the ball through midwicket"
"fuller delivery on off stump, defends"
"full and outside off, lets it carry on to the keeper"
runs a short delivery on off stump to cover
"in the slot and big Jase sends it soaring. He is magnificent to watch when he lets go of the burdens on his shoulders. Picks the bones off a length ball on off stump, T20 style"
"good length ball on off stump, blocks"
"plays so late, and plays so well. It never feels feels rushed with Chase at the crease, and this ball, pushed through outside leg contributes to that perception. Neat little flick behind sqyare leg"
"hangs back and flicks a shortish delivery, a little bit in the air, because he is into the shot too early, towards midwicket"
"tosses it up on middle stump, defends"
"tries padding up again, but somehow Yasir is making the ball pitch just a tiny bit away from the batsman's reach so that it can spin and threaten off stump"
presses forward to the ball pitching outside leg and smothers it
gets forward and blocks a ball on middle and leg
"stands tall behind a shortish delivery, coming into him, as he punches to mid-on"
gets across towards a back of a length delivery outside off and guides it to cover
drifts down the leg side and Chase's leg glance doesn't connect
"fullish on off stump, pushes it to cover"
"evades a short delivery outside off, and it exhibits tennis-ball bounce going through to the wicketkeeper"
a lovely straight bat comes down in answer to a back of a length ball on off stump
"finally, he succeeds in padding up to a delivery pitching well outside leg stump."
comes forward to meet a tossed up delivery outside leg with a dead bat
pushes a drive down the ground to long-off
"shapes to perhaps pull, but then is wise enough to change his shot for the ball bounces a touch more. Realigns his bat to a flicking position"
"drives to long-on, getting his front foot away so that those arms can come down freely"
kicks a good length ball pitching outside leg away
"carves a good length ball to the left of cover, but Azhar doesn't let it pass"
gets under a bouncer on and around off stump. The umpire penalises it for the height it gets
"that's unexpected, at least from the batsman's point of view. Chase is met by a yorker, curling into his pads and he is so late in bringing his bat down. And even as he does so, he is playing across the line, a panic-stricken flick through midwicket. It fails him as the ball cannons off his pad and onto off stump"
"Pakistan are celebrating again as Younis believes he has taken a low catch at second slip. The soft signal is out as the on-field umpires throw it to their colleague upstairs. All this commotion starts with another almost yorker-length delivery, this one outside the off stump. Bishoo, his feet rooted to the crease, pushes at the ball, gets an edge and it seems to have carried cleanly with Younis moving adeptly to his right. That's his 10th grab of the series, the Pakistan record for a fielder (and not a wicketkeeper)"
"that's emphatic. Strides forward and blocks a full, fast delivery outside off"
"this is a slower ball, weaving through the air, into the right-hander. Joseph is blocking down the wrong line, his front pad in the way of the bat. Weathers the lbw appeal because it would be slipping down leg"
"goes for the bouncer and then puts in a scary old stare to see if he can unsettle Joseph, who had left the ball comfortably."
"good length ball, spinning from out of the rough outside leg, defends"
"'like that,' says Sarfraz as Holder is given the single through midwicket"
"shifts over the wicket to the new batsman, and starts with a googly outside off. Joseph pushes it to cover"
"tosses it up on middle, Joseph blocks it"
"thinks about reaching out to a slow, good length delivery spinning away from him. And then refuses to do so"
"takes on a loopy delivery, drifting into middle and leg, and it is that drift that scuppers Joseph's intention to launch this over long-on. Instead, the ball takes the inside edge to fine leg. Holder doesn't want the single. He'd rather take the strike for the next over"
"'two, two, two' Holder screams after pulling a slow short ball, but the long leg fielder does well to interject. Well done, Hasan. You've given your fellow fast bower five balls at the tailender"
"cleans him up! This is fine bowling. The yorker again. Searing, straight and just too good for Joseph. Goes off the boot and onto the stumps again. This is high-quality bowling, and there might even be reverse swing on offer"
"almost, yorker, angling in on middle and leg and Gabriel knocks it flush into the boot as the bat face closes, he clutches his side after playing the shot. If it's a side strain, this is the last thing West Indies need after conceding a big lead - their premier paceman injured"
"angling in, defended into the leg side"
"fuller ball, cuts back in from outside off, it's the off-cutter, defended watchfully"
"beats the outside edge. Lovely delivery, full and in the corridor of uncertainty, holding its line and draws the batsman forward. Gabriel promptly sticks the bat out and the ball shoots past the edge to the keeper"
"fired full from around the wicket, gets down for a reverse sweep from outside leg and sends it along the ground through point for a brace"
"flighted, outside leg, defended"
this time he goes for a traditional sweep but does not middle it as the ball is pushed across to him
"sweep again, it's the slog this time and he has found the middle of the bat. Very good connection and sends it screaming into the deep midwicket boundary. Brute force"
"this time he goes with the turn, reverse sweep again, has to fetch it from outside leg and finds point"
"too full, outside leg, gets down and just about manages to sweep it away, off the top part of the bat to fine leg, very fine but not the connection wasn't great so it doesn't travel far"
"fuller ball, angling in outside off, driven straight back to the bowler"
"back of a length outside off, gets on top of the bounce and knocks it to point"
"off-cutter, spinning back in, beats the inside edge and hits Holder high, around the waist region"
"short of good length, outside off, Holder gets behind it and tucks it between mid-on and midwicket. Calls for two but has to settle for the single"
"fuller ball, outside off, presses forward to drive and skews it off the inside part of the bat to mid-on"
"has he found the bat? Yes, he has. Given by the umpire. Gabriel has asked for a review straight away and Abbas will have to wait to see if he has a five-for. The players are walking off the field, so seems like he may have got a feather. Small deflection can be seen before the ball hits the pad, it has got the inside edge and the on-field call remains"
"fuller ball, holding its line outside off, left alone"
"short of a length ball, outside off, Azhar plays a loose shot and sticks his bat out, he gets beaten"
"back of a length, angling in, tucked between mid-on and midwicket for a quick single"

"fuller length, turned away wristily behind square on the leg side and midwicket runs across and fields"
"fuller ball, pushed across and straightening, defends calmly from the crease to the leg side"
"short of a length, walks across and tucks off the hips to square leg for one"
"length, angled in outside off and nipping away late slightly, left alone"
"back of a length, shaping away late, sticks his bat out and punches through the gap at covers for a brace"
"short and wide, slashes hard as he cuts late and finds gully"
"full, drifting down leg and misses the batsman's attempted glance"
"back of a length, tries to walk across and defend and the ball angles in to hit him high on the back thigh. Impact outside off"
"fuller ball, angled in outside off, presses forward and bunts it back to the bowler"
"full, outside off, reaches out for a drive and skews it off the outside part of the bat, doesn't come on at the pace he would have liked so it messes up his timing, sliced through covers"
"short of a length, outside off, shuffles across and defends to the right of the bowler who gets his hand to it"
"short and wide, sees the width and opens up his arms and slashes hard at it, finds point on the cut. Straight to him and good catch from Blackwood despite the short reaction time. Backed himself to go over the fielder but failed to do so"
"angled in on a length, waits for it to come in to him before defending with a straight bat to mid-on"
"back of a length, outside off, shifts across outside off before defending back"
"good length ball, again he is not steady at the crease, walks forward as he defends"
"length, outside off, holding its line and left alone. Thought of going after it initially but ended up making the right call. He needs to show that discipline more often"
"fullish length, angled in, gets behind it solidly and blocks back to the bowler"
"back of a length, tucked off the pads and finds midwicket"
"full, angling in, tucked off the pads behind square for a single"

"same delivery, gets outside it and lets it go to the keeper"
"Babar has fallen to a bat-pad and Pakistan lose their second. Or have they? The umpires go upstairs to refer this. West Indies are celebrating and the soft signal is out. Flighted outside off and spinning in from a fullish length. Definite inside edge and it lobs towards forward short leg who gets down and takes it sharply. Seems like it may have bounced in front of him though. Remember, soft signal is out. This is going to be a hard one for the third umpire. Not sure if he has got his hands entirely underneath that one. They use multiple angles and one of them actually seems to suggest it may have just bounced. But the third umpire has stuck on with the on-field call and given it out"

"some nip into the left-hander, through the air, Masood keeps bat close to pad and blocks to cover"
"brings a defensive bat down quite late on a good length ball outside off, and as a result the bottom edge bounces along to the wicketkeeper"
"good length ball outside off, Masood restrains himself"
<b>doesn't carry to first slip</b>. Masood is lucky because he commits a mistake most teams know he would -  reaching away from his body to play at deliveries he doesn't need to. The full length delivery squeals off the outside edge but falls short of a diving Kieron Powell's left hand
"shortish delivery, angled into the left-hander, who enjoys flicking it through to long leg"
"some bounce. Considerable bounce, actually. But Younis is able to negotiate it well. Moves back in his crease and nudges it past the right of short leg"
"low full toss, from around the wicket, and Masood does well to dab it down to mid-on. He's batting with his mentor. A mentor who is playing his last Test innings"
"a shot he's made all his own. The sweep. Always effortless, even though he does stretch so far forward to connect with the ball. Single to long leg"
"good length ball outside off, defends"
"fires it in quicker, and in doing so, his length suffers. It's way too short and Masood rocks back to pull it through midwicket"
"loops it up on and around middle stump, Younis blunts it with bat in front of pad"
<b>another outside edge</b> and this time it skips between the keeper and first slip. Joseph bowling from around the wicket is making Masood play at everything because he is worried by the angle into him. But these balls are holding their lines and are making him look woeful
<b>beaten now</b> as he is again made to deal with a good length ball in the corridor of uncertainty. Excellent work from Joseph.
"oho, spectacular bowling! After teasing the outside edge, Joseph looks for the toe-crusher, and adding to its menace is the late swing. Masood is just about able to flick it through backward square leg"
"short of a length and outside off, lets it go"
ignores a good length ball dangled outside his off stump
he's not learning. He's just not learning. The plan to dismiss him won't be any clearer if Joseph ran in with a big sign across his chest that says 'I'm going to nick you off in the slips' and yet Masood keeps poking at back of a length deliveries outside off
"nimbly moves back to a good length ball, gets on top of the bounce and nudges it through midwicket"
"chooses to sweep and while it is a shot that unsettles a spinner, doing so to a good length ball, and to a bowler who is turning it away from him, and making it bounce extra, the risk is too much. Beaten"

lunges outside off to block a flighted delivery.
"whoa. He's bowling bouncers. Or the ball slips out of his hand, pitches in his own half and is pulled to deep square leg"
stands up to his full and considerable height to get on top of a shortish delivery outside off and whips it to mid-on
"<b>through the gate</b>! This is offspin of the highest quality. Loops it up well wide of off stump, the ball drifting away as well. Younis thinks it's there for the cover drive, but the ball dips sharply and then spins through the gap between bat and pad"
"presses forward, but Chase doesn't let him get to the pitch of the ball, So Younis takes great care to put his bat and pad tight together and keep his stumps standing"
"brilliant. It's almost the same delivery that he was beaten by earlier in the over, but this time he sweeps it to deep square leg, with the turn"
gets inside the line of a shortish delivery on off stump and clips it through to deep square leg
slices a good length ball well outside off to point
hoists his bat high over his head upon judging the shortish delivery to be outside off
"oooh, he's in a mood. Stares a bouncer square in the eye and then takes it on with a massive hook. It's got too much height on it, and it's too far outside off to do as its told, even by Younis"
"shortish and outside off, carves it to point"
"slower ball, pitching full on off stump and it kicks up off this slow, parched pitch. Younis yanks his bottom hand off and then promptly gets across to the other end"

"loopy delivery outside off, drives through cover"
"shapes to play the reverse sweep, and so the slip fielder moves to his right. Unfortunately for him, Younis doesn't make any connection as the ball takes off after pitching to hit the shoulder and run away fine to third man"
spears an overpitched delivery through extra cover. Didn't need to do much. Just give it direction.
gets forward and whips a well flighted delivery to mid-on
"starts around the wicket to the left-hander, who then clips a back of a length delivery towards midwicket. Holder buckles over in his followthrough. He's got shoulder issues, his bowling shoulder."

"shortish and outside off, safely put down"
gets inside the line of the ball angled into his hips and clips it to square leg
"shortish and on off stump, handles it easily"
"full on off stump, Masood is able to adjust to the change of length and blocks to point"
gets up off his toes to clip a short delivery on off stump to midwicket
opens the face of the bat to ensure a good length ball straightening in line with the stumps goes straight to ground
is that a chance? It'd take a harsh man to call that a dropped catch for gully is very close to the bat. A slow pitch demands that. And this was hit so very hard. Younis cuts with all his might and the ball bursts past the fielder diving to his right and runs off to the third man boundary
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"legcutter on and around off stump, Younis is wise to the variation"
defends a back of a good length delivery on off stump
"nice shot. He picks up the short ball outside off stump and cuts it to point. Plays it late, gets on top of the bounce"
"he's improving. Previously, he was hanging his bat at these deliveries, on a length and outside off. This time, though, he shuffles across and leaves"
latches onto a full delivery on the pads and clips it to midwicket
"crunches a shortish delivery outside off to cover, and he decides to go for the single. This is going to be tight for both batsmen hesitate midway through. Would have been out had the throw hit the stumps direct at the bowler's end"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"soft hands, hits the gap, nicks an easy single. Class batting from Younis. He sees the short ball, waits for it to come to him, dabs it down gently and point has no chance of stopping the run"
drives on the up and places it to the right of the man at short cover. Serene batting.
"lovely drive, and wouldn't you know it, it hits the gap too. Younis steps up to a good length ball outside off and threads it through the gap to the right of point. Fifty up for Pakistan"

"excitement from the bowler, but the ball <b>doesn't carry</b> to the wicketkeeper. This is the offcutter from Holder, pitching on a good length in front of off stump, drawing Masood into an airy drive. Might have been an edge, but it doesn't go the distance to the keeper"
"good length ball on off stump, blocks"
"into the body, but Masood is strong there. Shows it with a flick to square leg"
"full on middle, blocks, and sees the midwicket fielder commit a dreadful misfield. There is a single on offer, but Younis tells his protege to go back"
opens the face to guide a shortish delivery outside off to point
covers the line of another back of a length delivery on middle and works it to straight midwicket
"blurts past the fielder at slip. The ball keeps a touch low, which is why Younis mistimes the cut shot. He still benefits though"
pushes at a full delivery on the stumps to mid-off
"<b>dropped</b> but it doesn't matter for it came off a very high full toss, high enough for a <b>no-ball</b> to be called. Younis is ready to clatter it over the cover field, both his feet off the ground when he makes connection. The fielder puts in a valiant dive to his right and shells it"

"length ball, angling in, thinks of tucking it fine but the ball drifts down leg"
"pings Masood on the pad and umpire Oxenford raises his finer. And Masood has opted for the review. Height could be an issue here. And it was also angling in, so could it be heading down leg?

"length ball, angling in from well outside off and Misbah lets it go"

"Misbah's career ends on a slog sweep. He is pulled into a warm embrace b his retiring team-mate. West Indies' players all run up to him to congratulate him. Pakistan team puts together a guard of honour for their retiring captain with their bats raised. That includes Asad Shafiq who walks out to bat only after Misbah has passed through the guard of honour.

"loopy flighted ball, sliding on leg, Younis comes forward and the ball hits the pad"
"Misbah first and Younis now. He, too, gets handshakes from all of the West Indies team. And he walks off to a standing ovation, turns around and acknowledges the crowd as he walks off for the final time. Younis walks through a similar guard of honour and he is still being applauded after he has gone off the ground. And it is the sweep that brings an end to his career. It was flighted outside off and Younis got down to sweep. Ends up coming on the full, and as a result, it is too high for him, gets the top edge to short fine leg where Powell dives to his left to snaffle it"
"short ball, pulls it through midwicket and demands his partner to come back for the second"
the grumpy fast bowler turns around to the umpire and wonders why he's been penalised for bowling outside the off stump. Probably because he was trying to pitch it on the adjacent wicket

"<b>almost undone by the slower ball</b>. Good work from Joseph, thinking on his feet. He has seen Sarfraz craving quick runs, and invariably that means a batsman plays with hard hands. So slips in a slower ball on off stump and the flick nearly carries to short midwicket"

"good length ball, allows it to spin away past his stumps"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"

turns a shortish delivery on off stump to short midwicket
"full and outside off, drives into the covers"
"superb work! First from the bowler, in executing the perfect bouncer, making it climb up over the batsman's shoulder, a batsman who had charged out at him. How dare he, says Joseph with this little peach. Forces Sarfraz into a tangle and the attempted hook shot is gloved over his head and into the hands of the wicketkeeper.

"he's already worked out the right length to bowl on this pitch. And he's only 20. This is a slow surface. Anything hitting the deck will stop on the batsman. So if you can pitch it on a fuller than good length -  as Joseph does - the batsman is instinctively drawn into drive - as Shafiq is - and leaves himself open to popping tame catches. In this case, the bowler gets to enjoy the fruits of his labour all by himself"
gets an inside edge as he lunges outside off to block
"gorgeous hit. An on-drive from the top draw, and the key is that he doesn't over hit it. There is barely any followthrough. Just brings a straight bat down, and uses his bottom hand to time it and away she goes between the stumps and the non-striker"

comes down the track to meet the pitch and lofts it to the cow corner region where long-on runs across and stops it
"very full on leg, tries to clip it away and gets rapped on the pad. Optimistic appeal for lbw but heading down leg"
spinning away and he shapes up to cut but too full and he gets beaten
"length ball, comes on rather straight and beats the outside edge"
gets down for a reverse sweep and makes no contact as the ball goes to the keeper from outside off
"short of a length, angled across, stays leg side of it and slaps it wide of mid-off. <b>Pakistan bring up their 150</b>"
"back of a length, angled across, opens the face of his bat and guides it to point"
"caught at short cover. Short of good length ball and Amir was backing away, looking to slap it away. Can't keep it down and Bishoo juggles and takes the catch on second attempt. Seems to suggest that he momentarily lost sight of the ball. West Indies finally break through but has the damage already been done?"
"fullish length, outside off, sends it crashing through covers for a brace"
"slower short ball, fetches a pull from outside off and skews it off the toe end of the bat. Bishoo at deep square leg misjudges it, runs all around it and almost over-ran the ball before managing to get around it"
"full toss, clears the front leg and thumps it straight down the ground. This is just loose bowling, West Indies doing themselves no favours by giving away easy runs"
"gets down and scoops it fine, first slip runs across and picks it up"
"gets down for a paddle sweep, undone by the length which is not full enough and it comes on at an awkward height to evade the bat"

"reverse sweep, sends it crashing through point. This is some serious carnage"
"comes down the track and swings wildly, gets a leading edge that flies away to third man. Everything Pakistan are doing is now working in their favour"
"pitched up, gets right underneath and smokes this clean over long-on. <b>Pakistan bring up their 300 and have declared</b>"
"appeal for a catch at forward short leg. Turned down by the umpire Illingworth. He then walks up to the square leg umpire and then they decide to refer this upstairs. Soft signal is not out. It is a full ball, swinging in, Brathwaite clips and the ball has clearly bounced before going to the fielder"
"full, outside off, gently pats it down the ground, wide of mid-off for a brace"

"good length, pushed across outside off and left alone"
"fuller ball, outside off, punched firmly off the front foot to covers"
what a delivery! Slightly short of good length and nips away off the seam to open up the batsman and rip past the outside edge. Stuck his bat out without feet there did Powell

"back of a length, gets on top of the bounce and defends"
"full, clipped off the pads wristily to deep midwicket"
"was that a bat-pad? Pushed across from around the wicket and the batsman defends on the front foot. No, infact, it just took off and hit the shoulder of the bat before lobbing over the cordon"
"great catch at silly point! What a reflex catch this is! Pakistan have got what they are looking for and that is a breakthrough before stumps. Powell pushes forward and defends but the ball stays in the air just for a second longer as it goes in the direction of the fielder. Shan Masood the man, throws himself down to his left and plucks a one-handed stunner"
"flighted full-toss outside off, clipped to mid-on"
"ooh, nice loop and dip outside off. Stretches out to defend, doesn't get close enough to the pitch, gets a thickish inside edge that goes to the right of short leg"
"a bit shorter now, goes on the back foot and it spins back sharply from wide of off, Hetmeyer gets on top of the bounce and tucks it down towards leg gully"
"fullish on off stump, defended to mid-on"
"length ball close to off stump, Brathwaite lets it come on and dabs with soft hands to the right of point"
"full, slanted across and providing plenty of width, gets a big stride out, head over the ball, and drives smoothly to the right of the diving fielder at short extra-cover"

"length ball pitching outside leg, stretches out and pads it away"

"nice stride forward to the tossed-up ball wide of off, gets his head on top of the ball and defends towards silly point"
"ooh, risky. Looks for the flick from wide outside off, gets on the front foot. Dips on him a little and he whips it away, in the air, to the right of midwicket and down to long-on"
"short ball gets the wicket! Pitches this on or just outside leg stump, and Brathwaite shapes to cut. It may have bounced a little more than he expected, and he simply couldn't keep it down. Slapped it airily, and Hasan takes a good low catch falling forward at point"

"back of a length on middle stump, nice, big back and across stride to defend back down the pitch"
"big turn and bounce on this occasion. Pitches short on middle and off, and Hope leaves it alone calmly"
"short, wide, and that's really quick footwork from Hope - back and a long way across to cut it to the right of point. Hasan Ali falls to his right, gets a part of his body to it, but can't stop it"

"tossed up full on off stump, gets a nice stretch out to smother it"
"dangled that up much slower and a little wider. Took a big step forward - maybe to flat-bat through cover - and realised he was nowhere near the pitch. Left it alone, wisely, because it turned massively"
"quicker, back of a length, closer to off stump, left alone"
"tossed up full on middle and off, gets his front leg out of the way and flat-bats to short extra-cover"
"flipper, maybe. Went straight on for sure as he came forward to defend. Pitched on middle and turned much less than expected. Hit the inside edge but fell down safely enough in front of short leg"
"quicker, full on leg stump, makes sure he doesn't get his pad in the way and defends into the on side"
"length ball angled into off stump, defended with soft hands into the off side"
"ooh, good ball. Came half-forward to another good-length ball, this one was pitched a couple of inches shorter and wider, and it straightened after pitching. Made sure he played close to his body and didn't follow the ball. Kept it down well. Outside edge rolled away wide of Younis at slip"
"back of a length on middle and off, tucks it away to the left of midwicket"
"length ball slanting away after pitching on middle and off. Excellent, testing angle, and a good leave"

"back of a length, slanting away from off stump, left alone"

"full-toss on off stump, driven away nicely between short extra-cover and cover"

"full, angling in towards off stump, gets on the front foot to punch towards mid-off"
"length ball, a fair bit wider outside off, left alone"
"fullish on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"bowled him! Not for the first time this series, and this is another beauty! Full this time, with just a bit of late swerve into the left-hander. A poor shot, goes for the big drive through mid-off, and the ball sneaks through between bat and pad and knocks back off stump"
greets him with an off-stump yorker first up. Brings his bat down quickly to keep it out
"there's the topspinner or maybe the googly. Goes on the back foot and he clearly didn't pick it. Cramped for room, brings his bat down hurriedly, protects his leg stump, and gets a thick inside-edge that rolls away through backward square leg"
"loopy yorker on middle and leg, jams his bat down and blocks it"
"beauty. Again, this one goes straight on. A bit of flight and dip, pitches on off stump. Comes forward to defend, gets a thick inside edge that bounces short of forward short-leg, to his left"
"loopy legbreak pitching outside off. I don't know if he picked it out of his hand. Hope jumped back and across, almost to get his pad behind the ball in case it's the googly, but it's the legbreak and he leaves it alone"

"another short ball, this time it's slanting away from off stump and Chase drops his wrists to leave"

"touch short outside off, walks across and whips it wide of Amir at mid-on"

squeezes a full-length delivery on off stump to backward point
punches a short of length delivery on off stump to cover

"attacks the stumps again at length on middle, gets this to lift off the deck because of the subtle change in pace - this one's a cutter - which Chase defends gently. Took the bottom hand off the grip"

shows the full face of the bat to defend one back to the bowler
"caught off balance as he hops across to defend an incoming length ball, defended in the end."
"<b> first Test wicket for Hasan </b> and this is a beauty to get him. Toe-crusher that tails back in late to hit him flush on the toe. Lot of reverse on that delivery. Hope froze, completely played all around the delivery and missed it completely. The ball would have crashed into middle stump. Hope paid the price for no feet movement at all. Big strike just before lunch."

sways out of the way of that short ball on middle
hops back to bunt the length ball to gully
"he's caught on the crease. The ball nips back from length on middle to hit Chase high on his back leg. Remember, the on-field decision was not-out so it has to smash the stumps. Forget about smashing, this one would've missed leg stump by a long way."

"angles a full ball in from around the stumps, Vishaul defends from the crease"
hops across to keep out the incoming length ball from wide of the crease

"full now, on off stump, blocked into the cover point region"
"ooh, again he goes back to a full ball - even fuller than the previous one - and it turns and bounces sharply to beat his jabbing outside edge. Pitched on middle and missed the outside edge by a long way. He definitely played for the flatter trajectory than the actual length"

He's late going forward - he's only landing on his heel when the ball pitches - and he's nowhere near the pitch of it to defend. Inside edge onto pad, and pops up to short leg. who takes a lovely catch diving forward"
"full outside off, blocked into the point region"
"length ball, a little closer to off stump, defended to silly point"
"quicker now, some sharp turn outside off, left alone"

"tossed up on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"

"another off-stump yorker, jabbed away to short extra"
"fullish on leg stump, defended to midwicket"
"tossed up on leg stump, defended to short leg"

"back of a length, a bit of inward movement, and Chase's bat comes down from gully, leaving a bit of a gap between bat and body, and he gets a thick inside edge straight into his back toe. He hops around in pain for a bit"

"full now, outside off, a bit of late movement away. Dowrich drives away from his body, his front foot simply doesn't go forward or across, and ends up slicing it towards gully off the outside half of his bat. Dowrich was batting with a fairly open stance, and the lack of footwork left his front foot a loong way from the ball."
"fullish on off stump, defended to silly cover point"
"another short ball, pitching outside leg and turning towards middle stump. Rocks back and pulls through square leg"
"big appeal for a catch at short leg, and Oxenford's finger goes up immediately. Dowrich reviews immediately. Tossed up outside leg, and Dowrich is only half-forward as he tries to flick against the turn. Loops up off the pad to the short-leg fielder. Was there any bat on it? The toe of Dowrich's bat hit the ground for sure. From replays, the ball seems to pass the inside edge without really grazing it, but is there conclusive evidence? Difficult decision, this. Personally, I don't think he edged it. But the third umpire is reviewing Bruce Oxenford's decision, which was out. From side-by-side front-on and side-on images, it seems that there's a bit of gap between bat and ball when it passes the edge. But you can't be entirely sure. The third umpire stays with the on-field decision. Unlucky for Dowrich, but the third umpire didn't have much of a choice there."

"floats a full-length delivery outside off from wide of the crease, left alone"
beauty! This one draws Holder into a defensive stroke but leaves him late to whizz past the outside edge
"ripper. Again the awkward angle. Comes back in, hits length around the fourth stump and holds its line, Holder feels for the ball and is beaten."
"errs in length, this is a half-volley which Holder caresses into the gap between cover and point. Slow outfield, so he's forced to run hard for two. Would've been four on most outfields"

"too full outside leg, kicks it away with the pad again"
"muscles the pull into the deep midwicket boundary. Yasir dropped short, Chase used the depth of the crease to wallop that. Had to reach for it slightly but he's tall, and so has good reach. Two bounces into the boundary"

"short ball that spins away slowly from middle, enough time to go back into the crease and bunt it to cover"

"tossed up on middle and leg, worked with the spin to midwicket"
"pulled and pulled well. Half-tracker on middle and leg, he swivelled back and hammered this into the deep backward square leg boundary. Deserved to be put away. Babar at short leg was in the firing line. <b> 50 stand for these two </b>"

bunted off the back foot into the vacant space at cover

"edged but safe. Plays inside the line, the ball grazes the outside edge but all along the ground to gully"
"<b> puts down a return catch. </b> Will be disappointed. Tough because he was on the followthrough. This would have been a sensational start to the session. Length ball on middle, this one stops on Chase who checks his defensive shot, skewed off the top part of the bat. Oh, dear."

goes back and across to defend the short ball with soft hands
"full and swinging back into the pads, turned with the angle to short midwicket"
shapes to sweep but pulls out late as this pitched well outside leg

"<b> Bizarre way to go, reverse swing has done the trick again. </b> This is a full toss that reverses back in from outside off, Holder plays all around it.

lunges forward and steers a full delivery to short cover
"steered into the gap behind point, good work by Shan Masood"

extra bounce. Rips back in a long way but misdirected down leg. Bounced over Sarfraz's grab.
driven into the gap at cover as Bishoo gets off the mark

stabs forward and keeps out the legbreak
eased with the spin to short cover. Too full again
driven back to Yasir. Firmly done
"cracked into the gap between cover and point. Picked the length early, rocked back and walloped the short ball. Deserved to be punished. Every now and then, Yasir has shown the tendency of pitching short. Chase has put it away most times. Pure quality"
"swung away over midwicket. Looked to hit it over mid-on but ended up dragging it a bit. It's predominantly an off-side field, so he gets away. Wonder if Chase thinks he's better off trying to get some runs and perhaps a century while the others bat around him."

"too much flight again, Bishoo gets forward and smothers the spin"
attempted yorker converted into a low full toss as he drives into the gap at cover

"googly, pitching outside leg, a touch too short and he can go back, watch it onto his bat, and tuck it down into the ground towards leg slip"
"length ball slanted across Bishoo, quite flat - not much turn. Again, doesn't commit himself, watches it closely, moves into a comfortable half-forward position, and defends into the off side"
"back of a length outside off, lets it come on and defends into the cover point region. The slowness of the pitch has grown really pronounced now - possibly because this is a 74-over-old ball"
"again, back of a length, fourth-stump line. Opens his bat face this time and pushes to deep point. They take the single"
"bouncer, Bishoo looks awkward while playing this, gets his gloves up to try and fend it, and he's lucky it doesn't hit his glove. Off the shoulder, loops up to Sarfraz, who appeals anyway"
"shortish on off stump, this time it only gets up to chest height and he gets back and across and defends with soft hands"
"ooh, good, quick short ball outside off. Went through quickly to Sarfraz after passing the batsman at shoulder height. No need to play at that but he had a waft anyway"
"oh my. Again he has a poke. So lucky not to be edging these. This one's fuller, on the shorter side of a good length, fifth-stump line. Slow to move his feet, just pokes while shuffling across, and the ball straightens a touch to beat his outside edge"
"length ball, nips in towards off stump. He's on his way forward, this one bounces extra, and he drops his bottom hand to defend into the on side"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched back to the bowler"
"ooh, full outside off, inviting the drive. Chase goes for it, but it reverses late, and he ends up inside-edging into his boot and slipping as he does so"
"full-toss on off stump, clipped to midwicket"
"ooh, what a delivery. Length ball, cutting back sharply off the pitch. Chase is a little late getting on the front foot to defend into the off side, and the ball beats his inside edge and produces a big lbw appeal. Too high, it looks like. Hit his elbow and then his thigh"
"fuller now, outside off, driven into the covers"
"length ball angling into off stump, defended to short cover"
"fuller now, fourth-stump line - seems to be getting some late shape away from the left-hander - and Bishoo steps across nicely to defend into the covers"
"he bowls the bouncer instead, rising over off stump, and the ball whizzes over his helmet as he ducks while taking his eye over the ball"
"another bouncer, and Bishoo finds no way of evading this one. Rose to an awkward height - towards his neck - and the inward angle left him in no position to play it. Tried to fend it away into the on side, only managed to glove it in the air, gives the man at silly point the simplest of catches. Went off the bat handle, actually"
"full, angling down leg, looks to flick and gets a tickle off the front pad past the wicketkeeper diving to his left. A bit of bat too, perhaps"

"dipping slower ball, full outside off. Chase reaches out with his hands and stabs it to short cover"
"<b>dropped</b>. Reflex catch, those are hard to take. Full, swinging in towards the pads. Plays a flick that ends up rocketing back towards the bowler at chest height. Sticks his hands out, but the ball doesn't stick. Seems to have done a bit of damage to the hand"
"full again, reverses in late. Swinging down the leg side, so they abort the lbw appeal after Chase plays an ugly hoick across the line and misses"
"full slower ball, angling in towards off stump. This time he simply presses forward and defends into the on side"
"bouncer, angled down the leg side. Joseph ducks anyway"
"oh man. Maybe an attempted slower ball that slipped out. Definitely a high full-toss even if Joseph had been standing at full height. He ducked instead, and that only just missed his helmet. No-balled and warned."
"oooh, how did that miss off stump? Late reverse again from a good length, and Joseph shouldered arms. Couldn't have missed by more than an inch"

"back of a length, a bit of movement into middle and leg, tucked away to long leg"
"goes for the yorker, and hits Joseph's pad on the full as he overbalances while trying to play around his front pad. Late reverse, maybe too much of it, and the umpire shakes his head. Hawkeye says missing leg stump"

"back of a length outside off, punched to the left of cover. Azhar moves quickly to stop that"
"length ball, a bit of outswing again, too wide to make Chase play"
"gone! Caught at first slip! Full, fairly wide of off stump, and this time Chase goes for the big cover drive. Thick edge, flies to the right of Shafiq at shoulder height, and he takes it well with both hands. But hang on, Abbas has <b>overstepped</b> here! His heel lands on the line, but no part of it is behind the line."
"back of a length, wide outside off, some swing again. This time it's too wide to tempt Chase"
"ooh, good ball. Back of a length, banged into the pitch on an off-and-middle line. Straightens late. Chase looks to play the initial angle and work it leg side. The ball pops up towards point off the leading edge"
"length ball, wide of off, left alone"
"swing straightaway, swings from just back of a length, but swings down the leg side and makes Sarfraz dive"
"lbw appeal, but the ball pitched on or even outside leg stump and swung further down, beat Alzarri's defensive jab and hit his front pad"
"swing again, fuller length this time, towards Joseph's feet. Clipped to short leg"
"length ball, slanting across to middle stump, no swing this time. Joseph blocks it back to the bowler"

"full, some swing in towards off stump, blocked solidly to mid-off"
"full, angling down leg, Chase misses the flick and Sarfraz, throwing himself to his left, gets a bit of glove onto the ball but can't hold on. No one's interested in a bye"
"full, wide outswinger, slapped to deep point. No single taken. Should have left this given he doesn't want the single anyway"
"fullish, straightens towards off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"bouncer, Chase semi-ducks to evade it"
"full, angling into middle stump, defended to mid-on"
"back of a length outside off, punched away through the covers and deep point does not give chase - they'd rather concede four than give up a single and allow Chase to retain strike"
"Another astoundingly fortunate leave from Joseph. Back of a length, angling in from wide of the crease and swinging further in. Joseph leaves, without covering his stumps, and the ball bounces over the top of <i>leg</i> stump"
"another leave. This one starts from wider outside off, and doesn't swing as much"
"full outside off, and he strides forward and plays a flowing drive to point. High elbow and all that"
"full on off stump, some late swing in, Joseph punches it back to the bowler, as good-looking as the previous shot"
"bouncer, rising over leg stump or just outside. Joseph ducks down low, some serious knee and hip bend there"

"fullish on off stump, blocked to mid-on"
"back of a length, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump, punched into the covers"

"stays back to a length ball again, this one's headed towards off stump. Gets behind it to defend back to the bowler"
"fuller now, again homing in on off stump, punched to cover point, who's come in off the boundary just to stop that kind of shot and save the single"
"back of a length just outside off, punched into the covers"
"loopy leg-stump yorker, gets his feet out of the way and digs it out into the off side"
"dangled up slow outside off, left alone"
"ooh, tossed up again, full and a little wider. Goes for the big slog and misses by a long way, because that turned massively. May have thought it was the googly, simply because of the line"
"back of a length, flat, big legbreak that pitches on off stump. Left alone"
"back of a length again, this one pitches on middle and turns away, slower turn than the previous ball, defended into the point region"
"fullish, a bit of swing in towards middle stump, and Chase <b>gets to his hundred</b> with a stunning on-drive. A flick, really, past mid-on diving helplessly to his left. Does that X thing with his arms in celebration - not sure what it signifies, but who cares? What an innings he's played here"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"full on off stump, punched to mid-off"
"short, attempted bouncer, but it's wasted because a: it doesn't rise much at all, and b) it's too wide of off stump to make Chase play"
"length ball, sixth-stump line, left alone. Needs to be a foot closer to off stump to make Chase play"
"full, fourth-stump line. Goes for the off-drive without too much of a front-foot stride, and it skews off the outside half of the bat to the left of backward point, where Shafiq makes a good, diving stop to keep Chase away from the strike"
"big legbreak, dips onto a good length outside off and rips away. Stretches out and feels for it, bat doesn't really find the general vicinity of the ball"
"fuller now, and he gets a nice stride out to drive into the covers. The fielder chasing back teases them, as if to ask, don't you want more than one? Nope, they don't."

"full, pitches just outside leg, defended back to the bowler"
"tossed up on leg stump, driven inside-out to mid-off"
"full, a bit of late swing in towards middle and off. Front pad is safely out of the way as he defends into the cover point region"
"gone, Hasan has struck the crucial blow! The good old good-length ball, just outside off, in the corridor, the channel, call it what you will. Joseph feels for it, doesn't really move his feet in time. He's on the move while he plays and gets a thick outside edge that carries through at waist height to Sarfraz"
"back of a length wide of off, left alone"
"fullish, fourth-stump line. A decent stride forward and across to defend towards backward point"
"it isn't the bouncer. It's the full offcutter on a fourth-stump line, and Gabriel presses forward and has a little poke at it. I'm not sure he edged that, but Pakistan are convinced. They've reviewed Richard Illingworth's not-out decision. Replays show this might well be an edge. It's awfully close to the edge, if anything, but is there enough of a deflection to overrule Mr. Illingworth? In the absence of Snicko and HotSpot, the third umpire may well have to go with the on-field call. Not out. Phew."

"length ball, pitching middle and leg and turning towards off. Chase trusts the slowness of the pitch and defends off the back foot"

"length ball on off stump, blocked to mid-off"
"bouncer over off stump, and that's a great leave. Drops his wrists, sways his upper body away from the line, keeps his eye on the ball. Beautiful"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, and again he shows the full face and blocks to mid-off. Good stride in too"
"length ball again, nips in towards middle stump. Another excellent forward defensive. Plays close to his body and drops it down into the on side"
"short ball, as expected, but slanted away from off stump. Gabriel is looking to leave this, but he leaves his bat in the ball's path, and it ricochets off the cue-end and flies over the leaping fielder at third slip"
"another bouncer, angled across the batsman and over middle stump. He stays besides the line of the ball and pulls his bat away after initially shaping to have a poke"
"tossed up on middle stump, defended into the on side"
"fuller now, on leg stump, driven firmly to mid-on"
"legbreak lands on a nice length on leg stump, Chase is calmly forward to defend past short leg"
"flighted ball on leg stump, too full to really bother Chase, defends inside-out to silly point"
"ooh, finally lands one on the perfect length. Slows it up and makes Chase reach out and stretch. Pitches on middle, rips away, and beats the outside edge of his defensive bat."
"short outside off, Chase slaps it away between cover point and backward point. They take one, and despite Pakistan's fielders asking it to continue in that direction, the ball refuses to reach the boundary"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"wide of the crease, bangs it in short. Loops up tennis-ball style, and Chase ducks low under it"
"looks for the yorker, bowls it a few inches outside off stump. Stabbed away into the cover point region"
"full, angling into middle and leg, defended to midwicket. Showed the full face there, didn't look to flick"
"another yorker, an inch outside off stump this time, jabbed to cover point"
"length ball wide of off stump, Chase will not chase those"
"Beaten. Length ball outside off, turns away to beat Gabriel's forward defensive"
"and again. This one pitched on the stumps, but spun even more. Gabriel didn't follow it with his hands"

"short, wide, slapped powerfully to point"
"full, too full, gets a nice stride in and blocks to silly point"
"lbw appeal, more in hope than in belief. Length ball pitches on middle and turns away. Slow getting forward, gets an inside-edge onto pad"
"banged in short from wide of the crease, Chase ducks"
"short outside off, hops to ride the bounce and defends towards point"
"full outside off, angling in from wide of the crease, defended to Misbah at short cover"
"awkward bouncer, angling in and rising towards Chase's ribs. He got into a closed-off position, fended at it, and the ball hit the sticker of his bat and went to the right of short leg"
"another bouncer, rising over Chase's right shoulder this time. Keeps his eye on it and sways away from the line"
"shortish, angling into off stump, Chase jumps to get on top of the bounce, keeps it down by playing close to his body"
"tossed up full on leg stump, gets that front leg out of the way and gets down low to defend back to the bowler"
"short, pitches on leg and turns away sharply, but this pitch is really slow, and he waits on the back foot and blocks comfortably into the covers"
"full outside leg, defended past the man at short leg"
"given! Gabriel reviews this, I'm not sure he edged that. Drops this on a nice length outside leg. Gabriel thrust his pad at the ball and then the pad. Bat hit the back of his front leg, preventing it from completing his defensive stroke. I think the ball hit his pad, and somehow squeezed behind his bat, hit his back thigh, and then popped to silly point. For once, we have conclusive evidence to overturn the on-field decision!"
"tossed up full outside leg, big stride out, solid defensive push into the leg side"
"WHAT HAS JUST HAPPENED HERE? Slogs, and inside-edges into off stump! He had one ball to see out, and I think Yasir bowled the googly outside off. Gabriel may have picked it, and figured he was safest hitting it over the top because everyone was clustered around the bat. Still, what a risk. Only manages an inside-edge, and the ball ricochets into the stumps"
