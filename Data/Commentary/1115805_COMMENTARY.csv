"fullish on middle, presents the full face"
knocks a good length ball into the covers
gets right behind a short of a length delivery on middle. No wickets in the first over. Breathe.
"ooh, the romance between the outside edge and the outswinger is strong. Boult drags the makeshift opener forward, and takes the ball away enough to beat the middle. Single to deep third man"
"angles it into the body, at a full length, getting some seam off the pitch, Zaman nudges it to midwicket"
"hunts the top of off stump, but Zaman and the middle of the bat interfere"
<b>lovely leave</B>! There is every sign that this full delivery is meant to behead off stump. But then it pitches and holds its line and goes through to the keeper
creams it to the long-off boundary! A little bit of width and the opener latches onto it like iron on a magnet
"goes straighter, Fakhar misses out on a flick and is struck on the pads"
"back of a length, and only a shade outside off. Ashraf dabs to point"
hits the pads as Ashraf falls over a bit in his effort the whip through square leg
"<b>the experiment fails</b>. He goes for the cut again, when there possibly isn't enough room. Worse, Southee gets the ball to kick up off the pitch, piggyback off the top edge and settle in the wicketkeeper's gloves. Pakistan one-down early. Hmmm, haven't we been here before?"
"gorgeous shot, the checked on-drive against a perfectly good ball on off stump. Everything right about it, from the front foot striding down the pitch to the straight bat making polite greeting"
"bangs it in, wanting the left-hander to drag it from outside off. Zaman doesn't offer Southee the pleasure"

"up there for the drive, with plenty of room to free the arms, but Zaman isn't able to get his usual timing going and finds mid-off instead"
"taps and runs to the left of short cover, that's Santner's strong side, but he can't get the ball away in time. That alone is credit to the batsman's placement."
"ducks beneath a very short ball, sailing over the ducking batsman"
"<b>throws it away</b>! The width triggers the shot. That's the first thing Babar sees but the ball gets up to a bit of mischief about three-fourth the way down. It swings away. Well enough to beat the middle, snap the edge. Latham with his second catch, Southee with his second wicket"
"rises with a short delivery outside off and dabs towards point. Good stuff, considering he's very new to the crease and the ball is coming up to his badge"
walks across his stumps and gets behind another bouncer on off stump
"<B>dropped</b>, is it? Munro is banging his right hand on the turf looking beyond disappointed. He does so well to get close enough to make that a legitimate chance, running several yards to his right from short midwicket. Puts in a full-length dive, sticks out his hand and the ball ends up bobbing off his wrist and onto the turf. Zaman survives, as he did in the Champions Trophy final when he made a hundred, after playing a poor shot. Today, it's a badly-timed flick"

punches a good length ball straight down the ground and pinches a single before mid-on can come into play
"bouncer, a shade outside off, Zaman avoids it"

"goes for the pull against a short ball on leg stump, but it bobbles off his thigh pad"
glides a back of a length delivery outside off to deep third man
belts it away to deep midwicket. That is absolutely majestic. It isn't even short enough for the shot - he's pulling off the front foot and there is so much power on the shot. Power enough to light up a small town
"back of a length and outside off, he carves it to cover. Again, loads of power"
"good work from Southee, pulling all the pace back and makes Zaman defend the offcutter in line with the stumps"
"smacks it down the ground - fast bowlers loathe that more than Jason Bourne does the CIA. Picks the slower ball and with it offering width, he flat-bats it to long-off"
<b>beats the outside edge</b> with a bit of extra bounce as Southee angles the back of a length delivery across the left-thander
firm defence to a shortish delivery on middle
superb timing again as he presents the full face of the bat on an overpitched delivery. Ferguson at mid-on though puts in a good dive and stops the boundary

gently steers a shortish delivery outside off to deep third man
blocks a short of a length delivery on middle
slogs a length ball off middle stump away to the right of long leg. Could just as easily been bowled
"that's basic. A full toss on leg stump and Zaman puts on a bib, grabs his spoon and form and tucks into it like its Thanksgiving"
"a better shot, against a better ball, as he stands tall and punches a back of a length delivery through point. Bisects the two men square of the wicket there"
"<b>that's a top edge</b>! It shouldn't be travelling all the way! Zaman is thoroughly done by the bounce on this, nudging up to his left shoulder even as he tries to hook it away. And yet..."
"shortish on off stump, defends"
"fullish on middle, keeps it out"
sweet timing to the midwicket boundary. A ball on the pads is a ball on the pads even at 145 kph and Sohail puts it away looking like a class batsman

"another bouncer, angled a fair distance down leg, but the umpire lets him get away with it, perhaps because Sarfraz kept backing away"
148 kph delivery outsmarting the batsman. Sarfraz is looking to make room again and so Ferguson goes full and outside off and plays the perfect party crasher.
"beats him first ball, from around the wicket. But to be fair, this is a length ball, with enough width outside off to go downtown. Hafeez looks to do just that, but doesn't pull it off"
"gets a touch across his stumps - good thinking - and that takes him a lot closer to the slower ball near the wide line. After that, it's about a clean swing and Hafeez has got that. The field is set for the full and wide delivery and he one-ups New Zealand beautifully"
"full toss outside off, Hafeez hits straight to cover and wants a single. Sarfraz says no, correctly, and if there had been a direct hit, he would have been walking back"

one-bounce into the third man boundary. There's width. There's pace (146kph). There's opportunity and Hafeez cashes in with an upper cut
"third man is up for the slower pace that Boult is trying to work with. But he is also concentrating on bowling wide outside off. Sarfraz reads the play perfectly, stands still and dabs the ball to the third man boundary to bring up <b>his fifty</b> off only 44 balls"

"down the track, looking to make the pace himself since New Zealand aren't giving him any. Flat-bat pull to long-on"
"who cares if its back of a length, Shadab hits it straight back over the bowler's head. Sublime hit. To get under the ball bouncing up to your waist and then swing the bat hard enough to clear the ropes is fairly freakish"
offers length and Hafeez clears his front leg and launches it over long-on. Massive strike.
"looks at fine leg, the bat in scooping position, but since he makes that move way too early, Boult is able to change his length. Bowling it short, taking the pace off, and beating the bat"
"superb hit, and it's all timing as he beats long-off. Getting elevation off a low full toss like that is quite special."
"goes around the wicket, but ends up bowling a full toss, which Hafeez pastes through extra cover. Pakistan's last five overs have been absolutely brilliant. New Zealand, though, have been pretty awful with their lengths"
top edge sails into the crowd at long leg! Pakistan get past 260 with a hook shot against a very sharp bouncer
"yorker on middle, Hafeez knocks it to the right of the pitch and decides to run. Boult simply flies at the ball, takes it with his right hand, transfers it to his left, and knocks the stumps down at the non-strikers."

"excellent comeback from Rumman as well, angling the ball in, looking for lbw. Latham foils those well laid plans with a straight bat"
the front leg is across on off stump - that's why Pakistan are gunning for lbw. Latham manages to plonk the bat in front of it and the full delivery becomes a dot

"judges the length well and pushes onto the back foot to defend a quick turning, shortish legbreak"
"got im! The cut is one of Latham's strengths and he makes room upon seeing a short ball on fourth stump. He believes this is a legbreak ripe for the cut.  Problem is, it doesn't turn as much as he expects and bounces a little too much to boot. The ball takes the edge and goes to the left of slip where Azam takes a very sharp catch."
