slides into the pads on a length...and Kohli merely touches this with a glance. Gets it a few yards wide of short fine and it races away
"back of a length on middle stump, punched confidently to long-on off the back foot"
"attempted googly, dropped too short. Sits up on a leg stump line and Dhawan swivels on his back foot, front leg slightly raised, as he shovels this to the long leg boundary"
"pushes it through on a length, leg stump line, hurried flick straight to midwicket"
"drops it short again on leg stump. This time Dhawan is more energetic in his movement. Pushes back quickly and slaps this, aerially, to the long leg fence"
"good length at off stump, solidly behind it to defend off the front foot"
poor. Has fine leg and square leg in the circle -  a field for the full balls. Drifts it into the pads on a good length. Tucked off the pads past square leg
"fine leg goes back, but Kohli has hit it the other side of square leg this time. Length on the pads again and he stands tall to whip this"
"back of a length and nips back in towards off stump, cramps him up, forces him to defend off the back foot"
"good length, in the the corridor. Defended into the off side on the up"
"back of a length in the corridor, opens the face and runs it to third man"
"shot. Good length, angled across the left-hander but it's nicely in the slot for him. Extends his arms and taps it on the up to thread this through the cover region"
"full and down the leg side, looks to flay this with a sweep, can't connect"
"back of a length outside off stump, zips off the pitch and beats the outside edge on the cut shot"
"good length outside off stump, driven on the up to extra cover"
"good length at middle stump, gets a big stride in and turns this into the leg side"
"back of a length outside off stump, late cut, hit straight to backward point"
"ah, unlucky Badree. Googly, full and wide outside off stump. Draws him into the drive and gets the outside edge, but that flies past short third man"
"good length on off stump, forward defence"
short and wide outside off stump. That one was climbing sharply. Past his attempted upper cut
"back of a length, angled into the corridor, gets on his toes and taps this to cover point"
"<b>miscues the pull</b> but gets four! Dreadful shot. Kesrick goes wide of the crease, bowls a bouncer in the corridor. They're sticking to their plans against Kohli. He's late on the pull but it floats over mid-off and into the boundary"
"shot. Now he knows what's coming. Stays put in the crease, cuts down his shuffle a tad and slaps this bouncer to the midwicket boundary"
"back of a length, angled into the waist, watches it closely and opens the face to get it to third man"
"back of a length at leg stump, tucked to deep square leg off his thigh"
"short and just marginally wide outside off stump. Enough for Dhawan. Slashes at it, gets it off the middle and a bit more square than he would've liked, but that's four"
"short and in the corridor this time, a controlled slice to third man"
"back of a length, angled into the corridor. Looks to stab it to third man, beaten on the outside edge"
"regal. Backs away and stays so, so still. This is a good length ball at middle stump, but he's punched it on the up through extra cover"
"stays put this time, doesn't look to make room, and so this is a wide down leg side"
and again. Full and slanted down leg
"loses his shape. Charges at this length ball and looks to lift it over mid-off. Gets contorted and the head is out of the path of the ball, which climbs over the stumps"
"back of a length on middle stump, plays it from under his eyes, drops it into the midwicket region with soft hands"
"what. How did he do that. He has whipped a short ball off the front foot, from off stump, over the long-on boundary. Boycott has just parcelled this guy the text book"
"short and wide now, easy peasy, sways back and deposits this slice to the wide third man boundary"
"oh well bowled. Kohli makes room and is looking to hit another rising ball on the up, but Kesrick has rolled his fingers on that one. Gets a bit of grip in the pitch and Kohli's bat turns. Lobs a simple one to Narine at mid-on"
"good shot. Only one. Classily whips this length ball from middle stump, along the floor to deep square leg"
"<b>fantastic fielding by Kesrick!</b> Runs to his left, picks it up, swivels and tears down the non-strikers stumps as Dhawan is stranded halfway down the pitch. This was a short ball on middle stump. Pant defended it into the leg side and did not respond to Dhawan's call...<b>correction:</b> in fact, it was Pant who took off after hitting the shot. Dhawan responded and was too far down when Pant changed his mind"
"slower ball, good length at off stump. Walks into the shot, pushes it to mid-off"
"back of a length at off stump, whipped to midwicket off the back foot"
"back of a length outside off stump, opens the face to run it to short third man"
"good length at off stump, leans in and pokes it through the covers"
"short on off stump, makes room and bludgeons the back foot punch, straight to sweeper cover"
"good length, strikes him on the pads as he looks to flick and lobs towards short fine...who misfields and allows a second"
"good length on off stump, tries to push it through the covers, doesn't get to the pitch. Thick inside edge to midwicket"
"drops it short on middle stump, pulled straight to deep backward square"
"good length at off stump, forward defence into the off side"
"shot. Short on off stump, backs way nimbly and scythes this through backward point"
"good length at off stump, taps the reverse sweep into the pitch, a single to short third man"
"short and wide, cuts it late, sweeper cleans up"
"overpitched on leg stump, a delightful drive off his toes, straight to midwicket"
"back of a length at off stump, turns into him, he bunts it to short third man"
"overpitched on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"short ball at middle stump. Hurries him but he adjusts by hitting this a bit straighter. Slightly aerial but it dribbles away to the deep midwicket boundary, beating the fielder's dive at the last moment"
"back of a length outside off stump, punched to sweeper cover off the back foot"
"wrong'un, short on off stump, times the pull shot nicely but picks out deep midwicket on the bounce"
"short on the pads, stifled pull shot, straight to deep square leg"
"short and wide, another absolute brute of a cut, straight to sweeper"
"good length on middle stump, gets inside the line and tries to ramp it, but it bounces too much"
"so he goes for the conventional sweep. And gets it sweetly. Picks it up from a length outside off stump, keeps it on the floor and finds the square leg boundary"
"short and just outside off stump, finds backward point with the cut"
misses out on the short one again. Cuts straight to backward point
"good length at middle stump, pushed on the up to long-on"
"back of a length outside off stump, punches off the back foot to wide long-on"
"back of a length outside off stump, slices away from the body, straight to backward point"
"back of a length outside off stump, back foot punch to extra cover"
"goes deep in the crease for a big pull, hurried on it. Trickles out to deep square on the mistimed pull"
"oh good shot. Looks like a premeditated slog sweep, because he hasn't swept that on length. Was down early, picked this on the up from outside off and sent it into the stands"
"and again, gets in position early for the sweep. This one is shorter outside off, but he adjusts to ramp it fine. Quality limited-overs batting"
"good length outside off stump, thumps on the up as it turns away from him, gets it to sweeper's left"
"back of a length outside off, too far from the ball as he cuts, chops it into the turf towards extra cover"
"good length at off stump, fends at it off the front foot, inside edge to short fine leg"
"struggling a bit here. Back of a length, spinning and bouncing away from him, beaten on the cut"
"good length at off stump, pushed into the cover region with soft hands"
finally gets the cut past backward point. This wasn't too short. Back of a length and climbing in the off stump channel. Got deep in the crease and made the extra millisecond he needed to place this to the fielder's left with a cut
"short and cramps him near the ribs, one hand comes off the bat as he pull. Rolls feebly to long-on"
"a sound there. But not out says the umpire on the belated appeal. Back of a length in the corridor, tries to run it down to third man but he's beaten"
"this is impressive batting. Knows where the gaps are. Walks across the stumps, puts a stride forward and across and picks this rising ball from outside off. Lifts it over short fine leg"
"goes for the yorker, misses. Down leg"
"back of a length outside off, angles in and straightens. Karthik's down the track to try and flick this into the leg side, but he's beaten...lazily walks back into the crease, not expecting the keeper to throw. He was out if that had hit the stumps"
"another mix up. This is back of a length on off stump, he chops it straight to point. Pant is halfway down the pitch this time, but he hurries back to make his crease"
"drops it short on off stump, he goes back and under this. Lifts the pull cleanly over the square leg boundary"
"good length at off stump, looks to slap it on the up through the covers. Gets it high on the bat, straight to extra cover"
"good length outside off, steps out, but that's too wide. Tries to hit it over extra cover, drags it down to long-off"
"steps out, meets the length ball on the pitch, flicks to deep midwicket"
"the plan is clear. They're angling at across Pant and turning it away. Samuels does it again. Good length outside off, he looks to swipe it over midwicket boundary, beaten"
"good length, turning away from off stump. Goes across the line again, loses the bat and skews this in the air to long-off who races in and puts a <b>big dive forward but can't catch it</b>"
"looks to sweep this length ball from middle stump, swings too hard and mistimes. But the ball has hit the back of his bat, and a bit of glove, on the swing, and this is four through short third man"
"good length at off stump, pushes it into the covers on the up with soft hands"
"full and tailing into leg stump, jammed out to long-on off the inside half of the bat"
"bouncer, rises nastily on Pant. He looks to hook and is in a bad position. Cops it on the left shoulder. This lands to the keeper's right and Karthik wants a run  but he's sent back. Pant is winded, he needs attention"
"another bouncer, cramped again. Gets under the pull, slices it, couple of bounces to deep midwicket"
"offcutter, back of a length outside off stump. Opens the face, dabs it to third man"
"full at off stump, late on the attempted drive through the leg side. Toe-ends it to long-on"
"gets one in the slot and just clears the midwicket boundary. This is pushed through flat, good length on middle stump. Takes a step down and swings hard, not quite off the middle, but that's over"
"shot. Knows this one is going to be angled across. Gets it on a good length, slaps it over extra cover"
"back of a length outside off, steps out and pulls it, just about, to long-on"
"looks to pick that long leg boundary again, but he's gone too far across into the off side. Exposes all his stumps to this good length ball that clips the top of middle stump as he looks to ramp it"
"good length at middle stump, stride across, pokes it into the leg side"
"good length outside off, swings across the line, but isn't quite to the pitch. Drags it out to long-on"
"steps out, takes it on the full and swings so hard...loses his bat again. <b>It nearly falls onto the stumps!</b>. A single to sweeper in the end"
"back of a length outside off stump, pushed on the up to extra cover"
"full and follows the batsman down leg, he looks to slice this between point and short third man, can't get enough bat to do it"
"<b>top edge taken by backward point.</b> Change up from Taylor - bowls an offcutter, back of a length outside off stump. Grips in the pitch and rises as he tries to slog this on the up over midwicket. A few steps back for backward point and that's an easy catch in the end"
"<b>edged? Yes!</b> This is good bowling from Taylor. Bounces this in the off stump channel, Pant looks to back away and ramp this to the third man boundary but gets a feather through. That's the end of his much-vaunted chance in the Caribbean. Tough day"
"good length, into the pads, pushed into the awkward region between deep midwicket and long-on with enough finesse to come back for the second"
"short and wide, slower ball. Waits for it and chops it to sweeper's left"
"short in the corridor, gets all of this cut, but Chris Gayle gets in the way at backward point"
"slower ball, good length on leg stump, tucked off the front foot to short fine's right"
"slower ball, good length outside off stump. Looks to punch through the off side, but there's no pace off the wicket. Long-off fields"
"back of a length and angled across off stump, looks to pull, hurried on it. Long-on runs in"
"<b>Narine dives to his left</b> and takes a catch at deep square leg. It's a trademark Jadhav whip off the hips - which means it's really inexplicable. Back of a length, in at his mid-riff and he waits till it nearly strikes him flush before rolling his wrists hard. It dips to Narine's left but he does really well to hand on"
"low full toss on leg stump, flicked to deep square leg"
"goes for the yorker, misses his mark. Walton puts in a superb low dive to his right to parry it to fine leg"
"stays around the wicket to Ashwin. Yorker just outside off stump, dabbed to third man"
"backs away, tries to flay this cut shot from back of a length on middle, thick outside edge to a very strategically placed fine third man"
"shimmies around the crease, gets low on the full toss outside, gets it to long-on"
"full outside off stump, looks to go inside out through extra cover, thick inside edge to long-on"
"low full toss on middle stump, flicked along the floor to deep midwicket"
"offcutter, full at off stump, makes room and tries to cream this through the off side. Can only find long-off for the single"
"anticipates the slower ball and gets it. It's full and wide outside off stump, he gets low, one his back knee, and slog sweeps this, wide of long-on"
"back of a length, pitches outside leg, strikes his pad outside the line as well. He sways across the line at this. Kesrick's appealing loudly as it trickles to the fine leg boundary"
"full outside off stump, gets the front leg out of the way and drills it to long-off"
"back of a length slower ball on off stump, backs away and slaps this to sweeper cover's right...and this really runs away quickly. The fielder gets across after the initial shock"
"aaaaand finds the boundary to lift India to 190. <b>18 runs off the last over.</b> It's a low full toss on off stump, he sets himself up for a slog but he's thumped this back past the bowler to bisect the two fielders in the deep"
a gentle little tickle off his pads to long leg gets the Boss going. Like hot coffee in the morning.
"well, the pretender is angling for the throne! Picks up a length ball and heaves it over square leg. But it doesn't carry where it is meant to because the wind is so ruddy strong"
"struck on the thigh as he moves right across his stumps, aiming to hit to square leg again. Cross-seam delivery helping Bhuvi avoid punishment and instead make the batsman look pretty silly"
"a little chop to cover, as Bhuvi takes the pace off the ball. Lewis shapes to cut - he's very very good with that shot - but the ball seems to keep a little lower than he anticipates"
"oh, he could have had a dinky little boundary. But he is Chris Gayle so fate decides otherwise. Fine leg is up inside the circle and the big man dabs straight to him"
punches down the ground for Kohli to rush in from mid-off and prevent the single. Half expected him to do the <a href='http://p.imgci.com/db/PICTURES/CMS/157100/157155.2.jpg' target='_blank'>old RCB celebration</a> with Christopher Henry
"tosses it up on off stump, from around the wicket, defends"
"was there an edge there and either way <b>how did it miss the stumps</b>? The orthodox offspinner doesn't really turn, Gayle looks to take it on, but the ball sneaks between bat and pad. Dhoni doesn't stay low enough to collect it either. Rare that"
"logs in for the slog sweep, but Ashwin inserts a bug into the program by not allowing Lewis the freedom to swing the arms. Only a single to midwicket"
gets down the track and nudges to midwicket
loops it up - with a bit of a wide-arm action - Gayle blocks
"hello, world! I have returned! Gayle should be yelling that near the stump mic, but instead he takes on a length ball and smears it over long-off, clean as!"
"swivels on the back foot, after moving across onto off stump, to pull a short ball to deep square leg"
<b>could have been run-out</b> had square leg hit direct. Gayle hesitates after clipping away a ball on his thighs and that could well have cost him
"goes for the bouncer, but Lewis evades it"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"finds the gap between backward square leg and short fine leg. Isn't hit too hard though, so it is only two"
backs away and punches a shortish delivery to mid-off
one-bounce! Putting the ball up there for Gayle to languidly step forward and hit it through the line with that big bat is a bad idea
pulls his length back and so Gayle can only slice it away through cover point
picks the gap between backward and cover point. Toldja he's a good cutter. And has all the West Indian flair too. The head throwing back and the bat tracing wild arcs like it's a whip
"that's a thick outside edge, but boy is it still good. Short wide. hit-me scrawled all over it in pristine cursive and Lewis reads it like an A student"
"hey my mentor at the other end, watch this! Stands and delivers an extra cover drive that singes the turf as it goes to the boundary"
"and that's 19 off the Shami over! Lewis is setting Jamaica alight under bright sunshine. This wide yorker is meant to stump him, but he just calmly gets down with it and carves it to the third man boundary"
comes down the track and nudges a length ball on middle through midwicket
"flatter delivery, pushed on leg stump, Lewis hacks it behind square leg"
"has he one-upped Ashwin here? His initial move was a feint - a big lunge outside off - and that might well have tempted the offspinner to fire it flat on leg stump. But by then, Lewis has leapt back, made room and launch it over long-on. That's bloody burrrrrilliant!"
and the classical straight bat shot to follow! An overpitched delivery on off stump gets the textbook throw on top of it
"full and fast on leg stump, pushes to mid-on"
"that will be wide, as Ashwin tries to follow Lewis' move to make room. Trails him a little too enthusiastically and concedes the extra"
belts a ball about two sets of stumps wide of leg to mid-on. Making room must be on his unconscious mind
"slower ball on leg stump, Gayle dabs it to deep square leg and camps at the non-strikers. That's basically an endorsement to young Lewis. Go forth and conquer."
clears his front leg and smacks a length ball down to long-on. Hits it so hard that this ends up going off the bottom of the bat
another little nudge through midwicket and Gayle chills at the non-strikers' again. Guess he wants to take it easy on his first T20I at home in Jamaica
"buh-bye ball! Lewis has clobbered a short ball into the Atlantic. Short, but not near the head-high, and that means Lewis can rock back, and just swing hard and swing free. Miles over midwicket"
now he carves it like an apple through cover. Makes room and sends a back of a length delivery on middle through  cover. This is just brutal.
"a lofted straight drive, but this goes high. this is going to be a catch, a very difficult one, but Kohli is the man trying to get under it. But oh, he isn't the only one. Shami is cutting across, chasing after the ball. <b>There's going to be a collision</b>..... Phew, that's avoided. But the chance goes begging. And the Indian captain is fuming. He says I'm going for it, I called for it. And Shami retorts he couldn't hear the call."
"when you fail once, try, try and try again. So Lewis goes looking for the ocean again. Just misses out. Ends up with a six into nearly the top tier behind long-on"
some turn as the good length ball cuts into Lewis and doesn't allow him to cut
"squeezes out a very full, very quick yorker outside off through to deep third man. That's what Lewis is making them do. He's making the spinners bowl like quicks"
<b>it's another chance but it's dropped</b>. Another huge heave - Lewis really does not hold back when he looks for the boundary. This ball must hit high on the bat because it goes just high. Karthik at long-off rushes up to try and get under it. But he's also watching his captain Kohli racing back. And because of that he's distracted and it pops out
"loopy delivery outside off, Gayle looks for the slash through cover. Gets nothing"
rips right across the outside edge. Looks like Chris Gayle. Isn't quite batting like him
"flat outside off, left alone, wide called"
"low full toss outside off, spears it to deep cover"
"comes down the track, but Ashwin ties him up in knots with a ball on leg stump."
"almost does him in. This is brilliant bowling from Ashwin. He's not afraid by the man he's bowling too. Sees Gayle make a move down the track and fires in a flatter ball wide of him to try and stump him. A cut shot comes out, picks point"
heaves it to deep square leg
"just to make sure everyone knows he can hit along the ground as well, he sends this to the long-off boundary, and there is a fielder there. He might as well take the day off and sip a daiquiri at the beach"
"<b>appeal for a stumping</b>! But Lewis survives. He slogs at a length ball, misses it completely, but for a man swinging so hard, he does well to not lose balance. The back leg is back behind the crease and even Dhoni's lightning gloves can't do much"
goes back to a good length ball outside off and chops it to cover
"leading edge, goes straight up and comes down in Dhoni's hands. <b>That's Kuldeep's maiden wicket</b>. Pitches it at a shortish length on leg stump, and that line makes Gayle look to hit against the turn. Whilst he tries to do so though, the ball moves the wrong way, ie right past the middle. How dare it."
"nudges it, very very gently, to long leg. Who're you kidding, Lewis?"
stays back and blocks the googly in front of off stump.
"appeal for a caught behind from Dhoni, but the umpire isn't fooled. Wide called down the leg side"
works a shortish delivery from off stump to deep square leg
"nudges a shortish delivery to deep midwicket, seeks a second, but that blur is Jadeja, racing in from deep midwicket, so the experienced Samuels says, stay put, lad."
"he's off balance, I tell you. But who cares? He sees a loopy ball - an awful full toss outside off - and smears it into the sight screen. And while generating the power he needs, he nearly overbalances onto the stumps"
"slider, outside off, tries a cut, but misses"
"slower through the air, and Lewis, after thinking about a slog sweep, instead settles for a clip through to deep square leg."
clips a fuller delivery through midwicket
dabs a shortish delivery to the right of short third man
"legbreak, and to Samuels it might well have been a hieroglyph. Doesn't really pick it. Plays the shortish length as he tries to cut and is beaten by the turn"
"oh dear. Shami best go up to Lewis and ask what wrong he had done him because this is becoming very very last scene of a Tarantino movie. Short ball, smacks it over midiwcket"
"full and outside off, smashes it to long-off"
"full and sliding down leg. He's able to beat Lewis, but the umpire puts Shami in the dog house. Will make him bowl an extra ball"
belts a full delivery at extra cover
"that's the oasis in the desert - a dot v Lewis - and it's a well constructed one too. At 141 kph, a yorker, angled, and tailing into his pads. The batsman frantically tries to flick it, and is struck on the pad"
looks for the blockhole again and Lewis slices it to deep point.
"drills a full ball, outside off stump to long-on"
"out comes a googly, and Samuels seems to pick it as he drives through cover."
"<b>nearly bowled around the legs</b>. This big leg break on leg stump brings out the sweep, but Lewis misses it altogether and is lucky the ball bounces over his castle"
"pushes it through, and past Lewis' leg stump"
"comes down the track and works a slow, flighted delivery through midwicket"
"hangs deep in his crease and clips a shortish delivery, with the turn, to long leg"
"tries to hide the ball outside off, but goes a little too far"
"well done, Kuldeep. He's bowling slower through the air, and that's unsettling Lewis. Plays back to a reasonably full ball, cutting it. Beaten"
"well, at least for a little while it seemed as if Lewis wasn't feeling comfy cozy. So he goes to his happy place. The slog over leg. Positioning himself on one knee outside off. The ball sails over square leg. India might want it not returned"
"good length ball on off stump, defends, with mostly the inside edge"
backs away to the shortish delivery and cuts to point
steps forward to a full length ball and blocks to point
nudges it from off stump to long leg
"shifts across onto off stump, and the quicker ball, nearly does him in. Lewis goes for the pull, isn't fast enough to meet the ball. Weathers an lbw because it pitches outside leg"
"drifts it down leg, trying to hide the ball from Lewis, who is backing away as well"
"lovely, Jaddu. From over the wicket, as he has been bowling to Lewis this over, he spots the batsman making room and fires it outside off, past his reach"
"good bouncer. At 131 kph, climbing past the shoulder, and if Samuels has to pull, he has to drag it from outside off. As it happens, he doesn't want to take the risk"
"this is not his day. Goes for another short ball, but this is wide as well, and Samuels throws the bat at it. Outside edge wanders to the third man boundary"
"what. a. shot. Forget the man on course for a hundred at the other end, this is a contender for shot of the day. All he does is kick his front foot aside and effortlessly smear a length ball over extra cover. Flllllllat hit. That advertising hoarding, by right, must be crumpled up in agony."
cuts to deep point
"width outside off, and Lewis cracks it to deep point"
"fine leg dives over the ball, a desperate attempt from Karthik, trying to get to the ball which is too far to his right. Samuels' heave at a full delivery on middle and leg becomes a useful little inside edge"
"looks for that sweep over square leg again, but he misses out, and collects a wide for his trouble"
"zips it through outside off, Lewis tries to cut, and fails to connect"
"into the nineties! And with a shot so pristine too. Length ball on middle is pummeled down the ground, straight over the bowler's head. That's the kind of sixes bowlers hate"
"cuts, but finds point"
"thundering through to his hundred. He's only one short now! This is a length ball, a wide ball, and it's been smashed over long-off. Shown the door out like it's the weirdo at a rave that makes everyone feel awkward."
"<b>there it is</b>. And Lewis throws his helmet away and punches the air in triumph. UP in the dressing room, Chris Gayle and all the West Indians are on their feet. Imagine that. T20s greatest ever player giving you a standing ovation. Oh, and before I forget, the landmark comes up with a clip to fine leg"
"pushes a slower, length ball on off stump to cover"
cuts a shortish delivery through to the right of long-off
"that is all class. Sashays down the track, picking the googly, and launching it over cover. Smooth, Mr Samuels. Very smooth. We've got Mr T and Mr Bond batting together"
"<b>Dhoni misses a stumping</b>! He is blinded by the batsman racing down the pitch, put off by the ball clipping Samuels' pad and deflecting to his right."
"steps down, but has to deal with a high full toss. Plops it to long-on"
"waits for the ball to turn - and since this is short as well, he can hang back and wait. He can hang back, read a book, do his taxes, and then bring out the cut wide of long-off"
"another cut, this one to where most cuts go to, deep point"
oh he leaves a ball outside off. He's trolling the bowling!
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b>, as Jadeja spears in a full delivery from over the stumps. Seems to be adjacent too - because it pitches in front of off stump and straightens enough too. Hits low on the pad. Everything seems to be going for it, just that the umpire doesn't agree."
"don't you dare appeal against me! Or so he says with his 10th six of the day, this one over long-on. What a wicked innings"
"keep em comin! This is starting to feel like one of those six-hitting competitions at the park. Tossed up wide outside off, Lewis carves it over long-off much to the glee of the spectators there"
"sweeps to deep square leg - oh, and he's past the <b>highest score by a West Indies batsman in T20Is</b>"
drivers over the top of cover
"oh, he's just so good. If it's all brutality at the other end, this is like a robot, calculating the angles, and making only the minimum of effort to get boundaries. Little late cut, right between point and short third man, using the pace of the bowler against him"
"short ball, evades it"
cramps Samuels with a back of a length ball on leg stump
"heaves at a length ball, angled into him, misses it and it wanders between inside edge and thigh"
"wide yorker, perfectly executed. Samuels tries to scythe it through point but he cant"
"struck on the pads, but the ball is going down leg and the Indians don't even bother appealing"
midwicket apparently is feeling left out so Samuels takes care of its needs as he swings a length ball across the line
"single to deep square leg, another slog"
"there we go! West Indies have won and Lewis finishes it off as he started it - with a six - and the <b>highest score in a T20I chase</b>. Length ball on leg stump, slog swept to smithereeeeeens"
