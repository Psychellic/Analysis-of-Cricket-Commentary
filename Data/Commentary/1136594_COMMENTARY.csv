"there's six. The first of the night. 1000 IPL runs. It won't be the last six of the evening either. A full delivery outside off, Rahul just caresses an extra cover drive and it travels well over cover"
"drifts on the pads, worked away down to fine leg for a run. Cramping Rahul for room"
"<b>into the second tier</b>! 127 kph, it's a full delivery outside off. Rahul doesn't even extend his lofted drive, he just times a checked cover drive. The ball flies over the cover boundary"
"change in length this time, short around off, helped along down to fine leg for one"
"a wide yorker outside off, well bowled. Jammed out towards cover."
"a slower delivery around middle and leg, gets some cut on his offcutter. A thick outside edge down to short third man."
"another slower one, good comeback from Bumrah this over. Defended to point"

"another slower ball, on middle and off, clipped to deep square leg for a run."

"the wide yorker goes wrong. Full and wide, but outside the tramlines"

"the reverse sweep but he picks out short third man. Executes nicely, not quite placed well enough though"
"yikes! A googly on middle and leg, it's a filthy long-hop too. Rahul picks the length early, his eyes light up with six. He rocks back and mis-times a pull to deep midwicket. Picks out the fielder to perfection. Wow, those are six runs missed and he's out."

"just short of third man! Flat and wide outside off, slashed away towards the fielder, the ball lands in front and ricochets away off the body"
a googly outside off. Yuvi doesn't pick that and the ball beats the bat
"a legbreak on middle and leg, worked away with the spin to deep square leg for one"
"the error is that it's full. The line hardly matters in new-age T20s. It's full and wide, Gayle gets underneath the length and pummels a lofted drive over cover. Another very big hit."
"it's a wide googly, the length is much better and makes Gayle play a difficult shot. He plays it well though. Slices the ball over backward point for four"
"another wide googly, keeps very low. But outside the tramlines"
slog-sweeps the wide delivery to deep midwicket.

"strays down leg, cramping him for room. Worked to deep square leg"
"<b>dropped?</b> A tough chance! Short and wide, Yuvraj under-edges the ball towards the keeper. Kishan dives to his left, gets there, but the ball pops out. A chance he should have taken, I feel"

"a shortish delivery outside off, 127 kph. Gayle lets that one go"
"a humongous wicket for Mumbai! A 40-ball 50 from Gayle. He doesn't look too happy. That was excellent bowling from Mumbai, taking pace off the ball, bowling outside his preferred hitting areas. He's frustrated and therefore has a hoick at a length offcutter on middle. The ball takes the outside half of the bat and splices to deep midwicket."
"lots of hesitation. Full and wide, carved to backward point. Yuvraj and Nair move forward, then backward, then forwards. Then Yuvraj and Nair both go back. Lots of miscommunication"
"length ball on the pads, worked away to midwicket"

"that's much quicker and straighter, flicked to deep square leg"
"Yuvraj is gone? He's walking back! Nair played that quietly towards point and called Yuvraj through for a non-existent single. The fielder at point runs in, throws the ball back to the keeper and Yuvraj is welllll short of the crease. In backyard cricket, when you want the other person to get out, you call them for a run that isn't there and just say, sorry mate, next batsman. That's how bad that call for a single was"

"on the pads, worked away to deep square leg"
"chipped to Hardik Pandya at long-on! Kings XI stuttering here. Another good slower ball, on middle and leg, an offcutter. Axar Patel tries to hit the ball straight and does so well. But the pace off the ball was responsible for the ball being chipped instead of hit. Easy catch."

"a short slower ball outside off, hit away to long-off. Stoinis isn't happy with the execution."

"back of a length outside off, pushed to cover point"
"slapped in front of cover! Wide outside off, and Sky rides the bounce and muscles it towards the extra-cover boundary. Good start to the over"

"powered past cover for four more. A slower ball outside off, Krunal clears his front leg and clatters a powerful drive through cover"
"put away for four. A low full toss down leg, can't bowl full tosses at this time. Flicked away through backward square leg for four. Easily done."
"that's the game done! That was an awful delivery, on middle and leg. Krunal backs away and slogs the ball with ease over long-on. 20 runs off that over, and Mumbai should have no trouble from here."
"a slower delivery outside off, flat-batted away to long-on"
"four more. A slower delivery outside off, Krunal was well and truly beaten by that delivery, but he improvised so well. Waited and waited and then carved the ball in the air, but past point."
