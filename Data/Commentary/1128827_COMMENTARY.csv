nudges it off the top of middle stump through square leg
"<b>beats him</b>, with Watson playing inside the line a little bit and the indipper just about skips past the outside edge"

"back of a length on off stump, blocks it"

drills the short delivery to cover
good stop at midwicket as Sabbir dives to his right to stop a whip across the line from Shafiq

brings his bottom hand into play again as he drags a shortish delivery on off stump out to mid-on
"full on middle, comes off the inside edge as Watson flicks towards square leg"
"taken at midwicket! Sameen has a wicket two overs into his first game at the PSL. Shafiq slogs across the line, has no timing on the shot, it comes off the inside half of the bottom of the bat and even forces Sabbir to dive forward if he wants to get his hands under it. The third umpire does come into play the make sure the catch is clean. The angles are a bit iffy, but there is one close up of Sabbir's hands scooping the ball up before it hits the turf. Should be out. And is"
<b>beats him</b> with a 136 kph awayseamer that hits the deck and darts past Amin's block
"<b>dropped</b> at extra cover! Sammy's the man, diving to his left, but the cut shot is hit a little too hard for him to cling on. Pings off his left hand and onto the turf"

the spinners goes fast and full on leg stump. Watson flicks to deep square leg

belts it back down the ground and the 135 kph delivery disappears to the straight boundary. Another Watson special

misses out on the cut as the short and wide delivery escapes what originally looked like severe punishment
"low full toss on middle, Watson presents the full face, Gul a wry smile"
drops the 142 kph short ball into the leg side for a quick single
"pulls the short ball away towards the long leg boundary - and <b>both batsmen are at the same end - and neither one gets run out</b>! Watson sees that he won't get four for it and so turns around for a second run, and to be fair, it's a good call. But Umar doesn't care for it. The throw from Hafeez comes in, on the half-volley to Kamran Akmal, who fails to collect it and allows Watson the time to get to safety"

blocks the shortish delivery to point
"slower ball, which defeats Watson completely. He's into the big ole slog and the good length delivery hasn't even arrived."
"misfield at short fine leg, Tamim the culprit. An inside edge off a slog that sneaks between the batsman's feet"
"comes down the track, but he can't get under the tossed up ball on leg stump. Looks for the slog nevertheless and mistimes it behind square leg"
"in the slot and Watson has sent it into orbit! <b>The ball is lolling about on the roof</b>! Monstrous slog sweep. He sees the ball tossed up, plants that front leg down and goes mad"
"full toss, with room to free the arms, and Watson dispatches it over the straight boundary. Too easy"
long hop this time. The unholy trinity of bad bowling. Half-volley followed by a full toss followed by a short ball that is pulled over the straight boundary
"slower through the air, and tossed up wider too. Watson nails it through cover"
"dropped but this is such a difficult catch. Smith actually turns it into a chance, running quickly enough to his left, diving to get to the ball, he gets a good hand on it, but as the hand hits the ground, the ball pops out. Oooof. Bad luck there. (For Watson too. Not often do his slog sweeps end up inside a 65 m boundary)"
"full and outside off, smears it to the sweeper cover"
flays it down the ground to long-off
pummels it down to long-off
"taken at long-on! It's a length ball. It invites the slog. Amin just doesn't have the power to clear the boundary. In the end, it seems to bounce a bit more than the batsman would like, hitting higher on the bat and skewing up instead of long"
flicks a full ball on off stump to deep midwicket
"flatter in trajectory, which fools Watson into going back. But with the length full, and the ball skidding on, he ends up inside edging it"

"bang goes the off stump! Watson's plan to stay beside the ball and hammer it through the off side fails against a slider which is a bit fuller than he believes it to be. Credit to the bowler Usman for changing his trajectory, but not his length. Miiiiiight have stayed low too"
"full and outside off, pushes it back to the bowler"
"full and leg stump, clips it through square leg"

"<b>out of the ground!</B> New balls, please! Full on middle stump, and the batsman was quick to get his front foot out of the way. Manages to meet his half-tracker while running down the wicket, and hits it through the ball's line. Way beyond the long-on boundary. <b>A whole 97 metres!</b>"
"full on off stump, down on one knee and slogged towards cow corner. Well stopped by wide long on running to his left"
"full just outside off stump, shimmies down the wicket and tries to slog towards the leg side. Mistimed to deep midwicket instead. Off the bat's inside edge"
"good length and wide outside off, KP shows no footwork but chases after that delivery. Reaches at it, and tries to drive over cover... but comes off the bat's toe end. Done in by the slower ball, and the skier is taken by Asghar at point. Sharp catch, taken while diving forward"
"<b>softly played!</b> Back of a length outside off. Once again the cutter from Sammy, and the batsman taps this late. Hit fine enough to beat short third man"
"fuller ball wide outside off, checks his drive down the ground. Beats cover, and dribbles away into the deep"
"full outside off, crunches his drive towards cover point"

"full and wide outside off, forces the left-hander to reach at it. Mistimes his drive to cover as they scamper across for the run"
"good length just outside off, and <b>grips</b> off the surface. Straightens after pitching, and angles away from Sarfraz's bat. Just past his outside edge and through to the keeper"

"slower ball on off stump, quick to get down on one knee and it's been smacked over the square-leg umpire to deep midwicket. <b>Taken by the fielder in the deep</b> but there's no celebration. Oh dear, Sammy has realised what has happened. There were less than four fielders inside the circle, which is not allowed. Reckon Sarfraz noticed it before. <b>Free hit coming up</b>"

"good length on off stump, extra bounce off the surface and nudged off his pads towards the leg side"
"back of a length on off stump, punched down the ground to long on"
"full on off stump, mistimes hid drive towards midwicket. Sammy's chasing after it, but <b>he's fallen on the floor once again!</b> This does not look good any longer. It's that cramp/hamstring that's bothering him again. The physio is out and Sammy's been taken off. We need a new bowler for the last two deliveries"
"good length on middle stump, it's a half-tracker and punched to wide long on. Sharp throw from the deep and the non-striker's in trouble, but he's in just before Smith can take the bails off"
"yorker wide outside off, opens the bat's face and glances it to Tamim at short third man. Diving effort from the infielder ensures it's only a single"

"the yorker length outside off once again, pinged to deep cover point on the full"
"back of a length outside off, tries to pull but it's miscued. In the air, but falls just short of deep midwicket. Sarfraz was  tangled there"

"<b>Sabbir takes his third!</b> Full on middle stump and Nawaz tries to send this over long on. The bat turns in his hand, as it comes off the toe end. The fielder from Bangladesh is very safe at the long-on boundary"
"slower, low full toss on middle stump, tapped past the non-striker to long on. They walk across for the run"
"short on middle stump, goes down the leg side as Hastings misses the pull. The umpire thinks it's a legal ball though. Probably a good decision with the batsman shuffling across everywhere"

"straight up... who's taking it.. it's Chris Green, the substitute. The heave ho from Akmal, looking to smash Watson over his own head. And though he gets all the height he could possibly want, it doesn't even clear the square. Rahat chases it. Green calls for it. Both men are inches away from each other when the catch is complete"

"perfect riposte from the batsman, allowing the full delivery to reach his hitting arc and flicks it superbly through straight midwicket"

"full on off stump, drives back to the bowler"
nudges a full delivery through midwicket

"good length outside off stump, angling into Hafeez. Stays on the back foot and taps it with the bat's open face to point"

Whoa. <B>Peshawar Zalmi win by five wickets</b>"
