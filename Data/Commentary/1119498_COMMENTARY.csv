"the stock ball, flat around off, pushed away towards point"
"just clears long-off. Would have been gobbled up at the Gabba, but not here. The googly outside off, Finch picks the variation, tries to go over cover but gets it straighter. Bumrah at long-off just watches it go over him"
flat and wide outside off and boooom! Straight past Smith. Down the ground. Long-off has no chance. Sublime hitting. His muscle has got him 10 runs in two balls

"good length, around off, pushed back to the bowler. Using the variations nicely here is Pandya."

"flat on the pads, flicked down to fine leg again for one"

"short on off, Finch stays back and pummels a pull wide of long-on. Rahane gets across and stops the boundary"
"taken at deep midwicket. Finch's belligerence ends. It's full and Finch sees an opportunity to hit it over midwicket, but Finch can't get underneath the length, which means his heave goes straight and flat to Jadhav at deep midwicket, who takes it awkwardly. A white towel falls off, and Finch thinks it's the ball. But has to walk off. Fine innings from Finch, has put Australia in command"
"the googly down leg, worked away to midwicket"
"good length outside off, pushed to cover from the back foot"
"on the pads, flicked away to deep backward square leg for a comfortable brace"
"fullish delivery outside off, driven to the sweeper cover"

"easily taken at long-off. It's the googly outside off, Smith wanted to get closer to the ball and hit it straighter but the ball skews off the outside half and lobs to Bumrah at long-off. Looking into the sun is Bumrah, but he has his sunglasses on. Kuldeep has been a touch expensive, but has got two big wickets when they're trying to go after him."
"Maxwell gone now. Two in two for India. Australia losing their way. He shuffled right across, looking to go straight. He came running down but Chahal fires this wide outside off, so wide that Maxwell can't even get close to it. Misses it by a distance and Dhoni's hands are far too quick for Maxwell to consider going back. Chahal has him thrice in this series now, all while Maxwell has tried to take him down. Fantastic defensive bowling from India's spinners"

another short wide delivery that is too wide for legality
"what power from Stoinis. Bhuvneshwar goes straight this time, full around off, drilled past Bhuvi's feet. Long-off didn't have a long way to go but did not have a chance"

"a full slow delivery outside off, Handscomb stays in his crease, trying to go over long-on but no connection"

"a slower ball outside off, Stoinis can't get bat on ball. It's another cutter. Stoinis' strike rate now dips below 100"
"good length outside off, pushed to the sweeper cover. Stoinis thinks of two, but Rahane is quick on it. Great bowling, the lengths are so intentionally all over the place that the batsmen can't line 'em up"
"a wide slower delivery outside off, worked away to deep square leg. Just one more"
"fuller than good length around off, punched down to long-off. Another single more"
"sensational catching from Pandey. A slower delivery outside off is hit nicely to long-off, it looks like six for the entirety of its trajectory until Pandey gets around to his right, takes a reverse-cupped catch, realises he was stepping over the boundary and threw it back up in the air. Then, he nonchalantly got back in and took the catch, no fuss, no trouble."

Very full from Agar outside off, Kohli sees the length and wants to go over cover, but the bat comes down straight, as opposed to from slightly leg side, which means the ball skews off the inside half and lobs to Finch at long-off. That's a rare mistake from Kohli, won't be happy with the dead ball either"

"that should be the game now. A short cutter again, far too predictable, sits up for Pandey to whack through midwicket. Too easy."
"another short cutter on off and middle, think Mike and Bob Bryan's touch volley and think Pandey's touch forehand push to long-on. They aren't too much different. One to mid-on"
"what a shot. A short slow delivery on off, Pandey doesn't change the way the bat is moving, he just adjusts the bat to ensure the ball hits the bat, so that the ball doesn't go to third man. Instead, it goes right over the keeper. <b>That is the perfect ramp shot</b>"
