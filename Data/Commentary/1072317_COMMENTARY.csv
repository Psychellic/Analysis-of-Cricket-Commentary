"swing for Richardson, Roy chases it on the drive - <b>but plinked off the toe to extra cover!</b> Impetuous shot, nowhere near the line and Richardson bags the opening wicket, Roy trying to crash it on the up over the off side again but dollying up a simple catch. Looks like a slower delivery, in fact"

"flat, 88kph on off stump, punched through the covers coming forwards"

goes for the tramlines... but slides outside for an extra
"fullish, 129kph in the channel... <b>and Buttler plops it straight into the hands of mid-off!</b> Caught in two minds, I think, not a full-blooded drive, maybe duped by a cutter and he ended up chipping it to man on the ring"

"low full toss, on the pads, flipped to the leg side"

"back of a length, a gently turning legbreak"
"wrong'un, down the leg side"

whoops. A big legbreak but starts wide and goes wider
"misjudged from Maxwell, a weak front-foot biff over the covers, and <strong>almost misjudged by Roy at long-off as well!</strong> The umpires are checking, as Roy had to lean forward at the last minute to scoop it off the turf, and well, this looks short of his fingers, but the soft signal is out... this is a huge call. And it is <B>NOT OUT!</B> Such a tight call either way. Roy looks utterly nonplussed."

tucked into the leg side
thumped down to long-off

on the pads and worked square

"clears the front dog, slams the bat through the line, another slower ball is dispatched over the covers..."
"low full toss, crunched up and over the covers, just out of the reach of the back-pedalling fielder, and they come back for two ... He's probably blown his hundred now!"
"on the back foot, a tucked single to the leg side ...<strong> and Maxwell is on strike with the scores level!</strong>"
"banged in short, battered hard into the covers, but can't beat the field"
"swung mightily over the leg side, and<strong> it plops over the rope for the century!</strong> Stunning batting from the Big Show who, frankly, was the only show in town today."
