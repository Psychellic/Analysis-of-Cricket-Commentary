Instead of throwing the ball to Ashwin, he runs in and as it to taunt the batsman, gives the impression he'll eventually break the stumps, but wait, with him around three of four yards away from the stumps just throws the ball at the stumps. It hit this time, so it's all good, but I'm just imagining the comical scenes if he would've missed. I think that's exactly what Kohli's telling him too.

"is he really their most promising batsman? That's a terrible, terrible shot to play. What was the need? I don't know. Did they need 20 runs in two overs? No. The situation demanded he bat, bat and bat. Instead, he looks for an ugly slog and slices it to short third man. The turn does him in as he looks to slog across the line, the dip ensures the ball takes the edge. Catches like those won't be dropped most times. This is terrible batting from West Indies and as a coach, Stuart Law, even if he is going to resign after this series, has every right to ask for accountability. Very, very poor. Kuldeep trusted himself to deceive the batsman in flight, kept at it and has now been rewarded with two wickets."

Pant is alert, he picked the googly, didn't grab at the ball, rode the bounce and then effected a smart stumping. It nearly touched Pant's helmet as he was surprised by the bounce, but he did well. Could this end by tea? Very much a possibility. This I'm afraid isn't Test match batting."
