"solid start, right up to the blockhole, a bit of shape back into the right-hander, and dug out immediately"
"full once more, shaping away from the right hander, and Guptill completely loses his shape in a clobber through the line, clawed to mid-on"
"ghosting past the outside edge, a fraction back of a length, and beaten past the splice"
"crunched out to point, a tumbling stop limits the damage as Guptill gets off the mark with a solid connection"
"slams the pads on a full length, but sliding down as it is deflected square"
"back of a length, tucked off the pads to midwicket and that's another solid start"
"<strong>wheels</strong>! Sharp pace on a tight line, Guptill leans back for the cut but it's long gone!"
"<B>banjaxed into the stands!<B> That's the way to do it! Right in Guptill's arc, freeing his arms into a kambooming straight drive, miles over the rope at long-on!"
"Saqib responds well to that indignity, pulling his length back as Guptill tucks the single off the hips"
one hand comes off the bat as Munro flinches a leg-sided clip out to square leg
walks into the ball to nurdle a length delivery off the front foot to backward square. A good response after that second-ball battering
"<B>spoke too soon!</B> Munro's turn this time to monster a mow over the ropes! Down on one knee, and smoking a pull off an indeterminate length, played on line as much as length, climbing into the width with aplomb"
"back of a length, shaping back in, the relative lack of pace forcing Guptill to check his stroke to find his timing into the covers"
"slapped out to the square boundary again, same shot as the Saqib six, but dragged along the ground to the sweeper this time"
"short, held back, flicked off the legs to deep square leg"
"leg-sided full toss, and Curran gets away with that one, a scuffed attempt at a pull skims off the thighpad through to the keeper"
"gallops to the pitch, Scurran sees him coming and drags his length back, but the ball swings extravagantly from the hand"
"<B>nailed him!</B> Sucker ball from Curran, right up to the pads, taking advantage of Munro's premeditated movement to the pitch of the ball, and though he was a long way down, the yorker length left the umpire in little doubt as he wafted futilely across the line"
a toe-ended drive back down the pitch
"thumped with alacrity into the covers, a pleasing connection on the length ball, but the sweeper is well placed. Another fine over, though I suspect he won't get a third in a row in this spell.."
"leaning back for a thump into the covers, can't nail the stroke"
stabbed into the leg side as Jordan gets one to pop on a good length on off stump
"beaten outside off, a wild slash as Jordan nibbles one the other way, away from the bat"
another swish and a miss. Jordan mixing it up well outside off
"tighter line on off stump, tucked to the leg side and mid-off dives well to gather. Hitting the seam in this first over"
"flashed on the up, into the covers, a comfortable turn for the second run"
"shaping into the legs, a bit of a freebie to get his spell underway, a zippy outfield as Rashid is left chasing in vain at backward square"
"back of a length once more, shaping into the pads. Flicked hard off the pads, as Guptill shows he's not just a width-munching cover-drive bully"
"back of a length, forcing Guptill to shimmy onto the back foot to cut into the covers"
"<B>splattered into the stands!</B> Brown's varieties aren't having much luck so far today! Just back of a length, Seifert sizes up the length in an instant and crashes it over cow corner!"
"punched on the up, that's the breakthrough surely... <strong>no! A terrible drop from Vince in the covers! </strong>He had to hop to take it, but it was not travelling hard"
"tip and run, another single to keep the strike"
"cracked hard out to point, it was in the slot, but couldn't beat point"
"<strong>gloved, and dropped!</strong> Billings can't cling on at full stretch, above his head, as Jordan's slippery bouncer shapes down the leg side and snags a bit of padding on the way through a throaty pull"
thumped to the covers
"<B>dropped again, but what an effort!</B> It's Vince again, but this time he was haring round the boundary, 40 metres from cow corner to the sightscreen. Guptill climbed into a drive but got right underneath a slower ball... chancy!"
pumped into the off side
cracked out to midwicket
"banged in short, super connection on the pull, though it did sit up nicely for the shot. Deep backward comes round but can't intercept with a slightly tentative reverse-cup"
"thumped into the off side, straight at the man, from back of a length"
"<B>gone! Mahmood has his maiden England wicket!</B> A bit of a cutesy attempt at a dinky reverse-scoop, but there's less pace on the ball that Seifert had anticipated. Billings has oodles of time to shuffle round and gather a thin deflection down the leg side"
"puts bat through ball effectively enough, picks off the single to mid-on"
dabs another single into the covers
"banged in short, and ducked. A good comeback over"
"'Oooerr, that's lovely Rash!' is the cry from Billings. And it was. Beaten on a perfect length"
"googly, right up to the pads, and flinched to the leg side"
"hint of width, bashed out to deep point"
"swings through the line, outside off, picked up at point as CDG doesn't quite connect"
"<B>Guptill's connected with that one all right!</B> Just a touch too short, and he's onto it like a mantrap, snapping into a flat pull over the leg side"
"whisked off the pads, down the leg side, a splendidly milked first over from the leggie"
"whittled into the leg side, placing bat on ball to pick off the single to mid-on"
<B>right underneath a dismissive hoick over midwicket!</B> Pace off is not the way to go today!
"oh jeepers, he's going the journey today! Right in the slot, mowed through the line, <B>hard and flat over wide long-on!</B>"
"clipped in the air as Brown dips a fuller length into the toes, a bobble out to deep midwicket"
"well bowled, up to the blockhole, can't dig that one away"
"slower ball again, but a better one, just back of a length on this occasion, and nudged to the on side"
"a slog across the line, Guptill groans audibly as he realises he has top-edged a half-tracker. One hand comes off the bat as the ball spirals to Vince at deep square leg, and a fine innings comes to an indecent end"
"slides into a back-foot glide, on a full leg-stump length, punched to point"
"flashed off the legs, and <B>so close to short backward square!</B> A despairing dive, inside the circle and just out of reach!"
"<B>hoisted into the 20th row!</B> CDG drops to one knee, swivels through the line, and dumps a vast wipe of a slog-sweep out of the park!"
flogged to point
"crashed hard to short cover, that's travelling as Morgan tumbles well to intercept"
"<B>right up to the pads, and that's a stunning first-ball wicket!</B> Never mind pace off and all that malarky, just aim for the top of the timbers and that'll suffice in any format! A waft across the line, beaten for pace apart from anything else, a thin deflection off the top of the front pad, and back goes the off peg!"
pressed to the off side
"back of a length, flinched to the leg side"
"cracks the pads, deflects to the leg side"
"back of a length, tucked off the ribs to the on side"
drilled back down the pitch
"fizzes past a wild swing, Billings whips off the bails but the back foot is anchored"
"chopped into the covers, flowing through the line"
"back of a length, gentle turn, nudged to the on side to bring up the 100"
"<B>heave-ho! </B>Spring-loaded wrists, and pounded into the stands over wide long-on! Everything must go!"
"opens the stance, clobbers another wristy thump over point. Runs everywhere!"
"better finish, zipping through this time as Taylor can't line up the extra pace"
"back of a length, Mitchell lines up the pull  but gets an under-edge as the ball loops out to deep square leg on the bounce"
"rocks back and fillets the gap at third man, beautifully cocked wrists imparting supreme power and placement"
"pushed to cover, another single to the cause"
"extra pace on this one, shorter ball, wider line, a clap of approval from Billings"
"flipped off the toes, out to deep midwicket"
flicked to the leg side
"swing and a miss, good shape from Curran, away from the right-hander on a back of a length. Close to a wide, but fair enough"
"chopped hard, hitting at the top of the bounce outside off, but the sweeper is set back on the point boundary"
"low full toss, shaping across the right-hander, clipped to wide long-on"
"in the channel outside off, back of a length again, it's a counterintuitive line of attack, wide long-hops essentially... but it's effective to this field!"
"<B>... and there's the sucker blow! </B>A rare fuller length ball, Mitchell climbs greedily into a mow through the line, but can't get his timing right... it's a breezy day, but no mistake in the deep from Jordan at long-on!"
tucked off the legs to mid-on
"tossed up into the toes, can't get the clip away"
"dipping outside off, drilled into the covers, instantly looking for two"
"well bowled, floated into the left-hander's pads, and he can't get it away"
"a leg-sided lollipop, looked for a moment as though he'd muffed his clip off the pads, but short fine leg slipped in pursuit"
"fenced to the leg side, Rashid probing on a full length"
"<B>smashed flat to deep midwicket ... and dropped! </B> It's James Vince once more! That was an arcing swing of the bat, think of that six off Archer in the Super Over... but flatter this time, and straight at the man on the rope, who let the ball thump his chest and ricochet away!"
"punched into the covers, a direct hit at the non-striker's end but safely home"
"on the toes, nurdled to the leg side, good areas once more from the probing Curran"
"<strong>flogged on the up, and over the leg side! </strong>That was a sweet connection, but the ball was in the slot, tailing into the legs and helped on its way!"
stabbed through to the keeper as Curran spears in the yorker. Well bowled
"nudged off the toes, closing the face on impact to counter the shape that Curran is still getting on the ball"
"banged in short, Neesham ducks... close to a wide, but instead it's the end of a very important spell. He's probably made the difference between 170-plus and 200"
"very full length, outside off, clawed into the leg side with an arcing swing"
"<B>that's a freebie in any format!</B> A leg-stump half-volley, and Neesham needs no invitation to launch those off the toes! High over backward square!"
"outside off, punched to point"
"lots of width, a full length, had to stretch to reach that on a square drive. Vince does well (for a change) to slide round and intercept at deep point"
"wide yorker, protection on the off side, cracked to the sweeper"
"battered hard into the covers, they run on the shot  but it's a clean pick-up at the edge of the rope as Morgan gathered and shied... and <strong>that would have been out with a direct hit!</strong>"
"very full, that's a fine delivery, tailing in on middle and off, and punched with lots of bottom hand to cover"
"full and slow, Neesham inverts his stance with third man inside the circle, but he can't connect with his attempted flick over the shoulder"
"battered hard to the man set back on the rope, it arrives quickly and it's just a single"
"<strong>huge appeal and gone!</strong> A low full toss, tailing into the stumps, a wild hack from Taylor, who had walked across his stumps to open up his options, but ended up giving the umpire a very easy decision"
"back of a length, well bowled again, Santner fences to the leg side, but that's a rolled-fingered cutter and the ball grips in the surface"
"swiped high,<B> a rash, desperate hack across the line</B>, as Santner aims a shot to nothing... and top-edges his slog to Brown at long-on!"
"wide line, outside off, a slapped drive, not connected"
"back of a length, arrow straight, Southee leans back to carve a pull to the leg side, but can't beat the man at mid-on, jogging round"
"<strong>an inside-out wallop over extra cover!</strong> Dismissive power! Climbing into the length outside off, and dispatching it with glee!"
"outside off again, a slap to the leg side, was aiming straighter than that, but they scamper two to mid-on and nearly a third as a wild shy goes awry"
"flicked off the legs, up and over the man at short backward square. High on the bat, but a decent percentage option"
"full and wide once more, a biff back down the track, just enough bat on ball to rush the single to mid-off"
"wide yorker, perfect start, no connection on that one"
"another yorker, leg-sided this time, but flicks the pad to prevent the wide. Billings tumbles to intercept. He's bowled 2 for 2 in eight balls!"
"<B>a top-edged pull out to deep midwicket, and Dawid Malan has dropped a goober!</B> He was on the player mic a few overs ago, being asked if he'd ever dropped one live on air before... wonder if they'll cross to him now..."
"slashed to deep point, just short of the man! It's all happening"
"<B>spanked into the stands!</B> Jordan's lost his mojo after that drop, this one just sits up to be pumped over cow corner!"
"cut to backward point, and what's all this about? England barely react, they believe it's a simple catch ... and <strong>they are reviewing!</strong> It was an open face on impact, clipped the corner of the bat after pitching, and that's clearly out. Jordan wraps things up with his third wicket of the innings"
"oh my, he's spooned one <b>straight up to wide mid-on!</b> Whadda start for New Zealand! Southee starts with a fairly gentle outswinger that pitches on off stump moving away. Bairstow looks to whip it through the leg side, but doesn't get much of it at all and Daryl Mitchell couldn't hope for an easier catch."
"ooh edged! A little bit of nibble away from Southee, Vince prods at it apologetically with his bat away from his body, but his hands are soft enough that it doesn't quite carry to Taylor at wide slip and they squeeze through for one"
"outswinger slid across the left-hander from over the wicket, Malan has a flash and doesn't get anything on it"
"a touch straighter on a length, and Malan punches it out to the sweeper at cover for one off the back foot"
"no swing this time, tight to the stumps and holds its line. Vince looks to shovel into the leg side and is struck on the pad, but that's sliding way down"
"wider on the crease this time, another outswinger, Vince shuffles down and tries to give it the old inside-out treatment over extra cover but ends up swiping at thin air! <b>Great start from Southee!</b>"
"length ball on leg stump, tucked off the hip towards the gap at midwicket for an easy single"
"<b>and another!</b> There's a man out at deep point, Ferguson bowls a length ball outside off and Vince throws the kitchen sink at it, but hits it straight into the hands of Santner on the fence!"
"ooft, nearly! The man at slip moves wider to gully, Ferguson goes back-of-a-length on off stump, Morgan slashes at it and it flies <i>juuuuust</i> past the outstretched hand of the diving Taylor and away for four"
"beaten! Ferguson is on fire here! 145kph/90mph, length ball on off stump or just outside, Morgan has a nibble at it and gets nothing on it as it swerves through to Seifert"
"good wheels again, 146kph/91mph, length ball on leg stump and Morgan is cramped for room, just prodding this back to Ferguson"
"angled across Morgan again, length ball which he drops deep to and cuts. It flies to point on the bounce, and the man there fields well"
"good length from Southee, on off stump or thereabouts, tucked off the hip into the leg side"
"oh my, <b>that's an outrageous shot!</b> Another length ball, Morgan skips down the wicket and thumps this nonchalantly over extra cover for six, lifting the back leg elegantly as he goes"
"good recovery from Southee, slightly tighter line and Morgan is cramped for room looking to whack this away through the covers"
"yorker just outside leg stump, Morgan shuffles right over to the off side and can't get any bat on it, Southee belts out an appeal but this is pitching outside, like Cummins to Leach at the end of the Headingley Test. They scramble through for a leg bye"
"length ball, outside off, and thumped out to deep point for a single"
"yorker length on the pads, no great pace but Southee has been in control and Morgan can't get this away into the leg side... it squirts out towards cover point and they scramble through"
"length ball on fifth stump, Morgan slashes it away and pierces the infield... he hasn't timed it, but there's enough on it for them to come back for a couple"
"<b>nearly!</b> Good wheels again from Ferguson, length just outside off, Morgan thumps this through his favoured area at point and gets it away past the diving man there for four!"
"too short this time, the same wristy cut shot we've seen so often and this looks like it has just about carried for <b>six more over point!</b>"
"yorker at 147kph/91mph, drilled out straight to mid-off, Morgan belts out a loud 'NO!'"
"this isn't the line to Morgan, too wide outside the off stump, and easy length and Morgan drops deep and thumps this away through cover point for four more!"
"yorker on off stump, just about dug out towards where short leg would be. They think about scuttling through for one but decide against, and that ends another eventful over"
"fullish on off stump from round the wicket, bunted to mid-on"
"length ball, swept awkwardly out to midwicket but they jog through for one"
"freebie, Santner dishes up a shin-high full toss on leg stump which Morgan <b>dispatches</b> dismissively over square leg!"
"good recovery from Santner, Morgan can only knock it back to him"
"has another swipe at this, but <b>he's gone this time!</b> Fullish ball just outside off stump, sliding across him from over the wicket. He looks to slug this over long-on but doesn't get all of it, and miscues it <b>straight down Colin the Bigman's throat at long-on!</b>"
"length ball on the pads, flicked out to square leg for a single to keep the strike"
"tight to the stumps, length ball that would have hit the top of off stump. Malan pulls hard, and they take one to the sweeper at midwicket"
"length ball outside the off stump, Billings runs it away to short third man and they get through for one"
"length ball that Malan looks to hammer over extra cover, flashes hard and gets a <b>thick edge</b> which races away down to third man for four!"
"straight, length ball, flicked off the pads for one out to square leg. Malan yet to get going"
"Test match length in the off stump channel, Billings plays a cute little square drive but can only find the man at point"
"strays too straight, sliding down the leg side. Billings looks to run it away through square leg but only manages to chip it unconvincingly out to the sweeper for one"
"tossed up on off stump to start, Billings slams this out to the sweeper at extra cover for one"
"slow, flighted ball outside leg, Malan looks to work it into the leg side but can't beat fine leg"
"yorker length, full and straight, and pushed down the ground to long-off"
"floats this one wider as Billings shimmies down the track, and he can only push it for one to sweeper-cover"
"slider out the front of the hand, Malan chops to the man at point on the bounce"
"big legbreak this time, but too wide outside off and Billings leaves it alone"
"very wide again, Billings reaches for it this time, hockey-style, but finds the man in the ring"
"length ball released with a grunt, Malan plays a checked drive which finds the man in the ring at cover"
"floaty yorker outside the off stump, Malan shuffles across towards the off side and times this <b>exquisitely</b>, so well that it races away past the man sweeping at cover and to the fence!"
"fullish on leg stump, and tucked out to midwicket for one"
"fullish on fourth stump, and Billings flicks this wristily out to long-on"
"fullish outside off, pretty gentle at 128kph/79mph and clonked out to long-off for an easy one"
"slower ball this time, and just nurdled out to deep midwicket for another single"
"legbreak, tossed up outside off. Billings skips down and strokes this inside-out towards the man at deep extra cover, but he gets around well and cuts it off to save two runs"
"tossed up, a touch fuller, Billings looks for another heave-ho towards long-off but doesn't time this one... and <b>CdG snaffles it</b>!"
"legbreak, length ball flicked square off the hip and they race through for one"
"drag-down to start, Curran adjusts and slugs it away to Ferguson on the fence at deep square... he makes a meal of it, but they can't get back"
"fullish this time, Malan brings out the reverse but can't beat the man at point in the ring"
"full and straight, Malan works it with soft hands out towards deep midwicket looking for two, but they won't take on Guptill's arm"
"he goes after this one, and <i>nearly</i> holes out. Gets low to slog sweep, and it finds the man at deep square but only after bouncing just in front of him"
"throws the kitchen sink at this one, a length ball outside off, but it only skews up into nomansland and they get through for one"
"<b>BANG! That is absolutely huge!</b> Yikes, this one has pretty much cleared the stadium! Bit of a nothing ball, on a length on leg stump and Malan has shuffled across and absolutely <b>moosed</b> this onto the roof! Amazing sound off the bat - absolutely perfect connection and that's outta here"
"full and wide of off stump, Malan drives it out towards sweeper-cover on the half-volley but they can only get one"
"back of a length outside off, Curran looks to slug this through the leg side and ends up playing a tennis-style forehand past mid-off who half-stops. They'll get back for a couple"
"short, wide, and Curran slashes hard enough at it for it to race away to the fence. That's a big over for England, taking a bit of scoring pressure off"
"slides this into the pads from round the wicket, and it's tucked into the leg side for one"
whipped out to midwicket for a single
"in the slot, and <b>Malan's creamed this for six over midwicket again!</b> Drops his pace right down and Malan nails this for another maximum"
tucks one out to the sweeper legside again
"very wide on the crease, slides it across Curran outside his off stump. He slogs this, trying to wang it over long-on but only manages <b>to find that man CdG on the fence</b> who takes another good catch. England five down and in a bit of bother again..."
"tossed up, fullish outside off stump, and he drives this along the ground to short extra cover"
clonked out to long-off
slog-sweeps out to deep square
"slider out the front of the hand from over the wicket, fairly wide outside off, Malan looks to thrash it over long-off... but <b>can only find Guptill who takes a sharp catch diving forwards!</b> New Zealand's spinners are putting the brakes on"
"length ball, looks to whack it through midwicket but gets a bottom edge and Sodhi mops up off his own bowling"
"big legbreak, length ball outside off, and mistimed out into the covers for one"
"beaten! A googly which bounces up sharply from outside off, Jordan has a waft at it and is beaten comprehensively. <b>Great over from Sodhi!</b>"
hits the man sweeping at cover hard for one
"slides on with the arm from round the wicket, and blocked back to the bowler"
"beaten again! Bit of bounce again, Jordan looks to play it out to cover off the back foot but can't get anything on it"
"drops his speed right down, making Jordan manufacture the pace, but he only hit it to the man in the ring at cover point"
"beaten again! Quicker and on with the arm, and doesn't get bat on it"
"drops deep in his crease and can't pierce the infield, though they steal through for one"
"just about gets this one away, but it's only singles when England need a lot more"
"skips down the wicket and drags this hard towards long-on, where Guptill fields well on the bounce"
"sharp-turning legbreak, but a touch shorter and Jordan has time to rock back and belt this away through extra cover off the back foot"
"<b>blimey, that's huge!</b> Jordan clears the front leg and belts this up over Guptill at long-on for a massive six! The groundsman takes a good catch just before the stands..."
and another! <b>Jordan hammers another one over midwicket!</b>
"<b>BANG, BANG, BANG!</B> Too short again, drops deep in the crease and carves this high and mighty over midwicket for another hammer blow! England's hopes were hanging by a thread but Jordan is single-handedly keeping them in this one"
"length outside off, and pushed out to long-off for one"
"fullish and straight, and Jordan can only nudge it back to the bowler"
"yorker on off stump, 146kph/91mph and Jordan can only dig it out of the blockhole"
"fullish, just outside off, Jordan throws everything at it but doesn't time it, and mid-off will cut it off running back as it skews away"
"slower ball on off stump, and <b>he's whacked this one away over mid-off for another four!</b>"
"length on the pads, tucked into the leg side and they scuttle through for one"
"length outside off, drops deep in his crease and absolute creams this over extra cover in the ring for a one-bounce four! <b>Jordan is keeping them in the hunt!</B>"
"tossed up, yorker length outside off and Jordan squeezes this out to cover point"
"length outside off, checked drive and short extra cover mops up well"
"full, quick and straight, and Gregory can't get it away, only managing to block it back to the bowler"
"threads a cover drive away through the ring, but the sweeper mops it up well"
"tossed up on off stump, Jordan looks to go again but hasn't got enough on it... and <b>Guptill takes an easy catch!</b> Not this time for CJ, who has single-handedly kept England in the game, as the fielder snaffles this running round at long-on."
"length ball which Gregory drops deep to, looking to whack it away through extra, but only finds the fielder in the ring"
"length ball, Rashid backs away and spoons it out to deep point with those famous wrists on full show"
"legcutter, Gregory shimmies down and looks to moose this over long-on but ends up swatting at thin air"
"length ball, Gregory slugs it out leg side but the man at deep square cuts it off and the throw is fired in"
"slightly full of a length outside off and <b>that is the Lewis Gregory that Somerset fans know and love!</b> Knuckleball I think, just about picked it and moosed down the ground over long-on"
"looks to go again, runs his fingers down it again, Gregory doesn't read it this time and <b>slices this straight up to mid-off in the circle</b> where de Grandhomme takes his fourth catch of the afternoon!"
"fast, length ball outside off, Mahmood fishes at it and is beaten for pace"
"flashes hard, and <b>it races away past the outstretched Seifert!</b> Mahmood's first runs in international cricket, or in T20 cricket for that matter... they all count!"
"oops, <b>not this time</b>! Length outside off, Mahmood looks to work it through the leg side but is late on it again, gets a leading edge, and it spoons up to cover where Southee takes a simple catch"
"Brown has no idea what to do with this, and is playing three shots at once... ends up inside-edging into his pad and it squirts out to point"
"low full toss on off stump, Brown pushes it to mid-off and sprints through for his first run as an England player"
"back of a length ball outside the off stump, Rashid fends at it but can't connect and it flies through to Seifert"
"length ball, which Brown works into the leg side just behind square"
"squeezed out to the man on the fence at square leg, and they only manage one"
"wide outside off, length ball. Brown has a flash at it but only manages to connect with the fresh air in the channel"
"length outside off again, chopped away out to cover and they scramble through for one. Would have been in all sorts of trouble with a direct hit and the non-striker's end!"
"slashes hard at a low full toss outside off, looks to be racing away for four but Ferguson, who is one of several excellent fielders in this NZ side, does well to cut it off"
"yorker in the channel outside the off stump, and Rashid can't get anything on it"
"genuine outswinger, slightly full of a length, and Brown throws the bat at it but can't connect"

"yorker, which is drilled to long-on but it's only one"
"bowled 'im! The first not-caught dismissal of the innings, Rashid has a big old swing at it and looks back to see his off stump flying"
