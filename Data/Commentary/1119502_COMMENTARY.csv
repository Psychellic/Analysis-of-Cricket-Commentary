"and a four straight away, Barsapara finds its voice. Extremely wide and a full toss, Rohit reaches out and pats it away through backward point"
"full, a little bit of nip into the right-hander just outside off, Rohit quietly defends with a straight bat"
shot. That has been put away with ease. Too full and well wide of him. Rohit swoops the bat down at some pace and drives straight down the ground. The bat turned in his hands slightly so he didn't middle it but gets four anyway
"just like that, Barsapara has gone quiet. Not for long, though, as out comes the ever-popular Indian captain. Rohit pays for a lack of feet movement. Comes half-forward to this length ball that pitches around middle and off and beats him bu nipping in ever-so-slightly. Pings him plumb in front"
"fullish length, a very tight line on middle and leg, Kohli respectfully defends back"
"<b>in the air and Behrendorff has run forward to catch it</b>. He is claiming the catch, or is that an appeal for lbw? Seems like caught it is. Otherwise, height may have been a factor in the lbw. Back of a length, pushed across but zero room. Pitches around middle and comes into Kohli who tries to flick across the line. Gets a feather of an inside edge on to the high part of the bat. The ball lobs in the air and Behrendorff sprints forward to claim the catch. Excellent comeback after a first-ball four"
"slashes hard at this short and wide delivery and does not find the middle of the bat, on the bounce to deep backward point"
"lots of movement away outside off. Slightly back of a length, the movement is prodigious enough for Pandey to suss it out and keep his bat inside"
"short of a length, a bit of nip away again, Pandey gets on top of the bounce and drops it in front of point"
"shortish, comes into the batsman this time. Pandey backs away and punches it away through the point region for a brace"
"full, jags away late outside off, Pandey carves out a drive straight to covers"
"short of a length, comes into the pads of Pandey who tucks it around the corner for a single"
"short, pushed across, opens the face of his bat very late and jams it down to third man. Past the wide first slip who dives to his right"
"oh, lovely delivery! Jason Behrendorff, you beauty! What a spell he's having! Short of good length, gets it to move away just enough and later still to find the outside edge of Pandey who is culpable of sticking his bat away from the body. Clear noise as he sent a nick through to Paine who holds on to a straightforward offering"
"back of a length and pacy outside off, pushed across the off-stump of Jadhav who shoulders arms"
"short of good length, sees enough width and lifts his bat but the ball straightens late. Well away from the off-stump, though"
"length ball on off, defends solidly into the pitch"
"short of good length, pitches outside leg and comes on just outside off, Jadhav gets on top of the bounce and blocks solidly"
"short of a length, dabs down to third man with an open bat face"
"<b>just over point</b>. Maxwell is the fielder there, throws himself to his right and leaps a good couple of meters across. Short and wide, flayed hard"
"short ball, gets big on him and goes for a pull. The ball lobs over the cordon. Seemed like a top-edge initially but turns out it has gone off the helmet. Aaron Finch runs back and makes a brilliant effort to slide forward and pull the ball back"
"full, outside off, jabbed hard to mid-off"
"is that the shot of the night? Me thinks so. Just short of a length, comes in slightly and he stays firmly on the backfoot before pulling with impeccable timing and power - a short-arm jab over midwicket"
"short, wide, chops an attempted cut into the ground"
"fuller, comes in from outside off and finds the inside part of the bat as Dhawan looks to drill it. Goes away to mid-on"
"short of a length, curving in towards off, takes a step away and works it to point"
"<b>that's a stunning catch from David Warner</b>. Take a bow, skipper! He had to pedal back, and by no short distance, mind you. Falls over as he snaffles it having judged to perfection. Dhawan simply presented the full face of his bat to this fuller ball. He chips it over the in-field but it needed impeccable timing for the ball to carry all the way over the boundary. That's not to so, but this was always a 50-percent chance converted into a definite wicket by Warner's brilliance"
"short ball, pushed across, bottom-edges a pull to midwicket"
"short, wide, Jadhav lashes a cut over the point region. One-bounce over the ropes"
"short of a length, pushed across invitingly with width to make the batsman go after it. Jadhav tries to runs it down and gets beaten"
"classic Dhoni! Walks forward for a gentle flick into the leg side. It's shorter than he would have liked, inside-edges it into the leg side"
"short, goes hard at a pull but the ball doesn't get up as much and he inside-edges it hard on to the boot"
"too much width. Slightly short of a length, cuts late and ferociously hard to beat point"
flicked to square leg
"full, lets it come into him and flicks slightly uppishly but the ball lands safely before the short fine leg fielder"
"short of a length, tucked through the square leg region for an easy single"
"short of a length, outside off, pushed across. Dhoni walks across and flicks it out to deep square leg"
walks across again to this back of a length ball but is forced to make a late adjustment and defend with a straight bat because of the line
"length ball, flicked just backward of square leg and Dhoni sprints back for the second. That's terrific running"
"<b>was that a catch</b>. Doesn't seem like it judging by Australia's reaction. Full, wide, Dhoni jams the bat down and the ball has bumped into the ground before going to the right of the keeper who does well to get down and prevent a boundary"
"full, wide, pushed to point"
"<b>now how about that? Did that carry?</b> Extremely full on the stumps, Jadhav knocked it back to the bowler. Behrendorff dives forward but can't hold on. We will have to wait for replays to confirm if it was a chance. But an excellent spell nonetheless. He's through with his quota"
"fullish length, spinning away, comes forward and pushes it out"
advances down to this slider and pushes it wide of long-on
"looped up and sliding on leg, clipped away to deep fine leg. The fielder in the deep is squarer and they complete a brace"
"length, spinning away on off, punched to the bowler"
"full on middle and leg, flicked to midwicket"
"fuller, driven to mid-off"
is that four? Yes. Glanced fine enough to easily beat deep backward square leg to his right.Full and straying down the leg side
pulls across the line. Lots of power but he finds deep midwicket. Fetches the shot from way outside off
"short of a length, looks for a punch through the off side. He shuffled across before the delivery so he is tucked up and gets beaten very narrowly"
"full on middle and leg, turned away to deep square leg for one"
"full, finds the inside part of the bat as he presses forward to defend"
"full, flicked to deep square leg"
"length ball, spinning away on middle and off, whipped to the leg side"
"advances down and Zampa shortens the length, Dhoni punches to mid-off"
"brings those powerful wrists into play. That shot was all wrist-work. Full toss, whipped hard wide of deep midwicket"
charges down the track at the sight of width but the ball dips and Dhoni yorks himself as he squeezes out to cover
advances down and Zampa fires it wide of the batsman. Dhoni is equal to the task and manages to halt in his tracks and keep the backfoot planted. Had to really stretch there
"no cheeky work this time from Dhoni. He has been stumped clean and Zampa lets out a roar. Length ball, Dhoni advances again. It spins sharpy away from him and there is little the batsman can do from that position. Gets nowhere close to the ball and Paine completes a simple stumping"
"pitched up outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
"short of a length, comes in on middle and leg, kept out"
"back of a length on leg stump, nudged away from off the hips into the leg side"
"short of a length, uses the angle to whip it away to long leg"
"short of a length, on middle and leg, defended"
"full toss, clipped off the pads between midwicket and square leg. Tye runs to his left and gets down to make a good save"
looks for a flick and wears it on the pad. Stoinis makes a very late appeal but that was comfortably headed down leg
"googly, and the stumps are a mess! Jadhav clears his front leg, seeing a loopy delivery in line with off stump. He shapes to launch it straight over Zampa's head, but the ball dips on him, it breaks the wrong way, and topples the stumps. Australia on the rise. On a massive rise."
"loops it up again to the new batsman, Bhuvneshwar reads it as the googly and defends well"
"backs away to a shortish delivery, but it comes so slowly off the pitch, that Bhuvneshwar has to check his cut shot"
"carves a quicker, flatter delivery outside off to backward point"
"finds the gap to the right of backward point, hitting off the backfoot with a straight bat"
"opens the face against a faster, flatter delivery on off stump and retains strike with a single to short third man"
"cramps the batsman wit ha rapid delivery, coming up towards his gut. Pandya is struck on the top glove, and it's good on him to keep the ball down after being in such an awkward position"
"shortish and outside off, slides it down to third man"
"full on off stump, Bhuvi keeps it out"
"lifts it... straight to deep third man! Spots the short ball, but with it also being a slower ball, he doesn't really have the pace for the upper cut. Moises Henriques runs in from the boundary and takes a simple catch. India continue to unravel. Australia continue to keep the pressure on. This has been a splendid bowling performance"
"yorker outside off, dug out"
"full, flicked from off the pads behind square"
"slight turn on this length ball, tucked behind square"
"extremely full on the stumps, hammered down to long-on"
sweeps a delivery that's not really at a sweepable length and gets a bit of a top-edge that lands safely
"short, little bit of spin outside off, cuts and drags it down to long-off"
"length, on the pads, tucked to fine leg and they hare back for the second. Paine takes the bails off and they go upstairs to check. He's in my a mile"
"width outside off, a little shortish, cut to point"
"full, eased down to long-on"
"length, pushed across, defended"
"full, slows it down outside off, Kuldeep brings his bat forward and gets beaten"
"back of a length, rides the bounce and tucks it behind square on the leg side"
"full toss, driven down to long-off for one"
"oh, dear! That must have surely slipped out. Back-of-the-hand slower ball that comes on furiously at the helmet. Tye gets a warning, much to the displeasure of Warner and the bowler"
"follows it up with another full toss, this one's deemed fine on the height by the umpire. Kuldeep swings wildly across the line and gets a bottom edge that gets past the keeper diving to his left"
"short of a length, bunts it to point and pulls the bat back before jogging the single"
"short of a length, opens the face and runs down to third man"
"back of a length, coming in on middle and leg, defended"
"short of a length, tries to get on top of the bounce and gets an inside edge"
"short of a length, pulled to deep square leg"
"short ball, swivels around with a hard pull that lands in front of deep midwicket"
Pandya has finally woken up. That's one powerful pull the crowd has been dying to see. Too short and dispatched well over deep midwicket
"short of a length, opens the face and runs it down to backward point"
"short ball, pace off and Pandya can't time his shot too well. What he does do well, though, is pick the gap and that allows him to come back for two"
"short of a length, opens the face and steers to short third man"
"full, gets the pad forward and flicks it to deep fine leg to <b>bring up the 100 for India</b>"
"another full toss, waist-high, or is it? The umpires deem it fine. Does well to negotiate with the height and pat it into the on side"
"fetches a pull from way outside off, it's the slower ball, and it ends up being nothing more than a heave over midwicket"
"slower back of a length ball, Kuldeep susses out the pace and runs it down to third man late"
straight into the hands of long-off. Pandya seemed like he could haul India to a decent total but he's gone now with 15 deliveries remaining. Tries to launch this fuller ball but it's just too full and that doesn't allow him the chance to get under it
"another slower short ball, the bounce is too high and the square leg umpire calls it wide as the batsman misses a weak attempt at a hook"
"short of good length ball, knocked back to the bowler"
"ain't got no clue about that one. Short of a length, zero width as it comes on straight and Bumrah backs away slightly and clumsily attempts a steer to third man only to make no contact"
"now that's much better. Stays in the crease, waits for it and opens the face, just that he finds wide slip"
"short of a length, sprays it down the leg side and called a wide as the batsman misses the glance"
"short ball, drops the wrists and the bounce is deemed too high by the umpire. Right call, that went way over the batsman's head"
"length ball on the stumps, bunts it out into the on side and beats Coulter-Nile rushing forward for the single"
"full, wide, reaches out and goes for a big, booming drive to get beaten"
<b>just past the keeper</b>. Bumrah loses shape as he swings across the line looking for a heave over the leg side. Gets a leading edge that gets past Tim Paine flying to his right
"yorker on leg stump, dug out into the on side"
"short of a length, opens the face and runs it down to third man"
Bumrah survives a near run-out. Chips a fuller ball that remains in the air and drops short of mid-off charging forward. Bumrah is taking the single and Coulter-Nile is on the way of the batsman. Bumrah collides and the throw misses the stumps at the non-striker's end even as he recovers and scampers for the crease. Bumrah unhappy but that was not deliberate from the bowler. Coulter-Nile had his back to Bumrah. Coulter-Nile was actually moving across slightly to back up the throw
opens the face but can't connect as he tries to steer to third man
swings across the line and gets an inside edge to the pad.They take a quick single
advances down and the bowler drags the length back. Kuldeep wears it on the thigh and the ball goes to the left of Paine who runs across and throws with his keeping gloves on. Direct hit catches Bumrah short
"short, looks to pull and loses shape as the ball is slow and he swings early"
<b>just over the outstretched hands of point</b>. Clears the leg and lofts this over the fielder. He gets a fingertip to it. Head at the deep picks it up and throws to Paine.But the batsmen are going for a third and Paine fires at the non-striker's end. Chahal nearly collides with the bowler as he dives to make the crease. The throw does not hit the stumps
goes for a big slog and gets a top-edge that goes very high and Paine behind the stumps moves to his right and settles under it
"good length ball, darting down the leg side. Finch aims a flick, but can't connect. Would've been a great ball to Warner, who is at the other end, and who has been struggling against Bhuvi this tour"
"darts into the right-hander, and Finch, who doesn't really move his feet, is struck on the thigh as he tries to find a single behind square leg"
"goes wide of the crease to bowl the outswinger, but Finch is able to time is well enough, through cover point. Pandey chases it down, relays it to Kohli, who sends the throw in to Dhoni, who collects it to the right of the stumps, and flicks it between his legs onto the target. Warner is safe though"
"pushes it to the left of backward point, but Pandey dives across to stop it. Excellent work."
"back of a length, punches it to Kohli at cover"
"cramps him on middle and leg, Warner defends well"
"over the square leg fielder running back! Warner tries a short-arm pull, but his timing is all off. The ball goes off the top edge and eludes Chahal"
"too short and Finch simply helps it on its way to the backward square leg boundary. Fine shot, swivelling on his back leg"
"pitches it up further, and Finch, rooted to the crease because of that better length, defends off the inside edge"
"taken at cover! And Kohli goes wild. Takes the catch calmly, but a moment later he is hurtling the ball into the turf as if it had cut him off in traffic and dinged his Ferrari (he should have one right, being the new Tendulkar?). So  Warner goes for another single-digit score, his fifth in nine T20 innings, his downfall brought about by a short ball angling across his body. Goes for the pull, but only the leading edge manifests"
"back of a length on off stump, defends into midwicket"
sees width and so dabs a shortish delivery outside off to deep third man
"full on off stump, drives to mid-on"
gets up with a back of a length delivery outside off and blunts it
"superb strike, but mid-off runs to his left and dives to stop the ball from skirting past. Jadhav doing good work to stop a well timed off drive from Henriques"
"shortish delivery outside off, defends. And as Bhuvneshwar walks back, he drags his feet over the area where he lands on the popping crease, quite vigorously"
"back of a length and outside off, blocks it"
"taken by Kohli at cover again! Short ball, outside off, slapped straight to the fielder. Finch possibly undone by a little more lift off the pitch than he budgeted for."
"short on the pads, flicks it to deep square leg"
defends a good length ball on off stump
"superb drive! And pin-drop silence! Guwahati has been moving to Kohli's tune, roaring when their captain raises his hands and eggs them on. Here they are stunned by an on-the-up straight drive of the highest class"
"shortish on off stump, skews it away through midwicket off a bit of an inside edge"
"goes around the wicket for a full delivery on off stump, Head defuses it to mid-on"
<b>beaten</B> as a good length ball holds its line outside off and Head is left looking like an amateur
"timing, sensational! Of course, it's allowed to come out when the bowler strays onto the pads and the batsman has an easy put away through square leg"
"reaches away from his body as Bhuvneshwar dangles a good length ball, that seams further away. Blocks it gingerly"
"<b>extra bounce</b> but Henriques does well, using his height, to get on top of the ball and push it to mid-off. Goes down to thud his bat into the middle of the pitch to make it behave"
"attempts a forceful drive down the ground, but only gets an inside edge onto the pad"
<b>beats him</b> with an outswinger and they go up for an appeal. No bat involved though. Henriques done in by a ball that hits the seam and darts away past the edge
<B>even better</b>! This is fuller. It's closer to off stump. it demands Henriques to play and then dances past the outside edge. All that was missing is an evil cackle
"now for the one that is angled into off stump, and Henriques, lunging forward to defend, gets an inside edge behind square leg"
"length ball, angling in on off, flicked to midwicket"
"back of a length, punched to mid-off"
"that's out of here. That has sailed miles over deep square leg and smashed the grille of the stands there. Short ball, smokes a pull with immense power"

"full, curving in on off, drilled to mid-on"
"full on off, pushed towards mid-on for a very quick single"
"<b>darts away past the outside edge</b>! Gorgeous ball. Pitches it up, outside off, it deviates off the seam and leave Henqriques staring daggers at the pitch"
"back of a length and outside off, chops it as he tries to cut"
"inside edge, as this time Pandya makes the ball seam into the right-hander. Henriques defends but not exactly comfortably. India's lines so far have been excellent."
"punches a back of a length ball to mid-on, bowled from around the stumps"
punches a shortish delivery past mid-on's right
defends a good length ball on middle
steps out and slams a flighted delivery outside off to long-off
"too short, and though it does turn a long way, that only helps Henriques pick his spot better. Hits it to the square leg boundary"

"loops it up outside off, Head ignores it"
belts a half-volley down to long-on and Pandya races to his right to stop the boundary with a big dive.
"too short and Head wallops it to the midwicket boundary, well to the right of the man in the deep"
"walks out, to try and push the bowler's length back, and therefore prevent him from being able to seam the ball around. Succeeds in that and pulls the short ball to long leg"
"too short, and down the leg side as well, Henriques pulls it to the long leg boundary, very fine and very easily done."
"back of a length on off stump, Henriques moves across and clips it to square leg."
"walks at Pandya, to force his length back, and having done so, he is able to pull it through the gap at midwicket. Excellent batting."
"when the bowler can pitch it up, batting is hard, as this shows. Head can only defend one coming at the top of off."
"goes for the ole heave ho, seeing a fuller, slower ball outside off. Misses it altogether"
"pushes it through on middle, and it hurries off the pitch, cramping Henriques even as he tries to make room. Just about defends it"
""
"this one is a little short, and Henriques backs away to cut it through cover. Kohli gets a hand to it and deflects it to long-off"
"heaves it away to deep midwicket. Chahal not tossing it up, perhaps spooked by the idea of the batsman running at him"
"gives it a little more air, and it drifts into middle and leg. Henriques clears the front leg, but has to stick to defence as the ball turns sharply"
"beautiful late cut! Reads the length so early, sets himself in position to take advantage of the field, which has third man up. Little dab, maximum reward"
"tosses it up outside off, Head bunts it down the ground"
"lofts it to the deep midwicket boundary. Kuldeep is a touch slower than Chahal, so when he drops it short, it sits up for Head to do what he wishes."

"pushes it through outside off, Head cuts, but mistimes the ball to cover"

pulls a shortish delivery to midwicket
"tosses it up outside leg, Henriques drills a drive to long-on"
sails into the crowd behind long-on. Tossing it up isn't helping. Bowling short isn't helping. The dew isn't helping and the small target isn't helping. Head taking advantage of all of that with a meaty blow
slogs a flighted delivery from outside off out to deep midwicket
"loops it up, from around the wicket, Henriques smashes it to cover"

races down to reach the pitch of the tossed up delivery and carves it to long-off
