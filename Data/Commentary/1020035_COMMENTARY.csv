"standing outside the crease, expecting swing, and he begins by defending a good length ball firmly"
confident stride forward to block a fuller delivery on middle and off stump
"anything on the pads will go, and this shot indicates an early sign of how good the pitch is. Comes onto the bat beautifully and de Kock whips it through mdiwicket"
good response from Southee as he lines it up on top of off stump and the batsman respects it with a defensive bat
"keeps it full, keeps it straight, de Kock drives with a straight bat but can't place it past the bowler"
"<b>outside edge</b>, reward for probing lines from Southee, and a reminder that de Kock probably shouldn't be going gung ho when it is around his off stump. Hard-handed push ends up going wide of the slips"
starts a touch too straight and he flicks it to fine leg
asks the drive and gets it. De Kock plants the full ball outside off at cover
dives to his left in his followthrough to stop a gentle push down the ground from de Kock. New Zealand concentrating on keeping the ball in line with the stumps
pats a full delivery on off stump down to mid-off
"nudges it behind square leg, employing the closed face of the bat having read the line of the ball coming into leg stump. Seems to be a slow outfield at the cake tin"
can't be doing that. Although New Zealand have protection square on the off side. De Kock gets a wide ball and lashes it to deep third man
"angles it across the left-hander, and de Kock glides it down to third man"
"tries to tuck him up, but Amla is able to bring those lovely wrists into play and clip it through midwicket"
a hint of curl into the left-hander as Southee pitches it up on middle and leg stump. de Kock keeps it out
"it is Hashim's call, and his partner responds early enough to pinch a single to short fine leg. The ball is only just off, on leg stump and the glance proves profitable"
"time for another whip off the pads, Amla would be disappointed he's not finding the gap with these"
"full on leg, de Kock works it to the left of mid-on"
"tries to force it off the back foot, through cover point, but he doesn't quite have the room to do so"
flat bats it through cover. He is outstanding given a little bit of room to free those arms. Doesn't matter if he has to hit it on the up. He always times it
"tries a little late cut, but oddly enough, his decision to move back and across and closer to the ball hurts him. Cuts between bat and pad"
"good length ball on off stump, blocks"
"shortish and outside off, dabs it behind point"
"good length ball on off stump, negotiates it safely"
"loads up the pull shot, but again he doesn't quite have the full freedom to put everything into the shot. Inside edges through midwicket"
"goes for the bouncer, just outside off, Amla sees it early and drops his wrists"
"drivable ball on off stump, but Amla mistimes and finds cover"
"back of a length and outside off, Amla watches it skip across to the wicketkeeper"
"swivels on his back leg, the front one comes up off the ground, and he pulls to long leg. Usually, that allows the batsman extra balance against a ball that is bouncing a tad more than he expects, but this time, Hash falls over soon as he completes the shot"
"squeezes it past slip's right. Not really a chance, as de Kock waits for the full ball to come in his half of the pitch and then chops down on it with a vertical bat"
uses the left-armer's angle across the right-hander and forces him to leave it all alone
stands up tall and nudges it into the leg side
"looks to bring his wrists into play and take a short ball on off stump through midwicket, but it goes straighter"
"work for long leg as Amla goes for another hook, swivelling on his back leg. Not perfectly controlled, but he could almost have got a boundary. Southee is the man down there, sliding around and saving three runs"
allows the short delivery to come to him and then deflects it harmlessly to square leg
they see a lot of runs on this pitch. They see that they need a lot of it to defend. That's what this shot says as Amla tries to force a back of a length delivery on fifth stump through the covers and gets an inside edge
"appeal for a caught behind off a hook, but umpire Wilson shakes his head. Good height on the bouncer from Southee, and it's close enough to leg stump too that de Kock shouldn't really be hooking"
"crashes it past mid-off's left. Takes a shimmy down the pitch, hits it as hard as he can, and Williamson gets a bit of a bad bounce as he moves towards the ball"
"goes for a cut, but the bat comes under the ball skirting across him"
"a little nudge into the leg side, looking for a quick single, but Amla says no"
picks it up and smashes it over midwicket! That's pure authority. Pure class. Sees the short ball ever so early and then it's all instinct. Pulls well to the left of the fielder on the boundary
"try another short ball for size, says Southee as he makes it climb, and lines it outside off. De Kock is game for this too, and goes for an upper cut. No connection. Gee, this is fun."
powerful punch as Amla stands up tall behind a back of a lenght ball outside off. Neesham at cover leaps to his right and gets a hand to it
"hard-handed push against shortish delivery outside off - Boult is coming around the wicket now, trying to get the ball to straighten - the ball flies behind point"
gets a touch too straight and de Kock's whirling wrists sends it to deep midwicket
"<B>inside edges</b> a fuller delivery that isn't really there for the lash through cover. And since he is going especially hard at the ball, there is no timing either. Single to long leg"
"fuller delivery on off stump, drills it to mid-off"
opens the face just enough so that his drive goes to the right of mid-off. De Kock cruising
"change of pace, but de Kock is in such form, he spots it early, deftly drops it in the square leg region for a quick single"
"back of a length on off stump, Amla defends. He needs to readjust a bit. Not aim at 350 and come away with 200"
"<b>beaten</b> outside off. Hashim's not on today. He doesn't move his feet towards the length of this fuller delivery, but still throws his hands at it."
"and he's out out of his misery. For the longest time, he has been struggling to get the pace of this pitch and falls utterly perplexed by it. This is a good length ball on middle, from wide of the crease. Amla, thinking it would just come on to the bat, flicks and the ball really is there for this shot. If he was in form, he would have crashed it for four. Here though, he pops a leading edge to mid-off"
"short of a length and outside off, defends"
"good length ball on off stump, firmly behind it"
"shortish and outside off, dabs it into the off side"
"extra pace - this at 149 kph - means even a leg-stump half-volley can escape punishment. De kock flicks, but he is far too late into the shot. Yells at himself for the mistake"
"goes for the short ball at 147 kph, de Kock tucks it around the corner to fine leg"
"only a matter of time. He is so good against pace, even those coming in at 150 kph. This is length. This is on middle. This is flicked like Sanath Jayasuriya in his prime over deep square leg"
"149 kph, looks for the whip over square leg again, but this time he finds the inside edge and the length ball on middle and off only becomes a single"
"turns it to mid-on. de Kock is backing up, and has to hurry back to beat the under-arm throw"
"back of a length on off stump, bunts it to mid-off"
"gorgeous drive into the covers, du Plessis simply flowing into the shot. If only he had placed it better"
"some swing for de Grandhomme. The gentle kind, starting early, allowing the batsman to see it, read it to be outside off and leave it"
"<B>nips back off the seam</b>. This is how he got du Plessis out last game, but on this occasion, the batsman is able to adjust, bringing a straight bat down hurriedly in line with it"
"hammers it through the covers. Poor bowling that time, wide half-volley allowing du Plessis every freedom to let his hands flow through the shot. Places it to the left of short cover and away she goes"
scythes the ball behind point
"back of a length and outside off, punches it to mid-off"
"over the two slips. Clocks 150.2 kph with this short ball, and though du Plessis is a little late with this cut shot, he still gets a top edge and a very profitable one at that"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks it"
magnificent!. It takes a special kind of player to take a short delivery outside off stump and brute force it over cover with a straight bat. And at Lockie's pace too.
"squares him up with a 145 kph short ball, pitching on off stump and weaving away. Du Plessis pokes at it and gets an outside edge"
straight bat push sends the shortish delivery outside off through to mid-off
"<b>chance of a run-out</b>, oddly enough created by a fumble from Ferguson at third man. He slips while getting to the ball and South Africa chance a second off that. The throw comes all loopy to the bowler's end and De Kock beats it . Beautiful bowling first up though, with the fuller ball pitching on off stump and moving away late"
"huge appeal for an lbw as de Grandhomme gets this one to come into the right-hander, and du Plessis is nowhere. He is expecting the ball to move away again and when it doesn't he has to hurry into a shot. By that time he is pinned on the pad. Would have gone down leg though"
"fuller delivery outside off, leaves it alone"
"fuller delivery on off stump, blocks with an open face"
waits on the back of a length delivery on off stump and dabs it to deep third man
"full ball goes down leg, too far to de Kock to reach with a flick"
"fuller delivery on leg stump, nudges it through midwicket"
"tosses it up, from over the wicket, into leg stump. De Kock works it through square leg. He's really figured out when to throttle up and when to throttle down"
"loops it up on off stump, Faf answers with a straight bat"
"flatter delivery on off stump, waits on it and then turns through midwicket"
"on middle and leg, de Kock keeps it out"
"tosses it up on off stump, drives to long-off"
jams his bat down on a really full delivery on leg stump and retains strike with a single to long-on
"back of a length on off stump, de Kock tries to tap and run to point, but Broom, the fielder is just so alert. Comes haring in, dives, underarms a throw and if not for a dive, the batsman would have been gone. Course then it would have had to hit direct too"
"back of a length on off stump, nudges through midwicket"
another dinky little clip through midwicket
"back of a length on off stump, defends to cover"
"comes down the track, to see if he can avoid de Grandhomme pitching it at a length where he can keep swinging the ball. Defends to mid-off"
"fuller delivery on middle, coming in off the seam, du Plessis has to keep his front pad out of the way and bring down a straight bat"
does away with a flighted delivery on leg stump and finds a single at deep square leg
"drives a flighted delivery on off stump, can't place it past the bowler"
"mistake from the bowler and he has to pay for it. Short, on this slow pitch, that's a gimme. Faf rocks back and cuts behind point"
"nicely flighted, just outside off, du Plessis drives serenely through cover. Good pair to have for South Africa. They rotate strike by never hitting the ball hard, they often time their shots better"
"tosses it up on middle, pushes it back to Santner"
loads up the sweep and the length ball on middle screams away to deep midwicket
"looks for a little tap behind square leg, but he hasn't quite waited long enough for the back of a length ball to arrive on middle stump."
"on the pads and de Kock flicks it behind square leg to bring up a <b>half-century</b>, the 12th of his career, <b>fifth in five ODIs</B>. Effortless innings"
"<b>absolute beauty</b>! Faf seems to think this is a drivable ball, because de Grandhomme wants him to. Only the pitched up delivery has a secret. It's about to seam away and sharply, beating the outside edge"
"runs down the track - to get to the ball before it swings - and lofts it over mid-on. Calculated risk, well taken because he hits straight"
"back of a length on off stump, slices it to deep point"
"fuller delivery on the pads, and a flick of the wrists sends it flying to deep midwicket. And that's drinks."
too short to start and the 138 kph delivery is easily pulled to deep square leg
"solid drive off the back foot, but he can't beat mid-on"
"147kph, stands still and wafts at a short of a good length delivery which seems to straighten past the outside edge"
"goes for a bouncer, but he has given it a bit too much. Sails over the batsman's head"
beautifully played. Gets down low with the wide yorker and squeezes it with the open face of the horizontal bat to deep third man
"moves around the wicket for a 148 kph short ball at off stump, de Kock gets on top of it and looks for a single, tapping it down by his feet. Nothing there"
into the pads and it's clipped to deep square leg
"not the ball for the field he has. Short and wide, with no third man, and to de Kock especially, de Grandhomme has basically sabotaged himself. Cut away for four"
"back of a length on off sutmp, blocks towards point"
"<b>oooh</b>, this holds in the pitch and de Kock, looking to defend, is surprised by the extra bounce. Takes the shoulder of the bat and goes to third man"
into the pads and de Kock works it behind square leg
waits on the shortish delivery just outside off and dabs it gently to the left of the sweeper. Ferguson down there seems to slip on the outfield again. Second time that's happened to him alone
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
<b>sharp bouncer</b> and it gets a top edge as a stunned Faf plays half of a pull shot. No one there to gobble up the top edge at midwicket
"the angle from around the wicket takes the ball too close to de kock's pads and he flicks it through midwicket. This parntership, which ticked past fifty a few overs ago, keeps going strong"
"147 kph, gets behind a shortish delivery on off stump and runs it to point"
roll of the wrists sends a length ball that is sliding down to long leg
"150kph, but that doesn't faze Faf, as he drives off the back foot to the left of mid-off"
sways away from a short ball at 147 kph just outside off - but that's only so that he can whack it to deep third man
nudges a length ball from the top of off stump to long leg
"fuller delivery on middle, de Kock turns it to midwicket. He's usually at his best when there is pace on the pitch, but he has worked on his game, added the skill required to do well on slow pitches - using the bat face in various different angles, play late to manoeuvre the ball into gaps"
waits on the back of a length delivery and slides it to point
"hangs back and tries to pull a length ball that isn't there for the shot, mistimes it through square leg"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives fluently through cover"
"massive lbw appeal, as de Kock walks down the pitch and flicks across the line. He's done in by the lack of pace. Could it be pitching outside edge? Could it be going high? That's what the umpire thinks when he shakes his head. HotSpot reveals an edge too"
opens the face and guides a back of a length ball into the covers
stands and smashes a short delivery outside off through the covers
"heaves it... has be beaten the men in the deep... it's tight... aaaaand, he's made it! Spots the short ball early. Loves that it's at high pace. Rocks back and pulls between square leg and fine leg. Boult's the man racing to his left, putting in the dive and even he can't get to it"
"goes for a pull again, but this time he's beaten for pace, lobs off his hips to slip"
"another bouncer, on middle and off, de Kock sways away from it and looks for the upper cut. Doesn't make connection. Audacious, dude"
"length ball skirts down leg, de Kock would feel he's missed out on the pick up over square leg"
"<b>inside edge</b> and it almost crashes into his stumps. The value Ferguson brings to this time is in this ball, cramping the left-hander for room and hurrying him with his pace. Just that he bowls a few too many hit-me balls at this stage of his career"
"full ball on off stump, drives to mid-off"
"taken at mid-off and de Grandhomme does du Plessis again. It's all the pressure the bowler has built, with his remarkable full length and superb accuracy. The batsman tries to hit his way out of trouble and the on-the-up drive goes nowhere good. Southee has to come forward, and dive to convert the chance and he's a very fine catcher. No trouble there"
stays back to a fullish delivery on off stump and blocks towards gully
allows the back of a length ball to come to him and turns it to square leg
"taken in the deep by midwicket running to his left, de Grandhomme has changed the game. Two wickets in the over, and it's of the set batsmen. Short ball, there for the pull shot, takes on the boundary, but doesn't come up with the win this time. End of a fine innings - five fifty-plus scores on the trot lest we forget"
"length ball, drifts down and becomes a wide on the leg side"
"flicks across the line of a simple, straight ball and takes it on the pads. Too high and perhaps pitched outside leg as well. No wonder they didn't appeal"
<b>makes de Villiers hop</b> with a 144 kph bouncer on middle and leg. Thuds into his gloves as he leaps up several feet in the air to try and get on top of the ball. That's outstanding stuff
back of a length and outside off - and he deflects it to third man as if he were playing a club game
taps it down to long leg to get off the mark
"clubs it over midwicket. If you bowl short, make sure it comes up to his grille. Because if it isn't, AB will do this to you all day long. Shifts his balance back and pulls with pure disdain. <b>Nine thousand ODI runs</b> at a strike-rate of 100, average over 50, and the fastest to the mark in history"
"back of a length and outside off, offers no shot"
"there's another short ball outside off, dabs it to deep third man"
<b>absolute rip-snorter</b>. It has to be to beat de Villiers when it comes down at 120 kph. Pitches on a good length on middle and leaps away off the pitch like a legbreak
"fuller delivery on off stupm, defends"
turns it past mid-on
"fuller delivery outside off, Duminy plays away from the body a bit, but makes good connection. Finds point nevertheless."
shuffles back in his crease for a shortish delivery on leg stump and works it away behind square leg
"what a shot! Hurtles down the pitch like a runaway truck, turns a lenght ball into a half-volley and smears it through the covers. Would have taken Brownlie at short cover with it, if he dared to put a hand on that"
"lovely shot. With the left-arm spinner coming from over the wicket, and pitching on middle and leg, Duminy lunges forward and lap sweeps it so fine"
"good bowling. Tosses it up, and slows it down all the way. de Villiers knows he has nothing to work with and defends on off stump"
"makes his pace by coming down the track, but Santner does well to line it up on middle and leg, refusing de Villiers any room. Clip to square leg"
is ready for the correction form the bowler and the short ball outside off is slashed to deep point
"huge appeal for lbw from the keeper, but umpire Brown says no. Williamson is crying out to the keeper to ask his opinion and then goes for <b>a review</b>. This is a quicker ball, sliding down leg. AB tries to flick. Question is has he made connection. Third umpire says 'we don't have HotSpot' - must be a glitch because it was working before. Snicko works though and it shows nothing as ball passes bat"
"flatter delivery on off stump, punches it through cover"
gets across onto off and works the ball off the stumps behind square leg
"good length, outside off, Duminy pushes with his hands to cover"
"blocks with the open face, and the back of a length ball goes to point"
waits on the shortish delivery and guides it to the left of the wide slip
pats a back of a length ball to short cover
"on the pads, and Duminy clips it behind square leg"
"thinks about pummeling this slow delivery, thinking it is short, but it really doesn't offer him the room for such a shot. Duminy realises that eventually and blocks with a straight bat"
goes back and punches it through cover
comes on with the arm as de Villiers shifts back and flicks to mid-on
rocks back and cuts the flatter delivery to deep point
"he's doing it well against the left-arm spinner. Gets down low to paddle sweep the ball, and he can keep doing that considering Santner is bowling over the wicket and into middle and leg"
drives to long-on
"back of a length on off stump, keeps it out"
fullish on off stump fetches a crisp drive to mid-off
"goes back to try and thump a shortish delivery on middle stump over square leg, but misses it altogether. Too high for the lbw shout that de Grandhomme makes"
pierces the gap at cover as he moves back and punches the ball moving across him
"good length ball on off stump, de Villiers waits on it, and then pats the ball down as late as he could, looking for a single behind point. As nifty as the shot was, it doesn't amount to much"
taps it to deep point and that ends an uninterrupted spell of 10 overs from de Grandhomme. Took out both set batsmen in the same over. Brought New Zealand back into this game.
"premeditates the sweep, and despite the bowler adjusting, bowling quicker and flatter, de Villiers is able to send it to long leg"
deft little flick off middle and leg
"sweep again, taking the flighted ball from outside off and placing it well to the left of deep backward square leg"
"rocks back to a flat delivery, but has to play it with a straight bat because it is still full enough in length. Single to long-on"
"goes flat on leg stump and Duminy loads up the scoop, mistimes it to long leg"
"tosses it up on off stump, that's cue for AB to load up a big drive, but he goes after it a bit too early. Mis-hits it to mid-off"
"<b>inside edge</b>, flies past the keeper's right. Change of pace almost worked. It's the little offcutter, pitching back of a length and outside off. Duminy blocks with the bat coming down from gully at an angle"
"back of a length on off stump, taps it to point"
another inside edge as Duminy tries to guide a back of a length ball behind point and ends up almost dragging on
"fuller ball on off stump, defends"
wafts outside off and the cut shot doesn't come off
walks across in front of his stumps as he aims to flick and weathers an lbw appeal as he misses the shot. Would probably have gone down leg though
"flatter delivery on middle, Duminy drills it back at the bowler"
"sets up for the scoop, has to wait for the flighted delivery to arrive on middle. Single to long leg"
"tosses it up on middle, AB looks to flick it, but misses it. Lbw appeal shot down because it is sliding down"
backs away to a flatter delivery on leg stump and pushes it through cover
"<b>stumping missed</b>! And it was a simple one too. Up to Latham's mistake this is a beautiful piece of cricket from New Zealand. They have tied Duminy down. And Santner sees him itching to hit out. Sees him coming down the track and tosses it wide outside off, past his reach."
"tosses it up on leg stump, sweeps it gently to long leg"
"back of a length on off stump, pats it down"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives towards point"
"shortish on leg stump, turns it to midwicket"
"goes wide of the crease for a fuller ball on off stump, drives to mid-off and pinches a single"
"back of a length and outside off, de Villiers avoids it and it's so close to being a wide too"
"shortish and outside off, steers it behind point"
"a touch too full to be on the back foot, but AB is able to adjust with his hands, flicking through midwicket"
"direct hit at the bowler's end, is Duminy in trouble here? He's gone. Seems like the bat stuck in the ground and the point fielder Tim Southee has pulled off a piece of magic (it is Westpac after all). To think all of this began with a neat little glide from Duminy himself, moving across to a nicely tossed up delivery outside off. De Villiers called for the single, but Duminy was a little sluggish to start and the bat sticking into the wicket didn't help matters"
"flatter delivery outside off, punches it through to the sweeper on the off side"
"off the mark is the new batsman David Miller, clipping a loopy delivery on off stump to long-on"
drives through the covers for a single
"works a flighted delivery from off stump into the leg side, but Santner moves to his left and fields it himself"
"back of a length and outside off, taps it behind point"
guide a short delivery outside off to deep third man
"good ball - it's short, it climbs up at de Villiers' throat at off stump, making him sway away"
"this one is short too, but doesn't quite rise high enough to threaten de Villiers. Rocks back and pulls powerfully to deep midwicket"
steers a short delivery to deep third man
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"gets down the track, but does so a bit too early. Allows Santner the chance to change his length, bowl it flatter on leg stump and make sure Miller can only flick to midwicket"
"another flatter delivery outside off, slices it to point"
"taken at short midwicket! But the umpires want to make sure it has carried. Chris Brown's soft signal is out. This is such lovely bowling from Santner. On a slow pitch, he slows it down still and it finds Miller into the shot a touch too early. Broom's the man with the spotlight on him, diving to his right, getting his hands low and coming up with a fine catch. 'He's got it in the end of the fingers,' says the third umpire Paul Reiffel but he wants more angles for confirmation. This could be tight. 'Happy with that. It's out'"
"starts with a boundary, hanging back against a flat and wide delivery and cutting it past backward point"
"tosses it up, nice and slow on middle, defends"
"tosses it up on middle, defends to short midwicket"
"slower ball outside off, de Villiers lashes it to cover"
<b>extra bounce</b> which is weird on a slow pitch. De Villiers shapes to cut a back of a length delivery outside off but suddenly finds himself playing under it
"tennis-ball bounce again. This bouncer, dug into the middle of the pitch outside off, sails over the batsman outside off"
waits on the short and wide delivery and just dabs it at the last minute to deep third man
"back of a length on off stump, waits on it and taps it towards cover"
"lovely batting. it's not easy to start on this pitch, but Pretorius already has two fours. A cross-seamer, that seems to bounce extra, in the corridor of uncertainty. But the batsman just guides it past the wicketkeeper's right"
"fuller delivery on off stump, pushes it to the right of mid-on"
"tosses it up on off stump, drives towards mid-off"
"flatter delivery on middle, clips it through midwicket"
"good length ball on off stump, keeps it out"
"beauty. He lets it drift on with the arm, tossing the ball up on off stump. Pretorius defends, not knowing if it will turn or not, and gets an inside edge through his legs"
"tosses it up outside off, slices it to cover"
"good length, outside off, drives to the sweeper on the offside boundary"
"full delivery on off stump, AB keeps it out"
opens the face to a full delivery on off stump and finds a single through cover
"<b>gorgeous</b>. Ferguson puts in the effort ball, digging it into the pitch and making it climb on the batsman. Pretorius tries to run it to third man with an open face and is beaten"
"cleans him up, what a fine yorker from Ferguson! What a follow-up after the bouncer. Pretorius is caught on the back foot, expecting another one to buzz around his ears but he is completely deceived. By the time he realises that and gets low to try and protect his off stump, it is knocked back."
"greets him with a short ball at 141 kph, skating across the left-hander, who leaves"
"fuller ball on off stump, Parnell rolls his wrists on it and sends it down the ground between the stumps and the non-striker on the right"
"full and outside off, pushes it through the covers"
works a full one from middle and off to mid-on
defends a pitched-up delivery on off stump
"squares him with a full delivery that he flicks at way too early. Seems like the wobbly-seamer, on a full length, angled into the left-hander to draw the mistake. Leading edge to cover"
"back of a length on off stump, Parnell pats it back down the pitch and Boult dives to his left, against his followthrough, to field it himself"
steers a back of a length ball to point
"fullish on middle and off, de Villiers' instinct makes him look leg side, but his mind reminds him that this is a slow pitch and he has to be careful closing the face like that. Checks his shot and gets a leading edge to cover"
"<b>uppish</b> as Parnell thrusts his hands at a back of a length delivery on off stump. Into the shot too early, and the leading edge bisects point and cover point"
"shortish on off stump, keeps it out"
"shortish and outside off, he chops it down to third man"
"short ball, sliding down leg, AB unleashes a pull, but he picks out long leg. Oooh, there was a boundary for the taking there"
"crashes it to point, where Broom dives to his left to stop any runs"
stays beside the tossed up ball on leg stump and drives through cover
"loops it up over the batsman's eyeline, Parnell charges down and hits over the bowler's head"
goes for the sweep and hits it to the left of deep backward square leg
"premeditates a sweep, and sends a length ball outside off to deep midwicket"
"short of a good length and outside off, AB has to wait and wait and wait, before he can chop it through point"
"beats him and ends his quota in style. Santner's bowling is coming along superbly. This is a beautifully tossed up delivery, giving Parnell way too much time to think things over, and his timing little waft to third man is useless"
"oh, hello. This is the slower ball, and it <b>dips sharply</b> into the blockhole. Dwayne Bravo does this beautifully in T20 cricket. De Villiers manages to keep it out"
"fierce strike over midwicket. What a shot. It's the shot the ball deserved, short and barely rising up to his stomach, but gee, did he ever hit it hard. Deep midwicket has only a few yards to move his his left, but he is beaten"
half-volley on off stump and de Villiers smears it to the left of short cover and there's no one behind it. Or no one who could catch up with a perfectly timed drive
"half a shout for caught behind, but the noise comes off the offcutter clipping Ab's pad through to Latham the keeper. Good bowling. Good change of pace. Catches the batsman unawares as he hops on his crease, expecting something quicker, and flicks across the line"
"low full toss on middle, nudges it to long-on"
on the pads and Parnell works it towards square leg
"starts around the wicket for a back of a length ball on off stump, pushes to mid-on"
lifts it over mid-on. Calculated strike on a small ground with the fielder up. Sees the length he could get under and takes full toll of it
"oh, not quite so clever there. Backs away to a length ball and slogs. Southee beats him handsomely outside off"
"good length ball on off stump, tips and runs into the covers"
"shortish and outside off, pats it to point"
works a back of a length delivery on off stump through midwicket to retain strike
"excellent shot through square leg to bring up his half-century. The 51st of his career, and extremely vital to South Africa today. On a slow pitch, he's managing to maintain a strike-rate in the high 80s without breaking into a sweat"
"shortish on middle and leg, AB defuses it off his hips to square leg again"
goes way too short and it balloons high over the batsman's head
"lashes it over point! Phenomenal connection. True, the ball is short and wide and the boundaries are rather tiny here. But to time it so well. Phew"
works it off his pads towards midwicket
carves a full and wide ball through the covers
"slower ball, ends up a full toss, which Parnell smacks down the ground for a couple. AB will be on strike next over"
"beats de Villiers straight away, with a little help from the ball misbehaving. Keeps low as he tries to pull and it only just misses off stump."
"fuller delivery outside off, AB gets down low and smashes a cover drive. Can't pierce the gap though"
"takes on the short ball and does so sensibly, swivelling on the back foot and basically guiding it to deep square leg."
"back over the wicket for a yorker just outside off. AB looks to slice it through cover point, but gets an inside edge"
carves the ball over the covers. There's no one up inside the circle to 'catch it' as the cry demanded
"spears it into middle and leg, and Parnell manages to work it through to long leg. And they're going for the second run. They want AB on strike the next over again and Parnell does superbly to get back in time for the throw"
"fly away, you beauty. <b>Brings up the fifty partnership</b> and what a shot it is too. Drives at a back of a length ball and manages to get enough wood on the shot to clear cover"
"short and angled into off stump, mistimes the pull to deep midwicket"
"low full toss outside off, Parnell was backing away, meaning he's done himself in and has to reach out to make the connection. That ruins his timing. Only a couple to deep cover"
"AB could be run out, but Broom has to hit direct. He only has one stump to aim at from cover and he misses."
"finds the yorker on off stump, pushes to mid-off"
"lovely batting. This is a yorker on fourth stump, but AB gets down low with it and steers it to third man to keep strike. Beautiful. He's upped a gear in the last 10 overs."
"shot! He knows Boult will go yorker, so he moves across outside off, gets down low for the scoop and when it is a low full toss, it makes things all the more easier. Finds the gap to the left of long leg"
"that's perfect from Boult. Nails the yorker on middle, but AB's inside edge gets him two to long leg. Back on strike for the carnage South Africa need badly"
"goes for the slog sweep again, but on this slow pitch, he skews it off the inside half of the bat, playing too early"
"low full toss on middle, Parnell backs away and gets an outside edge to deep third man"
"walks at him, so Boult goes bouncer, just outside off, and it climbs on the batsman too. AB has to drag it, considering he is looking leg side for his runs. Finds square leg. Beautiful bowling."
"another yorker, on middle and leg, de Villiers gets an inside edge to square leg. Brownlie has one of three stumps to aim at, that's good odds to sneak a single. And AB steals the strike yet again. How well has he done it this evening."
"this is high class cricket. De Villiers in full flow, and New Zealand's premier quicks nailing their yorkers. This one is a notch better than normal because Southee knows the batsman is looking leg side for his runs and so goes for the blockhole wide outside off. Inside edge for only a single to square leg"
"moves around the wicket to the left-hander for a 97 kph slower ball on middle, Parnell slogs and gets an inside edge to long leg. South Africa have 250."
"digs it in short, and it's called a wide for height. De Villiers prepared to tennis forehand it down the ground, but avoids it in lieu of the extra run and ball"
"overpitched and it's smashed over mid-off. Misses his mark by a few inches and that's more than enough for most batsmen, let alone one of de Villiers' class."
"full on off stump, smears it to long-on and Parnell pushes AB to get through for a couple. The captain's taking in the big breaths now. Top innings under pressure."
"short and outside off, de Villiers jabs it to deep third man and picks up a couple"
"looks for the blockhole at off stump, AB clears his front leg and smacks it to cover. Single, and he will keep strike for the final over"
what a strike! He manages to sweep an overpitched delivery one bounce to the square leg boundary. You just cant time a cross-bat shot when it's that full and yet somehow those laws don't apply to AB de Villiers
"caught at the boundary, Neesham pulls off another superb grab, timing his jump perfectly. He would have fancing hitting this out of the park - full toss on off stump, offering him room to free the arms. But his magical timing fails right at the end. Still, his 85 off 80 balls has given South Africa a proper target to bowl at on a slow pitch"
"yorker, off stump, stabs it to long-off"
"low full toss on leg stump, drills it to long-on"
"comes down the track, preempting the yorker and though he mistimes the slash over cover, he beats the two men up inside the circle and then onto the boundary. Calculated strike. Parnell's doing really well"
"full on leg stump, heaves it to deep midwicket, they go for two and have they made it? The third umpire will confirm this, and Paul Reiffel sees that though Parnell is well past his crease, his bat is in the air"
"back of a length on off stump, with perhaps a shade of movement away from the bat. Defended"
"excellent line from the young quick. Pitching on off stump and moving across the left-hander. Latham, under pressure for runs, leaves. Brave choice"
"a touch fuller on off stump, but Latham trusts the angle of the right-armer going across him and shoulders arms again."
"good length ball on off stump, coming in off the pitch, prompts Latham to block."
"<b>absolute ripper</B>. This is 140 kph, but the kicker is it's a yorker. The chase is barely an over old and South Africa's spearhead nails the blockhole and nearly topples the stumps. But considering he can't do that with Latham's straight bat jamming down in time, Rabada settles for making Latham lose his footing and fall over on his face"
"back of a length, outside off, no shot"
"jags the ball into the right-hander, but with it being short of a length, Brownlie is able to clip it behind square leg"
"probes in the area just outside off, Latham refuses to play again"
"oh he looks utterly forlorn. Not merely because he's given South Africa just what they wanted, but also because he is struggling for form and now he goes for a duck. Takes on a back of a length delivery outside off - the same one he has been leaving - and carves it straight to point. Academic"
"tucks him up, but Williamson is able to get a little nibble behind square leg"
"goes on the bounce to mid-on. Oooh, that is risky. He pulls a ball that isn't necessarily all that short, nor does it give him any room and worst of all, it is climbing on him."
nudges a shortish delivery towards short midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, Williamson is happy to let those go"
"roll of the wrists, at the right time, sends a full ball on middle past mid-on's right"
"<b>corker again</b>! Shows you this pitch isn't straightforward. Back of a length ball, bites into the surface and rips away from Williamson even as he tries to block"
digs int short and it sails over the ducking Williamson and even beats de Kock behind the stumps
soft hands as he gets behind a shortish delivery on off stump and lets it run away to third man
"he is such a treat to watch. Fluid into the crease. effortless pace, and he moves the ball off the seam. This is in the corridor, just outside off, making doubts claw at Brownlie. He pokes at the ball with an open face, thinking why not, and feathers an edge through to the keeper. All of this at 142 kph too. South Africa don't have to worry about life after Dale Steyn"
tails into the pads and Taylor gets off the mark with a flick through to deep square leg. A faster outfield would have taken it away to the boundary
"<b>dropped by Amla at first slip</b> he's had a shocker today. Comes up with a wistful smile, perhaps thinking about the way the ball curved to the right just as it reached him. Mistake from Williamson, a rare one as he pushes hard at a 138 kph back of a length ball angled across him. Healthy outside edge, Amla is getting ready to catch it, but the ball deviates at the last second to throw him off"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"nudges it through square leg, getting in line with the shortish delivery on middle and leg"
"'yeah, yeah. yeah,' he yells after tapping the ball into the midwicket region"
"short of a length and outside off, shoulders arms"
cramps him up with an indipper on middle. South Africa are getting the ball to go off the pitch under lights
down leg and that's easy for Williamson. Indulges in a little flick and sees the ball fly away to long leg
spots the line of this back of a length ball as outside off and knows he doesn't need to do much more than watch it sail past
"hustles him with a shortish delivery at 144 kph, Taylor is off his feet to block"
"back of a length on off stump, defends towards cover point"
"looks for a single as he deflects a shortish delivery off his pads, but square leg rushes in quickly enough"
"looks for a flick, but this time he plays before the ball arrives and gets struck on the body. Offcutter jags back so sharply"
looks to pull a short ball moving across him at high pace - and going above his shoulder too. All of that is just wrong and that is why Williamson makes no connection
"that's classic! On most outfields you might just stand and admire a straight drive like that, but here Williamson has to hare up and down for a couple. Half-volley outside off, beautifully dealt with"
"squares him up with a short ball, that bounces a lot more than Taylor expects and thuds into his shoulder, after rising past the bat"
"back of a length and outside off, steers it into the covers"
"good length on off stump, defends"
"takes on the short ball and thumps it over midwicket. This one didn't get up high enough, so much that Taylor plays this shot off the front foot"
"full and threatening the stumps, Williamson presses forward to block"
defends inside the line of a good length ball that holds its line and darts past the outside edge. <b>Unplayable</b>
"takes the outside edge as Rabada bowls fuller, and the ball straightens again to put Williamson in trouble. Usually he starts well, but today he's been scratchy"
nudges a length ball off the stumps to the right of mid-on
"digs it in short on middle, Williamson avoids it easily enough"
"<b>wears it</b> on the gut. Oh, it's tough work facing Rabada on this deck, in this form. His accuracy is supreme and he is bowling such an awkward length, making the ball climb up on even the best batsmen. Williamson thinks he can flick this away, but the pain he feels a second later tells him how wrong he was"
"too straight and Taylor is able to tick the strike over with a flick to deep square leg. Singles, That's what the batsman has to look for. Taylor doing it well"
width offered and Williamson is able to slice it to deep third man
"heaves a length ball over midwicket fielder. Ugly, but effective enough. Tahir hits the stumps at the bowler's end direct from the boundary"
"that'll do him good. Gets behind the short ball, swivels on his back foot and pulls it with disdain. Off the front foot, over square leg. Top notch"
"goes around the stumps for a full ball on off stump, pushes to mid-off"
waits on the shortish delivery and glides it off the open face to point
checks his shot as he attempts a drive on the up towards short cover. Have to see off this spell from Rabada.
"<b>how do you play that?</b> It starts like an inswinger - and it's threatening the stumps. Taylor falls over as he plays a flick, and is completely beaten by the very late and quite prodigious away swing"
""
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"full and into the pads, flicks behind square leg"
comes forward confidently and blocks to mid-off. Straight face. Firm push
"plays inside the line of a good length ball that straightens. If he can do that often enough, this angle around the wicket could be very useful. Leading edge to point this time"
"makes him reach outside off, Taylor worried about the ball moving away late. This one though holds its line. Risky little glide to point"
"go for a quick single, and Williamson could have been gone had he hit - and let's take a moment to celebrate Parnell's ingenuity here. He rushes across, picks the ball up with his throwing hand, and as he tumbles over, he underarms the ball <i>between</i> his legs!"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives to mid-off"
"drifts into leg stump, and Williamson is able to get inside the line and pull to long leg"
"looks to run a good length ball to third man, but those efforts are spoiled by an athletic gully fieldsman"

"good length ball on off stump, Williamson looks to steer it past slip, but doesn't quite manage it"
"short ball, doesn't rise, and Lucky - seriously that's his middle name - doesn't bowl at a pace high enough to worry Williamson about a top edge. Front foot pull to deep midwicket"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"short of a length on off stump, blocks towards point"
"<b>confusion</b>, but they realise this single is non-existent just in time. Taylor taps it towards short midwicket and sets off, Williamson answers and then suddenly hears a panic-stricken no. Has to rush back"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
defends a shortish delivery that refuses to give him any room to work with
"seems to hold in the pitch and Williamson, in his effort to dab it to third man, has to adjust just a teensy bit to get the single he wants"
"again, dabs into the leg side and looks for a quick single that isn't there. Williamson, this time, has the good sense to say no straight away. Parnell was too close to it"
"smashes it through extra cover. it's a full toss, it needed to be put away and it is with consummate ease"
shifts back in his crease to tap a shortish delivery to point
too close for the cut and Williamson gets an inside edge which goes off to the wicketkeeper
"shifts his weight back to try and sneak a single to third man, but again, when the ball is hit into the deck, it holds up and doesn't come up at the pace the batsman expects. Goes to wide slip"
"turns it away through square leg, and Miller chasing the ball from the circle runs into the square leg umpire Chris Brown"
tries to yank a length ball on off stump towards midwicket. No luck
"shortish and outside off, Taylor pulls through vacant midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, Williamson makes good connection with the back-away cut, but Duminy at point, so close in, dives to his left and prevents any runs"
"nudge to short midwicket, and this time he's hit it softly enough to pinch the single"
<b>can't do much with that</b>. Williamson plays the angle of the good length ball pitching on off stump and shaping to come in. Then it jags away off the seam and beats the outside edge
<b>back-to-back jaffas</b> as a good length ball outside off draws him into a block and trumps him again
"goes for a pull the moment he sees it short, but without the requisite room to free the arms, he mistimes to mid-on"
"walks at the bowler, who shortens his length outside of, chops it to point"
shimmies down the pitch again and slugs a length ball to mid-on
"pressure tells. The moment a ball even remotely hittable arrives, Taylor plays a false stroke and is beaten. Length ball, jags away past the flashing bat"
"fuller delivery on off stump, taps it back down the pitch"
"shortish and just outside off, Taylor chops it to point. That inner ring is impenetrable"
finds the gap between the slip and backward point with the angled bat
"chops it on! He's been out of nick all innings, and even his favourite dab to third man goes awry. The thing that does him in is the seam movement that South Africa have managed so consistently - this time Lucky nips the ball back in cramping the batsman and then taking him out. De Villiers runs in and hugs his bowler and just doesn't wanna let go. Aw."
"fuller delivery on off stump, defends"
"back of a length and outside off, pushes into the covers"
<b>another inside edge</b> as Taylor looks to cut a ball that isn't really wide enough. Incredible control of line so far from South Africa
"pins him! It's Pretorius' turn to take out an NZ lynch pin. Taylor plays across the line of a full and straight delivery. He misses, the ball strikes pad, low and in front of middle stump. No surprise the umpire's finger shot up"

"back of a length and outside off, pats it behind point"
"back of a length and sliding down, Neesham looks for a flick, but can't connect"

"fuller delivery outside off, guides it to deep third man"
"fuller delivery outside off, squeezes it to point"
"back of a length on off stump, keeps it out"
"simple catch at first slip and Amla has made amends for his earlier drop, he's particularly chuffed with this turn of events. It's that lovely bit of seam movement again, under lights on a pitch that seems to have changed completely. Lucky hits back of a length in the corridor of uncertainty, Broom pushes at it with hard hands and he has to walk off"

gets up tall to wrestle a short delivery outside off into the ground and gets a single through cover
"good length, on middle, on a pitch that is giving some nibble, all Santner can do is present a straight bat"
steps forward to block a fuller delivery on off stump
"takes the risk, it doesn't come off. What a spell of bowling from Pretorius. Gets curl in the air, into the left-hander and that's more than enough to hurtle past the inside edge and into off stump. Expansive strike, meant to take the ball over mid-on, becomes Santner's downfall"
"fuller ball on off stump, pushes into the covers"
"back of a length and outside off, pushes it into the covers"

tosses it up on middle - not sure if it's the wrong 'un - de Grandhomme flicks to deep midwicket
"another flighted delivery on middle, Neesham clips past short midwicket"
"carves a half-volley wide outside off to the point boundary. Top timing from de Grandhomme, opens the face at the last second and that's the trick"

"googly again, this one quicker and fuller on off stump, de Grandhomme defends"

"142 kph, back of a length delivery hustling the batsman. Neesham dabs it into the midwicket region"
"too legsidish and Neesham does well to play late and flick it all along the ground to deep square leg. He's become a proper batsman, Neesham. Not the late-order hitter he once was"

"shortish delivery on middle and leg, works it through midwicket"
keeps back to block a good length ball on off stump
"extra bounce does him. Neesham sets up for the pull shot, but it is onto him too quickly and skews off splice of the bat back to the bowler who takes the catch, low to his right"
"shortish and into the body from around the stumps, he nurdles it behind square leg"
sometimes cricket can be as simple as that. It's pitched it. It can be gotten under. it can be lofted over mid-off and so Southee just does that. Easy peasy lemon squeezy
and then he does this: backs away to a shortish delivery on middle stump and aims over cover. Completely beaten
"digs it in on middle and off stump, Southee goes for the upper cut, but he is done for pace"
"cramps him with a back of a length delivery on middle and leg. Southee just about keeps it out and then bumbles out looking for a run, when Rabada is right there, stalking the ball"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"

bouncer from Parnell now and Ferguson has to duck to save himself again

takes a length ball and drives through cover
"full on off stump, Ferguson is waiting on the short one, but is still able to drill this though point"
"length ball on off stump, pushes to cover"
gets inside the line of a short ball and works it away to deep square leg
"launches it over the square leg boundary. Big man, big shot. Short ball, takes it on and sends it soaring over the fielder placed there to dissuade such a shot"
"134 kph, goes for the bouncer, which skirts past the right-hander as he gets inside the line and tries to pull it fine. Appeal from the wicketkeeper. Not out says umpire Brown. AB comes in, asking if anyone heard anything, and then decides not to review. Good call. This sharp short ball sails over de Grandhomme, who is caught in an awkward duck/pull"
<s>Tahir has one too</s> - and but Ferguson has reviewed and replays shows he has smashed it with the inside edge. Slider on middle nearly had him
<b>how has middle stump survived?</b> This is the googly and Ferguson plays down the ground line. The ball sneaks between bat and pad and sails over the stumps
"slider again, quick and straight, Ferguson defends confidently"
"tosses it up on off stump, Ferguson closes the face too early and gets a leading edge"
"good length ball outside off, leaves it alone"
"too good. That's a top over of legspin. Shows off all his tricks and gets him with another wrong 'un. The trick to this ball is in the line. it's just a shade outside off, drags him across to create the gap between bat and pad, considering Ferguson didn't pick it off the hand. He plays for turn, it's in the wrong direction and is bowled neck and crop"
banged in short and it sails over the batsman's head
back of a length on off stump defends

"fires it in on middle, de Grandhomme goes for a slog and wears it"

walks at the medium pacer and blocks the shortish delivery on off stump
"sets up for the slog over the leg side, his back leg as the ballast and his front leg out of the way. And then he decides to leave"

"good length ball outside off, puts it into the open space at cover and takes the single"
the captain takes the catch to end the match. What a game for South Africa. They batted through a middle-order collapse and now have bundled New Zealand out for 112 on their home turf. it all ends when Boult takes a swing at a back of a length ball on off stump and top-edges it for mid-off to run in and finish proceedings
