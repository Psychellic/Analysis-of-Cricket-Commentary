"84mph, good length, angled in, fourth stump line, he leaves a tight one to off"
<strong>caught behind! Five times for Broad!</strong> Warner trying to leave made his decision to late! Got a little outside edge before withdrawing the bat. Easy catch for Bairstow! It was a good length but way wide of off. It didn't shape away much. The tightness of the previous leave maybe caused doubt for Warner and he was too late to withdraw the bat!

"<strong>huge LBW appeal and given!</strong> Harris <strong>reviews</strong>. The umpire took awhile and Harris took awhile to send it upstairs. It was a good length angled in, no bat, it nipped past the inside edge but hit the front pad above the knee roll. Ball tracking says it's hitting the bails! <strong>Umpire's call and it stays out!</strong> He was caught on the crease so height wasn't as big a factor. Good call from Dharmasena."

"length outside off, has a <strong>massive heave</strong> which goes miles up in the air... Root at mid-on watches it fly up, has enough time to set himself, roll up his sleeves, finish off his cup of tea and then pouch it. Brainless shot! Bit of a nothing ball from a negative angle, Wade hadn't got going at all and lost his patience, hoping to mow this over cow corner, and top-edged it straight up"

"back of a length from round the wicket, Burns blocks it down into the off side"
"wide on the crease, a touch fuller and straighter, Burns defends back down the pitch"
"<strong>leading edge, and gone!</strong> Full of a length and straight, Burns looks to work it into the leg side, gets a leading edge, and it floats up to wide mid-off/short cover! Head takes a pretty straightforward, knee-high, and that is exactly the start that Australia would have wanted"
"<strong>BOWLED 'IM! Absolute ripper from Cummins, England are in disarray!</strong> This is more or less the perfect delivery for a right-arm seamer to a right-hander. On a length, nips away off the seam, kisses the top of the off stump past Root's defences, and Cummins wheels away in celebration. <B>What a start for Australia!</B>"

"good length, defended on the front foot"
"<b>loud appeal</b> but it struck him outside the line and wasn't coming back enough to hit the stumps either. Tuns out it might have clipped the stumps on umpire's call. Roy was caught on the crease a bit and played for turn that wasn't there, but he was moving across and it struck him on the pad"

<b>overthrows</b> and Lyon isn't happy. This was flicked to midwicket for a quick single. A shy at the stumps results in further runs
"lovely looking cover drive, but straight to the man at cover"
"nipping in from outside off, but it was slightly back of a length so he's safe in leaving this as it bounces over the stumps"
"nipping in on a length again, and raps his pads"
"<b>inside edge</b> trickles to backward square leg. Wide enough of off and full enough to attempt the drive, but it tailed in a bit and took the edge"
"back of a length outside off, he pulls out of playing a shot"
"<b>bowled through the gate</b>. There's the opening Australia were seeking since the morning, and it's Pat Cummins - again - who has delivered it. Roy has been pushing forward through his innings, and been vulnerable to the incoming delivery. Cummins gets the length and movement perfect and rearranges the stumps, with a big gap left between bat and pad."
"length outside off, kept a tad low but he watched it carefully and defended"
"<b>through him</b>. Was there bat on that? Drifts gently away and breaks in sharply to hit pad and bounce up. <b>in fact there was an inside edge on it too</b>. Pushing forward to defend but the turn means he inside-edged onto pad and it bounced up to Paine. Can't call that a drop, went up to his face nearly"

"length outside off, defended carefully to cover"
"full on the stumps, opens the face to defend towards point from the crease"
"bouncer, but ducked under easily as it's going down leg"

"more in control that time, waits for the ball and steers it by opening the bat face well wide of third slip"
"low full toss, nudged into the leg side"
fullish length on the stumps and turning away but he takes a big stride out to smother the spin and defend
"that one spit up from a length, and broke sharply past the outside edge. Stokes played it wel in the end, going back and getting the bat out of the way to let it go on"

"length on the stumps, defended on the front foot"
strays down leg and stokes clips it to deep square leg. Off the mark
"good length, nipping across him, and he keeps bat close to his body, allowing ball to go past"
"<b>Stokes is walking</b> - what a massive moment! This was a corker of a delivery, bowled on the stumps, back of a length, insistently pushing Stokes on the back foot and so close to his body that he had to play at it. He realised too late that wearing the blow on his body might be better and was taking the bat out of the way. It must have got a tickle through - as soon as Paine moves to his right to gather it, he was celebrating, Cummins was appealing. And then Stokes was walking, even though the umpire hadn't indicated anything."
"length outside off, defended"
"oooh, it's all happening here suddenly. Length ball, jagging in sharply again, flies off the thigh pad and Paine can't gather. It goes to the boundary for four leg byes"
"good length on the stumps, turned into the legside"
"fuller on leg stump, pushed towards mid-on"
"too full, flicked off his pads to deep square leg"
"length ball outside off, keeps his bat well out of the way by tucking it behind is back almost to let it go"
"length outside off, defended to point"
"<b>big appeal</b> and not given, but Paine is not reviewing. They were asking for a caught behind but the ball hit his front pad on the way through to Paine. Another one that is coming in and has the batsman in trouble, he pushes outside the line and it takes the pad to the keeper. Wouldn't have been lbw also, with impact showing umpire's call"
superb response. Too full outside off and he drives it crisply through cover for a lovely cover drive for four
"bouncer, stays low and sways his head out of the way"
"length ball outside off, stays beside it and pushes to point"

"good length on off, gets behind it to defend"

"length ball angling in, squeezed towards mid-on"
"good length outside off, nipping in but Denly judges it well enough and knows he can shoulder arms to this because it's not coming back enough to threaten pad or stumps"

He didn't account for the movement and the ball goes past his inside edge to strike the knee roll. <b>DRS shows two reds and umpire's call on hitting the stumps</b>. Bairstow's resistance is done, and Starc has broken through"
"oooh similar ball to the one that got Bairstow, angling in from around the wicket but didn't move as much and Overton does well to jab it away"

"length ball, it's a length that is allowing them to go deep and play him off the backfoot, which Buttler does again, using his wrists to turn to square leg"
"better length that time, and draws him forward to defend. Hits his pad and they go up in appeal. Not out and no review, probably striking him outside the line"

"this one comes in with the angle, but is back of a length so Buttler lets it go, as it bounces over the stumps"
"beaten again, jagging away from a length. This changed ball is playing tricks. Comes in a tad and moves away, Buttler is left connecting with air as he tries to defend on the front foot"

"very full outside off, defended back down the pitch on the front foot"

"<b>through batsman and keeper</b> for four byes. Nice loop on that and Overton goes to drive it, but it drifts past the bat and spins in, beats Paine too"

"length on middle stump, tapped into the legside on the back foot"

"length on off, and Overton confidently forward to defend"
"<b>and the one that comes back in has done it!</b> But Overton wants to review the lbw. Oooh this might be  close thing on whether there was bat or not! Skilful bowling by Cummins, who had bowled fullish on off till now and got Overton defending confidently. This one was a bit shorter, and moved in sharply. The issues is the bat is hitting pad at the same time that the ball is going past, and all three are close together. But that doesn't matter because <b>impact was outside off!</b>.  Overton survives. Huge cheers around the ground."

"<b>rapped on the pads and the finger goes up!</b> Of course Overton will review, but I think he's a goner here. Length ball, nipping back in, don't think he read that, and it hits him on the knee roll, in front of the stumps. And it's three reds. <b>Australia will retain the Ashes</b>. It was a fantastic fight by Overton, and England, but Australia relentlessly kept at it and broke through in the last hour. What a match. What a finish."
