<b> saved by a full-length dive! </b> Cut this to cover point and took off for a single. Pandey was hesitant but he had no option but to complete the run. Both feet in the air as the bat landed inside the crease and dragged through. The grip was loose to ensure it didn't plonk up when the bails came off.
"slips this arm-ball on middle, Pandey plays outside the line to get a thick inside edge down to fine leg. Completely deceived but lucky"
this time he's much more solid in defence. Gets a long way forward and blocks

defended back to the bowler with the spin
"gets forward, opens his wrists nicely to square drive this to the deep point boundary. There was deep cover, so the next best option to get a boundary was if he hit it behind square and he did just that. Inspired batting this"
appeal for stumping but Pandey's backfoot just came back in the nick of time. It was briefly in the air. Credit to the bowler for drawing him forward and beating him in flight. Got this to spin away past the outside edge. Pandey was done in by the dip as well. The thing is Sri Lanka need to bowl these more regularly

didn't read that one at all. Fizzed through another flipper that Pandey had to really bring his bat down quickly to keep it out. Did so in the end
goes back into the crease and bunts this wide of cover to keep strike
"Oh, Pandey. What have you done? The stage was set for him to milk the runs, possibly a big score,  but what does he do? Attempts an ugly slog sweep that he has to fetch from outside off, ends up top-edging it to Tharanga who takes a dolly at midwicket. Some relief for Sri Lanka. A 99-run stand has been broken"

drifts in and spins away to squeeze to short point off the edge. The fielder ran in quickly and fired a wide throw to the keeper. No one backing up at square leg so an extra run ensures.

driven nicely but straight to Tharanga at cover. This was too full

"sharp turn away from outside off, Jadhav steers this behind point and scampers back for the second. Lazy fielding effort again from the Lankans"
how well does he play this? Once again goes back into the crease and uses the bowler's pace to glide this away into the gap between point and short third man. Vishwa Fernando had to run around a long way from square third man to stop that

"went for an expansive drive, played outside the line as the ball zipped through the inside-edge"
"works this away with the spin into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on, back for the second comfortably"

"tossed up on middle, he lunges forward and defends"
"nicely flighted, Jadhav waits for this to dip on him and then works this to midwicket"
"rocks back and pulls this into the gap at wide long-on. This skidded back in just a touch, he got it high on the bat. Not entirely off the middle and so he wasn't in complete control"
shapes to cut but misses. This one spun away little more than he anticipated
"slow turn, nice flight. Lands this on middle, Jadhav gets forward and defends"

"too short, but Jadhav can only smash this straight to deep point"
"drifts in a full ball on the stumps, squeezed back to the bowler"
