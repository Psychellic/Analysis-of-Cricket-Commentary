"<b>Is Maxwell out? Yes! </b> How unlucky would he have to be? It was full on middle stump, and Shaw drove it straight to Sandeep. The bowler managed to get fingertips to it, and it ricocheted onto his boots and then onto the stumps. Maxwell's too slow to react, and he's inches short of the ground."

"good length on off, and angling into his pads. Tapped towards deep midwicket on this occasion"
"full on leg, and that's been drilled to midwicket. A diving effort from the fielder there saves the single"

<strong>uppish but safe!</strong> This stopped on Pant as he looked to punch towards midwicket
"back of length outside off, he stands tall and punches to deep cover"

"lucky to get away with a <strong>juicy full toss</strong>, punched to long on"

"<b>yes, no, yes, no, out!</b> Full just on off, and he pushes the wrong'un towards the non-striker. Ojha wants to get off strike, but Pant chooses not to carry on after starting off. Ojha's stranded, and Rashid collects and throws at the batsman's end. Saha does the rest..."

"wrong'un! Outside off, and spinning into his pads. Flicked to the midwicket boundary"
"<b>big appeal!</b> And that's the slow finger of death. He's reviewing, but looks half-hearted. Was short on middle, and Pant just couldn't connect with the pull. The ball snuck under his bat, and hit his back leg. Looks kinda high though. Could miss the stumps, but alas! Would've clipped top of middle stump."
"overpitched on leg stump, and Christian pushes it into the gap in front of midwicket. He'll keep strike"
outside off and angling into the batsman. Mistimed towards cover

"slower ball, and short outside off. Checks his pull, but still manages to hit it well to the cow-corner boundary. Rashid is excellent in the deep"

"muscled to long off! But men patrolling the deep. Full outside off,and that was mistimed over Kaul's head"
"full and wide outside off, but Shankar gets his bat to ball and taps this towards point. Would've gone for four if it wasn't for Sandeep's diving effort near the 15-year circle"

"short outside off, and Bhuvi's also taken the pace off this. Christian flat-bats it over Shankar, but lands well short of long on"

<strong>beaten for pace!</strong> Shapes to pull from outside off but played too late.
"<strong>clever, very clever.</strong> Made room to slap this over point but Avesh cramped him for room. Hales now changes his stroke and uses the pace to help this wide of short third man."
"<b> Oh, dear. Maxwell! What have you done? </b> Will that prove to be the difference? Straight in, straight out at deep square leg. Avesh hits the deck hard again with this short ball, rushed onto Hales as he pulled from outside off, got more elevation than distance. Maxwell came running in, trembled and never looked like taking it as it descended. Gosh!"

"drags this pull from way outside off to square leg, no timing again."
"controls the pull to keep this all along the ground, down to deep square"

"oh, dear. Oversteps as he bowls this full delivery that is defended back. Huge roar around the ground as the umpire calls it a <b> freehit </b>"
"this has been clobbered deep into the stands at backward square leg. Sat up nicely, Dhawan swivelled back and allowed his wrists to create magic! The release shot. Will we see a different Dhawan from now?"
"another pull, this time he gets it high on the bat but manages to hit this wide of short fine leg"
"stunning! How quickly did he pick the length there? Fetched it from outside off and pull it imperiously in front of square. Bowled at 144kph, went to the ropes at 200. Delightful"
