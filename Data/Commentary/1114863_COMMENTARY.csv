even wristspin doesn't get anything from the surface. A short-pitched delivery on off stump is easily pushed to the left of cover
"pushes it through again, at 97 kph, and Patterson enjoys the chance to flick off the back foot in front of square leg"
"<b>direct hit</b> and the Gabba erupts. Nearly 35,000 people sense a run-out! But they all go 'oooooh' as replays show Steketee's throw from square leg isn't quite enough against big Buttler dive. Survives and will think again about nudging a single off his pads into that region."
"finally draws the batsman forward, on and around off stump, Patterson blocks to cover"
"<b>misfield</b> at backward square leg, but an equally big gaffe from Shadab, who keeps bowling fast and short. Ross allows the ball to get what it deserves"
"punches a quick, back of a length delivery towards extra cover"
"firm drive down the ground as Buttler stays exquisitely balanced at the crease. Steketee sends a probe out searching for swing, but there isn't any"
"<b>beaten</b>! There is absolutely no swing, but if the bowler hits the deck, there is some seam on offer. Buttler goes for the on-the-up cover drive and is done in by a bit of bounce and away movement"
"<b>leading edge</b>! He's trying to work a good length ball on off stump through wide mid-on, but finds himself into the shot too early. Only just escapes being caught and bowled as Steketee sticks out a left hand in his followthrough but can't reach far enough"
slices a shortish delivery t opoint
wide enough for him to free the arms and guide the back of a length delivery to deep third man
"gets forward for a firm defensive push, even if it comes off a closed face. Early signs that the pace on the pitch may not be as the batsman expects it to be"
"powerful hit over mid-off! And it didn't require any more effort than an extension of defence. Half-volley on off stump, lifts it away"
"comes down the track, wandering across his stumps, and flicks a back of a length delivery to square leg"
"swing into the left-hander, but it works in Patterson's favour as he clips it to deep square leg"
he's into the front foot push too early and the short of a length delivery holds in the pitch and rears up at the splice of the bat. Patterson finds a couple through midwicket
"shortish and outside off, he holds his shot a little longer this time and works it through midwicket. Neat use of the wrists"
"Buttler's happy to hang back in his crease - which is probably why the left-arm quick is targeting a good length and pushing the ball across towards the slips. Good plans, Buttler spoils them a bit with a middle-of-the-bat drill to cover"
"very full on middle, whips it to the left of mid-on. Again, timing not entirely perfect from Patterson"
"looks to bulldoze a back of a length ball down the ground, but there isn't quite the room he is looking for. Buttler making his intentions as plain as possible"
"launches it towards the long-off boundary - but it stops on the outfield, allowing the fielder Swepson o catch up with it and flick it back just as it seems to trickle to the rope. Fine shot from Buttler though, leaning forward and lifting the ball over the infield."
"wants to free the arms and pull it away down the ground, but again Steketee ties him up well with a short, rising delivery"
"full on off stump, Buttler walks into the flick to mid-on. He's itching to go big. But for all that intent, he's 10 off 14."
pulls a short and wide delivery out to deep midwicket. Slower ball doesn't allow him to get as much on it as he would've liked
"taken at deep midwicket, whilst the rain falls! Lovely bowling from Lalor. He changes his length with the batsman haring out of his crease, digs it in short and cramps him for room. Patterson goes for the pull, wanting to flap the ball away as far as he can. Only ends up finding one of the Heat's best fielders"
"lofts a good length ball outside off nearly all the way to the cover boundary. The only thing stopping it is <b>Baz flying through the air</b>, headlong at the rope, and yanking the ball back with inches to go. That's a scene that defined New Zealand's World Cup campaign in 2015"
"bouncer to the new batsman, and Watson is happy to avoid it"
"back of a length and just outside off, to keep the wide slip and a gully in play. Watson blocks to cover"
"goes for the pull and fetches himself a one-bounce four over wide mid-on. The ball isn't terribly short, but Watson is so strong on the pull shot. So instinctive with it"
"carves it through point! Bowling short (and wide) to him is like tickling a sleeping dragon. Hogwarts students are advised not to (remember the school seal?), perhaps Lalor needs to spend a year there."
"tosses it up outside off, belts it down to long-on"
brings his wrists into play and works a full delivery down to long-on
"<b>outside edge</b> down to short third man. Good work from Swepson, tossing the ball up, but keeping it a touch wide of the reach of batsmen who are clearly targeting him"
"good work from Buttler, shuffling across outside off to get closer to those widish deliveries. He's helped by the shorter length and sweeps it to deep square leg"
"nudges it off his pads to long leg. A bit of drift for legspinner, moving off the straight and into leg stump"
"feigns to make room, but Swepson isn't rattled by it. Delivers a simple legbreak outside off and concedes just a single through the covers"
"pushes it through down leg, Buttler does well with his feet, shifting back, opening his hips and giving himself the room to flick it away hard behind square"
"quick, short and angled into the body. Buttler pulls - concentrating on pure power and not getting any of what he wants - to deep square leg"
gets that big front stride going to flick a fuller delivery from outside off to long-on
drags the length short again and Buttler brings out the pull again
"113 kph - fast, short and outside off. Buttler's cut shot is a touch tardy"
"he's not looked in touch at all and he's missed a straight one now. That's the wrong 'un, doesn't look like Buttler picks it. He registeres the ball tossed up. He hopes it would give him the room to slog over wide long-on. Problem is, it angles into him, sneaks between bat and pad and crashes into middle and leg"
"gets down the track, but can't reach the pitch of the ball. Good work from Swepson to drag his length back and so Watson can only block"
"launches it to the left of deep midwicket and it carries all the way. That's absolutely muscled, got just enough width to free his arms, but does all the rest of the work - lunging forward to get to the pitch of the ball - himself"
rocks back and pulls the short ball - it was bound to be - through midwicket. Watson going well.
clips a shortish delivery to short fine leg
"picks the gap between point and short third man! Gorgeous shot - because it's the result of his picking the short ball early, rocking back quickly and playing late enough to find a very small hole in the field"
"that's brutal! Fast bowlers shouldn't drag it down, so what chance does a legspinner have? Watson pummels the long hop over deep midwicket"
brings the bottom hand into play to try and whip a good length ball outside off to long-on. No luck
works a flatter delivery off middle to deep midwicket
"sweeps off middle! That's ridiculously risky against a bowler known to skid through, instead of spin the legbreak. Watson though seems to be in good enough form that he hits the ball off the sweet spot"
"wrong 'un goes horribly wrong! It's short. It's a mile down leg and Watson pulls off the back foot to the long leg boundary. <b>He's 36 off only 15, at a strike-rate of 228</b>"
brings him forward with a 112 kph delivery on a good length outside off. Watson chips it to long-off
"quick, short and no room. Ferguson goes for the cut, instinct forcing him into the shot as soon as he spots the length. But all he can manage is an inside edge"
"short and outside off, cuts to the sweeper"
"pulls a back of a length delivery to mid-on, because it keeps a touch lower than Ferguson originally thought"
clips a shortish delivery through to deep midwicket
tailing into the pads but Ferguson can't quite put it away. Has to settle for a single through square leg. Seemed as though Doggett rushed him for pace
overpitched delivery outside off and Watson drives looking like a boss to mid-off
swivels on the back foot as he pulls the 134 kph short ball to long leg.
leans on his front foot and whips a full delivery from outside off to deep square leg.
"picks the slower ball and, with it being short and wide, cuts it away to the sweeper on the boundary"
"back of a length and outside off, cuts to the sweeper"
"slogs a slower delivery out to the long-on boundary/ That's not really the best work from Swepson, who gets across to his right, catches up with the ball, tries to slap it back onto the playing area but misses"
"another slower ball, banged into the pitch. Watson loads up with the pull but he's way too early with the shot. His mind registers how the ball is banged into the pitch, doesn't quite realise it's pace has been taken off"
"another slower ball bouncer - a 120 kph delivery that skirts over Watson's gloves as he goes for a pull and, tonight, for once looks, he ungainly doing so"
gloves a bouncer sliding into his body out to the long leg boundary. Great reward for beating the batsman with pace. #Hmpf
"looks for the yorker, and it tails into the right-hander too, late enough that Ferguson is rushed into presenting a straight bat."
"<b>that's his fifty, off only 25 balls. it's second of the season as well</B>. Raises his bat to a pretty appreciative crowd (he's a Queensland boy, remember) after slicing a full and wide delivery down to third man"
"full and outside off, he looks to flay it away over cover but is done in for pace"
"back of a length slower ball outside off, chops it to deep third man"
smacks a shortish delivery outside off to the sweeper
"slower delivery outside off, slaps it to the sweeper"
"manages to reach out to the full and wide delivery - after he is setting up to make room outside leg - and carves it to the left of the sweeper cover. Decides, rather late, to pinch a second and a bad throw allows him to do so"
beats him by the lack of pace as Watson is thoroughly miffed that he misses a good length ball giving him all the room he wants to free the arms
"full and wide - he strays a little too far, actually. Watson looks for the biff over cover and there is no way he can connect with that"
"full and outside off, swats it to long-off"
"full toss, outside off, flat-bats it to deep cover - also, it's been called <b>a no-ball for height</b>."
"bouncer, and it looks an outstandingly fast delivery. It's not often that Watson is beaten for pace while going for a pull. And he is now. Gets a bit of a glove to the wicketkeeper, who leaps to his left, as high as he possibly could, to stop a boundary. But, if this had been a legal delivery, that would have been the catch of the tournament"
whips it down to long-on
"loops it up outside off, Watson launches it over extra cover.... there's a man theeeere, but it falls well short"
"fast, flat wrong 'un on the stumps, Ferguson pulls it away to deep backward square leg"
"taken at long-off! For the longest time, it seems like Watson has placed the ball well enough to get a boundary. He certianly hit it hard enough. One of his best shots of the night really. Except Burns runs quickly to his left, eyes on the ball, reverse cup coming out at the perfect time to snap the ball up. Shadab does the trick."
whips a shortish delivery out to deep midwicket
"clips a short, quick ball through to deep midwicket"
turns a full delivery outside leg to deep square leg
"slower ball on middle, sent packing to deep square leg"
"smacks it to the long-off boundary. Sensational stuff. He's deep in his crease, happy to have that extra bit of time against a quick bowler. And is helped also by the ball being length and outside off so he can get under it. Flat-batted flay of the highest order."
"pings the bowler on his right foot, and Doggett's probably saved a boundary. Spots the slower delivery, waits in his stance and belts the ball down the ground like he holds a grudge with it"
"full and outside off, gets a thick outside edge to third man"
"pulls, off the front foot mostly, down to long leg. Not the easiest thing to pull off against a ball coming for your head"
looks for the blockhole from around the wicket. Ferguson comes charging at the bowler and slaps it to mid-off
"<b>dropped</b> at deep midwicket! Doggett is the man there on the boundary, and he misjudges the pace at which the ball has been hit because Ferguson's absolutely nailed the slog sweep. The fielder would have taken it if he hadn't run in so quickly"
"shortish and outside off, chops it towards point"
"seems to pick the wrong 'un and gently tips it over the cover field. Super timing. If Buttler spent all his innings searching for power, Rohrer's come out concentrating on simply meeting the ball and picking the gap"
"goes for the reverse sweep, and he mistimes it towards short fine leg. Lynn is the man down there, sending the ball back with his left arm. The right's got those shoulder problems"
hacks it out to deep square leg
"slog sweeps it away, and it's a mighty hit towards the deep midwicket boundary but Alex Ross, with a brilliant dive to his left, intervenes. Top stuff."
"full, slow and too far outside off to interest the batsman."
"slower ball, drags it down, and Ferguson has absolutely muscled it to the midwicket boundary. This is a really good innings from the new recruit."
"<b>he's hit Rohrer in the neck/chest area</b>. He goes down straight away, then seems to realise he's out of his crease and has the wherewithal to get back in. Visuals show him standing up now, while the doctor checks on him. Ferguson's right beside him, having caused all the problems with a brutal hit down the ground, trying to take advantage of a wide half-volley"
"caught by Lynn running to his right from midwicket. Excellent bowling from Lalor, going short, getting it to clumb up towards his chin, cramping the batsman for room and it's all tied up by the fact he's beat the batsman for pace. Ferguson goes for a pull and only manages a top edge"
"full toss outside off, plonks it down to long-on"
"slower ball, outside off, misses the cut, but pinches an extra run in addition to a wide. Good call from Rohrer at the non-strikers'"
"full toss down leg, Rohrer deflects it fine to long leg"
"wide yorker outside off, glides it to short third man"
a gift - short and wide down leg from around the wicket - that Peirson spurns as he hits a pull straight to square leg
"<B>extra bounce</b> as a good length ball holds in the pitch and leaps up, forcing Peirson to soften the grip on his bat as he looks to push to cover"
"good length ball outside off, Peirson shapes to hit to cover again and misses"
"full and at the stumps, Peirson looks to flick it through midwicket, but gets a leading edge to cover instead"
calmly nudges a full delivery on middle to long-on
hangs back to punch a shortish delivery on leg stump to long-on
"134 kph, starts with a fast, wide one down leg. Peirson won't be worried by those. <b>Hints of swing though</b>"
slashes a short delivery outside off to point. Should really have picked the gap considering the freedom given to him there from McClenaghan
<b>pins him on the thigh</B> as he goes for the pull and is deceived by the pace it seems to gain off the pitch. Also keeps a touch lower than he expects
sways back and ramps a short delivery outside off to third man. This pitch doesn't look very straightforward for strokeplay. 151 might well be a pretty good target
goes for the cut and gets it off the inside part of the bat to the third man boundary
"134 kph yorker on middle, McCullum digs it out. That's not too far from the ball Mitchell Starc bowled at the MCG a couple years ago"
"<b>bowls him</b> with the slower ball! What a ball! What a wicket! McCullum is not ready for the offcutter, he's coming onto the front foot, searching for the ball which pitches just in front of him but a lot later than he expects it to. Then, it breaks sharply off the pitch to crash into off stump. Mean delivery."
"back of a length and outside off, punches it to point"
cuts over point - has the room to do so and absolutely loves it. Fast hands. Still base.
swivels on the back foot as he pulls the short ball in front of square. Mid-on chases it down
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"fullish on off stump, defends for a quick single to mid-off"
"he's not played a match since the IPL in May and he vents all of that frustration the first ball he gets. Bang, through the covers"
shapes to slice the short delivery through point but it's too close to his body to pull off
"slower ball on middle, Peirson looks to go after it, but only ends up with an inside edge to long leg"
full and outside off - too far to bother the batsman. But the plan is clear - hide the ball from his hitting range
bouncer - gains too much height this time. Lynn's presence is making the bowlers overthink
booming drive to the right of mid-off and Patterson's saved a boundary. Slower ball from McClenaghan there
that's into the crowd at deep midwicket! He said he was okay for last game for the Heat. And he's showing whoever made that decision what he thinks of it. Takes a length ball - a slower ball - and slogs it to oblivion
"inside edge to the long leg boundary. Lynn, once again, clears the front leg, looking for long-on. But he won't mind looking a bit silly if it fetches his team a boundary"
full and down leg - McClenaghan is spooked! He's into his eighth ball of the over
Lynnsanity's hit the Gabba! It's certainly hit McClenaghan who offers a short and wide delivery for the batsman to lash over extra cover
nudges a full length delivery on leg stump back at the bowler. Green coming from around the wicket
<b>dropped</b> by the bowler! Peirson is trying to whip a full delivery on middle through the leg side but pops out a leading edge. Green sets himself in position with reverse cup but it bursts through his hands
"smears it to deep cover! Great footwork to jump away outside leg, which allows him to hit a ball on middle and leg through that packed off side infield. Six balls faced, five of them have been hit to the boundary!"
"for a second, it seems like he's been caught in the wrong position. A good length delivery that skids through towards off stump - looks set to take it too with Lynn making way too much room outside leg. Then suddenly out comes the middle of the bat and he glides it easily down to third man"
works it down to long-on
""
"<b>picks out deep midwicket</b> and Watsons roars in pure vindication after sending down the back of a length delivery that does the trick. It's a bit slow. It is hit away powerfully, brutally, but there's a man there and he takes a very simple catch."
""
"slower, short ball on off stump, Burns pulls to deep midwicket"
gets struck on the thigh as the ball holds on the pitch on off stump and decks away enough to beat the closed face of the bat. Peirson's struggling
pulls a short ball outside off to deep square leg
"<b>slower bouncer</b> which deceives Peirson. The length triggers the instinct to pull before he realises it's the change of pace. By the time he adjusts, he's beaten. Great over from the captain."
"looks to sweep, but there's just enough turn for Fawad Ahmed to beat the horizontal bat and hit the thigh"
gets back and across to flick a good length ball from off stump to deep midwicket
"that's well bowled. He keeps the trajectory flat - which forces Peirson to stay in his crease. But the length is full. Good tactic for lbws, but this time he gets the middle of the bat"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to deep point"
whips a flatter delivery on off stump to long-on
"googly, which he reads off the pitch and pulls to deep square leg"
"sweet shot to the backward square boundary. Probably the sweetest strike of his night, as he stays back in his crease, swivels and simply helps the short ball away"
"good length ball, pushed towards long-on"
nudges a length ball off his pads to long leg
glances a short delivery heading down leg away to long leg
pulls a shortish delivery outside off to deep square leg
"good bouncer, coming up to his head. Burns gets the pull shot going and nails it well enough to give Green some trouble at deep square leg. Saves a couple"
"belts a full delivery outside off back at the bowler. Good fielding from Nair, getting down in his followthrough"
"races down the pitch, but Nair doesn't let him get under the ball enough to power it away. Doesn't even leave the pitch"
looks to launch a good length ball outside off over cover. But he's beaten all ends up.
"shortish and outside off, cuts to point"
"that's super work. He decides to wait on the ball, rather than look for it, and as a result of that he's in better position the short-arm jab the short one away to the right of deep midwicket"
cuts between point and short third man. Heat are getting a move on! Although this time they've got a little help from Nair bowling short and wide
"shapes to sweep, but the ball is too full for him to get properly down on one knee. So he simply goes into the shot with his hands, standing upright and powering it away to the long leg boundary"
"shortish and on middle, Burns flicks it to deep midwicket"
slogs a well flighted delivery outside off to long-on
"looks for the slog sweep, but Fawad gets the ball to dip at the worst moment for Burns, who can only inside edge it"
sends it into the crowd behind long-on! Superb hit! He sees this lob up over his eyeline and swings right through it. Relies on timing and reaps the maximum reward
"picks the gap again, to the left of extra cover, for a couple. he's got 17 runs off his last five"
works a tossed up delivery to long-on
"sets up deep in his crease to get under the good length ball outside off. But he may have overdone it and the pull shot finds long-on perfectly. Nair strikes, pressure rises."
"full and outside off, drives to cover"
"fine sweep, taking the ball from a length outside off to deep square leg. Gets right on top of the ball and rolls his wrists to keep it down"
pushes it through and the ball goes through straight. Burns carves it to backward point
"good length ball just outside off, Cutting defends, although he doesn't seem to read the turn well"
slog sweeps a length ball on off stump out to deep midwicket
"that's high, square leg is running in, can he make it? Noooo! This is the wicket they were looking for, they were planning for. Ferguson, on the mic, just said he was hoping for a top-edged sweep and here it is. Patterson runs in from the long leg boundary - perhaps a touch later than he should - as it falls short of him"
flicks a full delivery on middle to deep midwicket
"<b>falls short</b> of the man at long-on! Gibson the man racing towards the ball, after starting a touch late, putting in the big dive but can't quite make up the time he lost a second or so earlier. Targeting that long boundary doesn't really seem like the best option"
sweeps it out to deep square leg
""
sweeps the ball - taking it on the full from outside off - to long leg
"good work from the bowler, getting down to intercept a hard hit drive from Burns"
whips a full delivery on off stump out to long-on
drives on the up to long-off
"shimmies down the pitch for a little dink through midwicket. And with everyone in the vicinity on the boundary, that's an easy two"
works a shortish delivery through midwicket again and they pinch a couple one more time. Seems Heat have decided to milk the spinners and take their chances against pace bowling
"takes the pressure catch does the captain! It's a full toss outside off, Cutting, the danger man, gets it off the toe of the bat, and skies it to point. Good plans - keeping the ball away from the reach of the big-hitter"
"looks for the blockhole, and though he doesn't quite find it, Burns is only able to plink it down to mid-off"
"full on off stump, whips it to long-on"
"full and outside off, spears it to deep cover"
"short and outside off, pulls it to long-on"
"top edge runs away to the long leg boundary and the Gabba roars. Poor McClenaghan. He does his bit to beat the batsman for pace, looking to bounce him out. Ross flaps at it and gets away with a timely four"
gets down the track and drives to cover
sweeps a length ball that strays down leg. Can't beat short fine leg
"backs away, but the very slow delivery on off stump, dips at the last second and ruins with Ross' slash."
gets down the track and whips it away out to deep square leg
"low full toss on middle, which Burns slogs to deep midwicket"
"is that the clincher? The man in form shows off just as the pressure seems to mount too high! It's the last ball of the over, it's tossed up, on leg stump and Ross races down the track to launch the ball over long-on. Miles over long-on"
"It's not that much, says McClenaghan as the ball wanders past the wide line. The only reason for that is because Burns shuffles outside off and so the bowler shifts the line away beyond his reach. That's a tough call from the umpire"
"full toss outside off, carves it to deep third man. Burns has a strike rate of 124 - he's hit only one boundary"
"full toss outside off, bunts it back at the bowler. Thunder doing beautifully, especially when it comes to their fielding. McClenaghan leaps up to stop any runs"
"top edge goes straight up, but it lands well beyond the reach of the three men chasing after it. Wicketkeeper, short fine leg and third man all vie for it. To no avail. Another of the bouncers - a sharp one - that gives the bowler only grief"
mistimes the drive to mid-off
gets across to spear a full delivery outside off to deep cover
"It's Ross again who makes the last ball of the over disappear! Happy, by Pharrell Williams blares out to the a crowd that is more than that after watching a full delivery outside off being launched over long-on"
"wanders away outside off to try and scoop the near yorker away to the long leg boundary. But the ball is too full to do so and because Burns moves away from his usual stance, the umpire this time doesn't call a wide"
"he finally strikes one the way he wants to and the ball soars away to the midwicket boundary. He's faced 31 balls, he's not timed any of them. But when the match is on the line, he shifts back and across, and from deep in his crease, slogs it into the stands"
goes around the wicket and delivers a slower ball that beats the right-hander's big swing
"good length from around the wicket on off stump, Burns works it towards midwicket"
"<B>dropped</b> by the deep square leg fielder who is too far inside the boundary and Ross takes the Heat home. A man demoted because someone thought he didn't have the power for this sort of hitting seals the game and sets the record straight. Ross has been in form, and that's immensely valuable in T20 cricket. Not that he needs much of a leg up when it's a full toss on leg stump. Helps it away with a short-arm flick. The fact that it was only a short-arm flick is what makes Blizzard the substitute race in to try and take a catch. Instead, he ends up having to leap up and stretch back and ends up spilling the chance"
