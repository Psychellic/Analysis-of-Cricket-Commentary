This is full and gets it to shape away a touch, Rahul enticed to drive, no feet movement and ends up getting a thick edge that has been superbly taken by Finch with his fingers pointing upwards. Rahul's second Australia tour has started quite poorly, and to a poor stroke."

"<strong>loose, very loose and gone! Suckerpunched.</strong> It's the length that has done the trick. Bowled short, short and then slanted this full and across. Vijay is enticed into the drive but this is way too quick for him at 145kph, didn't come back as much as Vijay would've liked, tickled through to Tim Paine"

He's done in by a hint of extra bounce.

Screamer, absolute screamer and India are in trouble or what."

Pujara caught just short. The end of a quality innings. Just about the only way they could get him"
"would you believe it? He's gloved an absolute shocker of a short ball down leg to Paine. Asking to be hit, any bit of bat on that would've been enough to get a boundary. India bowled out for 250. Shami just doesn't know to put a price tag on his wicket."

It hit the back leg outside the line but no shot means it still can be out. Ball tracking says ... hitting. Out!

Presses forward to one that is nicely tossed up, there's enough turn and bounce off the deck to lob off the pad, then a bit of glove? Doesn't look like on replay. Pant grabs the lob. Spring in India's steps as <b> they walk off for tea. </b> Could he have reviewed? Possibly, because replays don't conclusively prove there was a glove.
