"length ball straightening on off stump, defended"

"flighted, spinning away and chopped into a gap off the back foot for a single"
"struck on the pads, done by the googly... Not given by umpire Shaun George but South Africa call for the <b>review</b>. Looks like he played his front pad with his bat, which meant a little gap opened up for the ball to slide through and hit the thigh. Definitely no bat involved but could be a touch leg side... Yep, bouncing high and wide of leg stump, so Sandakan survives"
"not for long, though! George's finger goes up immediately but Sandakan <b>reviews</b> this time... He went back to cut but the ball clearly brushed the pad flap first, right in front of middle and that is going to be out! Tahir finishes it off to give South Africa a 121-run victory"
