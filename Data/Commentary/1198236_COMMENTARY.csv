"nice zippy opening delivery, good length outside off, Warner allows it to go through"
"<b>what a brute!</b> This climbs from back of a length, Warner has to jump out of the line as it carries at head height to Buttler"
"given caught behind, and Warner has <strong>reviewed</strong> straight away! He made the call in the instant he was given. Another cracking delivery, short of a length, nips back at Warner and beats the inside edge, but the replay shows that glanced the glove!"
"Archer is flying, keeps it short of a length and this rises through to Buttler as Carey stays inside the line"
"<b>beaten again!</b> 91mph, fuller outside off, Carey is caught a little flat-footed as he reaches out to drive"
"<b>missed run out chance!</b> Short of a length, dropped square into the off side, there's all sorts of confusion between the batsmen. Moeen comes in from gully, can't quite underarm it into the stumps"

"fuller at middle and leg, <strong>92mph/148kph</strong>, aims to whip it through the leg side but it deflects off the pads towards point"
"top edged hook! A short ball on leg stump, gets underneath it but falls short of long leg...not much out of the middle so far"
"good length at the stumps, flicked backward of square and Rashid tumbles down to make the save at short fine leg. Almost done by a bobble off the outfield"
"<B>edged, caught behind!</b> What a start from England. Carey tries to give himself a touch of room to the leg side, shapes a drive at a good-length delivery but can only get a thin nick to Buttler"
"full outside off, 89mph/144kph, plinks a drive into the covers"
<B>lovely delivery</b> as Finch is caught on the crease against a good-length ball outside off and it zips past the outside edge. That was <b>95.8mph / 154.2kph!</b>
"<B>all the way!</b> Takes on the short ball, gets well underneath this pick-up pull off his hip. For a second it looked like it might find the man at deep square but it was well back"
<b>what a comeback!</b> That's a <strong>91mph/146kph leg-cutter</strong> which scorchers past the outside edge
"92mph/148kph, Finch is hurried into a forward push that finds cover"
nips back off a good length and strikes Finch a painful blow off the bottom hand

"nicely timed, short of a length outside off, punched through the covers for a brace"
"misfield gives Smith a boundary, short of a length, he shovels a pull through square leg and the deep fielder can't cut it off"
"gets squared up this time, back of a length, played into midwicket"
"<b>that's a cracker!</b> Jags away from back of a length, beats the outside edge and carries nicely. Something in this pitch"
"<b>clears deep square leg!</b> Terrific pull shot by Smith, the delivery wasn't that short, just back of a length and swung away"
"played back down the pitch, was aiming into midwicket"
"<strong>run out with a direct hit!</strong> Brilliant work from Eoin Morgan. Pushed towards mid-on, the captain quickly in and an underarm into the stumps. Smith well short"
"back of a length at off stump, defended"
"touch shorter, pushed firmly square into the off side"
"<strong>just wide of a diving Buttler! </strong>Angled into the pads, glanced off the face of the bat and not that far from the big dive"
"nice piece of timing, but mid-on could have done better...leans forward and times the on-drive, Curran dives over it"
"inswinging yorker at off stump, 94mph/151kph, jabbed into the covers"
"doesn't really time this pull, sends it into square leg"
"very full outside off, driven to long-off"
"quicker, flatter at leg stump, pushed to the off side...out of the front from Rashid"
"big appeal for lbw from Buttler as Stoinis presses forward, certainly came off the bat in the end. And England have <strong>reviewed</strong>! Ha, he couldn't have middled that any better. Not one of the better reviews. Even Buttler has a laugh"
"full at off stump, driven down the ground"
"a little shorter, played off the back foot to the bowler"
"almost pops this up to cover, the ball grips and sticks in the surface, pushes with hard hands to the off side"
"good start, on a length at middle and off, pushed into the covers"
<strong>that's a strong shot!</strong> A fraction short from Jordan and Stoinis latches on with a dismissive pull in front of square
"pushes this up further, punched off the back foot back to Jordan"
"more good work by the captain, diving to his left at cover to intercept a drive"
"on the pads, worked through midwicket where Bairstow collects in the deep"
"cloths this lofted drive, but manages to clear mid-off on the edge of the ring. A slower ball from Jordan and Stoinis was through his shot"
"very full, wide outside off, swung down to long-on as he swings across the line"
"full toss wide outside off, driven very firmly at cover and this has done some damage to Morgan. Looks like a finger on his right hand. Maybe a dislocation? Physio is straight out there"

"fuller at the stumps, a quicker delivery, defended"
"goes for the sweep, deflects off his pad and it isn't far from bobbling into leg stump"

floated up and driven through the off side
"Rashid's googly beats Stoinis on the inside - umpire Burns says no! Maybe outside the line, Stoinis completely foxed there, he's been done that way before... but no review from England. <b>Hawk-Eye says it was bouncing over leg stump</b>"
"back of a length, 80mph/129kph and Finch taps it down defensively"
"<b>swatted over backward square leg!</b> Picked up and he finds the gap, using Jordan's pace and incoming angle to good effect"
"half an appeal, Finch struck on the pads playing back, runs away for one"
"full on off, Stoinis crunches up and over,<i> almost </i>carries all the way to long-on running in"
"slower ball, Finch didn't seem to pick it but managed to adjust, <b>heaved through backward square again!</b> Lost his shape but managed to hoick four more"
"<b>dragged on!</b> Short ball, coming back in at pace, Finch seems surprised by it and can only chop down into his timbers! Jordan roars in celebration, that's a big breakthrough, with Australia rebuilding nicely"
<b>lummoxed over long-off!</b> Doesn't matter about picking 'em if you get to the pitch and hit that sweetly through the line!
floated up and dinked through mid-off
"googly, comes back and Maxwell isn't in a position to play it, gloves the ball down"
tossed up on leg stump and he nurdles his first run into a gap at midwicket
"full, wide of the stumps, tempting Stoinis out and he chips up and over cover towards the sweeper"
"<b>steered to slip</b>, Rashid again finishes his spell with a wicket! Stoinis hangs his head but that was indicative of his struggles against spin... hung back, spotted too late that it was a big-turning legbreak, could only watch in horror as he directed it straight to Malan, diving to his right"
shortish and tucked to the leg side
"round the wicket, back of a length and Agar prods it back to the bowler"
"bit of width on offer, 82mph/132kph and this is chopped through the covers to the sweper"
angling in with the arm and worked through square leg
"round the wicket, speared in at<b> 90mph/145kph</b>, draws a waft play-and-miss from Agar"
"short ball, 89mph on the hip and Agar nudges to midwicket for one"

"over the wicket, worked off the stumps to leg"

"pushed through outside off, Maxwell opens the face and steers one square"
"length ball, 81mph/130kph and Maxwell clips through midwikcet, comes back for two"
"skidding on outside off, 82mph and he opens the face, guides straight to short third man for one"

"pitched up, 88mph/141kph attempted yorker and Maxi digs it out through cover for one to keep the strike"

"flung down full and wide of the stumps at <b>93mph/149kph</b> and Maxwell can only jam one to deep point, a bellow of frustration audible on the stump mic"

"spears in the yorker, <b>pace up at 91mph/147kph</b> and Agar can't do anything but keep it out"

"full on the stumps, 84mph and drilled to long-on for just a single"
"yorker length, 89mph and wide of the stumps, <b>bullocked through extra by Maxwell!</b> Such power, should have been tough to hit, but he forces it away through the infield, beats the man out, too"
"heaves at a length ball, <b>nicked to the keeper!</b> Unusual dismissal at this stage of the innings, but it'll work for England... Jordan hitting that hard length again, as he did at the death on Friday, and Maxwell is too leg side as he swings for the hills and edges through. Was seeing it well, but that's going to dent Australia's hopes of getting 150"
pitched up and dinked into the covers for a single
"<b>slugged down the ground</b>, 90mph/145kph and he uses that pace, thumping a half-volley fine of Moeen at long-on!"

"90mph yorker outside off as Agar comes across, hits him on the boot and ricochets to short third man"
"slower ball, short outside off... and called wide on height. Looked tight from side on. May have been a knuckle ball bouncer?"
"length ball, <b>Cummins top-edges it over short third man!</b> Rashid turns and givers chase but this will run away"
"Woof! <b>Smoked down the ground!</b> Cummins sets himself and thrashes another length ball back over the bowler's head... Shot, sir"
"sprays this down the leg side, Buttler can't grab it cleanly... more extras in the over, Archer not enjoying this quite so much now"
"goes back to basics, nails the <b>92mph/148kph</b> yorker... and then runs Agar out as he comes looking for the single! He made an instinctive move out of his crease, even as the ball went straight back to the bowler. Archer dismissively pings the stumps, but this has been a good over for Australia"
"fullish length, 91mph and Starc hacks across the line, gets a thick inside edge, and they'll scamper two to finish an 18-run over. How crucial will that be?"
"over the wicket, short of a length, played with a straight bat and it runs off a thick inside edge to the leg side"
"huge appeal for lbw! Full, swings in at leg stump, probably doing too much as Bairstow plays across the line but Finch has called the <strong>review</strong>. Takes the back leg in the end. Yep, missing leg stump. Umpires' call on impact as well for what it's worth"

"<strong>great shot! </strong>Moves to the leg side again and this time plays to the off, threads the covers with a wonderfully crisp drive"
"<strong>big appeal for lbw!</strong> Fantastic yorker, knocks Buttler off his feet, but no review this time. Right on the boot, missing leg stump"

"tries again, but loses his shape this time, the bottom hand drags this into the leg side"
"a straight full toss, 90mph/145kph, driven to the covers"
"<strong>he's hit his own stumps! Out hit wicket</strong>. Was a quick short ball outside off, Bairstow was beaten as he went for the pull and as his bat swung around from the shot it tapped leg stump. Odd way to go, big wicket for Australia"

"latches on with the pull this time, short of a length and he whips it through midwicket off one leg"
"full and straight, flicked in the air over the square leg straight to the deep man"
"short outside leg stump, poor ball, Buttler manages to catch up with it with a toe-ended pull wide of short fine leg...good over in the end for England"
