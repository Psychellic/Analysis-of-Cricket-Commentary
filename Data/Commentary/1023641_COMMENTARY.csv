"<strong>What a relay catch</strong>! Turner runs to his right from long-off, pouches the ball with both hands. But the momentum carries him over the ropes at the straight boundary. He is wary of it and hence tosses it back into the field of play, looking at Bresnan running in to his left from long-on. Bresnan now hangs onto the chest-high chance. Was Turner's foot in contact with the rope while he was collecting the ball? The replays aren't conclusive enough, I suppose. Quite difficult to judge from this. Bailey waits; he isn't going anywhere. But, Mealey, the TV umpire, rules Bailey out. Excellent awareness from the two fielders, nevertheless. Bailey runs down the track, attempts a loft and falls. The ball dipped creating some distance between the bat and the pitch."
