"starts off with a length ball sliding down leg, looked like it clipped Hafeez's pad on the way through to wade. Umpire didn't hear something. Rough call, Pakistan are away"
"beauty! Draws him forward by bowling this full outside off, the ball nips away to beat the edge by a whisker. That just zipped through"
"too full, Hafeez gets forward and tentatively pushes it to the point fielder. May have found the gap had he tried to play it with a lot more authority. Was just feeling bat on ball there"
"in the lovely off stump channel, invites the drive but Hafeez lets it go. Some away movement and carry. Wade takes this sideways near the face"
"bowls this full and jags this one off the deck from outside off, Hafeez shoulders arms"
"gentle tap off the front foot to the man coming in from cover, just looked up, eye contact with his partner and they were off for the run. Excellent call from Hafeez"
hops back into the crease and blocks the length ball on middle first up
"too full and shaping away from off, eased into the gap between cover and mid-off"
"gets this to shape away, but too short and angled past the sixth stump or so, Sharjeel leaves and the keeper collects it on the bounce"
"beaten by a ripper! Short of length but there's steep bounce, Sharjeel pokes and misses by one that slants across at an angle he doesn't really want to be facing"
"thumped down the ground past mid-on. Too full and Sharjeel, who was camping inside the crease, crashed it. Not quite off the middle but still got enough on it"
just short of square leg. This one's Sharjeel's trademark one-legged whip off his hip. Lucky for him that it didn't carry to Handscomb
"sees this in his arc and lofts this over cover, far from the middle. The timing was off but he just managed to hit this over the infield for a couple"
"tucks him up with an indipper that hits him high on the thigh pad, or perhaps near the box. Played outside the line on that occasion"
"wrong line. Too full and angling down leg, Hafeez looks to tickle it fine but manages to get some pad alright, and that's enough. No chance for Wade on the dive"
"short ball on middle, Hafeez ducks under it. Whizzes through to Wade"
"swung this one a bit too far. Flirting with the wide line. Hafeez shoulders arms, fair call from the umpire"
"moves this one away from outside off, this one's just inside the wide line. Hafeez watches this through to the keeper"
"full and swinging away from middle this time, Hafeez gets half forward and taps it gently"
"lovely square drive, opened the face of the bat late to ease it behind point. Third man comes around to cut that off"
whipped past the diving midwicket fielder. Picked the length early and went back into the crease to make that shot possible
"pushes hard at a length ball on middle, gets a thick inside edge to the leg side"
"pulled, and pulled imperiously. Plenty of wood on that as it sails over square leg. Too short. Sharjeel had already decided he'd go through and he executed it well too. Super timing!"
"draws the edge this time, and third man can't get there. Handy runs for Sharjeel, frustration for Stanlake. This was a gentle push, and it just raced off the bat past second slip"
"cracking shot, between cover and point. Too full, Sharjeel leans forward and slices this up and over the infield. This should get Australia thinking. The intent is right from Sharjeel"
"wristy whip wide of mid-on. Not all that full, but Sharjeel went through with the stroke and found the gap even though he didn't time it as well as he would have liked"
"there's the first wicket and it's plumb. Hafeez slaps his pad in disappointment. He plays all around a full incoming delivery on middle and misses. Hazlewood didn't even bother appealing till very late because he knew Hafeez was stone dead there. Respite for Australia after a pulsating start. Hafeez fell over and when he did so, the leg stump was visible. An umpire needs no more proof"
gets forward and defends solidly to cover
"slips a short ball in but this was down leg side, Azam looks away as he ducks. Hazlewood can't believe that has been called wide."
"crunching square drive, that is isn't four is only because of Faulkner's athleticism. Runs around from third man, at least 20 yards, before dishing in a full stretch dive to cut that off"
"firm drive down to mid-on, not all that full but he offered the full face of the bat nonetheless"
quality stroke from a quality batsman. Not a leg stump half volley by any means. This was length on middle but Azam brings his wrists into play to punch that into the gap at midwicket. All class
gets forward and pushes this to mid-off
"crashed to point, Maxwell leaps high to effect a one-handed stop. Saved four runs"
"beaten by a ripper. Gets this to jag away ever-so-slightly from length on middle, Sharjeel plays with an angled bat, didn't miss the edge by much"
"looks to whip this off his hip but the ball hits him off the top edge on the grille off the helmet. Ouch, he's checking to see if his visor is okay."
slashes and misses. Was too full for him to try that stroke
"too short and way down leg, umpire reckons it was inside the wide line. Not too sure, Stanlake gets away"
"waist-high full toss outside off, Sharjeel looks to slap this past cover, hits it off the toe end to mid-off instead. Two poor deliveries and he's gotten away this time"
"good length delivery on off stump, Azam plants his foot forward and defends solidly to the off side"
"half shout for lbw, but this was an instinctive reaction. The ball was angling into middle and leg, hit him high on the thigh pad"
"uppish but safe. Looks like the bat face turned in his hand as he looked to drive, between point and gully. Third man comes around to cut that off. This is the 'in-between' length that makes Hazlewood dangerous"
rip roaring bouncer out of frustration perhaps. Azam comfortably ducks under it
solidly behind the line of that incoming short of length delivery
"this is a beauty! Swerves away late, Azam was drawn into the drive and is lucky the delivery was too good to find the edge. Wow, cracking stuff this."
gets on top of the bounce and works it off his hip to deep square leg
"floats this full on off from wide of the crease, eased to mid-on"
plants his front foot forward and drives through the line to cover
"too short and way over the batsman's head, Azam ducks under it again"
"short of length delivery outside off, left alone. This one touches 145.6kph"
"this is angled full and into the batsman from wide of the crease, Azam looks to work it leg side and has been <b> saved by a thick inside edge. </b> The impact was in line and would have gone on to hit if not for an inside edge."
"hustled for pace as he goes back to whip it away, deflects off the thigh pad to the leg side and they steal a leg bye"
"play and a miss. Looks for an expansive cut, and when he decided to pull out, the ball had already passed the bat. High 140s again, this time from Cummins"
firm push but can't beat mid-on there. Hazlewood does well
"not too full for the cut, chops it to point"
plants forward confidently and defends the length ball to the off side
"in two minds again. Not sure whether to play or leave, goes for it and then pulls out, but it was too late again. The ball had already passed the bat"
"whipped to deep square. Short of length delivery on middle, he was onto his toes to play that"
"stands tall to punch, gets a thick outside edge to third man"
"short ball at 143.9 clicks, but well down the leg side. Once again he's gotten away with it.<b> That was a big wide, says Waqar on air. He's spot on. </b>"
"did the edge carry to Wade? It was a thick inside edge of a mow over cow corner, played outside the line too. Lot fuller this time from Stanlake. There were two sounds. Some pad as well. Replays suggest it fell short of Wade"
"whipped behind square on the leg side. Bat, thigh pad and the deflection"
stays inside the crease and bunts the short of length delivery to the off side
drops it into the off side gently towards the man coming in from point
punched straight to cover point
quality stroke from a quality player. Punching through the line between cover and point. Warner sprints behind that and pulls it back in
"way over the batsman's head, too short from Cummins outside off. This time it's called wide. Wade was airborne when he collected that"
"solidly behind the line of that full delivery on middle, eased back down to the bowler"
gets half forward and punches the away-going length delivery to cover
"too short, another wide. Looking to test the bounce of the surface, is he? This was way down leg side and the correct call"
stands tall and punches it past the diving point fielder for an easy single
swivels back and pulls him to deep fine leg. Cummins misfields but recovers quickly to keep it to a single
"not there for the cut. Too full, not much width as well, the ball shaves past the inside edge"
"looks to force one through cover, gets an inside edge that rolls past leg stump, Wade does well to run to his left and stop that. No feet movement there from Azam"
"didn't get underneath the delivery, looked to slap that down the ground past mid-off"
"slower delivery, was through with the flick, except this time there was more bounce and was hit on the thigh pad as a result"
stays inside the crease and dabs the away-going length ball to the off side. Excellent comeback this from Stanlake
"bangs a short ball outside off, Azam gets on top of the bounce and fends it to the off side"
"driven through the line to Warner at mid-off, chances his arm and takes off for a single, the throw is fired to the striker's end. Sharjeel was well in"
ripper of a delivery that nips away late to beat Sharjeel's flirty push. Played inside the line of that delivery
stands tall and punches the short of length delivery to cover
"good bouncer on middle and off, Azam gets out of the way nice and early"
"bullet drive, but the bowler does well to put his right hand out on the follow-through and stop that"
"drifts one into middle, Sharjeel gets forward and blocks"
"that's the release he has been waiting for. Head errs in length, this one's too short, Sharjeel makes room and cracks it behind point. Poor effort from Cummins. <b> First boundary since the fifth over </b>"
"cramped for room, hit back to the bowler this time"
gets forward and dabs the in-drifter back down the pitch
"big, big shout for lbw. Sharjeel looks to get outside the line of the stumps and mow it over square leg, looks like he got a hint of bat on that. Australia have no reviews left. Close call though"
leans forward and turns the full delivery to midwicket
"mix-up, but sent back. Azam pushed this towards mid-on and was wandering down the pitch. There was a direct hit at the striker's end but he was just in"
"lucky break. Frustration for the bowler. No feet movement from Azam as he looks to thrash this over point, gets a thick inside edge to the fine leg boundary instead"
gets on top of the bounce and works this to square leg
"better technique, gets onto his toes and fends this to the leg side as they scamper a run"
a misfield at mid-off by Warner gives them a single that shouldn't have been
sways out of the way of that quick bouncer on middle
"tossed up on middle and leg, worked with the angle to long-on"
"pushed through quicker on middle, dabbed to the off side"
"width and he's crashed that into the deep point boundary. Warner it is again. Super effort to get there, sprinted 30 metres and then got in the dive, but couldn't stop it as the ball clipped him on the chest and deflected to the boundary"
"pulled wide of midwicket. That is a bullet hit, long-on was no more than a few yards from the delivery but he had no chance. Sharjeel on the move"
thick edge that races past short third man. <b> There's a half-century for Sharjeel. </b> The fans are happy. He looked to crack this behind point
"the party is over! Sharjeel looks to cut again, this time it was too close for him to play that. The drift in ensured he only managed a thick inside edge back onto the stumps. Celebration one delivery, frustration the next."
"back of a length in the corridor, climbs up on top of the bounce and bunts it back to the bowler"
"good length outside off, puts a stride in and pushes it to covers"
"full length, angling in towards off, times the drive nicely but straight to mid-on"
"bouncer on middle stump, he's comfortably ducked under that"

"around the wicket, good length, angled across, forward defence"
"drops it short and wide, cut away to sweeper cover"

"good length, steps out and gets beaten in flight, pushed to midwicket"
"dropped short, pulled away to deep midiwcket"
"full outside off, hard hands, doesn't connect the cover drive well"
"GONE! Grade cricket batting that. Head loops it across him outside off, he steps out early, gets beaten in flight and doesn't know what to do with it next. Flails at it as it keeps drifting away and he can only get a top-edge, straight to short third man"
"Did that carry? It did and he's <b>dropped</b> it in his follow through. Good length on middle, pushes at it well away from his body and chips it back to Faulkner, who has to dive low to get to it. He doesn't. Instead, it clips his fingers and hits the stumps at the non-strikers, where Malik is just about in - with his feet. Poor technique, but he's still there."

"good length outside off, no feet, defended late"
"gets a stride in this time, defends the corridor ball to covers"
"good length, angled across the batsman, left alone"

"back of a length angling across off, tries to cut this one but the bat turns, one bounce to cover"
"back of a length on off stump, defended off the back foot"

"good length, off stump, front foot defence"
"back of  a length on off stump, defended"
"floated on middle, steps out but can push it only to midwicket"
"dropped short, driven off the back foot to long-on"
"WOW! You can keep looking at that on loop. Floated on off stump, he steps out and lifts it majestically over the bowler's head and whacks the sightscreen - which is a 103 metres behind. Gorgeous."
"drops short on middle, swivels back and throws everything he's got into this pull shot, but it's only a single down to long-on"

"bouncer on off stump, Malik is happy to duck under this"
"short outside off, not wide enough for the cut, and he gets it on the inside half and into the pitch"
"CLOSE! Almost picked up my first commentary wicket. Walks across his stumps to this good length delivery, and catches it on his pads as he tries to flick it. Pitched outside leg though but trapped him right in front"

"walks across again, but this time gets bat on it and turns it down to fine leg"

"short and wide, slapped to deep cover"

"OOOH! 140 kph, good length in the corridor, climbs at him and beats his outside edge"

"short on middle and leg, nurdled to square leg for an easy single"
"darts this one on middle and leg, solidly defended back down the pitch"
"tipping over the bar stuff. There was a chance for Smith at short midwicket, but it was powerfully struck too. It was short, he rocked back to pull, would have been a beauty had he pulled that off"
"short, he rocks back and pulls this over the infield, towards deep midwicket"
"wow, that's a lovely stroke from Umar. This is a length ball on off stump, he brings those wrists into play to flick that one bounce into the midwicket boundary. Top shot"
"drops it gently towards backward point, looks for a single but is sent back"

"length ball outside off, he gets forward and blocks"

"whipped towards the vacant square leg region, timed well and so short fine leg has to run back and come around to cut that off, excellent running"
"width and he's slapped that to deep cover, no more than a single since there's protection there. Cheer from the Pakistan fans as the 200 is up"
beaten by a slower delivery. Deceptive change in pace without much change of grip

hops back and across to work the short bouncer on middle to square leg
"flicks a length ball into the gap at deep square leg, two easy runs brought about by strong, steely wrists"
"bouncer outside off at 140kph, he sways out of the way of that delivery"
this is a rip roaring bouncer that leaves Wade flinging to his left to get a hand on that. Azam arched back to sway out of the way. The ball swung back in a long way after it passed the batsman. Wade has the presence of mind to flick the ball back and prevent the batmen from scampering a bye
"<b> dropped chance, would have been a stunner had he held on. </b> This is a flat batted pull which he looks to swat over Cummins's head. He puts his hand out on the follow-through but catches like those should stick."
"full outside off, pushed to long-off as they jog the single"
"shot of a man who is now seeing this like a football. Length ball on middle and leg, Azam brings his wrists into the picture to whip the ball up and over wide mid-on, one bounce into the boundary."
punched past the bowler to long-off as they take an easy single
"slower and fuller on off, dabbed to cover for a quick single"

worked off his hip towards square leg for an easy single
"too full outside off, squeezed to deep cover"
"on middle and leg, worked to the leg side as they complete an easy single"
"opens the bat face to run it down to third man, but doesn't have the width or pace to beat the man there, a single nonetheless"
"backs away and muscles the slower ball over cover, but on the bounce to the fielder. Didn't generate the kind of power he would have liked"
"that's an outstanding catch by Handscomb. The pressure has got to Babar, who looks to pull that in front of square. Doesn't get the elevation. Handscomb, running in from deep midwicket, had to take a split-second decision if he wants to go for the catch or risk conceding a boundary. He takes a couple of steps forward and then dives low and full length forward to complete a super catch. Gets his fingers completely underneath the ball even as it was dying. The third umpire has a look, but Babar is walking off."
goes back into the crease and turns the length ball to the leg side and scoots across for a single

"turns an incoming short delivery towards fine leg, good work by the tall and lanky Stanlake to get down low and stop that"
"top stuff, gentle nudge to the leg side to give the man coming in from deep square plenty of work. Sensible running"
"ah, time and again he can thrill with shots like those. Shot of the day, and this is a super shot inside-out over cover. Not a half-volley by any means. Pick the length and goes through with the stroke, 15 rows back. What balance, what timing. No brute force, all timing. Held the pose for the cameras too"
"back of the hand slower ball on middle and leg, worked to deep midwicket"
"looks for a tip and run towards point, but Akmal says no"
looks to get on top of the bounce and defend but the ball cut back in to hit him on the glove and roll to the off side

hangs back and deflects the length ball outside off to third man

"angles a length ball into middle and leg, turned to fine leg"
"looks to play a flat-batted pull but gets it high on the bat, just lobs over the bowler's head"
"reward for some super bowling. Sees the batsman advancing and hits the deck hard. The bouncer is too steep for Akmal, who can only glove it to the keeper in an attempt to run it down to third man. Another setback for Pakistan just when Akmal was looking good to eye a final flourish"
"hustled for pace by a bouncer angled into leg stump from wide of the crease, Rizwan is caught on the hop as he defends"
delicate little dab down to third man for an easy single to get off the mark
"width on offer, forced off the back foot to deep point"
"slapped over the infield, but that is an outstanding catch by Travis Head running backwards from mid-off. He had to be mindful of Maxwell running from cover, but the loud and clear call allowed him to back off. Having made the early call, aided by a head start, he kept his eyes on the ball and then flung himself forward to complete the catch. Never easy taking those, especially when you're running backwards, but wow, did he pull off a stunner or what. Pakistan are crumbling here after setting themselves up for a 300 plus total"
guides it from the crease to point
"cramped for room, beaten for pace as he defends to the off side again"
super timing! Faulkner at third man comes around towards deep point to cut that off. It was just a glide using the bowler's pace
"floats this full on off, the ball nips back in and meets a dead bat"
"chopped to point, Maxwell moves swiftly to his left to cut that off."
"hangs back and looks to ramp it over the keeper's head, but is done in by the bounce. He was off balance too when he tried to play it"

"gets out of the line to scoop it over the keeper's head, but the bounce on the surface meant it was always going to be an arduous task"

"looked to swing that to Perth's CBD, but couldn't connect. Backed away to go over long on, cross-batted, nowhere near the pitch or the line. Beaten"
caught on the hop as he looks to tuck it fine. Struggling to lay bat on ball at the moment. Hit high on the thigh pas this time
"I'm sure even Rizwan has no clue how he has managed to scoop that fine over short fine. Shaped to play, but looked away so that he isn't in danger of being hit if there's a top edge. Somehow gets his willow to the line of the ball and the deflection bounces into the ropes"

"superb from Amir! Good length, starts on middle and off, swings away and past the outside edge, and there seems to be a sound as it flies to the keeper. They appeal loudly, it's turned down. No review. Snicko shows a sound, but it is after the ball passes the bat"
