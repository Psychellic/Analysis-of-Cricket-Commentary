"140 kph, back of a length, angled in at the waist, taps it uppishly, wide of mid-on"
"fuller, swinging away from outside off, ultimately past the wide marker"
"good ball. Good length, in the corridor, nips away, climbs and beats his back foot poke outside off"
"good length at off stump, but enough bounce for him to stay rooted and defend it uprightly, rather than with a stride"

"slower ball, overpitched outside off, driven straight to short extra cover"

"good length at off stump, forward defence into the off side"
"back of a length, angled across sharply and it beats him as he pushes away from his body"
"<b>dropped!</b> Narine has put down a blatantly simple catch. That's not doing his captain's temper any good. Back of a length, angled across from off stump. This time Vohra hasn't transferred his weight quickly as he goes for the hook. Top edge hangs up generously for Narine at third man, but he is languid as he gets under this and offers anxious hands at waist height to put it down"

"good length, angled in at middle stump Stoinis pushes back dangerously and just about defends it back to the bowler"

"good length at off stump, drops it into the leg side with soft hands and beats midwicket's fielding to steal a single. In fact, he hadn't quite beaten him. Would've been gone with a direct hit"

"short and wide outside off stump, cut away, sweeper runs to his left and cuts it off"
"seam up ball, good length at off stump, hits it straight to the fielder at point and they take a run. Might have been interesting if Narine was behind the stumps"

"predicts the googly, and leans into this ball outside off. Turns it off the front foot to deep square leg"

"<b>oh dear, someone set up a hospitality package for Boult. Yet another misfield.</b> He bounces him outside off stump again. This time Saha gets bat on his upper cut. It's not a lot of bat. Loops and lands in front of Narine at third man. He is not anticipating the bounce on this as it's about to hit the floor. Lazily puts his hands up while offering a lazy jump and it goes over him"
"oh get out of the way. Back of a length at middle stump, stays rooted to the crease and nails this pull shot to get it over the square leg boundary"

"misses another yorker, this is a full toss too. Too fast for Miller to slog this over the midwicket boundary. Gets it high on that bat and slices it out into the leg side where Pandey runs in from the midwicket boundary and slides forward with the momentum after pouching it low. The third umpire was called on to check for height there, but it was safely below waist"
