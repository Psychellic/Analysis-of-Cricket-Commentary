"good-length ball first up. Pitches on off stump, and Lynn defends off the back foot"

"full on off, and that's been swept square. Well hit, but stopped by Chahar at square leg"

"wide outside off again, and Lynn once again cuts this square. Straight to the man in the deep though"
"full on leg, and that's been beautifully clipped off his toes. Lifted over square leg, and fine leg can't cut it off. Uses his wrists to whip it over the infield. One-bounce and four"

"<b>chopped past first slip!</b> Raina's dive to his right sn't good enough. It was too close to his body for the cut, but he played it anyway. Off the bat's edge, but just beyond Raina. Third man can't intercept either"

"full toss on off stump, and Lynn muscles this towards cow corner"
"<b>classical Uthappa!</b> Full on middle, and he's quick to get down on one knee. Goes through his slog-sweep and smacks this over deep midwicket. Lands in the stands"

"<b>the leg stump's uprooted!</b> Flatter ball on middle, and Lynn's halfway down the wicket. He misses the leg-side heave, and the ball goes between bat and pad. Crashes into leg stump and Jadeja's pumped!"
"good length just outside off, punched off the back foot towards cover"
"full outside off, and Rana gets to the pitch of this delivery. Smothers it off his pads to square leg thereafter"
"full on off, and in the slot for Uthappa. Takes a big stride forward and lofts this over wide long on. Full extension of the arms, and that lands in the stands once again"
<b>two in a row!</b> And again in the same spot. Full ball and Uthappa simply gets to the pitch of the delivery and dispatches it for six more. Golf-like swing and KKR end the Powerplay on 64

a short ball to welcome DK. Pitches on off and gets big on the KKR captain. He ducks under the line of the ball
"good length just outside off. It's punched to cover but <b>there's a hesitation!</b> Raina stops the ball, turns around, and throws it at the non-striker's. Uthappa's struggling, and he's well short when the zing bails come alive. KKR gift CSK a wicket. Karthik wanted the single, but Uthappa wasn't quite sure. Pays the price"

"short outside off, but not wide enough for the cut. DK bottom-edged the shot to third man on this occasion"
"overpitched outside off, and Thakur pays the price for missing his length. Down on one knee, and muscled by Russell over long on. It's not off the bat's sweet spot, but enough behind it to clear the boundary. Thakur's knuckle ball did not come off"
"<b>two in two!</b> It's a full toss on off stump, and Russell's not going to miss out on these. It's pumped over the non-striker's head and lands next to the sightscreen"
"good length on off stump, and Russell mistimes his pull to cow corner. They jog across for the single"
"low full toss on off stump, but tailing sharply into DK's toes. Tries to play straight, but the swing forces an error from Karthik. He bottom-edges it to the keeper. Could've easily chopped onto his stumps however"
"goes short first. Pitches on leg stump, but Russell goes under the delivery. First-bouncer says the umpire"
"<b>that's out of the ground!</b> Full on middle and Russell's spotted this early. Down on one knee, and swung over Bravo's head. A full 105 metres and even Shahrukh Khan needs to crane his neck to see that ball"

"now Karthik's joining in! Picks the slower ball nice and early, and DK slogs this over long on with disdain! Nineteen off the 17th over"

"yorker on leg stump, and Karthik misses the shot. Hits his back leg, and the appeal's been given out! He's reviewing but that's a futile decision. It hit his back leg, and impact was in front of leg stump. The replay shows that the ball would've clipped leg stump. <b>KKR retain their review</b> but the captain has to go"
"good length on off stump, and Curran backs away to make some extra room. Slaps this square past point to the man in the deep"
"overpitched, but wide outside off. Russell hits this hard into the ground, and the ball lobs over Watto's head. There's cover in the deep though"
"it's full on leg stump, and Russell whips this off his pads! That's all it was, a simple flick, and the ball soars over deep midwicket. Raw power from Russell"

"<b>three in three!</b> Short on off, and Russell swivels to pull. Off the bat's middle and it lands beyond the man at cow corner. The KKR dugout can't believe it"
"excellent yorker on middle stump, and Russell does well to get his bat down in time. It's inside-edged to short fine leg, and Curran's halfway down the wicket. There's a misfield there, so Russell chooses to run across as well. Could've been a run-out if Chahar collected the ball cleanly"
"back of a length outside off, and Curran lifts this off the back foot. Played over cover, but there's someone in the deep"
"low full toss on leg stump, and Russell flicks this off his pads to deep backward square. Twenty-one runs off the over but importantly, Russell's on strike. <b>Can KKR breach 200?</b>"

"short on off stump, and Russell's pull doesn't come off. Bottom-edges it towards deep midwicket"

"knuckle ball outside off, and Curran can't connect again! Deceived by the pace"
"another knuckle ball outside off, and Curran can't hit it. But Dhoni misfields, which makes the batsmen take the bye. They can take overthrows as well, but Russell's not interested"

drops it short and into the body. Watson uses the angle as he stays tall and swats this past short fine
<B>huuuuuge!</b> Puts it up at a length on leg stump and boy does Watson love that. He's made room and is waiting for a clean swing through the ball. Vinay allows him that and he duly drills it over long-on
"<b>through the covers now!</b> Vinay Kumar finishes poorly after two dot balls. Length ball outside off, onto the front foot and he punches it on the up"
"slider from wide of the crease, coming in at off stump on a good length. He plants the front leg forward and drops it in front of short third man with soft hands"
"<b>overthrows.</b> Watson dabs a length ball into the leg side and Karthik slides, swivels and throws a very very wide throw as he tries to run Watson out at the other end. Russell puts in a big dive to the left at mid-off but can't stop that"

"full on off, and the drive's been crunched to Rana at cover point. Stopped well, but his throw doesn't hit the stumps. Allows them to take an <b>overthrow</b>"
"takes the pace off this time. Good length on middle, and Rayudu pokes at it. Played towards point for a quick run"
"<B>pulled, but holes out!</b> Curran strikes in his first over. Short again, and this time the pull isn't hit well enough. Rinku Singh was placed at cow corner after the earlier pull, and this time Watson finds the man. Big wicket for the visitors"

"big appeal for lbw! But turned down. <b>Narine wants to review.</b> It was a good-length ball on middle, and zipped straight through. Dhoni tried to defend but the ball sneaked between bat and pad.

"good length on leg stump, and it's a quicker ball to welcome Jadeja! Hits his front leg, but would've probably gone down the leg side. Jadeja wanted the run, though, but he's quickly asked to go back"

"<b>ridiculous!</b> Low full toss on middle stump, but Billings shuffles across to the off side. Gets to the other side and then paddles this over fine leg"
"back of a length on leg stump, but Billings was expecting that very length! Uses his bottom hand to flat-bat it over long on. Enough connection to take it beyond the boundary. Two terrific shots from Billings"
"short outside off, and Billings pings this over square leg this time. Drags his shot to Kuldeep at deep backward square"
full and fast outside off. Jadeja can't make any connection. A useful dot to end Russell's spell
"smart bowling, but Billings will get to his <b>fifty</b>. Full and wide outside off, and the batsman is forced to drag a sweep towards the leg side"
"good length on off, and that's been tapped to backward point. Jadeja scampers across to the other end, but more important, gives the strike back to Billings"
"half-tracker on middle, and Billings pulls it away over midwicket! Slight bend of the knee to keep his eyes on the ball, and then sent over the boundary with ease"
"<b>holes out to long off!</b> Full outside off, but slightly slower this time. Billings is through his shot too early, and that comes off the blade's toe end. Billings walks back but not before keeping CSK alive in this match"
"short on middle, and Jadeja cuts it to Chawla at point. Diving effort stops the ball, and ensures they can only take the single"
"yorker on leg stump, and all Bravo can do is flick it off his toes to deep midwicket. <b>CSK need 17 off the final over</b>"
"waist-high full toss on leg stump, and Bravo simply swings through to the leg side. It's taken a leading edge, but has enough behind that for the ball to go beyond the fine-leg boundary! Perfect way for CSK to start the over. Free hit as well"
"full and wide outside off, but that's been smacked over long on's head. Taken in the deep, but that's a free hit, so he's safe! Bravo comes back for the second"
"short on middle, and Bravo pulls this square to cow corner. It's in the air, but falls short of the man at cow corner. Bravo wanted the second, but Jadeja chooses not to come back. DJ's not happy!"
"full and slow outside off, but that's too wide! Jadeja lets it go as the umpire stretches his arms"
"good length on off stump, and Jadeja carves this to point for a quick single. Gets Bravo back on strike"
full and wide outside off. Bravo drags his shot to long on this time. No chance of a double
"<b>over long on!</b> And CSK complete another heist. Full on middle stump, but Jadeja gets his front foot out of the way to smack this over Vinay's head. In the slot to be punished, and Jadeja does exactly that. It lands in the second tier and with that the CSK boys come running out! <b>The hosts win by five wickets</b>"
