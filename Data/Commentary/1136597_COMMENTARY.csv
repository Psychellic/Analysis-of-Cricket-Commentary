"good length outside off, and he stays on the back foot to push towards the off side"
"width offered again, but this time Suryakumar can't time it well. Too wide, actually, and therefore his cut finds the bat's toe end. Krishna will feel relieved..."
full on off and angling into his pads. Suryakumar shuffles across to the off side and drives towards mid on. Diving effort from Russell at mid on saves the team a certain boundary

"shorter and darted in on middle stump, forced off the back foot to deep midwicket for one"
"speared very full just a shade outside off, Lewis jumps outside leg and looks to cart it through the covers. Instead, he toe-ends it away to the left of DK behind the stumps and right of short third man. Fortunate four"
"slower through the air but heading down leg, past the sweep. Leg-side wide"
"100.8ks dart on middle stump, Lewis races down the track, converts it into a full-toss, and belts it back to the left of Rana. He stretches his hands to his left but the force of the shot ensures the ball bursts out. <strong>Dropped, but that was a very difficult chance.</strong> Such ones stick or they just don't. The umpire was in the firing line too"
"loopier and fuller outside off, enough width for Suryakumar to collapse his back leg and lace a drive between sweeper cover and wide long-off. Impeccable placement again from Suryakumar"

Lewis stays leg-side of the ball and drives to wide long-off

"dropped short and sliding away outside off, Suryakumar uses the depth of the crease, use of pace and angle of Kuldeep, and chops it away past short third man for another four"
"full on middle, and tapped towards the vacant midwicket region. The man in the deep has to come charging in, but can't stop the second run"
"slower ball, and that does the trick! Full on off, and Lewis is tempted to go for the biggie. Tries to drive over cover, but slices it down short third man's throat. Comfortably for Lynn"

"Rohit slog-sweeps with the break but picks out Rinku, the sub fielder, at deep midwicket. Tossed up and spins in on middle, Rohit drops down on one knee but skews it off the bottom of the bat to the man in the deep. Only the second wicket away from home for Narine in IPL 2018"

"slower ball outside off, and that's been mistimed down the ground to long on. A gentle punch"
"<b>tickles it to the keeper!</b> Good length on the fourth-stump line, and it's too close to his body for the cut. Finds the edge and DK does the rest. The heat has played its part too. He was really late to play that shot"
"short, but that's first-ball four! Yanks a pull over the fielder at midwicket, and the shot has the legs to reach the boundary"
"short outside off, and Krunal goes chasing after it. Tried to slap it over third man, but can't get bat to ball"
"short again! And the keeper appeals for caught behind. Russell isn't convinced though. It was on leg stump, and Krunal was cramped to play that pull. Goes over his gloves. The appeal, however, may have saved KKR from getting that wide"

"good length on middle, and lifted off the back foot! Hit over midwicket, but Chawla's manning that region in the deep. Looks like the captain is asking Chawla why he didn't attack the ball"
"short outside off, and that's been crunched off the back foot! Cut square, and sweeper cover is too slow to react. Muscles this one"
"<b>cheeky!</b> Good length outside off, but Hardik's done playing convention. Steps across to the off side, hides his face, and then paddles it over his shoulder! No one at fine leg, and Hardik ends the over with consecutive boundaries."
"good length on leg stump, and Krunal can't paddle it away. Hits his front leg, but the appeal is turned down. Bounced just outside leg"
"good length on middle, and Krunal flat-bats it over the non-striker. Man at long off, but it lands just in front of him"

"good length on middle, and Krunal's big back lift comes to the party. Hits through the ball's line, and sent over the long on boundary"
"<b>finds Gill at long on!</b> Tries the same shot, but Narine went shorter. The leg-side heave comes off the bat's toe end, and Krunal fails to find the distance on this occasion. He's disappointed!"
"good length outside off, and zipping further away. Tries to cut, but the ball stays low! Well taken by DK"
"cutter outside off, but the umpire thinks it's too wide. Hardik had let it go anyway. Johnson's not pleased with the umpire's call. Looked like it was just inside the tramlines though!"

"full on middle and leg, and Duminy clips it off his toes to the sweeper fielder on the leg side"

"wide outside off, and forces Hardik to stretch at it. Toe ends it straight down the ground to the man in the deep"
"good length outside off, but Duminy walks across to the off side to meet it. Swings towards the leg side, and manages to get enough behind it to clear cow corner"
"tossed up, but full outside off. Squeezed away towards wide long on, and collects a couple more"
"full on off, and he gets down on one knee to slog sweep. There's a fielder in the deep for that shot"
"good length outside off, and he muscles a pull to the man at deep midwicket. Off the bat's inside half"
"good length outside off, and Duminy shuffles across to that side to pull again. Not well connected this time"
"Short, and Duminy can't pull it away! Duminy wants it to be a wide, but the ball went over leg stump. Excellent!"
"slower ball, and angling across Duminy. With all his might, the batsman tries to slog, but can only find the man at long on"
"full outside off, and this time the slower ball has deceived the batsman beautifully. But the game's cruel, so Hardik will earn a boundary. Slices this drive over DK's head"
"full and wide outside off, and Hardik attempts a expansive drive. The ball goes under Hardik's bat, but on the wide-line. The umpire calls extras"
"<b>unlucky!</b> The pace earns Hardik another boundary. Goes for the wide yorker, and Hardik's wild slash takes the bat's toe end. Goes between third man and the keeper this time"
"full toss outside off, but Hardik can't connect. <b>The bat's gone flying too!</b> Goes to the keeper on the bounce, who has a shy at the stumps. Misses! Hardik would've been gone"
"full and wide outside off, and this time he inside-edges the drive towards the keeper's left. They steal the single. <b>Mumbai Indians finish on 181 for 4</b>"
"back of a length and angling across off from over the wicket, dabbed through point with soft hands"
"back of a length and into the hips of Gill, punched past the right of mid-on for one"

"McClenaghan brings out his hit-the-deck bustle. Banged in short on middle, Lynn arches his back and lets it fly through to Kishan"
"back of a length and wide outside off, in Lynn's swinging arc, slapped away fiercely but straight to point who has moved back in from the deep"
"Bumrah ventures wide of the crease, but this shortish ball holds its line outside off, Gill rides it down to deep third man for one"
"142.5ks back-of-a-length ball, straightening away outside off, Lynn throws his hands at the ball but only collects fresh air. Encouraging carry to Kishan"

"back of a length and outside off, Lynn flashes at it and sends a thick outside edge between wide slip and regular short third man for four"
"115ks slower, back-of-a-length ball outside off, Lynn delays his punch and hits it past the left of mid-off and short cover for back-to-back fours"
"Bumrah nearly chops Lynn into half! 142ks, back of a length and zips back in from wide of the crease. There's that sharp angle from Bumrah. Beats the inside edge, beats off stump, and beats a diving Kishan. Two fours followed by four byes. KKR won't complain"

"short on leg stump, cramps the batsman for room, dragged away square of short fine leg"
"skiddy, short ball on the hips, pulled away past square leg for another four"
"keeps it short, angling away outside off, just over the hips. Lynn waits for this length on the back-foot and swats it away to the midwicket fence"
"The short ball finally works for McClenaghan and Mumbai. Chest-high ball on middle, tucks Lynn up for room. He still goes for the pull, hits it well, but picks out Bumrah at short fine leg"
McClenaghan hits a hard length on middle and leg - neither driveable nor pullable - punched back to the bowler off the back foot
"<strong>Gill caught Pandya bowled Pandya</strong>. Hardik floats a slower offcutter outside off first up. Gill does not spot it. He is early into a drive and gets more height as opposed to distance. Krunal snuffles the catch at mid-off, has his hands aloft and roars <s>Wakanda forever</s>. Two wickets in three balls for Mumbai"

"<strong>Markande backpedals and drops a sitter</strong>! Pandya is shocked. Back of a length, slower ball outside off, this is more a short-arm flap as opposed to a short-arm pull. He drags it in the air, Markande does not have a stable base, and the ball pops out"

"googly! Good length on middle, and turns into his body. Gets big on the batsman, so he wedges it onto his thighs"
"good length outside off, and Uthappa chooses to play this fine. Cut straight to short third man though"

"almost a yorker on off, and Rana digs it away towards midwicket for a walking single"
"good length on middle, and worked off his pads towards deep midwicket. Good use of his wrists to direct it there"
"wide outside off, and Uthappa makes room to cut. But can't find the gap as point pounces onto it in a flash"
"<B>yes, no, yes, no!</b> Uthappa's safe though! Tapped towards point, and Uthappa wants the run. Rana says no, and he's forced to turn back. Does well to slide in before Kishan can dislodge the bails"
"good length on middle and leg, and Uthappa makes further room on the leg side to punch it straight down the ground. Krunal gets his body behind it, and saves the single"
"<b>freebie!</b> Full toss on off, and Uthappa backs away to thump it over cover! Wide long off does not bother moving an inch"

"sticks with the slower ball. On a good length and angling away from Rana. Mistimes the cut, but finds the gap on this occasion. Deep point cleans up"
"slower ball yorker, but outside leg stump. Uthappa checks his shot, and eventualy whips it off his toes. Played over square leg, and no one's there in the deep."
"offcutter outside off, and he opens the bat's face to run it down to third man. Uthappa wants the run, but there's none on offer"
"appeal for caught behind! But not given. Came off something, but not the bat. Good length outside leg, but goes over the top of leg stump as Rana misses the clip off his pads. Replays show it flicked his trouser"
"full outside off, and punched to McClenaghan at sweeper cover. A wild throw that hits Rana's bat but Lewis does well to back up"

"<b>crunched over midwicket!</b> Good length on off, but Uthappa walks across to the off side and checks a pull shot over the infield. Placed to perfection, and what a way to get to your <b>first IPL 2018 fifty!</b>"
"<b>fourth boundary in a row!</b> Short on off, but Cutting doesn't have the pace to trouble Uthappa. Takes his backfoot deep, and swivels a pull over short fine leg"

"full on middle, and turning away from Rana. Sticks his bat out and taps it to point"
"full outside leg, but turning into his body. Gets down on one knee, and sweeps it uppishly to deep backward square"
"conventional legbreak, and that earns him the wicket! Straight to long off. Full outside off, and Uthappa plays it straight down the ground. The ball spun away slightly, and induced the shot from the bat's toe end. Markande makes amends after all!"

"good length on middle, and backs away to punch it towards cover"

"good length outside off, and angling away from Dre. He stands tall and punches it towards the gap near cover"
"goes short outside leg, and DK wants to pull. He can't connect, and goes through to Kishan. What's surprising is the umpire doesn't call it a wide. <B>Karthik is bemused</b>"
"full on off, and that's been defended with soft hands. Cover's too deep, so they can walk across for another run"
"offcutter that Russell can't pitch. It was short on off, and he had walked across to the off side. Hits his body, but rather gently, as he misses the leg-side whip"
"back of a length on middle, and Russell flays a cut towards backward point. All he can earn is a single"

"too wide outside off, and then spinning sharply inwards. Russell goes deep into his crease and thumps a flat-batted shot to the wide long-on boundary"
"full on middle, and no spin this time. Russell takes a big stride forward and defends it back to young Markande. <b>Time out</b>"
"slower ball, but wide outside off. It's a length delivery, so DK cuts it square to the man in the deep. Singles are fine for Mumbai"
"cramps Russell! Aimed at leg stump, and with the batsman backing away, it's a perfect delivery. Russell tried to pull, but in trying to protect himself, he plays it back to Bumrah"
"full outside off, and Russell almost gets under it. Drills it past the umpire, and long on does well to cut it off"
"back of a length on middle, but Russell makes a lot of room on the leg side. Pulls it towards the leg side, but <b>Krunal takes a screamer!</b> He's at short fine leg, but needs to race towards the square-leg boundary. Dives forward, and takes an excellent catch!"
"full outside off, and DK carves it over point. Bends his knee to get under the ball, and then drives over the infield"
"<b>what did that come off?!</b> Yorker outside leg, and it's a really quick delivery. DK can't connect, and the ball comes off his boot. Kishan dives to his left but can't get his hands to it either. Important runs for KKR to end the 17th"

"full on off, and Narine backs away to muscle it towards deep midwicket. Gets off the mark"

"good length outside off, and cut hard! Just past point, and beats the sweeper cover fielder as well!"
"slower ball, wide outside off. DK winds up to hit it straight, but the pace (or lack of it) does him in. Under edges it to Kishan. Hardik asks him to hold on to the ball"

"low full toss on middle, and DK swings wildly. Hits his bat's inside half and goes to fine leg. <b>Says no to the single</b>"
"short! On off stump, and soaring over his shoulders. DK tries to pull behind square, but can't connect at all"
"overpitched on middle and leg, and DK gets his front leg out of the way to smash it straight! Long on had no chance. Good use of the crease's depth"
"<b>dropped at deep backward square! And goes for four.</b> Another low full toss on middle, and that's been whipped off his pads. Duminy got under it, but messes it all up. The ball pops out, takes a bounce, and then goes for four. <b>Kolkata need 23 off the final over</b>"
"full toss outside off, and that's in Narine's arc! Thumped past the non-striker to the straight boundary. Long-on just a spectator"
"full outside off, and angling away from Narine. Tries to lift it over cover, but slices it to the man on the circle. <b>DK has crossed to the other side though!</b>"
"good length on leg stump, and DK tries to pull it. Tries to play it on one knee, but can't connect. <b>Krunal appeals for lbw, and then asks for a review.</b> Nah, it's going down leg"
"low full toss, very wide outside off. DK gets down on one knee, and carves it over point. KKR need a six, but all they get is a four"
"back of a length on middle, and DK pulls to deep midwicket. Refuses the single"
"good length outside off, and bunted to long on for a single. Cheers all around! <b>Mumbai Indians win by 13 runs!</b>"
