tame dismissal. Full and on the pads. Tries to clip it and harmlessly chips it to mid-on. Slower ball from Zadran and the batsman does not pick and is done in by the lack of pace
"short ball, slower in pace again and the batsman goes through with the pull shot too early. He had rolled his fingers over the seam and the ball goes off the very end of the bat to the wicketkeeper. Bounces in front of him though"
"and that will be the game. Dawlat takes four like in the previous game. Slower ball again does the trick. Handshakes and hugs all around the Afghanistan team. They check for a no-ball and from the first angle it seems as though he may have overstepped.This, after they have already started making their way out. And guess what! It's a no-ball. Game not yet over folks. We have a restart. Coming to the delivery, it was a slower short of a length ball and Dockrell swung across the line, misses it completely and the ball takes out the stumps"
"full and on the pads, clipped away to midwicket"
"drifting in and cramps him for room, beats the attempted cut"
beaten outside off with turn
"now it is definitely game over. Six wickets for Rashid. Handshakes exchanged again and this time they are only headed out. No coming back. Googly from Rashid again, the batsman fails to pick it, plays for the turn as he comes forward to defend. The ball spins past the inside edge and crashes into the stumps"
