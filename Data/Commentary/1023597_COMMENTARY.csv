"starts with some swing. Back of a length outside off, moving away. Dabbed to gully for one"
"nicely bowled. Full and straight on off and middle, played into the leg side towards midwicket"
"runs down at Willey but the ball starts on middle and leg, goes on down leg for an extra run"
"whew, landed in MCG if he made contact. Finch gives himself room and swings wildly. The ball beats the inside edge, past leg stump, through bat and pad. A bye as the keeper can't collect"
"away swing, full and outside off, pushed into the cover region"
"128 kph, just short of short cover. Full outside off, the ball moves away. Harris plays a leaden-footed prod-push. Klinger can't get forward to take it on the full"
"131 kph, worked to mid-on, a drag from outside off"
"full and very wide outside off, 141 kph. A quick, but wayward start. Finch is hustled through his drive and can't make contact"
"shot. 140 kph overpitched outside off, Finch just caresses his drive. Lets his muscle do the rest. Races away between cover and mid-off"
"over the top for four more. Full outside off, Finch watches the in his slot and then lofts the ball over mid-off. Not great timing, but all strength again"
"slower ball on off, 127 kph, that's a clever change-up. Forces Finch to defend, changes the pace off the game"
"full and wide, Finch doesn't make contact with a swing"

"another swing and miss. Baseball style. Full delivery outside off, swings away and beats Harris' heave"
defended to cover from the crease
"plonks in the surface just short of deep square leg. Good length outside off, Harris clatters his swing. Bell races around from deep square leg to save two"
smashed. Harris gives a length delivery a proper thwack with a short-arm jab past the bowler and mid-off
lovely shot. Harris gets across and swivels into his flick to get the ball to the right of short fine leg. Very Marcus North-like. Using those wrists
"a slower ball on middle and off, 120 ks, worked to deep square leg"
"full outside off, 121 kph, blocked back"
"a bit of extra bounce, some angle too. Good length on off, the ball swerves away and beats Harris' swat"
"in the gap for a run. Good fielding. On a length outside off, Harris craves through backward point. Tye at short third man runs across to save one"
"crashed. Good length outside off, Finch backs away and drills a lofted drive over cover. Why bother keeping it down?"
"six. Over long-on. Just over. But over. Backs away again, marsh follows him. Finch gets enough underneath the length, gets enough behind it."
"slower ball on leg to finish, prodded towards point for one"
"full on middle, 126 kph, pushed to mid-off for one"
"back of a length, bouncer on off. Pulled to deep square leg"
"the knuckle ball, slow, 108 kph, on off. Finch waits for it to come to him before opening the face to get two to third man"
"yikes. A soft, soft dismissal. Another knuckle ball outside off, so slow at 111 kph, sits up for Finch to hit anywhere he wants but all he does is slap the ball into short cover's hands. A fumble and a parry, but who cares as long as it's taken. Finch was looking superb."
worked away through square leg
"<b>huge huge appeal</b>. That's because there was a loud noise as ball passed glove/bat. Bouncer outside off, quick. Harris looks to ramp the ball over the slip cordon but can't make contact. There is glove though. Gets away with one"
"some flight on middle, worked to deep midwicket"
"swerves in, 93 ks, pushed to mid-on"
another thwack. Harris comes down and closes the bat face as he looks to go over the bowler. Past mid-on for four

"shortish length on middle and leg, Harris improvises a checked defensive stroke after misreading the pace"
"short and wide outside off, 123 kph. Harris attempts the wrong shot, looks to drag a pull through midwicket instead of hitting through the off side"
"nice. Gets low and helps his reverse-sweep through third man for three. Fantastic thinking, equally food execution"
"got 'im. Harris' hit and miss innings ends. Pushed much wider outside off, Harris gets on one knee and mis-times a sweep. Sails high, more elevation than distance. Deep midwicket judges the catch well, takes a simple reverse-cupped catch"

reverse-swept to third man

"short and wide, crunchy cut to point's left. Good diving stop"
"back of a length on off, dabbed towards gully"
sweetly-timed to long-off. White gives himself room and drives nicely

"short on or just outside off, White gives himself room and forehands the ball over point for a couple"
"slower ball on middle, 107 kph, swatted to deep backward square leg for two more"
"<strong>dropped</strong>! A rather tough chance. Slow ball on off, White beaten for pace, checks his drive which carries at a decent height to Tye's right, but a but too wide. He gets his right hand to it, but spills the one-hander"

"142 kph, on the hips and White clips. Snips one to deep square leg"
"darted in on leg, 90 ks, worked to midwicket"
"nice length. Not short not full, Ferguson's feet are rooted in the crease, pushed to deep cover"
"easily accepted. Flat delivery on leg, White backs away, looking to deposit one into the stands. Chooses a slog sweep to execute, but the ball skews off the outside half, the bat face turning in his hands. Carries to deep midwicket. Another reverse-cupped take, by Willey at deep midwicket"
"nice. Tossed up, chipped over the bowler for one to long-on"
a nurdle through square leg for one
"91 kph, scythed to point. As so often happens, a wicket stalls the run-rate"
"full on middle, a hint of away swing. Pushed to mid-on"
"excellent stop from Marsh. Saves one. Full outside off, driven back to the bowler's left who dives"
nicely done. Gets outside the line of the ball and intentionally lofts the ball over cover for four
"four more. On the pads, Ferguson whips the ball through backward square leg. Fantastic gap-finding skills. Playing on the merit of the ball"
"chipped, lands just short of midwicket. Slower ball on off, Ferguson closes the bat face"
"another soft dismissal. All this does is give the Scorchers a sniff. Slower ball on middle and leg, Ferguson stays in his crease and swats the length straight to deep midwicket. Wanted to get that a lot straighter"

"slower ball down leg, good disguise. Cooper misses a pull, beaten in pace this time. Strays down and wide called"
"phew. That slingy action of Johnson again. Round-arm action, short of a length on leg, Cooper has no idea what's going on. Wears the blow"
guided behind point for a couple
"another wicket. Johnson gets Cooper. Renegades struggling towards the end. Back of a length on middle and off, the length that has troubled Cooper. He gives himself some room and upper-cuts towards third man. Marsh runs to his right and takes a good catch near the boundary"
"oh my, what a delivery. <b>How does it move so much?</b> A knuckle ball outside off that swings/floats/swerves away. Beats Nevill's drive"
yet again. Sensational bowling. Just inside the tramline too. Deadly accurate. Exceptional bowling. Beats Nevill because of that movement. The best slower ball in cricket now?

"130 kph, full on middle, skewed towards long-on for one"
hoicked away over midwicket for a couple more
"superb stuff. Another slow delivery outside off, 120 kph, defended back."

"slower ball on the pads, worked to short fine leg"
"114 kph slower ball on middle, Bravo gets down and mis-times his slog to mid-off. Exceptional end-overs bowling"

"just enough on that. Another slower ball, in the arc and Bravo launches his heave over long-on"
"132 kph, another quick delivery on the pads, bravo pushes to mid-on and gets back for two. Good stuff from Bravo"
"129 kph, full on the pads, mis-timed to long-on. A tiring Bravo returns for the second, but to no avail. The throw to the keeper is full and decent. The keeper takes the bails off. <strong>Serious end-overs skills from Tye</strong>"

"<strong>big appeal</strong>. No says the umpire. Pitched well outside leg. Hits Marsh on the pad and ricochets to White at slip, who fires a throw at the stumps. Hits Rimmington on the shin. Ouch."

"low full toss, driven to mid-off"
worked to midwicket with soft hands

"flat on the pads, spins down leg. Bell struck on the pad"
"flat on off and middle, pushed to long-on"
"shortish and wide outside off, chopped away to point"
"nice. Sees the trajectory is slightly flatter and shorter, he opens the face and gets two to third man"
"why is he so forward? It's not a slow outfield either. Hoggy. Back of a length on leg, Bell helps the ball on its way, off the top edge. Goes just over Hogg's outstretched hand at fine leg. Bounces in front of the boundary for four"

Winces in pain. </strong>The left leg got stuck in the turf just before he took off to dive. He's still lying on the turf. A doctor is asking for a stretcher"

"and one more. Finch is on fire. The Scorchers being doused. Flat and full on off, Voges wanted to turn that ball into the leg side, preferably for two. A leading edge goes to the left of Finch. he runs across, picks up, turns around and effects a direct hit. Whaaaaat?"
