"lovely start from Guptill. Good length delivery outside off, some away movement. Guptill guides a punchy push behind backward point for a couple. Rajpoot gets across to his left from third man"
adjusts straightaway. Saw shape in the previous ball so brought this one straighter to ensure there wasn't too much width. Guptill forced to defend
"nice again. A good length outside off, width but not overly wide. Guptill pokes but is beaten by some outswing."
"that's a poor delivery. Did he get too greedy? back of a length on leg and middle, Guptill flicks the ball down to fine leg for four. Just using the pace"
"good change in length. A bouncer on middle and leg, Guptill gets underneath that."
"finds the gap somehow. Full delivery outside off, Guptill leans into a push and finds the gap through cover for a couple. His compatriot de Grandhomme tracks it down"
"oh my. That was tripe. Back of a length down leg, a terrible delivery. Vohra toe-ends his flick to the bowler"
"on a length down leg, flicked to deep square leg"
Guptill shimmies down but de Grandhomme digs in a bouncer. Superb delivery.
"on a length on middle and leg, pushed to long-on for a run. Conscious not to give width"
"too straight again, whipped away through backward deep square leg"
"good finish from de Grandhomme. On a length on middle., pushed to mid-off. Tidy over, no width at all"
"good length outside off, a thick outside edge down to third man, who gets across to his left. A dive."
"drifts down leg, a wide."
"fullish delivery outside off, another thick outside edge down to third man"
"112 kph, strays on the pad, flicked away to deep square leg for a run"
"was there some glove? No. Byes. A bouncer down leg, Vohra misses his pull. The ball swerves and Uthappa can't collect cleanly. An extra"
"good single. Full delivery on off, pushed to mid-off for a run."
lovely timing but the field placing is really good. Strays on the pads and Vohra flicks away to deep backward square leg. Would have been four with the conventional fine leg
short and wide from Narine. Vohra cuts to extra cover. That should have been four
that one seamed back in. Vohra stayed back and punched a drive through extra cover. Nice timing
"four more. Really good batting. Flat, quick with a bit of width. Vohra opens the face to get four to third man. Very fine"
"good batting. Outside off, Vohra flicks through midwicket for a run"
"flat, spinning back in towards off. Pushed back"
"<strong>a massive appeal.</strong> No, says umpire Ravi. Was that juuuust outside off? Definitely hitting the stumps. Guptill planted his front foot forward and fell over his flick. I've seen those given, but seemed a good call to me. Oops, I was wrong. All three reds on HawkEye."
"back of a length on middle, a mis-timed pull over mid-on for a couple. No timing on that. Lobs over the fielder"
"a mow over midwicket. 108 kph slower ball on middle and leg, Vohra comes to the pitch and heaves the ball over the fielder. Good in that he didn't try to keep it down"
"on a length down leg, off the pad to the keeper. Missed out on four more"
"gets this over the off-side infield and Vohra gets four more. Gave himself room, anticipating a straight delivery. Vohra guides the ball over point for four"
that's a bad delivery. Strays down leg for a wide
"and given! Yes, seemed like glove. A short delivery down leg. Vohra wanted to play this fine because fine leg is more towards square leg. In doing that, he tried to get underneath the ball - like a scoop - rather than with the flat bat. Kisses the glove and carries to Uthappa. That wasn't a good delivery, but Umesh won't care"
"fullish delivery outside off, pushed to mid-off"
"93 kph, flat down leg, clipped to short fine leg."
"just enough turn to beat the bat. Flat delivery outside off, the ball spins past the edge. Lovely length"
"flat and straight, pushed away towards cover for a run to get off the mark"
"flat delivery outside off, spinning back in. Punched to mid-off"
"this is given by umpire Ravi. A flat delivery on off and middle, Guptill gets really low to try and sweep over backward square leg but just can't miss it, especially with that kind of shot. It struck him in line with off, and looked out-er than the previous one. Kings XI stumble"
"flat and straight, played out"
"a slower ball on middle, pushed away to long-on"
"good length outside off, tapped towards point for a single. A good, tight run"
"good length on off, flicked away to deep square leg"

"another good length delivery on off, played away towards point."
"this is fuller and wider, guided to third man for a run"

"nagging line towards off, dabbed towards point. A tight single"
"full and wide outside off, pushed away to deep cover"
"short and wide outside off, 131 kph. Do not bowl there to Marsh. Goes underneath the cut"
"128 kph, off the inside edge. Good length on off, Marsh gets a thick edge which somehow misses the stumps. Lucky Marshy"
"oh delectable. Full and straight, overpitched. Marsh lays into his straight drive. It's as good a stroke as there is. Beats long-off."
"good length outside off, carved to third man for one"
too close to the third man. Good length on a fourth-stump line. Marsh misses a dab
"yikes, that looped over the batsman. A short delivery from Woakes that goes way over the head"
"bowled 'im. Big wicket. It's full, it's straight. Marsh plays the line but the ball seams back in late to beat the inside edge and clatter into off stump. Definite late lateral movement did for Marsh. Undone by a special ball. Kings XI in real trouble here, their season hangs in the balance"
"back of a length on off, blocked towards point. Nicely bowled, well played"
"full and wide outside off, sliced away to backward point. Another dot."
"136 kph, a bit of width outside off, carved down to third man for another single"
strays down leg for a wide
"full and straight, shovelled to midwicket for one"
"good length outside off, hammered to the sweeper cover."
"goes short outside off, Maxwell wants to ramp over the keeper but doesn't make contact. I'd be happy as a bowler if he made connection with that. Opens up the possibility of a catch at third man"
flicked away through backward square leg for a couple
nudged to midwicket for a run. A fumble but no damage
"125 kph, slower ball outside off, played down towards backward point"
good length on middle. pushed to midwicket
"full and straight, blocked away to cover. Solid as ..."
"133 kph, a bouncer on off. Saha misses his upper cut. These are all crucial dot balls"
"good stop by Lynn. Full and straight, flicked away to the left of Lynn who dives on his left shoulder and saves two"
"a slower ball outside off, goes through Uthappa as he is unable to make contact. A bye."
"full and straight, played back to the bowler. Another tidy over. Overs ticking by"
"fullish and wide, dabbed down to third man"
"full outside off, driven towards cover. Yusuf anticipated, went right, then went left, the ball went over him for a couple. Took pace off the shot"
"over the fielder for six. A slower ball outside off, Maxwell gets under that and hammers his lofted drive over long-on. The fielder came in and then went back, too late"
drifts down leg for a wide
"that's six more. Not a good delivery. Short delivery down leg, Maxwell swivels into a pull and the ball goes waaaay back. Momentum"
"good length on off, dabbed down to short third man"
"a couple more. Full and straight, flicked through backward square leg for another brace. Great over"
"short down leg, off the pad down to fine leg. Missed out on some runs"
"a top-edge over the keeper for four. Flat on off, Saha is in no control of his pull. The ball flies over the keeper and towards fine leg"
a flat-batted pull to deep square leg for a run
"short and wide outside off, 140 kph. Maxwell misses a cut. Width. A missed opportunity"
"picks the length early and boom. Flat on middle, pulled through midwicket for four. Great execution. Intentionally hit that in front of square"
"good finish. A yorker on off and middle, dug out towards mid-off"
"flat on off and middle, punched to cover, who parries the ball for a run. Seems to have hurt something"
"flat on off and middle, pulled to deep square leg. Looked out, but the throw bobbles towards the keeper. A better throw would have had Saha. The third umpire confirms Saha's dive saved him"
good batting. Big boundaries. Worked towards square leg and called for two right away. Knew what he wanted all along. Gets it
shimmies down and flicks to square leg
worked away down to short fine leg for a single
"a googly down leg, Saha misses his sweep, off the pad towards square leg"
"flat on off, hit away to long-off"
"flat on leg, flicked to deep midwicket for a single"
"nicely hit by Saha. Gives himself room, opens up some space and slaps a stroke past cover and long-off"
pushed away to long-on for a run.
"big boundaries again. Flat delivery on leg, Maxwell mis-times a cut towards midwicket but gets two because the fielder is on the boundary"
worked away to deep square leg. Another tidy over for Kings XI
"goes big. Goes Massive. A googly on leg, Maxwell gets underneath that and slugs it a long way over midwicket. Got underneath that sufficiently and that was enough"
another big hit. It's straight which allows Maxwell to get underneath that again. Goes a long way over midwicket again. 89 metres.
"superb catch by Woakes. A googly from Kuldeep, very wide outside off. Maxwell can't hold back, why would he? He chooses a good option too, a lofted drive over cover but can't quite get enough behind that. It hangs in the air for a while before settling in Woakes' hands, who ran across from long-off to take a quality catch. Made a tough catch look incredibly easy, both hands too."
"more flight outside off, inside-edged into the pad with a sweep"
cut away towards extra cover for a tight single. Gambhir can't save the single
"another googly outside off, defended back. Excellent comeback from Kuldeep"
"flat and wide outside off, flat-batted down to long-on"

"overpitched outside off, drilled to long-off"
"shortish delivery outside off, Saha's swat finds deep midwicket on the bounce."
"nicely bowled. Flat and slow outside off, some spin beats the bat of Axar"
"full and straight, nudged away to midwicket. Tidy over and spell from Narine"
"flat delivery outside off, Axar's slog skews off the inside half towards deep midwicket"
"sees Saha coming so bowls the googly extremely wide outside off, hit away to long-off. Great bowling"
"that's overpitched, too full. But the field backed him. Overly wide outside off, crashed past cover for a run to deep cover"
"goes over the boundary. Not great timing but got enough distance. A wrong 'un outside off, Saha gets underneath that sufficiently and sliced it over long-on"
"a flat delivery on off, mis-timed pull to deep midwicket for a couple more"
excellent bowling again. Sees Saha coming but delivers his googly well outside off. Gets underneath Saha's bat and Uthappa does the rest. A wide signalled but worth it to get a set man at this stage.
"another googly outside off, slapped away to wide long-off for a couple."
"a slower ball, straight. Pace off. Excellently bowled. Pushed to long-off"
"chops on. 129 kph. Good length delivery outside off, Swapnil opts to pull but can't quite get his bat in line with the ball. He plays over the ball slightly and the ball clatters into leg stump. Keeps a charge in check does wickets"
"132 kph, he does so with his first ball. Back of a length outside off, Tewatia's pull is over the line again. The ball creeps underneath"
"lovely stroke. Full and wide this time, in the slot. Tewatia goes deep in his crease and lofts the ball over cover for four. Great shot selection too"
"short on off and middle, Tewatia walks across, sees a short delivery and Tewatia pulls over short fine leg. Excellent execution this"
"great end. A yorker on leg and middle, jammed out towards the keeper for a run. Good over again for Kings XI despite the wicket"
"a slower delivery on off, a big sweep is under-edged to square leg for a run"
"a low full toss on off, drilled down to long-off. Just one. Excellent bowling that."
"a slower delivery on leg, Tewatia misses a sweep and is struck in front of leg. A big appeal from Rajpoot but that pitched well outside leg."
"whoa. That was close. Full on off, an offcutter. Axar misses a slog and is struck right in front of off and middle. That looked plumb. Umpire Ravi says no to the appeal. Leg bye"
"picked his spot and executed really well. A full delivery on off, Tewatia gets underneath this and sweeps this over square leg for four. Lovely execution."
"a yorker outside off, played away towards cover for a run. Good finish."
"starts with a languid caress for four. fullish, too much width, and he just plonks forward and strokes this away to the left of extra-cover"
"and another. Full again, a bit of width, no swing, and a smooth swing of Narine's bat lifts this effortlessly over mid-off"
"Sandeep goes for the yorker instead, right up there on middle stump. Jams his bat down to keep it out"
"goes for that yorker again, ends up bowling a low full-toss angling into Narine's leg stump. Looks to hit over long-on, only manages to get the bottom of his bat on it, and it loops up but bounces well short of long-on"
"too. Much. Width. Full and wide, and Lynn slaps it away over cover point"
"back of a length on off stump, punched towards mid-off"
"oh, finds the edge first ball. Length ball just outside off. Lynn clears his front leg and looks to slog over wide mid-on, only manages a thick edge that flies between keeper and the lone wide slip"
"another slog, this time off a back-of-a-length ball, a bit straighter. Drags it to the right of the fielder at deep square leg, and Guptill makes an excellent sprinting, diving save at the boundary"
"fuller now, on off stump. Lynn clears his front leg and smacks it along the ground to mid-on. Couldn't really get under this"
"bouncer, and that's run away for a lucky boundary. He's a little late on the hook, takes his eye off the ball, and he's lucky fine leg is inside the circle. Flies way over the fielder and bounces a few yards in front of the rope"
"very full, in the blockhole on middle and off, makes a bit of room to jab that powerfully to extra-cover. The ball bounces off the fielder's hands, towards mid-off, and they run a single"
"back of a length on off stump, Narine clears his front leg and swats this to mid-off. He loves hitting through mid-off"
"yorker again, on the stumps, gets his feet out of the way to stab to mid-off"
"looks for the yorker again, but this ends up as a half-volley, and Lynn drives powerfully down the ground. Long-off is back, but he has no chance - this is hit fiercely to the fielder's left"
"slower short ball outside off, Lynn had cleared that front leg, looking for something fuller and closer to him, and was surprised by this ball. Elects to leave it alone"
"another slower short ball, shorter still. Lynn looks to play a tennis-style smash through midwicket, only manages to toe-end, on the bounce, to the keeper"
leg-stump yorker. Gets that front foot out of the way and blocks this to the left of extra-cover
"looks for the yorker again, and Narine, moving his front leg towards the leg side to make himself a bit of hitting room, looks to go over mid-off. Doesn't time it, and ends up hitting the low full-toss loopily to the right of the mid-off fielder"
"starts the over with a leg-stump bouncer, and Narine, clearing his front leg and looking for that slog down the ground again, is in no position to play it. Ducks quickly to evade it"
"Slower ball, not full enough to deny Narine elevation, and the angle across him affords a bit of width too. Makes a bit more room with that front leg going out of the way, and lofts cleanly over extra-cover"
"back of a length, angling into off stump. Exactly what Narine's looking for. Clears that front leg and swings through the line to drive between mid-off and extra-cover"
"bowled 'im! Another slower one from Mohit - this one's the offcutter - sent down full and straight, attacking middle stump. Brave ball to bowl, but Narine didn't pick it, swung too early, swung across the line, and Kings XI finally have a breakthrough"
"back of a length, angling across towards off stump. Gambhir jumps back and across to defend"
"back of a length, attacking Gambhir's body. Looks to jump across and work this through the leg side, can't put bat to ball. Ends up hitting him on the hip"
"flat ;ength ball, but a bit of width, and Lynn slaps it away, off the front foot, to the right of cover point"
"and again, finds the gap to the right of cover point. Bowling without a sweeper is so difficult for a left-arm spinner, and this wasn't a bad ball. Back of a length on off stump, made room and slapped it away"
"back of a length, on middle stump this time, makes room and punches with a straight bat to mid-off"
"shortish, a bit of width, punched to cover"
"length ball, tossed up a bit slower outside off, uses his wrists to work that to square leg"
"ooh, good ball. Length ball on off stump, Gambhir shapes to work it through midwicket, but it doesn't turn, and he gets a bit of a leading edge down to mid-off"
"back of a length on off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and pokes it into the point region"
"yorker on off stump, jams his bat down to squeeze it out to cover point"
"bouncer, and that's a stunning shot. Lynn seemed a little unprepared for it initially, in that 'ready position' with his front leg out of the way, and he had to reach for it from wide outside off stump, but he keeps his shape, stays balanced, and swats it away over midwicket"
"full-toss, around hip high, angling into the body, and Lynn clears his left leg and mows it away over midwicket for his first six of the day"
"slower ball, quite full, Lynn drags this from outside off towards long-on"
"back of a length on middle stump, Gambhir shuffles across and tucks this to short fine leg. Timed that really well - slightly better placement and he'd have got four for it"
"shortish outside off, and this is a good ball now with the field restrictions over and the sweeper out at deep cover point. Slapped away for one"
"slowish length ball outside off, Gambhir comes forward and whips to midwicket"
"quicker one, on off stump, goes back to chop it down towards backward point"
"quick, flat length ball on middle and leg. Goes back, stays leg-side of the ball, and blocks it back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to sweeper cover"
"slower this time, back of a length close to off stump, goes on the back foot to dab to backward point"
"ooh, big turn first up. Back of a length on midddle and leg, and this spins sharply away. Lynn is surprised, just pokes it defensively into the covers"
"length ball on middle and off, goes back to work it to long-on"
"back of a length, straightens towards off stump and denies Gambhir room as he backs away to cut. Chops it back down the pitch to the bowler"
"very full outside leg. Looks to sweep, gets only pad on it, down to short fine leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, makes a bit of room to punch to long-off"
"shortish on middle stump, Gambhir rocks back quickly and pulls to deep midwicket"
"back of a length, quickish, on off stump. Gambhir looks to pull, only manages a bottom-edge onto pad, and it rolls away into the short fine leg region"
"quick dart on off stump, back of a length, makes some room to flat-bat to long-off"
"shortish outside off, slapped away down to long-off"
down the track and Swapnil bowls it flat and angles this into leg stump to deny swinging room. Punches it down to long-off for another single
"fuller now, wide of off. Too wide, and Lynn just ignores it"
"back of a length again, on off stump, flat-batted to long-off"
"full-toss on middle stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, Gambhir makes room and slaps to cover. Bit of a mix-up, Lynn wanted a single. Vohra throws to the right end, but inaccurately, and Lynn scrambles back as the bowler dives and tries to collect the throw"
"full outside off, driven to long-off to bring up another fifty - Lynn's third of the season"
"tossed up on leg stump, and Gambhir - having been tied down for 17 balls - sees a boundary opportunity, clears his front leg, and slogs hard. Big outfield here, and he doesn't hit this all that cleanly, and all he ends up doing is picking out deep midwicket"
"back of a length on leg stump, worked away towards deep midwicket"
"googly, and Uthappa may have picked this, but he's also picked out a fielder. Looks for the slog-sweep. This was bowled slower so he had to manufacture the power himself, doesn't really manage it. And what a superb catch that is. Axar sprints to his right from deep midwicket, dives, and takes it a foot from the ground with both hands"
"googly, and I don't know if Lynn has picked this. Quicker than the previous one, on the shorter side of a good length. Props forward and defends it after it spins back into him, towards middle and leg"
"flat length ball on off stump, defended into the covers"
"back of a length on middle stump, defended to midwicket"
"flat and back of a length again, on middle and leg. Pandey plays with a straight bat and midwicket dives right to stop it"
"back of a length on off stump, makes a bit of room to stab that to deep point"
"speared in round-arm, on leg stump, punched to the left of midwicket"
"back of a length, at Pandey's pads, tucked away to deep square leg"
"floated up very full on off stump, gets his front leg out of the way and jabs to extra-cover"
"tossed up outside off, driven past the right hand of the diving extra-cover fielder, down to long-off"
"flighty and full, almost a leg-stump yorker, clipped away through square leg"
"length ball on middle and off, held this one back just a bit, and Pandey had to stretch forward to defend into the covers"
"again a slow length ball outside off, the amount of grip and turn he's getting is allowing him to bowl like this. Shows the full face to drive to long-off"
flat length ball on the pads. Can't open up and bring his bat down quickly enough to connect with the flick. Rolls off the pad to the left of the keeper
"shortish outside off, makes room and punches this away to the right of the man at deep point. Axar moves quickly to his right to stop it"
"flat length ball wide of off, flat-batted powerfully, in the air, to the left of long-off, and Guptill has to sprint and dive to stop that"
"speared in quick, round-arm. Back of a length at the body, not short enough to pull, and he only manages a bottom-edge into his thigh"
"swinging room, but he had to swing quickly. That was fired in flat and wide of off stump. Lynn looked to take on long-on, and he just cleared Maxwell despite not hitting as cleanly as he'd have liked"
"flat and back of a length, wide of off again, slapped away to sweeper cover"
"tossed up on middle and leg, driven inside-out to extra-cover"
flat length ball on middle and leg. Stays on the back foot to punch back to the bowler
"flat, back of a length, on leg stump. Gets his front leg out of the way, brings down a straight bat to punch to long-on"
"length ball on middle stump, slogged on the bounce to deep midwicket"
"wide signalled. Interesting. Lynn moved away from leg stump, exposing all three stumps. Tewatia fired it full and wide of off stump, Lynn moved back in and simply left it."
"length ball wide of off, flat-batted to sweeper cover"
"tossed up wide of off stump, and this time the length is just right for Pandey - not full enough to deny elevation, not short enough to make him wonder about how much it could turn - and he uses the swinging room to whip that away, in the air, between long-on and deep midwicket"
"a step down the pitch now, flicks this flighted ball to the right of long-on"
"back of a length on off stump, makes himself room to punch to deep point"
"back of a length outside off, and Lynn gives himself a bit more room and flat-bats it with awesome power and easily clears long-off"
"short and wide, slapped away to the left of deep extra-cover. I think they've moved cover point in and pushed extra-cover back"
"fired in flat at the pads, clipped to midwicket"
"flat, follows Lynn's movement away from leg stump, flat-bats down to long-on"
back of a length on middle and leg and he goes deep in his crease to work this through square leg
looks for the leg-stump yorker. Lynn whips the low full-toss to deep square leg.
"slower ball, on a good length on off stump. Looks to slog it away but only manages to drag it off the inside half of the bat to the left of short fine leg"
"nice and full on middle stump, clears his front leg and swipes it away to deep midwicket"
down the track and Sandeep looks to york him. Nice swing of the bat to middle that low off-stump full-toss and hit it on the bounce to long-on
"full-toss, thigh-high, angling into the batsman's body. He's bowling for that front leg moving away, and manages to cramp Lynn. Slogs at it, doesn't middle it, lands safely to the right of deep midwicket"
"down the track and Sandeep nails the off-stump yorker, squeezed away into the covers"
"slower length ball on off stump, clears his front leg and slogs on the bounce to long-on"
"low full-toss on middle and leg, well bowled. Gets his front leg out of the way to drive to long-off"
"oh, excellent slower ball outside off. A lot slower than Pandey may have expected. Knuckleball, stays low, beats Pandey's across-the-line slog and rolls down to the keeper"
"another slower one. Back of the hand this time, a touch wider. The leg-cut action on it took it away from Pandey, and again he slogs and misses"
"slower offcutter now, he's going through his full range here. Back of a length, closer to off stump, swiped down to long-on, all along the ground"
"looks for the off-stump yorker, misses his length by a few inches, and Lynn hammers it for four. Ends up close to being a half-volley, and he clears his front leg and smashes it back over the bowler's head, easily beating long-off to his right. Such a good over, spoiled by one that went a few inches wrong. The margins of T20."
"that's a super slower ball, a dipping full one, out of the back of the hand, on leg stump, and he's taken out Pandey. Looks for the big whip over midwicket, doesn't time it at all, and Axar takes a simple catch at deep midwicket"
"run-out ends Lynn's innings, and this could be pivotal! Full, angling into off stump. Looks to clear his front leg and smash it to long-on, mistimes and drags it square. Rolls towards deep midwicket, they chance a second to keep Lynn on strike. Slightly tired legs, a super accurate throw from Axar, on the bounce and into the keeper's gloves, and Saha does the rest with the batsman still out by a foot or so"
"yorker on off stump, swiped away to Axar at deep midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, angling in from wide of the crease. Clubbed down to long-on"
"slower short ball, angling into off stump, pulled away to fine leg"
"full, quite a bit of width, and that's put away well by CdG. Cover point was inside the circle, extra cover was back, and he slices it up and over point to pick up four"
"and he strikes first ball. Slower ball, back of a length, Yusuf takes a stride out, slogs, and can't get enough power behind this, hits it down long-on's throat. The big boundaries here make the slower one such a potent weapon"
"very full, close to off stump, opens his bat face and jabs to backward point"
"another slower one. This is the wide-ish length ball, the back-of-the-hand one that jags away. Woakes slogs across the line and misses"
"back of a length, closer to off stump this time, and that's stunning power from Woakes, quick hands through the slog-pull, and he clears the leaping Axar running to his left from deep midwicket"
"quick full-toss, shin high, angling into middle and leg. Woakes is surprised by that, he's late bringing his bat down - wants to make room and punch through cover, only manages an inside-edge that rolls to Saha"
"another full-toss, this one is low and outside off and swerves in just a touch, late. Just pokes at it, gets a bottom-edge that bounces towards the keeper for another stolen single"
"looks for the wide-ish yorker, CdG only manages a sliced drive to the left of sweeper cover"
"oh, well bowled. Off-stump yorker. Backs away to try and squeeze it through backward pojnt, can only get an inside edge, past his stumps, to the left of the keeper"
"oh, another yorker. On middle and leg this time. Gets his front leg out of the way and flicks to long-on. And what's up here, they're appealing for a run-out. They chanced two and just about got it. Direct hit from Maxwell at the keeper's end may have got CdG, but it went to Saha first."
"they need a six desperately, CdG runs down the pitch, and Sandeep adjusts his length to bowl it close enough to him to deny any elevation. Digs it out to long-on and they only get one"
"another yorker. This one is wide of off stump. That's because Woakes was moving across, looking for the scoop over short fine. Sandeep won't give him that. Sneaks it under his bat"
"finishes with a slower ball, and this is a sensational win for Kings XI. Back of a length, Woakes slogs across the line and misses, and the ball loops over the top of middle stump and rolls to Saha"
