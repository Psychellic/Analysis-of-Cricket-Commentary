"106kph, wide half volley, he square drives firmly to deep point"
"<strong>run out by a direct hit going for two! Warner unbelievable from deep midwicket!</strong> Babar just knocked this outside the circle at midwicket, he ran one to reach his 12th T20I fifty, he called for two, Warner raced in off the rope, picked up one hand and whipped the throw in off balance, and hit the base of the striker's stumps! Babar dived but was inches short. Unreal from Warner"
