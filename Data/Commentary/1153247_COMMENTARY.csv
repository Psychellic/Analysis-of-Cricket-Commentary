Short of length from Bhuvneshwar, not one to be pulled easily, Fakhar takes the risk, top-edges and it goes really high. Chahal goes a bit to his left and back from midwicket, the sun in his eyes and he just about holds on to it. Rohit waits and then holds his hands together with a beaming smile"

Dhoni sticks his right hand out, and the ball sticks in his hand, but it bounces off his gloves as he tries to control his dive. Big chance gone down as the teams break for <b>drinks</b>"

"right through him and that's hit top of off! A classic delivery from Kuldeep to show how he deceives batsmen. The line was just a bit different from the first ball, it pitched on middle and Babar stepped down to flick it away with the turn, but it was a <b>wrong'un</b> and missed the outside edge by a distance, and goes on to hit the off stump. Dhoni is standing there looking at off stump, no need for a stumping.

stays back and pushes the ball into the cover from outside off
"<b>direct hit</b> from Rayudu, Malik is run out! Not a 100% effort to come back from Malik after he was refused the run. Asif tapped the ball behind square on off and Malik wanted the run and sprinted out, Asif didn't want it and Rayudu was on the ball in no time, he swooped down and darted in a direct hit at the non-striker's end and Malik wasn't stretching fully to make it back"
