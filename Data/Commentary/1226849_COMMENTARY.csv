"short slower ball on middle, he backs away and mistimes a horizontal bat shot to mid off for one"
""
"carved over fine backward point for four!  Full and wide, with a flourish he lifted it up and over backward point using his hands superbly"
works it down to long-on
"<b>taken on the midwicket boundary</b>. Maddinson goes for the pull shot, having backed away from his crease. Richardson followed him with a short ball meant to cramp him up. Must have done enough because he picks out the fielder"
"slower ball from around the wicket, he waits on it and clips behind square leg"
"makes room on the leg side, but Tye follows him, ensuring a dot ball. Coulter-Nile is denied his hitting range and worse takes a hit on the body"
now he moves across his crease and a back of a length ball on leg stump slips down. Very very tight call that from the ump
"wanders away outside leg again but Tye zeroes in on him, searching for the blockhole. Comes out a full toss which is bunted to long-on"
pulls a back of a length ball - from around the wicket again - through midwicket
gets enough on it and it sails over midwicket. A front foot pull shot full of power from Coulter-Nile
<b>This one's a miscue</b> and the captain back-pedals from mid-on to take a fine catch. Coulter-Nile searches for leverage that isn't there and this full ball on middle and leg ends up more or less going straight up
nudges a back of a length ball on leg stump through midwicket
"looks to force the pace through the off side, but he's losing a lot of his timing, only manages an inside edge back down the pitch"

comes down the track and cuts the shorter flatter delivery outside off to the sweeper
taps a flighted delivery on middle to long-on

over extra cover! Clears the front leg. Uses the angle of the bowler from around the wicket and clatters it to the boundary
"another one over extra cover, only this time it's more of a splice. Goes high in the air, doesn't go the distance, and it's only two"
hammers it through the covers. This time the bowler gives him a bit of room too - in addition to what he is creating by clearing the front leg. So all that's left to do is hit the ball as hard as possible and Larkin does
around the wicket experiment is done. Returns over and nails a yorker just outside off to beat the right-hander
"good effort on the point boundary by Livingstone, diving to stop a well hit cut shot from beating him on his right and going for four"

"shapes to upper cut a short ball angled across him, but he doesn't make contact. Throws his head down in disappointment. He knows he missed out on a boundary"
"<b>gone, scooping the ball</b>! Scoreboard pressure gets to him in the end. Might also have been tiring. That combination results in his basically directing the ball off the high part of his bat onto his stumps. A length ball on target. Larkin tries to make too much of it, getting across his stumps and then down on one knee and in the end pays for it."
"full toss on middle from around the wicket, works it behind square leg"
inside edge onto body and they pinch a quick single before the bowler can run up the pitch and fling a throw at the strikers' end

"low full toss, slogs it away to deep midwicket"
"hammers it down the ground - too short, too easy, one-bounce four"
short again - but this time it's to his field. There's a man at the sweeper and that's who Hinchliffe finds.
"low full toss outside off, he swings it to long-off"
slices the almost wide yorker away but there's a sweeper protecting the square boundary on the off side.
"tries to correct his mistake and goes over cover this time as Richardson misses the blockhole again, but there's not enough power in the shot."
"carves it but straight to the sweeper. Three attempted yorkers, three not quite hitting the mark, still Scorchers ahead"
smashes it over long-on. That's the power the Stars have been looking for at the back end. It's coming all too late though
"shifts his plans after four yorkers go completely awry and targets the batsman's head with a bouncer. And it's a quick one too. Cartwright tries to pull, but it's on him too soon, hits the glove, then his helmet and results in a single somewhere behind square leg. Quick concussion check and he's okay"
whips it to the deep midwicket fielder. And that's that.
