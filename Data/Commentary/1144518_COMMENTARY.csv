"<strong></strong>big nick! Or is it?! Given not out with Gulbadin driving well away from his body. <strong>Sarfaraz calls for the review!</strong> Seemed completely obvious live that he edged that ball but Nigel Llong didn't think so. Sarfaraz took an eternity to review overthinking things, i.e., was it so obvious that it wasn't an edge after all? Of course it was! Ultra-edge shows a clear spike when ball passes bat. Umpire Llong changes his signal."
"<strong>he's on a hat-trick! What a whirlwind over!</strong> Not the best ball to be fair. Full and angling down leg, should have been ticked through fine leg for four but Hashmatullah is out in front of the ball and his attempt to play it through the leg side results in a leading edge that balloons over Shaheen towards mid-off. Imad jogs 10 yards left and takes it at waist height in stride."

"given some more air, and gets a bit of turn from outside off, but he rocks back and slashes through point"

"<b>leading edge goes to short cover</b>. This was also bowled at 96kph, but Imad got it to grip and hold on the pitch. Also got it to turn gently. Rahmat thought there's a straightforward single for the taking to midwicket, but found that he had brought his bat down too early, and the leading edge pops up for a simple catch"

"nicely floated up on off, and he's caught hanging back, defends from the crease"
"quicker one now, and he hurriedly chops it down towards gully"

comes on the front foot to turn this into the legside for a quick single
"tossed up on the stumps, clipped off his toes to long-on"
"<b>slam bang, six again</b>. Asghar's not hanging back. He's reading the length well too, and choosing the right balls to skip down the track to. This time he lifts this over wide long-on after getting to the pitch of it"
"and well done again, good length outside off, big stride out to nudge this into the legside and take a quick single with the in-field hanging back"
"<b>he's on fire!</b>. Bad ball, too short and given room outside off, and he flays it nonchalantly to the point boundary. Didn't move his feet, but didn't need to because he was well balanced and timed and placed it perfectly"
"predictable bouncer as a response from Wahab, but too short and he can duck under it without any hassle"
"length ball across him, tucked towards mid-on and sets off for a very quick single. Fielder doesn't collect cleanly running in, so all safe"

Talked into it by Shadab. </strong> He was hit a long way down the pitch but was struck on the back pad in line with off stump as it beat him through the gap. Ball-tracking shows... <b>umpire's call!</b> Umpire Paul Wilson breathes a sigh of relief. That would have been the third overturned decision of the match and we're only just past the halfway point of the first innings. Pakistan retains their review though.

"yorker on fourth stump at 139 kph/86 mph, stabbed out to backward point."
"another wide yorker at 140 kph/87 mph on fifth stump, stabbed out off a toe edge to third man on the boundary."
"in the blockhole once more on fourth stump, driven to the cover sweeper and <strong>they've inexplicably not taken a run!</strong> Shinwari is furious with Mujeeb, who has apparently miscounted the number of balls and not realized that was the sixth ball. Mujeeb will be on strike to start the 50th. Or is Shinwari upset at the scorers claiming the board showed 48.4? He's voluntarily not run. A brainfade either way."
"Mujeeb backs away to a slower ball on a good length wide on fifth stump, out in front slapping at it in vain catching air in the end."
"another slower ball on a fullish length tighter to the stumps on fourth stump, Mujeeb out in front of it again."
"hat-trick of slower balls outside off stump, this one at 118 kph, as Mujeeb still can't lay bat on ball. Shinwari only has himself to blame for the miscalculation at the end of the last over."
"goes for the full pace at 136 kph and Mujeeb slashes an edge wide over Sarfaraz for four, third man very square on the rope."
"another slower ball wide outside off that Mujeeb swings over. If it ain't broke, don't fix it Mr. Amir!"
attempted yorker on leg stump is a low full toss slapped to long-on and they hare back for a tight second. The throw to Sarfaraz beat Mujeeb in plenty of time but dragged Sarfaraz four yards wide to the left of the stumps. He tries to flick on for a runout to deny the second run but misses as Mujeeb collides trying to make his ground. Could have been a third on an overthrow to third man but Mujeeb wasn't able to get back to his feet with Shinwari wanting to come back.
"on the spot, outside off, big stride out to defend"
"<b>strikes second ball!</b>. Given lbw but the batsman goes up to review. That looked out on first sight. Pitched on a length and spun in, carrom ball, beat his defensive prod to strike him on the pad. Bat and pad are very close to together, and there is a spike. I think it's of ball hitting pad, there's a gap between ball and bat. The third umpire's thinking the same. And ball tracking shows three reds! So not only have Pakistan lost Fakhar, they've lost a review too."

"strays down leg that time, flicks the pad on the way to short fine leg"
"<b>big shout</b> for lbw. Not given but Naib is going for a review. I think he must have been struck outside the line. Offspinner pitched outside off and Babar was coming on the front foot to defend, but had his off-stump covered. No bat involves, but yes, it's well outside the line. Strange review, and they've lost it. Maybe they thought he wasn't playing a shot, so impact wouldn't matter?"
"too full on the pads, flicked to deep square leg. Mis-field, or rather a fumble, allows a second"

"googly on the pads, rolls to short fine leg off the pads but they take a single. Imad will be on strike for the final over"
"another full toss outside off, flayed through the offside but he has protection in the deep. Terrible bowling by Gulbadin"
"strays down leg, Wahab doesn't connect with the big heave, so it rolls off his pad to short fine leg"
"very full outside off, driven fluently to cover, who relays a straight throw to Naib <b>who fumbles it with the batsman hout of his crease</b>. Not only that he lets it slip, and they steal a second. Gulbadin's every nightmare coming alive."
"<b>Imad has done it</b>! another full toss outside off, and he keeps icy calm to thread this through cover, bisects the field and sends this to the boundary. <b>Pakistan are roaring and alive</b> in the World Cup 2019. What a win!"
