"<b>won't get away this time!</b> He's been done by his own technique adjustment. Perhaps the loose shots from the last Test have prompted him to shuffle and get close to off stump.

Mahmudullah is caught on the crease while still moving across. Plumb. Bat blocked by leg, which was pressing forward and the looking to get back and really, just a big mess of his own doing."
