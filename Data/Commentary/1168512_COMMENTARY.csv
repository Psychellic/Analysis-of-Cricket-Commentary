"he's a little squared up as Jayed gets the ball to straighten off the pitch. And since the length is beautiful as well - full but not drivable - Hope is stuck in his crease, playing towards mid-on. Ends up getting a leading edge into the covers"
solid forward defensive
drives sweetly to mid-off
"lovely shape again from Jayed, the outswing making sure Ambris' attempted flick through midwicket ends up near the point boundary"
<b>top shot</b>! Spots the short ball early and wallops it to the midwicket boundary
another short ball and another dismissive put-away! Mashrafe is too slow to be bowling that length. Especially when it doesn't even rise up to his hips. Ambris swivels in his back foot and pulls it behind square
straying on the pads again and Ambris dabs it to the left of short fine leg
swing and miss as Mashrafe switches his line outside off. Plenty of room for the cut shot but maybe he goes at it too hard and loses his shape
targets the top of off and Ambris shuffles in his crease to flick the ball through straight midwicket
"back of a length around off stump, he taps it to cover"
"<b>top shot again</b>! He's very good on the drive and Jayed offers up the invitation, pitching the ball up and offering room for Ambris to free the arms and lift it over extra cover"
fullish and this time he swings the ball into the right-hander - good tricks - and Ambris shows it some respect
<b>laces it through the covers</b>. Outstanding shot from Ambris. He looks in a mood today. Although it doesn't take a genius to send a wide half volley packing
chops the back of a length delivery on off stump to deep third man
"another lovely drive, this time from Hope, as he stride forward confidently to the ball outside off. Finds mid-off though"
"keeps him in his crease by pulling the length back. Hope is as careful as ever, defending the ball right under his eyes"
cuts a shortish delivery to point. Not quite enough room to go full throttle
"good technique, allowing the full, slightly slower, ball to come to him, and then artfully flicking it to midwicket"
hits the deck a little harder and gets some response as the back of a length ball straigtens to take Ambris' outside edge behind point
too easy as Mashrafe slips into the pads and Hope flicks it away to the backward square leg boundary.
full on off stump and Hope is on the drive immediately. Solidly hit but Mashrafe gets down to stop it himself
flicks a back of a length ball down to short fine leg
"<b>shot of the morning</b>! How he leeeeeans into that cover drive! Even as that ball swings away, attempting to escape his magic hands. But Hope holds his shape, moves his front leg across to the ball, gets nice and low over the ball, and then gently directs it to the boundary"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
blocks the fuller delivery on off stump to mid-off
loads up the drive again but finds mid-off
blocks the good length ball that shapes into the right-hander just a tiny bit
"another glorious drive from Hope, this time straighter of cover. There's a man inside the circle, diving to his right to save a certain boundary. <b>Delicious strokeplay</b> starting from the measured front foot stride and the conscious decision to only time the ball"
pulls the short ball to deep square leg. Mashrafe looks ridiculously out of sorts this morning. Too slow. Too stiff. And too wayward
nudges a fuller delivery to mid-on
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"angles the shortish ball into the right-hander, and Ambris, even as he tries to make room, isn't able to get enough to play a full-blooded cut shot. Just a tap to point"
"gooone! Tame end to a promising innings and Mashrafe barely celebrates. Just glowers at everything in sight as if blaming it for his poor form until this very moment, when a shortish delivery outside off stump is basically guided to a wide slip fielder like it's catching practice. Soumya dives to his right and picks up a smart catch"
"good length, outside off, from round the wicket. Bravo covers the off stump and lets it go"
"loops it up on off stump, and a tame, loopy offbreak suddenly takes on threatening proportions when it dips on the right-hander. Hope has to hurry into a block"
"pushes forward and drives to mid-on. Good start from Mehidy. Targeting the stumps, lovely flight too"
angles it into off stump and the full ball just straightens enough for Bravo to be wary of and defend
"this slides on with the arm - natural variation - and Bravo plays for turn, blocking on off stump, only to get an inside edge through square leg"
"lunges forward to try and get to the pitch of the ball a shade outside off, and though he isn't there, he tries to bring his wrists into the drive and try and whip the ball to cover. Doesn't quite pull it off"
this time he does reach the ball on the half-volley outside off and nails it to the long-off boundary
tries to tuck away the shortish delivery from round the wicket through midwicket. Can't hit the gap
"goes for an on the up drive through the covers and because the ball gets big on him, he yanks the bottom hand off the bat"
launches it down the ground! Outrageous shot from Bravo. Just plants his front leg down and because there's room on offer he just goes after the ball. That means a short ball has been slapped straight down the ground. Wicked!
"back of a length on off stump, Bravo defends"
"plays with soft hands, looking to pinch a single off a short ball that comes up to his chest. No such luck"
"good length on off stump, defends it"
"goes back to nudge a good length ball to midwicket. Hope wants the single, Bravo doesn't. And in the end, they recover from the mix-up"
shifts his weight back because the ball is only on a good length and then punches it with the turn towards long-on
"another push towards long-on, but midwicket cuts across as well"
waits on the good length ball on off stump a little more this time to try and turn it behind square leg. Still no luck with the single
"there's the tossed up ball. After a few shorter ones to build pressure. Looking for a release shot, Hope?, asks Mehidy. Hope answers with a stout forward defensive"
stays back to the length ball on middle and drills it to long-on
too short and Hope just swivels on his back foot and pulls it down to the fine leg boundary. Easily done
"whips a short ball outside off away to deep midwicket. Outstanding shot. Needs to wait for the ball, wait till it's right under his eyes to executed it perfectly and he does."
"<b>dropped</b> by Mehidy! He's at point, running in to try and get under a steepler. Poor shot from Bravo, going for an on the up loft over the bowler's head but being beaten for lack of pace. Mehidy tracks it. He's goes for it. But he's really nowhere near it, having to dive forward and in the end, he doesn't even get his hands to it"
nudges a shortish delivery behind square leg
clips a shortish delivery on middle and off to short fine leg
defends a shortish delivery on off stump to point
<b>bit of a leading edge</b> as he tries to flick a tossed up ball on middle through mid-on. But it drifts away just a tiny bit and makes him get squared up. A tangled up block back to the bowler
turns the ball on middle through midwicket
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> and he has his man! Dropped him in the last over, traps him in this, with a slider on off stump. Bravo plays outside the line, looking for turn. There isn't any and he's pinned in front. Would probably have gone on to hit leg stump. At least in umpire Kettleborough's mind and we don't have DRS to get confirmation in this series."
"lovely dip, and it happens at the last second too, making Hope reach in front of himself to try and make contact with the ball on off stump"
quicker delivery on off stump and Chase flicks it to midwicket
a little too short that time and Chase has the opportunity to get off the mark with a punch to long-on
"<b>huge lbw shout</b> but umpire Neill thinks it might be sliding down. And he's right. Mashrafe finally gets his length right and the ball skids through as well, pitching on off stump and cutting into the right-hander, making him play across the line"
"drills it towards midwicket, where Mahmudullah falls over the ball and lets it through to the boundary"
"shapes to cut the ball, sensing there's enough room for it, but Mashrafe gets it to nip into the right-hander again, surprising Chase"
gets forward to block with an open face outside off. Finds point
"hits him on the thigh as Mashrafe hits the deck outside off and getting it to seam into Chase, hurry into him."
"<b>another lbw appeal</b> but umpire Neill says too high. Oooh, this is good stuff. Mashrafe's finally warmed up. He should be having bowled six overs and his indippers are causing all sorts of problems. Too much movement off the pitch keeps catching the batsman stuck in his crease, panicking and playing across the line"
"leans forward, getting to the pitch of the ball on middle and driving it to long-on"
"gets it past the right of slip. Not convincing, but it's still runs on the board. An intentional back foot glide, even though danger lurks. What's Chase thinking..."
"works it into the leg side, past midwicket"
<b>extra bounce</b> as Mehidy hits a good length outside off and surprises Hope who is trying to flick the ball to midwicket and has to yank his bottom hand off the bat
flicks through midwicket
drives smoothly to long-on
<b>inside edge</b> as Chase stays too upright while playing away from his body. The shot meant to skirt away through the covers goes instead to long leg
"good length ball on middle, Hope blocks and demands the single, but again he's met with an answer in the negative"
<b>top edge</b> but it lobs over the short fine leg fielder. The mis-hit is because Hope is into the pull shot too early and the short ball nearly does the trick
adjusts to Jayed's limited pace better as he now rocks back and across and cuts to deep point
stops on him and Hope <b>nearly pops a return catch</b>. Jayed's ability to keep it wicket to wicket will give him reward sooner or later
"slower ball on off stump, Hope dabs it towards point and sprints through. Good response from Chase too"
"looks to drive towards long-on, but Mehidy's drift secures a bit of a leading edge back to him"
"loops it up outside off, Hope lunges forward and across to block"
"picks the flatter trajectory early, going back to flick the ball through square leg"
"shimmies down the pitch but Mehidy pulls his length back just enough that Chase's flick is mistimed, and almost carries to midwicket"
"good length ball outside off, defends to cover"
"whips the full delivery on leg stump away to deep midwicket. Outstanding shot, especially seeing as he yanked his front foot back, which is right where the ball pitched, to open up room for the shot"

lifts a fuller delivery on middle away to deep midwicket
"goes for the on the up drive but Jayed doesn't really have the pace for those shots and it shows, mistimed hit to cover"

punches a length ball down the ground to long-on
gets the dip just right and the flick that Hope intends to keep along the ground goes in the air through midwicket

"goes back to force the ball down the ground, but hits straight to the bowler"
uses the depth of the crease well to flick a good length ball on middle behind square leg

"gone, West Indies are three down! Not the most wicket-taking of deliveries, back of a length and angling across to off stump. Looks to play a forcing back-foot flick, and plays a little early and ends up popping a simple catch to midwicket"
"back of a length, nips in from outside off to cramp Carter a little as he tries to dab down to third man. Can only play a defensive jab in the end"

"given! Back of a length, angling into the stumps, and he's caught on the crease as he looks to work it across the line. Skids on with a bit of inward movement to beat the inside edge. Was that missing leg stump, possibly? No DRS, and Carter doesn't look too happy"

"<b>ridiculously good slower ball</b>. He needs to pull the length back, seeing Holder advance, and then put the cut on the ball to bear the leading edge as the batsman looks for midwicket because he has no other choice.

"<b>caught behind</b>! Toe-end of the bat as he goes for the pull shot and Bangladesh have a vital breakthrough at a great time.

steps out to the pitch of the ball on middle and leg and launches it down to long-on
"another fine shot, this time going inside out so that the offbreak from round the wicket, meant to cramp him on middle and leg, is lifted back over the bowler's head. Superb strokeplay"
"taken at short cover! He's not to the pitch of the ball, having come down the track too early and giving Nurse the opportunity to change his length, and also go tight into his pads. It's a lot shorter now, it's a lot closer now, but Shakib is committed to the shot. Goes for the drive, tries to lift it over the infield, no such luck."
works it away through midwicket
"<b>there's a neeeeervous juggle, but he takes it in the end</b>. Ambris at short midwicket this time as another Bangladesh player mis-hits a lofted shot. Soumya wants to get under the ball, nicely tossed up outside off, and clip it over the leg side field for a couple of runs, but the ball isn't quite as full as he thinks he is. It grips. it turns. It takes a leading edge and poof. He's gone"

works the flatter delivery on middle to deep midwicket
"<b>has Mithun been run out</b>?! Oooh, it's close, but he's just in. Very risky run from Mushfiqur, but he likes to keep things ticking, especially after quick wickets. And though that's a good idea, dinking the ball so close to a very good fielder like Jonathan Carter at first slip is asking for trouble. He runs to his right, to where short point would be, dives head-first at the ball, grabs it with his right hand and then flicks it, while he's still suspended in the air, under his body at the keeper. <b>Epic fielding skillz</b>"

"good length, outside off, Mushfiqur leaves. Brave leave"
"<b>Mithun should have been run out</b>. He goes for a reverse sweep and just sets off. Not realising Nurse is onto the ball quickly, moving to his left. Mushfiqur is aware of it though and, after taking a couple of steps forward, yells no and at that point, Mithun loses his footing and falls on his backside. He's stranded in the middle of the pitch with no way back. All Nurse has to do is lob the ball to the keeper... and he messes it up, sending it way over the keeper"

walks across his stumps and gets cramped up as Allen pulls his length back and keeps it on off stump. Mushfiqur can only block
drives a tossed up delivery outside off to cover
"now behind square, the sweep shot with great class. And the reason he goes behind square is because WI put a fielder in front. So now, when he gets across his stumps and gets on top of the ball, he rolls his wrists specifically so he can place it in the newly created gap."
"good length outside off, defends"
goes back to a good length ball that skids onto off stump. There's danger here for Mushfiqur but his hands help him adjust quickly enough
"poor bowling again from West Indies. The captain now straying onto the pads with fine leg up. What do you think happened next? (Hint, leg glance for four)"
"huge appeal for lbw, and with Mithun always going across his stumps, he's always going to be candidate for that. But here the indipper might just have gone down leg"
