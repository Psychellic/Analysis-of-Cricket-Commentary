"good length on the pads, a loosener. Off the thigh pad towards square leg for a run to start"
"more leg byes. Full and swinging in, 140 kph. Finch can't make contact, but the ball ricochets off his legs for a couple of leg byes to fine leg"
"that one doesn't swing. Lovely bowling. Nice and full, angled away. Finch drives with his feet rooted in the crease, the ball goes past"
"good length around off, bunted to cover. 141 kph. A cautious start from Finch, not a bad approach at all. Take your time, he can make it up in a few balls"
"140 kph, on a length around off, no swing again. Outside-halved towards point this time."
"edged and gone! Finch falls. A duck for Finch. Good length delivery outside off, Finch tries to work this down to third man but can only get a thin outside edge through to the keeper. A tentative shot, a tentative innings, a tentative tournament for Finch."

"superb shot, but finds the fielder again. Short and wide, slashed to point for nothing"
"141 kph, good length and straight, defended back"
"sliced over the infield. Full and wide, may have been the offcutter. White is through his shot too early, and can only carve the ball over point for a couple. Went high, but got enough bat too"
"White's gone now. Big wicket for the Scorchers. It's Johnson's modus operandi, isn't it? Dug in, not too high, aimed at the ribs. Just fended to short fine leg, and the Renegades now in some trouble"

"slow outside off, 88 kph, slides back in, no turn, defended"
"tip and run to cover. Flight around off, tapped towards cover for a quick single"
"99 kph, given! That's an iffy decision. Flat and straight, did it pitch outside leg? If it didn't, there is no way that one straightened to hit off stump. Given out on the shot, more than anything. Short and straight, Harris misses a pull, struck in front of off, but with that angle, surely there was too much doubt? Pitched outside leg and missing off stump, says HawkEye, so that's an awful decision"
