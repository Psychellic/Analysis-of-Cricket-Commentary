'wait' is the cry from Guptill after he drills the very full ball to cover. And they do... right up until the misfield from Hasnain the substitute... when they pinch the single
"back of a length on off stump, blocks it well. Looks like this game won't be complicated by menace of extra bounce"
<b>lashes it past point</b>! Oh this looks a batting beauty. No swing. Easy pace. And Boult makes matters even more easier by offering width. Good shot from Rizwan
"back of a length on off stump, opens the face looking for a single towards point, no such luck"
"<b>thumps it away</b>! What a pull shot. It certainly looks like the Pakistan team has come out with a point to prove, especially against short bowling. Rizwan is back in his crease and hammers it away behind square leg"
"shortish and outside off, goes at it hard hard, but since he's reaching out for the ball, he doesn't have all his balance and the cut shot goes to cover"
"<b>swings it away!</b>. Haider is very very good at hitting the ball in the air, especially over the leg side field. Southee invites him to do so with a length ball angled into the pads and without Conway's last ditch dive at deep square leg, this would've been a boundary"
"<b>woo hoo hoooo!!!</b> Haider Ali is box office! This ball is by no means bad. Good length. Even gets some swing, only thing is it swings right onto to the middle of the bat as he launches it over long-on"
"<b>beaten by the bouncer</b>. Southee sends one outside off and makes it climb over the batsman's shoulder. Haider is still caught on on his front foot, meaning when he goes for the hook shot, he has little chance of connecting"
"<b>sucked in by his own momentum and he's gone!</b> Oh all those big hits, all that gung ho-ness. Pakistan want so desperately to win this powerplay. To completely dominate it. But this wasn't the ball. It's full. It's tailing in. New Zealand had bolstered the leg side, so Haider looks to open up and go over mid-off. He miscues it. And Williamson at mid-off takes a simple catch"
"back of a length on middle and off, defends"
<b>straight up and it's taken by the bowler</b>! A top edge to a half-hearted pull shot - half-hearted because Southee does not give him the room for such shenanigans. It's poor shot selection. it's born of Pakistan's need to whack NZ out of shape after the collapse in the first T20I. And it results in a second very very easy wicket.
punches a shortish delivery on off stump towards cover
pulls the bouncer past the left of long leg. And this is a proper shot. He reads the length early. He shifts his weight back. He gets on top of the bounce. Rolls his wrists and even places it perfectly
"shortish and on off stump, guides it to point"
neat little tap to short third man as he waits on the ball with plenty of width to play that shot.
goes back to a shortish ball on off stump and defends to point
blocks a good length ball into the covers
<b>movement past the bat</b>! Southee hits the deck and even then he has such supreme control of the ball - that seam is so upright - that he gets it to deck away past the right-hander's feeble poke
short and outside off - definitely there for the cut shot - but again Southee gets it to dart away past the flashing blade
"<b>leading edge</b>. Now that Southee has seen the ball moving, he is pitching it up and angling it in at the stumps. Rizwan plays for that, looking for runs through midwicket, and instead gets a run through point"
"good length looking for the top of off stump, Hafeez defends behind point"
"full on off stump, he drives to cover"
"<b>drills it through the covers</b>. That's the risk in searching for swing. When it doesn't happen, the batsman can hit that fuller delivery on off stump through the line."
"<b>plenty of movement into the right-hander</b>! Hafeez is caught hopping in his crease as he tries to clip a back of a length ball into the leg side, but it keeps cramping him and then hits his body"
"<b>just past the right of slip</b>! 'That would've been an absolute worldie,' says Neesham on the mic, who was also the fielder. 'Sorry KJ' he yells! This is a shortish ball outside off, Hafeez is looking for the late cut, the extra bounce may have made him place the ball a little closer to slip than he intends"
"<b>sharp bounce, sharp movement</b>! Rizwan is loaded up for the cut shot. But the shortish ball outside off rears into him and makes him lose his shape and mis-hit to cover"
"<b>fiiiiieeeerrrrrrrrce cut shot</b>. And it's gone to Guptill at point. A little to his right. Some might call this a catching opportunity, but It's to his credit that he gets a hand to it and saves a boundary"
pulls a short ball outside off to long leg
"full and outside off, drives smoothly to cover"
opens the face and slices a shortish ball on off stump to the left of the sweeper
lets a good length ball outside off go through to the keeper
"knocks it down to mid-on, the single they take isn't particularly perfect, but Hafeez puts in a dive and saves himself despite a Jamieson direct hit"
<b>caught behind</b>! His game is all about hard hands. His game is all in your face. Southee has sussed that up. He's also got the away swing working for him. So he pitches the ball up. He asks Rizwan to drive on the up. Rizwan does and nicks through to the keeper. Gorgeous bowling. Not so bright batting.
"<b>rippppaaaahhhhhh!</b> If the last game was all about bounce, this one has suddenly turned into one about swing. Southee gets a good length ball to straighten past the squared up batsman, caught in his crease"
<b>another beauty</b>! This is a Southee special. Wide of the crease. Full enough in length. But it's not drivable. So the batsman doesn't want to push onto the front foot. He's trapped in his crease. He knows he has to play though because the ball is on off stump. Then it hits the deck and darts away past the outside edge. Glorious bowling.
defends a fuller delivery on off stump
"<b>loooooveeeeely shot</b>! Hafeez seems to be the only one playing normal cricket. He's keeping the good ones out. He's constantly looking for a single. And if its in his arc, like this half-volley, he cracks it away to the boundary, this time through point"
"<b>bliiiiiiiiistering hit</b>! The second the ball is angled into his pads, Hafeez is ready to flick it away. He also knows there is no one on the midwicket boundary so there's no need to keep it along the ground"
"full and outside off, drives to the sweeper. Good batting. He's only run-a-ball but he's got a start, the kind that could build into a really big innings"
<b>nearly chops on</B> as Shadab looks for a cut to a ball that is too close to his body. The mis-hit though travels all the way to the fine leg boundary
"full and outside off, drives to cover"
"starts with a yorker on off stump, Hafeez digs it out to point"
"<b>smears it to the boundary</b>! See, this is what happens when you give yourself time at the crease. You get used to the pace and bounce on the pitch and you stay out there long enough to exploit the change bowlers. This is a good length ball outside off and he square drives it on the up to the point boundary. <b>Absolutely majestic</b>"
<b>oohhhh this is clever</b>! There is no malice in this shot. There isn't even the timing from the last boundary. There's only placement. He wants to beat third man on his left and he does. Beautiful batting
"goes for the dab to third man again and it wanders between keeper and first slip! Those two fielders are a good distance apart so he was playing a very intentional shot, looking for four once more"
"<b>extra bounce</b> and Shadab, looking for the upper cut, can't quite connect"
<b>beats him again</b> with a shortish ball outside off. Shadab was trying to access point
"drives ever so smoothly through the covers, leaning into the good length ball outside off. Hafeez is definitely in the zone."
"<b>the short ball does him in</b>! Shadab goes for the pull shot, but he doesn't have the swinging room. It's too close to his body. It's also rising on him. Gets the top half of the bat as he looks to heave ho and therefore no power in the shot. Simple catch to midwicket"
"back of a length and on the pads, he's into the flick shot too early and the ball travels a good distance in the air towards mid-on"
slices a good length ball on off stump past the left of point
"shapes for the cut shot, but then realises the ball is sitting in the pitch, so he waits that second longer, as he should, and then dabs it past the left of point. Good batting."
<b>beats him</b> with a back of a length delivery that keeps rising past the edge of the bat that Shah just lets dangle
<b>splendid hit</b>! Hafeez looks to have sized up Kuggeleijn. This one is full on off stump and he just brings down a straight bat and the timing takes it past cover
opens the face to a short ball outside off and dabs it to third man.
<b>he's hopping around</b> against a short ball on leg stump and gets a leading edge to point
"fullish on off stump, defends"
works a back of a length ball on his pads to deep square leg
nudges a shortish ball into the midwicket region to keep the strike
nudged to short third and they get a smart single
leg-stump line and Khushdil tickles it down for a single
"cleverly played, if indeed he meant it. A bit of width and he opens the face of the bat, getting a thick edge very fine, where third man has no chance"
"shorter this time, Hafeez tried to do the same, but it dribbles down to the keeper"
cramped him up for room. Hafeez blocks
"flicked away smartly over midwicket. Devon Conway has a bit of a chase, but keeps it down to two"
"slightly short, Khushdil hits it hard straight to the fielder"
"better. Slightly fuller, spinning back into the left hander"
steps back and carves it to sweeper cover
nicely flighted. Hafeez respectfully defends
shorter and wider. Perhaps an opportunity to beat a man but Hafeez finds the point fielder
"Long hop to finish off and Hafeez capitalises! Moves onto the back foot and pulls it away for a boundary, spoiling a good over"
glanced down to fine leg
"elegant timing, pushed back past the bowler, but the fielder cuts it off"
not the best delivery. It sat up somewhat for Khushdil at no real pace. Khushdil smears to deep midwicket where the boundary fielder can't cut it off
went wider of the crease and angled it across. Khushdil drives to the offside
""
deft flick down to fine leg. Excellent work from the man to keep it down to two
single down to short third
"quick, smart single through the offside"
"dances down the crease but came early, so Sodhi drops it a little short. Hafeez slices it to cover and gets off strike"
"wrong'un, Khushdil reads it but can't manage to beat the fielder out in the deep on the offside"
"spinning sharply away, he reached for it a little and found himself beaten"
"strong finish to the over from Sodhi. Hafeez tried to tickle it to third man, but gets beaten again"
has a generous swing at it but no real timing. They get a single to mid-off
lifts it over the cover region and it was racing down to the boundary. Kept down to two
"<strong>Paddled down to fine leg, dropped!</strong> How costly might that be? Conway was running in and got there comfortably, only to watch it pop out of his hands. There was a run-out chance, too, with Hafeez looking in trouble for a bit, but puts in the dive and gets there"
<strong>and he brings up his half-century!</strong> Makes New Zealand pay for that drop with a majestic pull over square leg that takes it sailing over the boundary
"wide half-volley, but same result! <strong>Same result</strong>. Hafeez leans into the drive through the air, and the ball goes flying over the long-off boundary. big, big over this for Pakistan"
"good pace to finish the over, beats the bat of Hafeez. Even so, 15 off that over"
"tossed up, brave to be doing that to Khushdil at the death. Tonked to long-on where an excellent dive prevents the ball from getting acquainted with the rope"
"through the two fielders at point! Hafeez is doing what he's done so well all year, moving up a gear when the team really needs it"
"<strong>and six! This is sensational from Hafeez</strong>. Races down the wicket and for the longest time, it looked like Guptill might hold onto that. Puts in a huge leap but still just evades him"
tried to run this down but beats the edge
prances down the ground but the timing isn't there this time. Just a single on the bounce to long-on
"<strong>and the wicket finally comes</strong>. It wasn't the best ball. Knee high full toss, but Khushdil's heave couldn't beat Guptill, who finally gets a catch this over"
"Hafeez gets another life! Charmed existence, this is. Edged it to keeper, who dived sharply to his right. Got a glove on it, but can't quite get it to stick"
greets him with a bouncer first up
swiped down to midwicket for a couple. Hafeez's legs getting tested
"takes the pace off, and he runs it down to fine leg"
"moves across the stumps and gets it over fine leg! The runs are coming along in clusters now, and New Zealand losing a bit of control"
keeps the strike to finish another handy over
works it down to wide long-on where they push the fielder and get two out of it
"yorker angling in, raps him on the pads. Southee appeals but that's wayyy down the leg side"
"slower  ball, but Faheem not quite finding the middle just yet. Gets Hafeez on strike, though, which is what seems to matter right now"
makes room for himself and pulls a short ball to square leg. Southee's bowling cannily here
<strong>sliced it</strong>. Went high in the air and Williamson completes the easiest catch. Reckon even his newborn might have caught that. Faheem departs and Imad comes in
"nearly got there, too! Top edge from Hafeez and Seifert gallops along after it and puts in an almighty dive. The ball's only just out of his reach, but let that not detract from a sensational spell of bowling from Southee. 4-0-21-4"
"<strong>dropped from Boult.</strong> That wasn't really a chance, to be fair. It was smashed back at him, and Boult stuck out a right hand. More like saving three runs than anything"
"full, hammers into Imad's ankle. Excellent bowling at the death"
"slower bouncer, how did he play that? It seemed Imad was in no position to get much on that but manages to get it over third man, who was in the ring, and it goes for four"
<strong>what's that shot? Reverse paddle to a Trent boult yorker</strong>. Gets the perfect little bit of connection to tickle it down to third man for four. Intelligent batting.
"sweetly struck, but only down to deep midwicket for one"
in the blockhole to finish. Hafeez digs it out and will keep the strike
"yorker to start off, Hafeez can only dig it down to long-off or a single"
"low full toss, Imad has a heave at it. Goes down to long-on for a single"
"<strong>excellent bowling</strong>. Gets it right in the blockhole again. Hafeez smashes it to mid-off, but it's a precious, rare dot ball"
"Hafeez gets lucky, again! T<strong>op edge and it carries over the keeper, over the rope on the shortest part of the ground</strong>. Jamieson has a smile on his face, but he probably didn't deserve that"
"another little bit of fortune! Hafeez swings for the fences, gets another outside edge and it beats third man for a boundary. Pakistan up to 157"
"what a sensational innings! Hafeez ends with the best shot of the innings, a gloriously timed six straight down the ground! And, agonisingly, it takes him to 99 not out! <strong>This is the second highest individual score in Pakistan T20I cricket history</strong>"
"'wait,' is the cry from Guptill as he drills a very full ball on off stump to cover. Wait they do... right up until the point Hasnain, the substitute misfields... then they pinch the single"
"<b>smears it through the covers</b>. Seifert began the series well, playing orthodox cricket shots in Eden Park. Looks like he's starting the same way here too. Good stuff."
clips it off his pads to long leg
"pitched up on off stump, Guptill is looking for the on the up drive, without quite moving his feet. That results in a gap between bat and pad and also the ball taking the inside edge to midwicket"
smoothly turns it to the right of mid-on
"back of a length and outside off. Guptill looks to force it through the off side again, but continues to only profit through the inside edge"
"whips it to the square leg boundary. It's on the pads. It's too full. It's a hit-me ball and it gets Guptill, who hasn't really looked in very good form this summer, off and running."
<b>launches it over extra cover</b>! Whoa! This is one big player taking down another big player! Haris Rauf was a menace in the last game. But Guptill decides he won't let that happen tonight. Backs away from a length ball outside off and thumps it over the top
<b>misses a run-out</b>! Rauf races to his left even as Guptill misjudges the single. The batsman's given up. The bowler takes aim. He should have hit the target...
"full on off stump, defends"
"149.8 kph, works a shortish delivery on middle to deep square leg"
"<b>goes for the upper cut and misses</b>. Rauf is pumped up. He hasn't liked that six Guptill hit earlier in the over. Goes short on middle and off stump. Guptill seems to be ready for it, swaying away to try and lift it over the keeper. Doesn't connect"
<b>sharp bounce</b>! Seifert is looking to slash a shortish ball outside off past point but the ball misbehaves on him
"<b>swings it in and cuts him in half</b>! Much like Southee earlier, Shaheen is finding movement after the first few overs. This good length ball darts in off the pitch and Seifert, set up to punch through the off side, is made to look silly"
<b>outstanding pull shot</b>. Shaheen tests the batsman with a short ball and Seifert is more than up for it. The bowler kicks the turf as he watches it scurry away behind square leg
"<b>smoothly driven</b> through the covers, this one off the back foot, as he stands tall against the shortish ball outside off"
"goes around the wicket and Seifert works that angle, moving across his stumps to get a single towards midwicket"
blocks a shortish delivery on off stump to point
<b>gloooooooooriouuuuuuuus</b>! This is Guptill at his absolute best. At PS5 cheat-code level awesomeness. He sees it full. He gets leg side of it. And that full swing of a straight bat is a proper thing of beauty. Maximum over long-off
knocks a back of a length ball on off stump into the off side
<b>taken at deep square leg</b>! The advantage of playing a decent sized ground. Even a batsman's big hit becomes a wicket. Ashraf goes short after being hit down the ground. Guptill loads up the front foot pull and picks out Rauf
<b>extra bounce</b> beats Seifert's attempted cut shot against a short ball outside off
punches a shortish delivery that comes into him to cover
defends a good length ball on off stump
gets an inside edge onto his thigh as he looks to flick a short ball aiming to cramp him up
"<b>between slip and keeper</b>! They've left a huuuuuuuuge gap there. And this is a genuine edge that would have been gobbled by an orthodox first slip. Williamson's efforts to force a short and rising delivery outside off juuuuuuuuust about comes off. Rauf, meanwhile, is deeply annoyed by the missed opportunity. He screams in agony as the outside edge skips away to the third man boundary"
<b>beats him</b> as Williamson once again comes second best against a back of a length ball that straightens off the pitch
dabs a back of a length ball on off stump to point
opens the face to try and glide the shortish ball on off stump behind point. Can't hit the gap
shapes to hit that gap behind point again but it doesn't happen. Williamson needs more time at the crease to work out the pace and bounce
<b>extra bounce</b> messes with the batsman's desire to nudge a straight ball into the leg side
backs away to try and carve a short of a length ball on middle and leg. Misses it completely.
"<b>scoops it over the keeper</b>! The bounce has been troubling batsmen. There's even been a little movement. Pakistan too have been very good at not giving them any room to work with. Given all of those constraints, Seifert takes a little risk and it comes off perfectly"
slogs a length ball on middle and off stump away to deep midwicket
gently taps a shortish ball behind the wickets and pinches a quick single.
pushes a back of a length delivery to cover
starts with a bouncer that soars over Seifert's head
<b>spectacular hit</b>! He looks so good on the pull shot. Sees the length early. Shifts off side of it so he swivel on the back foot and swing his arms over the ball. Soars over deep backward square leg
around the wicket now and it's even better! <b>Straight down the ground</b> as he clears the front leg and gets under a length ball. Plenty of disdain in that shot.
"shortish and outside off, steers to point"
"<b>immense batting</b>! He seems to know exactly what the bowler is about to do. Like here, he's moving across his crease and because of that, he's in perfect position to lift a back of a length ball outside off - that's not a bad ball - over deep square leg."
waits on the short ball angled into the body and turns it around to long leg.

"knows the next ball will be quicker and shorter and is waiting on the back foot for it, dabs towards point"
pushes into the covers
steps away from the shortish ball outside off and cuts to cover
goes for the cut but can't beat point
"<b>superb placement</b>! There is just a hint more width here. Imad rarely offers such luxuries. So WIlliamson makes the most of it, waiting on the ball and smacking it to the left of the sweeper"
"once the short ball goes for four, you get ready for the full one. Williamson works it through midwicket"
<b>outside edge and that too flies away</b>. Pakistan were hoping to get the better of Seifert by taking the pace off and although they do produce a false shot - a rank slog to a length ball - it goes in the batsman's favour. Four to third man
cuts to the sweeper
<b>back to back fifties</b> for Seifert and he's soaking it all in. Raises his bat with pride after it loomed over a tossed up legbreak and flicked it through midwicket
<b>outstanding sweep shot</b>. He's so confusing to bowl to with all these shots in his locker
<b>leading edge</b> as Shadab goes quick and full on leg stump. Seifert plays the angle and is done by the turn
"shortish and outside off, cuts to the sweeper"
steps forward to a flighted ball and flicks it through midwicket
goes back to a shortish delivery and works it to deep midwicket. And they get an extra run with a misfield from Rauf.
