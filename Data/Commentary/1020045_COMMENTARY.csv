"they keep bouncing him, he keeps taking it on, and it's yet another boundary through fine leg. This was sliding down leg and once more he swiveled and found the boundary"
it is the bouncer that gets him anyway. This one is close to his throat and still climbing as he swings at it. He closes his eyes and goes through with the shot. The top edge floats high behind first slip and Watling trots backwards to catch that

"back of a length and outside off, Raval refuses to play"
"good lift off a good length, but with the line being outside off, and with Raval picking it early and leaving, there is no danger"
probes fuller and Raval is a tad slow in coming forward. Gentle hands and a straight bat bail him out
"difficult, so difficult to bat on a pitch that affords seam movement when it's Philander running in at you. He's always there and thereabouts. This time it's on off stump, on a full length and Raval defends rather gingerly. <b>Outside edge</b> scurries through the cordon"
"<B>beats him</b>. Peach of a ball, pitching on a good length, on off stump and going on with the angle across the left-hander. Raval needs to be more decisive with his footwork, especially in coming forward"
"shortish and outside off, taps it into the covers"
"shortish and down leg, Latham has an easy leave"
shifts his line back to the proper side of the wicket and a good length ball outside off goes by without tempting the batsman
"<b>drives on the up</b>, because of all the pressure that has been built on him, not necessarily because this ball was there for the shot. It's wide, it's a tempter, it's the kind that could take his edge if there was some movement. As such it is creamed through the covers"

"short ball, down the leg side, left alone"

"shorter in length and some width on offer outside off. De Kock steers it away through backward point. Point and backward point run behind it and the former dives to pull it back. They go upstairs to check. They are checking if his arm has made contact with the rope as he dived forward to pull it back. Maybe it brushes against it before he can entirely release it. No, he has done alright"

<b>appeal for leg before</b>. Not given by umpire Rod Tucker.  He was hanging back and the ball slides in to rap him on the pad. Seems like there was an inside edge on that. New Zealand don't have reviews
