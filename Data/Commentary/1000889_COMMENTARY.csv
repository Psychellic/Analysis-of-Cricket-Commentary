"ooh, what happened there! Junaid appeals for a caught behind but it is stifled and a tad late. It was a short of a length delivery and Warner was looking to defend off the front foot but the ball tails back in at 130kph and brushes him high on the thigh pad as it goes to the wicketkeeper. If that appeal was for lbw, it was too high"
"another good ball, squares him up this time with a length ball that straightens after angling in. Warner sticks his bat out and gets rapped on the pad but too high again. Walked into the shot as he pressed forward there. Lot more confident appeal but not given"

"fullish length ball, tucks it off the pads between midwicket and mid-on, midwicket runs across and cuts it off"
"outside edge, or is there? Appeal from Junaid as Warner slashes outside off and there is a noise as the ball goes to the wicketkeeper. It was a short of a length and angling away slightly. It has actually missed the blade by quite a distance. Strange noise, that. Even snicko shows that there was a noise but the ball missed the bat by some distance"

"short of a length ball outside off, steered with an open bat face towards backward point"
and he finally gets his man. This is good bowling from Junaid. Gets it to shape away just a tad from the back of a length region after tempting the batsman to go after it by offering enough width. Warner chases it with an angled bat and skews it off the outside edge to the wicketkeeper

"rolls his fingers over the seam and bowls a slower full ball outside off, Khawaja pushes forward and goes after it with soft hands. Gets an outside edge that bounces well before the man at first slip and goes away to his left. Not the best of efforts from the fielder there, could a dive have perhaps helped stop it? The ball runs away to the third man boundary"
"good length ball outside off, driven off the front foot into the covers region"
"Usman Khawaja has edged to first slip but he stands his ground and the umpires go upstairs to check if it's a clean catch. That's a fantastic catch from Sharjeel. It was a good length ball, just outside off and Khawaja was shaping up to slap it through backward point. But there was not enough room to free his arms and he gets a thick outside edge. Sharjeel gets down to his left and snaffles a superb catch. And it is clean. No doubts there and Khawaja has to go back. What a start to Junaid's comeback game!"

"length ball on the leg stump channel this time, tucked off the pads to square leg"
"and now Amir has one. Marsh has picked cover with a loose drive first ball. Amir has done superbly to fire a tempter outside off, forcing the batsman to lean across and reach out. Marsh is no good position, arches up as he plays the drive, meaning there was no way he was going to keep that down. Sends it straight into the hands of Imad Wasim at short cover"

rapped on the pads and appeal for lbw. Turned down by the umpire. It was a length ball and angling in and Wade was shifting on the backfoot looking to flick it away. Hit on the pad but the angle seems to suggest it was missing leg
"very full ball that is angled in at a flat trajectory, clipped away to deep square leg"
optimistic appeal for caught behind but not given. Wade is done in by the drift that takes the ball away and gets beaten as he sticks his bat at it
another appeal for caught behind and this time given. But Australia have reviewed it. Wade was pretty quick in reviewing it. Pushed across to the left-hander and rushes him with pace. Wade is caught on neither foot and walks across after being opened up as he tries to stick his bat out. Replays show that there is no bat involved as confirmed by both HotSpot and snicko and the on-field decision is reversed. The ball actually brushed the flap of the pad which produced the noise.

"fuller ball outside off, pushes at it without much feet and the bat turns in his hands slightly as the ball goes to point"
"slower back of a length ball, tries to open the bat face and run it down and gets very narrowly beaten"
"short ball, well-directed, sways out of the line. But it is too short and called a wide"
"fuller ball outside off, driven firmly to mid-off and he starts off with the single. Jogs initially before realising late that the ball goes to the fielder quite quickly and then ups his pace even as a throw is fired at the non-striker's end that does not hit the stumps"
tucked off the pads to the backward square leg region and it is vacant there so the wicketkeeper has to run across and gather it. Easy single
"short of a length, jumps up and drops it in front of point. Faulkner was off for the single but is sent back by Hazlewood and it's the right call in the end"
"fullish ball, pushes it off the front of the toes towards mid-on"
tries a yorker but ends up bowling a low full toss outside off that is driven firmly but straight to cover
unintentional boundary. It was a short ball and he was backing away. But the ball follows him and takes the top part of his bat before flying over wher ethe cordon would have been and into the third man boundary
held at point and that's the end of the innings with four balls remaining. It was a short of good length ball but he is in no position to slap it. Skews it in the air to point where Shafiq settles under it easily
"full and wide to start, 144.5 kph, left alone nicely. A hint of inward movement"
"gets that line closer to off, 145 kph, Hafeez gets forward and blocks to mid-off"
"146 kph, full and wide from Starc. Seeing if there is some swing, there is but not much. Hafeez misses his leaden-footed drive"
"<strong>edged and dropped</strong>! Smith's slips struggles continue. A sitter. Uh oh. Full and wide again, Hafeez goes hard at the ball and gets a thick outside edge which goes straight to Smith at second slip. Gets his hands down near his midriff and shells a dolly. He has dropped an unusual number of catches recently"
defended solidly into the cover region
"147 kph, fantastic over from Starc. Attacks the stumps with a full length, Hafeez defends back to the bowler. Starc picks up and is ready to breathe fire but doesn't let go of the ball"
"short and wide, there for the cut. Sharjeel just misses it. No worries. If it's there, try. Beaten by bounce"
"oh my.<strong> That's a gem</strong>. Good length outside off, climbs and climbs and climbs past the outside edge. Wade takes it by his head. Cut that!"
"130 kph, the line and length that had Sharjeel nicking off in the Sydney Test. Not wide, not close to off. A set of stumps wide. Sharjeel think, should I cut? Ah, no. Left alone"
"close to off on a good length, defended back"
"there is that backward square leg region in play. Ready to pull anything short, this isn't quite short but he swats anyway to deep backward square leg."
"on the pads, drifting down. An appeal is quickly aborted. Hafeez misses a flick"
"147 kph, full and straight, Sharjeel gets a thick outside edge which flies towards point."
"143 kph, full delivery outside off, defended to mid-off. Not much movement"
strays down leg for an extra. 148 kph.
"shot! A tad too full from Starc, Sharjeel leans forward, a nice gentle stride. His shot is not gentle. Lovely, clean, flowing drive past Warner at mid-off and through cover. Timing"
"short and wide this time, cuts in front of extra cover for a couple more. Good batting, there to be hit, hit it"
"another clean drive but he finds mid-off. Good batting, depending on timing. Picking the right balls too"
"149 kph, pacey stuff. Beats Sharjeel for pace, he inside-edges his flick into his pad."
"131 kph, on the pads, flicked down towards backward square leg for a couple more"
"close to off on a full length, defended towards point"
"on a length outside off, too wide. Called"
"<strong>a big appeal.</strong> No says the umpire. Sliding down. Full and down leg, Hafeez falls over as he misses a flick."
"another edge. Flies down to third man along the ground, just one. Great fielding from Cummins, sprints to his left to save three"
"races away. Again, so strong on the pull. Slightly short and Sharjeel nails his pull through midwicket for four. Picked the length early"
"134 kph, on a length on leg, defended with a straight bat"
"full and straight from Starc, worked towards midwicket. That little bit of swing seems to have ceased"
"angled across, lovely line. A set of stumps outside off. Hafeez plays a good stroke, left alone"
"another nice leave. Full and wide, asking Hafeez to drive or test Smith again. Hafeez wants neither"
"146 kph, dabbed towards backward point"
"full and way too wide, 148 kph, another leave"
"too straight from Starc, flicked through square leg for more runs. Three of them"
"good end. 149 kph, full and straight, Sharjeel defends back with the full face"
"Hafeez falls over again. Straying down leg, Hafeez misses a flick. Sliding down"
"falls over again! On a length and straight, Hafeez fails to connect with a nudge into the leg side. The ball hits him high on the body"
"good length outside off, Hafeez leaves this alone"
"lovely line. Around off, Hafeez defends into the off side"
"135 kph, left alone outside off, lovely bowling. Hafeez refuses to play there. Good from both"
maiden! Hafeez gets forward and drives through cover.
"too straight from Cummins first up, Sharjeel tucks away merrily down to the fine leg boundary. Easy as"

"on a length outside off, left alone by Hafeez"

"back of a length on leg, bouncer. Hafeez gloves one down to fine leg. Not in control of the pull, beaten for pace"
"full and straight, Sharjeel picks it up and drag-flicks the ball over midwicket. Closed the bat face but picked his area. Not a bad shot at all. Good proactive batting"
"back of a length outside off, Hafeez tries to ride the bounce but lets this one go"
"nice channels. A couple of stumps outside off, Hafeez leaves again"
"full and straight, defended back"
"hustled for pace. Back of a length down leg, Hafeez doesn't connect with his half-pull help down to fine leg. Rapped on the body"
"good length outside off, defended into the off side"
"another maiden played by Hafeez. Full and straight from Cummins, Hafeez defends back"
"126 kph, full delivery outside off, played to the left of short third man. A long run there but Hafeez sends him back. Not good that from Hafeez"
"much better. On a full length down leg, Sharjeel is struck on the pad, hits the pad and ricochets towards point. Hafeez calls Sharjeel through"
"131 kph, angled across outside off, left alone"
"just clears mid-on. Looks to go over the top, but fails to time the ball after a forward shimmy. Gets enough on that"
"too straight and tucked down to fine leg for one. A lot better way to bat, finds the singles"
shovelled down to deep backward square leg for one.
"full and straight from Cummins, Sharjeel gets a thick inside edge towards deep backward square leg. The pair want two but are just too slow between the wickets. Should have been two there"
"top-edged for four. Bouncer on off, Hafeez fails to control the stroke. Hustles Hafeez, who gets a thick edge which flies down to the fine leg boundary. Grazed the helmet too"
"around off on a length, defended"
"good length outside off, defended into the off side"
"nice lines. Close to off on a length, defended back. Not much Hafeez can do to that"
"nice end. But too many dot balls to Hafeez. Good length outside off, played into the off side"

"good length outside off, played towards point. Another dot. Not even looking for one"

"full delivery outside off, pushed towards cover from the crease"
"good length outside off, 142 kph, scythed away towards point where Maxwell dives to his right"

defended towards cover from the crease
"nailed that! Back of a length on middle and leg, a bouncer. Hafeez thwacks this through deep backward square leg with ease. Placed well too"
"fullish on off, 147 kph, pushed towards mid-off"
"shortish outside off, punched down to long-on with so much ease"
"beaten on the outside edge. Flat delivery outside off, skids on with the arm and beats the bat. No turn"
nicely played. Gets low and hammers his sweep through deep backward square leg. Fantastic timing. Superb placement
"that's tripe. Short and way down leg, Hafeez pulls down to fine leg. Could have left that and got the extra ball"
"tossed up on leg, clipped through square leg"
"four more! Great batting, Hafeez runs down to the pitch and drills the ball over the bowler for four. Fantastic timing. Good area to hit the ball too"
"too straight from Faulkner, flicked down to fine leg for one"
"more runs. Full and straight, easy pickings for Hafeez to flick through midwicket for plenty. A poor ball"
"taken this time! And Australia get Sharjeel. A length delivery outside off, fourth-stump channel. Sharjeel lets the ball come to him, looking for one down to third man off the open face but the ball kisses the outside edge and is easily held by Wade. Sharjeel looking for something too cheeky, that's not his strength."
"good length delivery outside off, pushed towards cover"

"good length outside off, 128 kph, punched towards extra cover"
"full and straight from Faulkner, a solid block"
"swatted away through midwicket. Full and wide from Faulkner, Hafeez doesn't care. A cross-batted heave into the gap off the front foot. Nowhere near a bad bal"
"full and wide, left alone"
"good length outside off, slashed down to third man for one"
"some extra bounce. Good length delivery outside off, prodded away towards point. Takes the glove and handle of the bat. Signs of variable bounce"

"127 kph, good length delivery outside off, dabbed towards backward point"
"128 kph, gets on top of the bounce to steer towards gully. Wants one does Hafeez, rightly sent back"

pushed towards mid-on
"too straight this time, flicked through square leg for three more. Made easily, shrewd field manipulation. Waited for the bowler to come to him"

"superb lines, close to off on a full length, another solid block"
"135 kph, fullish length on middle and leg, a soft-hands push towards mid-on for a quick single."

pushed out to mid-on
"shot! Superb timing from Azam. Gets one on his pads and flicks away through midwicket. Fantastic timing. Gets the bowler to bowl to him, a very un-Hazlewood type delivery"
"good length outside off, outside-halved down to third man"
"not quite timed. Fullish on off, Azam looks to unfurl a gorgeous drive through mid-off but squirts to mid-on in rather ugly fashion"
"141 kph, a half-volley outside off, driven to mid-off"
"good length outside off, carved to point from the crease"

"too straight, flicked away through square leg"
"a good length delivery outside off, played down towards point"
"superb stroke. Full on the pads, Hafeez flicks that nonchalantly over square leg. A wristy flick. Didn't bother keeping that down. <b>Hafeez brings up fifty too</b>"
"a yorker outside off, carved towards a short third man"
"both watching each other from the middle of the pitch almost. Full delivery outside off, pushed into the cover region"

"141 kph, outside off from Cummins, driven to mid-off"

"good single. 140 kph, outside off and full, Azam opens the bat face late to get one to third man"
"144 kph, a full length outside off, draws Hafeez forward who drives to mid-off"

"shot! Good length on off, Azam reads the length early, goes on the back foot and hammers his pull over midwicket. Fantastic execution"
"if you can make a run to Warner look easy, it's well judged. Full outside off, pushed to mid-off, Hafeez calls immediately and gets there"
"offcutter on off, blocked"
"<b>saved four.</b> Wow. Full and wide from Starc, Azam laces his drive towards extra cover. Head sticks out a left hand and prevents plenty of runs. Fantastic stuff"

"144 kph, full and straight, pushed to mid-off"
"<strong>150 kph</strong>. Full and wide, Hafeez misses his dab down to third man. Pakistan 1 for 111"
"good length on off and middle, pushed away towards mid-off"
"on the hips, Azam misses a nudge, struck on the pad and a deflection to fine leg ensues"
"<strong>dropped! </strong>Another sensational effort, but just can't cling on. Extra cover was 10 metres outside the circle. Hafeez wanted to go over cover but the ball squirted off the outside half. Cummins stretches out a left hand but the ball bursts out"
dabbed down to third man
"creamed away. Full and wide, driven to the right of Cummins this time. He's probably at that awkward position to cut off the angles?"
"blocked into the off side, nice and straight from Faulkner"
"full delivery outside off, pushed to mid-off"
"good length on middle and leg, swatted through square leg for a couple more"
nicely steered to third man off the open face. Need more of that
"in the air but in the gap. Four. Full and wide, swerving away. Hafeez can't hold back his drive, ends up skewing the ball off the outside half through point. Very catchable but not to the fielder"
"more runs, full and straight, a wristy flick over square leg. Didn't want to keep that down. More runs"
"flies down to the third man boundary. Back of a length outside off, Azam gives it all he has, the ball flashes away off the top edge over gully. Think I saw steam from Starc's ears"
"slower ball outside off, defended towards mid-off"
"slower ball outside off, Hafeez fails to connect with a guide"
"119 kph, slower ball, carved to backward point, Maxwell is quick to the ball"
"goes past the outside edge. Full and wide outside off, Hafeez pokes and the ball swerves past"
"123 kph, good length outside off, played down to third man for one"
"superlative timing. Full and wide from Faulkner, Azam times his cover drive past cover. No chance once he found the gap. Awesome stuff"
"through the gap again. Full and wide from Starc, Hafeez leans forward and scythes a drive through point. These two letting loose now"
"back of a length outside off, Hafeez gets a thick outside edge which flies down to third man, on the bounce"
"taken! Not a percentage stroke with third man in place. Back of a length outside off, Azam plays that nicely, sways away from the line, arches his back and gets underneath the ball. Ramps the ball but can't get it over slip, more over gully, and because of that, third man is able to get around and complete a good catch at the third man boundary. May have been a better option to hit that over point."
"a yorker outside off, jammed out"
"another yorker outside off, kept out again"
"full and wide, left alone"
"fuller ball on off, presses forward and opens his bat face to run it down towards third man"
late away movement outside off. It's very full and Shafiq gets beaten as he tries to squeeze it out through the off side
"short of a length and on the stumps, stays back and defends but gets an inside edge to the pads"
"back of a length and angling away outside off, waits for it to come before opening the bat face late to steer it down to third man"
"fuller ball outside off, Hafeez perishes trying to play across the line. Looks to loft it and the bat face closes in his hand as he goes through with the shot. Can't get any sort of distance as the ball balloons only as far as mid-on where Hazlewood snaffles it"
"fuller back-of-the-hand slower ball outside off, presses forward and drives into the off side"
"poor shot. Full and wide, Shafiq doesn't go after that properly, nor does he bail out. Ends up poking, the ball goes past"
"<strong>Warner's done something to his hamstring</strong>? Full and wide, driven towards Warner at mid-off, who runs to the ball, got into position to throw at the batsman's end, but just pulled up, Looks fine though"
"lovely bowling. Full and wide, Malik drives but Starc gets late away movement. Beats the bat"
"fullish delivery outside off, defended towards extra cover"
"nice again, full and straight, Malik defends"
"too straight, off the pads down to fine leg. Malik was hesitant but came back for the second. The throw was not accurate, the backing-up not great and Pakistan get three eventually. Would have been very close had the stumps been hit at the batsman's end"
"good length on off, 138 kph, the ball seams back in and hits the inside edge of Malik, onto the body"
"nice line. Around off, coming back in. Malik defends"

"full and straight, flicked away to midwicket. Good over from Cummins"
"full delivery outside off, Malik defends to point"

"on a length and straight, defended"
""
"shortish and wide, Malik gets on top of the bounce and laces a square drive through point. Forced that through."
"good length outside off, defended into the off side"
"139 kph, loopy bouncer over the head, wide called"
"beauty! Exceptional bowling. <strong>Malik reviews the out decision. </strong>A big noise, was it bat on pad, or bat on ball? Hotspot has nothing. This is interesting. There is a big spike before the ball reaches the bat, which may indicate that the bat clipped the pad. But that doesn't mean there is no bat on ball. In this case, it was just bat on pad. The back flap was moved forward with the bat. Good use of the review from Malik, called for it immediately."
"sweet timing through cover for a couple more. Just a gentle push, leans into the drive"
"a bouncer, a high bouncer, 143 kph. Second bouncer called. Not wide"
"on the pads, worked to square leg"
"full and straight, some seam movement back in, pushed to mid-on with the angle"
"just short of midwicket. No need for these strokes. Back of a length on middle, Shafiq mis-times his pull and is lucky that the ball lands in front of Khawaja"
calls for one. Gets there. A bit of a leading edge to mid-off. Warner is quick to it and fires an inaccurate throw to the batsman's end. <strong>Out with a direct hit</strong>
"oh yea. What a shot. Full and straight and speaking about percentage strokes, how's this? Presents the full face of the bat and lofts over mid-on. Clean ball-striking. Clears the boundary. Experience."
defended into the off side
"good length delivery outside off, blocked to cover"
"driven towards cover.  A loud call of 'yeees', gets there easily. Well played"
"big appeal, not out. <strong>Smith reviews. Has nothing to lose. </strong>Good length on middle and leg, seaming back in. Strikes Malik over the kneeroll. No bat. Looks a touch high. Two reds, but one very important green as the ball is heading over leg stump. An easy decision that on this surface."
"good length outside off, some inward seam movement. Malik is beaten on the inside edge"
"too straight, nudged away to deep backward square leg for a couple more. Already can see what Pakistan missed in the previous game, some experience"
"inside-edged just past the stumps. A leaden-footed slap, one to fine leg"
"through square leg for a couple more. Full and straight from Cummins, Shafiq skews a couple towards fine leg"
"full and straight, a thick inside edge into the pad? No, says umpire Wilson. <strong>Big big appeal.</strong> No inside edge. Hit both pads. Sliding down? Umpire's call on impact with stumps"
"nice channel around off, defended"
"132 kph, length on middle, inside-edged into the pad. Malik sends an exuberant Shafiq back. No run there"
"132 kph, fullish outside off, another solid defensive block"

"Warner dives to his right, saves three and almost effects a wicket. But Malik has made the run, pushed off the front foot to mid-off"
"that's Shafiq gone. Extremely poor shot. Full and wide from Starc, the ball was moving away. He had  o reason to play with this being Starc's last over. Shafiq, though, wanted to drive through cover. Ended up stretching out for the ball, but it was too wide. Had no control, no balance and got a thick outside edge to Wade"
