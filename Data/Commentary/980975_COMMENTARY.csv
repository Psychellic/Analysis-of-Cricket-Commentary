"swings towards the batsman again from around leg stump, typical Gambhir tuck to work that ball to long leg for two more"

"wider this time outside off, GG cuts that straight to point"
"back of length outside off, Uthappa leans forward to push it to cover"
"bit of inswing for the back of length ball, Gambhir hops on the back foot to easily tuck it to deep backward square leg"
"he chases the wide delivery, that's swinging away further, without any footwork and misses!"
"pretty wide outside off again, more outswing and Uthappa swings and misses again. Nowhere close to the ball"
"slightly better form Kulkarni and much much better from Uthappa! Length delivery swinging away outside off, Uthappa reaches out and crunches a cover drive in the gap!"
a tad short and the same result! More swing away from the Uthappa and he again caresses that through the wide gap in the covers
"bowled around his legs, PK punches the air! It pitched around leg and was swinging down a bit, for the leg slip in place, Gambhir glanced but the ball deflected off the thigh pad and change direction to hit the stumps! That's a big wicket for Lions"
gets a back of length delivery and he pushes it towards mid-on
"edged to the keeper, Pandey goes for a duck! What a beauty that was - just back of length on off stump with seam pointing towards the slips, Pandey doesn't move his feet and pokes at the ball as it swings away a bit and there's no room for him. Faint outside edge and an easy catch for the keeper"
"nicely bowled on the stumps with a hint of outswing, Surya stays back and blocks"
"keeps low as it's pitched well outside off and swings away further, Surya leaves it"
"ends the over by swinging the ball in from outside off, Surya slices and gets two to third man where Shivil Kaushik slides to keep it in"
"misfield at fine leg and that's gone for four, the crowd likes it! The ball came into Uthappa and he flicked it away nicely behind square for just a single, but Shivil, who went down on a knee to stop that, couldn't hold on to it. Deflected off him for four"
back of length and extra bounce as Uthappa swings and misses
"Uthappa goes as well, caught behind! Nicely bowled just outside off, it looked like Uthappa wanted to push it firmly down the ground but played the wrong line and gave a faint outside edge to the keeper. The umpire's finger went up immediately"

swings into the batsman now who wants to flick and manages a leg bye
"angles it sharply in towards the off stump, Surya defends it late to wide slip"
"that's gone high and not too far, but lands just beyond mid-off's reach! Surya drove the fullish delivery on the up and didn't middle it, Finch chased from mid-off and it was well beyond his reach"
"that's a <strong>stunner</strong> from Raina at slip! Whoa! I need to see a few replays to believe that. Smith angled the short ball in and Surya swayed his head out of the way to ramp that over the slips, it took his glove and then - Raina leapt a long way to his left with his right hand high and plucked the ball out of its path"
"in the air again and it goes just over cover for four! Yusuf gets a fullish delivery first ball, he swings hard and sends that flying for four"

a bit of room again and he cuts to short third for a quick single
turning into Shakib and he tucks it off the pads to leg for one
"little flat on off, Shakib goes back and blocks"

"way too full down leg, low full toss, and he steers it to short fine leg where PK dives to his left to stop it"

"the batsman rocks outside leg again, Jadeja chases him with a flat dart and hits the pad. The ball rolls to off"
"Pathan makes room now, Jadeja pushes it outside off.  Pathan reaches out and carves it past backward point. Jadeja should have shortened his length further"
"Jadeja slides it flat and outside off, Yusuf wants to bash it through the off side. He only manages an under edge, it sneaks through DK's legs. Kaushil tracks it from short third man, slides, and keeps it to two"
"Shakib dances down the track, Bravo digs it short and wide outside off. The batsman reaches out and scythes it over the covers for a six"

"bit too full, Shakib clears his front foot and slams that to the wide long-on boundary! There was a fielder waiting there and it sailed just over his jump"

"full toss low and wide outside off, driven away to sweeper cover for one"

"nicely bowled - slow offcutter around off, Shakib can't put it away and finds Bravo"
"nearly in the block hole outside off, Yusuf digs it down to long-on"

"full toss outside off to end the innings, Shakib swings hard to dispatch it through the covers and Jadeja sprints to his left to just keep it in with his left hand, and then throws it back too. Excellent effort"

"straighter at the same length, Smith works to square leg to get the chase running"
"full again on middle and leg, McCullum, who is standing on a leg-stump guard, pushes to mid-off"
"really good bowling this. Bowling it full and inviting the ball to swing. it does, away swing, but driven to mid-on"
"141 kph, KKR cannot believe it. I heard a noise too. Good length outside off, McCullum shimmies down and has a wild slog at it. Misses says the umpire. Uthappa went up straight away. A definite sound as ball passed bat, but what was it?"
"good length outside off, hustles Baz for pace, as he miscues his cut to point"
"walloped away through midwicket. Smith stands tall in his crease, anticipates Morkel's natural length - shortish on middle - and swats it away with a cross-batted heave"
"back of a length on leg, clipped to square leg for one"
shot! Makes room and scythes the cut over point. Just backed away to create some space and then thrashes the shortish length with ease
"yikes, through McCullum. His first ball that is pitched up - full down leg. McCullum shuffles across and misses another wild heave. Goes between pad and stumps"
"another one from McCullum, 144 kph. Full on leg, squeezed to midwicket off the inside half of the bat"

"flat but down leg, Smith gets down into an awkward position and sweeps it in the gap behind square"
"again, on with the arm. No turn. Flat down leg, Smith waits but is still beaten. Hits him on the thigh pad"
"smashed. Tossed up, Smith gets down to the pitch and drills a drive to Suryakumar at mid-off. A fumble and the ball goes through. He didn't really attempt to go after it, must have been some internal pain"
"flight on off, bunted to long-on"
"four more, very streaky. McCullum looking far from good. Some flight on off and middle, BM runs to the pitch and looks to go straight, but the ball skews off the inside half and finds the gap at midwicket"
"yorker outside off, dug out to cover"
"pace off the ball on middle, heaved away to midwicket"

five! Five free runs for Gujarat. Digs the bouncer in halfway down. And it takes off. Whistles over Uthappa's gloves
"poor from russell. Low full toss on leg, Smith just gets a bit of bat on it, that's all he needed to do. Fine leg fence is found and Gujarat have the start they wanted"
"full outside off, pushed to cover. Gambhir has a shy at the bowler's end but misses"
"slower delivery on off, 128 kph. Comes back in, may have been the offcutter. Point is found"

"too short! Smith stayed back, waited for it to come to him and then slammed that behind square on the leg side for a six!"
"leg stump gone! It was way slower at 80kmh, Smith came down and exposed his stumps while trying to slog it to leg, missed it completely and the crowd likes it!"
thick edge goes to point as Raina plays for the spin but it doesn't come in as much
with a straighter bat now as he pushes the length ball to leg side. Shakib goes to his left to stop the ball and <strong>twists his right ankle</strong>!
"gives too much room on the off side, Raina goes on the back foot and punches that nicely through the covers for four! Off the mark in style"
"short ball with some room, McCullum makes even more and slaps that on the off side with so much power that it reached the boundary in a second or two!"
"even shorter and this one's cut for six! Way too short, McCullum made room again and unleashed an upper cut to send that sailing over third man!"
"pretty full now outside off, Baz drills it down to mid-off"
"on the other side now - six to the leg side, that's <strong>HUGGE</strong>! Short ball angling in, it doesn't bother Baz as he opens up and clobbers it with a hook to the midwicket boundary. 106 metres according to the TV"
"beats him with a slower delivery that landed on length, Baz tried to push it down but missed as the ball just missed the leg stump too"

chips the ball uppishly to the left of Chawla to long-on for one
"Baz holes out to long-on! He was just starting to fire...came down the track, took the ball on full and slammed it straight down the ground. And Manish Pandey does well to pouch that near the boundary at chest height. The umpires check for no ball and it's fine"
"bit of turn outside off, pushed to cover point and chance of an overthrow after a direct hit at the keeper's end but the batsmen decide against it"
"goes pretty straight after pitching on middle, Raina pushes into the covers"
"the wrong'un comes in from outside off, Raina waits and steers it late to short third man"
reverse-swept against the turn from around off stump and he has placed that very well to send that along the ground to the third-man boundary
"this time with the spin, and four more! Pitched up, DK leans forward and sweeps that with the turn to the wide long-on boundary"
"a different kind of shot and same result! Tossed up outside off, DK this time flicks it nicely and in the gap again, same part of the ground for another boundary"
"too short with some turn, DK goes back and pulls it to long leg"

"just back of length on middle and leg, worked off the pads as he goes on the toes"
"just back of length, DK defends and the ball rolls to the leg side behind square"
"shortish ball, Raina hops on his toes again and works it to leg"
"expects the shortish ball and he goes on his toes, defends it to off"
"maybe DK was expecting the short ball too, he goes a long way to off and tries to scoop it over short fine leg, but misses"
on the back foot and defends the ball behind square on leg for one
on middle and leg and Raina clips it off the back foot to long leg

"short of length on off, Raina defends it with firm hands towards cover point and gets one more"
"back of length, DK stays back in the crease and blocks"
"short, hooked, DK doesn't middle it at all and still gets six! He came down the track and took his eyes off the ball at the last moment while hooking, the bounce took the top edge and went flying fine on the leg side"
pushes the ball off the back foot into the covers for one
"makes room, unleashes a scorching drive and Gambhir dives at short cover to save that one"
shuffles to off to clip the leg-stump ball to fine leg
shuffles down the pitch and drives that nicely to sweeper cover in the gap for two
"charges down and tries to slap it to leg, doesn't middle so gets a single to leg"
"bangs it in short outside off, DK steers it late towards the slip region for one"
goes back and across and pulls it gently to deep square leg
"another clever shot nicely played by DK! This was coming in from outside off, DK opens the face of the bat late, again, and beats the fairly square third man"
what happened there?! Goes way across to scoop it over short fine leg but is through the shot early an gets an outside edge to third man
stays back in the crease and defends the short ball back
"angling in sharply, flicks and misses to take it on the pad"
"that's too short, DK pivots on the back foot and pulls that away, in the gap again, wide of fine leg for four"
stays back to cover the stumps and blocks the back of length ball
"<strong>put down</strong>! It was a tough chance down the leg side as DK pulled the short of length ball late, Uthappa tried to catch with his left hand and it came out of the glove"
"top-edge and Raina is gone! Short ball angling away, Raina pulls very unconvincingly and hands a pretty easy catch to Hoggy at fine leg"
"DK is still going strong! He sees that short ball outside off, gets into position nicely and ramps that away to the third man boundary for four more"
too wide from Shakib and Finch gets too to punch it with some power to the covers boundary. What a start from Finch
"drills that along the ground to cover, deflects off the cover fielder and they still get two"
"what a beauty, shot of the day! Pitched up outside off, Finch moved an inch to leg and drove that inside-out beautifully way over the covers for a six! Worth watching several replays"

goes on the back foot and cuts that to deep point
"fullish outside off again, driven down to long-off for one"

outside off and he cuts it to deep cover after the turn
"plomps his front foot across and Finch sweeps that fine on the leg side, from well outside off, for four"
"and another boundary! How many mangoes has Finch had today? He made room early, Chawla gifted him a short ball that turned away too and Finch slammed it away to the cover boundary"
"on the other side now - slog-swept for six! Reaches out a long way down the ground with his front foot and sweeps that away against the turn, a long way to the midwicket boundary!"
punched off the back foot but straight to cover
"starts with a four! DK goes a long way to off and sweeps that with the turn to leg, and places it so well he beats a sliding Russell at fine leg"
"<strong>edged and dropped</strong>! DK dances down to swing, gets an outside edge as the wrong'un goes away but Uthappa can't hold on to it"

presses forward and takes the ball on the pad outside leg
"turns away a bit from off, Jadeja stays back and defends to leg"
"tossed up almost in the block hole, Jads swings and gets an edge to leg for one"
"the ball turns into him, cramps him for room and Jadeja can't put it away"
"turning in again, this time Jadeja clips it off his pads to deep square leg and brings the scores level with two quick runs"
stays back and defends the straighter ball back
"oh my, a run out when the scores are level. Finch is furious! Jadeja leaned into the ball to help it to midwicket and took a couple of steps before stopping and Finch wanted a quick single that didn't even exist. Manish Pandey collects the ball cleanly and runs to the stumps to take the bails off"
outside off now and he helps it to point now
too full and Jadeja seals it with a slog-sweep for six to the wide long-on boundary!
