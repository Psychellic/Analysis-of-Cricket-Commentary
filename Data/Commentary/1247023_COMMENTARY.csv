"<strong>slower bouncer nabs him!</strong> Ball sticks in the wicket with tennis ball bounce, Rutherford struggles trying to keep his hands back with his body already rotated through his intended pull, he eventually swats at this and it comes off the gloves quite clearly to balloon to the keeper. Simple decision for the umpire."

Frankly an absurd call, it passed at shoulder height. But Clarke did a horrendous job fumbling the take on a bounce to allow it to go to the rope."
knee high full toss on the body is punched high and deep over the long-on rope. Good Lord what a finish to the innings! That wide call and fumble by Clarke essentially results in 10 extra runs for Zalmi!

Goes through his legs into the rope."
