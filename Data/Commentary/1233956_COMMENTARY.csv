"down the leg side, and beats Seifert. Bennett puts in a dive, but cannot reel it back in before they run three"
"pitched up, and he drives this straight down"
"down the leg side, and called wide again"
defends one straightening into him
driven hard towards mid-off
"makes room, and lofts him over extra cover. It has gone a looooong way into the banks"
"slanted in, and he whips it away towards deep mid-wicket. Wants two, but he's timed it far too well for that"
defends one around off
"<strong>ooh, just off the fingertips of the man at slip!</strong> Mitchell there, and King looks to drive firmly. It takes the outside edge and just flies to the right of the man there. Cannot be called a drop technically"
"he gets his man this time! Brisk, just outside off, and invites the lofted drive again. Off the outside edge as King looks to go straighter, and flies down to Jimmy Neesham at third man. Good catch, taken by settling himself under it, and bending his knee as he pouches it"
"<strong>ooh, dismissive!</strong> It's fast, but way down the leg side, and he has fine leg inside the circle, and Mayers can just get enough bat on it to get it down to the fence"
"length, goes back and across and whips this towards mid-wicket"
"<strong>inside edge, but goes past Seifert to his left!</strong> Quick, and bouncy, and angles into Fletcher, who tries to do nothing other than defend. It flies off to fine leg"
"short, a bit wide, and left alone. Seifert collects this quite high to his left. Some late movement after passing the bat"
"banged in short, and Mayers has a swish, looking to go over mid-wicket, but misses"
"fast, angles across him, and he fails to make contact with an intended swing across the line"
