backs away to slap that over cover but played too early and missed the length ball that drifted away
"steps out, gets to the pitch and thumps this between cover and mid-off. Sweet"
"floated it full at length on middle, Narine gives him the charge and lofts though the line over his head. One bounce into the boundary. Not much turn so hitting through the line isn't that much of a risk"
"too full and crashed. Gayle watches in amusement. This is easy pickings. Gets underneath the delivery and lofts him over cover. Good, clean striking this. Wow"
hint of turn but this time he hits with the spin. Shimmies down the pitch and hammers him over long-on. Stunning
"drags the sweep to square leg. He's got more than 50 runs in the last two games, all in boundaries. What a start for KKR"
"gets this to bounce awkwardly, coming into his rib cage as Gambhir hops back. Rapped on the glove as he tried to fend. Wasn't watching the ball"
slash and a miss. This was ripe for the picking: short and had plenty of width. Any amount of bat and it would've raced over the slip cordon
"banged in short on middle and leg from wide of the crease, Gambhir beaten for pace as he looks to hook. Umpires glance at each other before the straight umpire calls wide, possibly because of height. Kohli not amused but a fair call"
"full toss on middle, Gambhir misses out, late on an attempted drive down the ground. Mistimes it back to the bowler"
"hops back and across as she tucks it to square leg. Wanted the run but was sent back. Good work from Chahal, who swooped in quickly from midwicket to prevent the run"
"too short, enough width as well and Gambhir uses the pace to help this over the third man boundary. He was looking up to the square leg umpire to check for no-ball. It should've been one for this was way over the head. Gambhir's feet were in the air when he made contact"
"slower delivery, turns out into a full toss which Gambhir drives to cover. The overthrow hits Gayle on the thigh. The big man is down"
"nips away off the seam from length outside off, Narine plays and misses. Looked to punch that on the up"
"steps out and mistimes a lofted hit to long-on, got that off a thick inside edge"
uses the pace to glide this past Gayle at wide slip. Third man was square and had no chance
"short of length outside off, Gambhir runs it down to third man and jogs the single"
flat-bats a pull over the bowler's head. Disdainfully done. The final flourish was that of a man with supreme confidence. Too short from Aravind
"backs away to make room and smokes the length ball between cover and point. Ganguly, watching from the stands, would've been proud of that stroke."
"floats this full on middle, Gambhir gets a thick inside edge towards deep square. Chahal comes in and fires a throw at the bowler's end. <b> Run-out chance missed. Mills should've been backing up. Narine wasn't even in the picture. </b>"
misfield by Mandeep at point gives away a single. Delicate little dab from Gambhir by hopping back. Mandeep slipped.
"wayward. Sliding down leg, Narine misses a tickle, Jadhav can't stop it fully on the dive either, deflects it to the fine leg boundary. More frustration for Kohli and RCB"
whips a length ball to Chahal at deep square leg
"the late movement has done the trick. This length delivery bowled with a scrambled seam comes back in to middle and deviates late to square up Gambhir, who pokes at that. It was dying on Jadhav, because of lack of pace, and he dived forward to complete the catch. Gambhir walks off shaking his head, he though it came off the hand. The onfield umpires can only check if it carried. <b> Replays confirm Gambhir got glove on that. </b>"
eased down the ground. It was a tease for mid-off and mid-on (ABD and Binny). Both of them dived across but couldn't get a hand on it. Sweet timing
goes back into the crease and defends. Eventful over
"clears his front leg, looks to slap this over cover but played too early and is beaten"
"low full toss angling into middle and leg, eased down to long-on"
"hesitation. <b> Uthappa had given up and hoped Negi would miss the direct hit from point. </b> Fortunately for him, he missed. Total breakdown in commiunication"
"dabbed wide of cover, once again uncertainty in the running, they eventually get across. Hit this well to Kohli, who misfielded."
"floated full on middle, flicked to square leg. Risky as he's playing across the line. Plumb if he missed"
"full and straight on the stumps from wide of the crease, squeezed back to the bowler"
"length ball sliding into middle and leg, whipped into the midwicket boundary. Strong wrists, super timing."
"steps out and flat-bats one to mid-off, gave him the charge and gave away his intention very early. Was cramped for room so couldn't complete the shot"
"floats this full outside off from wide of the crease, Narine uses his stretch to reach out and slice this over short third man. Not sure it was deliberate, looked like he was trying to hit over point but he'll take the runs anyway"
"timed beautifully but he's picked out the lone man at deep square leg. Too short, he goes back into the crease and whips that away. Chahal was right there at the ropes and took it with both hands facing the sky. Narine's done his job though, he's livid with himself for playing that shot"
drives the length ball on the up to cover
"angles one in full on off from wide of the crease, defended back down the pitch"
"slider outside off, punched to deep cover"
"<b> The drift has done the trick. </b> Appeal for lbw as Uthappa plays across the line to a full ball on middle, umpire CK Nandan thought about this for a while and decided it would've crashed into the stumps. Played into Badree's hands, should've been trying to play straighter towards long-on rather than midwicket."
"lunges forward to drive, gets a thick inside edge to midwicket"
"skids on from off stump, Pandey is looking to cut but readjusts and blocks"
worked against the turn past the diving Kohli at midwicket
"sharp turn from off stump, Yusuf hangs back and blocks. Better second over from Badree"
"flipper on middle, Pandey late on the shot but somehow manages to hit it off the top part to long-on"

"fetches the sweep from outside off to deep square, good work by Aravind"
"hint of width, Pandey makes room and forces if to sweeper cover"
"too full on off, Yusuf prefers the sweep again, down to Badree who stops it with his boot at short fine leg"
driven with the spin to long-off
"tossed up on middle, worked across the line to long-on this time"
lunges forward and turns it into the gap between deep midwicket and deep square. Aggressive running
"fired outside off, Yusuf uses the pace to dab this to short third man and scamper a quick single. Before he looked up, Pandey was off the blocks"
"slower through the air, lands this at length, Pandey punches it back to the bowler"
doesn't read the googly and plays outside the line and sees the ball hit him on the pad. But the ball was going down
"too short, Pandey rocks back and cuts. Chahal's half-stop takes the pace off, but they come back for the second"
"fired full on middle, squeezed to the man coming in from deep midwicket. There's a rocket throw at the keeper's end, which Jadhav collects to break the stumps but the full stretch meant Yusuf was in no real danger. Simple call for the third umpire"
"beautifully done by Chahal. Big moment, surely? Sees Yusuf give him the charge and fires this down leg, Jadhav is alert to that possibility, moves swiftly to his left, collects cleanly and whips the bails off even as a desperate Yusuf tries to lunge back in."
"drives, gets a thick inside edge to midwicket"
"dipping low full toss on the pads, worked to deep square leg"
"driven down the ground to long-off, got well forward to take it on the full"

gets to the pitch of the ball and works it down to long-on
"googly which Pandey doesn't read off the hand, readjusts to block as it comes back in"
"superbly done. Badree drops short, Pandey goes back into the crease and then opens the bat face late to ease this behind point."
wrong'un which he works with the angle to deep backward square leg
"flicks a low full toss straight to midwicket. Pandey can't believe what he's just done. Nicely tossed up, the ball dips on him and Pandey hit it well but found the fielder"
"too full on off, squeezed back to the bowler"
"draws him forward, deceives him in flight, de Grandhomme looks to biff this over the long-off boundary but gets a thick edge as the ball spun away sharply, gleefully accepted by Kohli at slip. Chahal is having a grand party at the moment. KKR continue to slip and slide"
"tossed up on the stumps, he lunges forward and deadbats that"
shapes to cut but the ball fizzes across to beat the outside edge. Too close to play that shot
"touch short, waits for it to turn and then eases it between cover and point to get off the mark"
"tossed up outside off, forced off the frontfoot to backward point"
looks to paddle this but ends up hitting it onto the helmet. Negi cleverly tossed this up way outside off to make it tougher to premeditate
driven with the spin to cover
"steps out to whip it away but gets a thick inside edge onto the pad, rolls back to the bowler"
"cuts and gets a thick edge that flies past a diving Kohli at slip. No short third man, so that was headed only one way. Welcome boundary"
slider that comes back in with the arm to hit him high on the thigh pad as he looks to whip this behind square
"driven with the spin to a diving Kohli at cover, dived full-stretch to his right to pull off a one-handed stop"
"slow turn from off, punched to cover where the captain misfields, they won't chance a second as Mandeep swoops in from the boundary"
"looks to drive but gets a thick inside edge, rolls back to the bowler"
"lofted but not entirely in control, on the bounce to Mandeep at deep point. Sliced it"
beauty! Sharp turn across the face of the bat to beat him comprehensively

"steps out to go over long-on, gets a thick inside edge to deep midwicket"
"drifts in, Surya waits for it to spin away as he drives wide of cover"
"arm-ball which skids back in from around the stumps, Woakes makes room and steers this to point"
faster one that comes back in to cramp him for room and hit him on the thigh pad as he look to work it to the leg side
leans forward and works the full delivery on middle and leg to deep square
"floats a cutter outside off, Woakes mistimes an attempted lofted hit to long-off"
"swept into the square leg fence. Aravind sees him moving inside the crease and drops this short, perhaps in an attempt to bounce him, but Surya nails the sweep into the gap. Chahal at the boundary had no chance"
"yorker on middle, squeezed to long-on"
"short of length outside off, thumped to sweeper cover"
"length ball but another cutter, not much pace to run it down but Surya tries to do just that and misses. This gripped the surface and spun away"
"low full toss on the pads, flicked into the gap between deep square and deep midwicket"
glorious. Mills overpitches outside off stump and he just leans into this and holds the pose as he lifts this over extra cover
"short ball outside off, he backs away to make room for a ramp through third man, beaten"
"slower ball at off stump, leans into it again. He seemed to have picked the slower ball, but ended up picking deep midwicket too. Got to the pitch and tried to lift it over that corner of the boundary with an aerial flick, but got under it too much. High before landing safely in the fielder's grasp"
"slower ball, back of a length. Angles in at off stump, sits in the pitch and slides under his attempted cut shot"
"conventional bouncer this time, hooks it off the middle of the bat from an off stump line. One bounce to Mandeep at deep square leg"
"short ball at off stump, mistimed pull shot, straight to midwicket"
"tossed up outside off stump, walks across his stumps and puts in a lot of effort to drag that sweep to long leg"
"flat and full at off stump, he was looking to back away and slam this through the off side, but could only push it to long-off"
"walks across the stumps again, gets an arm ball that slides down leg. Would have slid into his leg if he hadn't moved, but this is no game for a bowler. Wide"
"tossed up outside off stump, stands his ground this time and meets it at the pitch. Gets good connection too as he drives this flat, but that is his undoing in the end. Not enough to clear ABD at long-off who hops up gracefully and takes the offering mid-air"
"Negi will have a hat-trick ball at No. 11. This is good length, off stump, and it meets with a wild heave with no feet movement. Problem for Yadav is, it has met the heave on the leading edge. Lobs up for Mills who takes it too easy at short third man, fumbles and takes on the second attempt"
<b>oh so close!</b> He stays around the wicket and fires this flat and full at middle stump. Kuldeep goes for the sweep and <i>just</i> about gets an inside edge on it to tickle it to short fine. Out if he had missed that

"full and fast outside off stump, Umesh was heaving leg side at middle stump to it as it flew past the outside edge"
"full ball in the corridor, he backs away and looks to slice this square through the off side, beaten"
"gives him the charge, mistimes the drive on the up and finds extra cover"
"and that's it for KKR. This is an off cutter. Good length outside off stump, steps out and looks to swing this into the midwicket boundary, but he's missed. It slams into the middle stump"
"starts off by angling a full delivery outside off, which Gayle leaves. That's one of the biggest no-balls you've seen this season. <b> Free-hit </b>"
"bangs one in short, Gayle is beaten for pace as he looks to pull, Gayle cops one on the glove and Gambhir takes the catch at short leg. Effort short delivery at 140 plus"
looks to flick but the ball swings back in late to deflect off  the pad to fine leg
"<b> they've snuffed out Kohli for a first-ball duck. </b> He's livid with the shot, Gambhir and KKR are pumped. Eden roars. This is full outside off, the ball moves away a wee bit, Kohli shapes for the drive away from the body but is late on the stroke and Pandey takes it on the second attempt at a wide second slip."
gets on top of the bounce and runs it down to third man to get off the mark
"floats a full delivery across Gayle, who lets it go again"
right behind that good length delivery on middle in defence. Top over to begin your defence of a modest total
"starts off with a full-length delivery on off stump, Mandeep is half-forward as he defends"
"width and he's cut that straight to Pandey at point. RCB are making a mess of this or what? He picked the length early but looked like he checked his shot, almost steered it into the hands of the fielder."
"short ball on the body from wide of the crease, de Villiers sways out of the way"
vintage AB. Sliding onto middle and leg at length and he whips this effortlessly into the midwicket boundary
bunts a length ball on off to mid-on
nips back in to hit him on the thigh pad as de Villiers looked to whip that to midwicket
"leading edge that flies past where third slip would've been, down to third man. Looked to flick but this one held its line"
gift of a delivery for AB. Full and drifting into the pads and he tickles it into the fine leg boundary
"oh, dear. What is happening at Eden? AB tries to fetch a pull from outside off and the extra pace of Coulter-Nile doe the trick as AB top-edges the pull to Uthappa behind the stumps. The bottom hand came off the glove as he completed the pull, the ball was swirling for a long time, Uthappa called for it and pouched it cleanly on the dive. <B> That delivery was a shade under 150 clicks </b>"
"gets this to jag away off the seam from length outside off, Jadhav lets it go. This one's another no-ball. <B> Free-hit for Jadhav </b>"
slants a wide down leg. Slower ball gone wrong. Jadhav was early into the pull. The free-hit will stay
"edged and over third man. Too full, he backed away to carve this behind point but just about managed to squeeze this over Surya at wide second slip. Useful boundary"
punched on the up to mid-off
delightful square drive! Overpitched and Jadhav leant into it to smash that over point. Couple of bounces into the boundary
"full and sliding into middle and leg, tucked to square leg"
"right into the blockhole at the base of off, Gayle jams his bat down late to squeeze the inside edge to square leg"
shapes to cut but holds back and ends up wafting at that without much success. Beaten
"too quick for him to play a full-blooded pull, gets in line to play the shot and ends up rolling his wrists to get it down to fine leg."
"pulled but straight to square leg. That was dug in at 139kph, Gayle was ready for it"
"through Gayle. Full and straight on the stumps, this swung back in to shave past the inside edge as Gayle looked to flick"
"chips it straight to mid-on. Did the ball stop on him? The length ball angles back in, Jadhav was looking to whip this towards midwicket but the bounce meant it hit him on the top part of the bat and mid-on took a dolly. RCB in tatters."
"gets this to buzz across the deck at length outside off, Binny watches it fly to Uthappa behind the stumps"
"hustled for pace by that 142kph short ball, Binny is squared up as he somehow skews it to the off side. Tried to turn it square to the leg side."
"looks to drive, minimal feet movement, gets an inside edge back to the bowler. Bat came down at an angle"
thumped but straight to the cover fielder
"width, too full and Binny latches on to smack that over point. Third man didn't move."
"bouncer to Gayle, who sways out of the way. Excellent from Umesh. Effort, bending his back. Causing some discomfort to the tacky back of Gayle"
beaten. Hangs an angled bat out to play that away-going length ball. Squared up by late movement
"thick outside edge, flies into the third man boundary on the bounce. Looks to fetch the pull from way outside off, beaten for pace again. Lucky to get away this time. Gambhir won't mind that"
"tucked up by a bouncer on the rib-cage, fends it to short square leg. An overthrow at the bowler' end gives them a second. Sloppy from Kuldeep, who was't behind the line of the throw at mid-off"
"edged but down to third man. Squared up again, just wide of Yusuf at slip. Gayle is living on the edge at the moment"
width and Binny slashes that past the diving point fielder. Uppish but Pandey had no chance despite a full-stretch to his left.
"floats this full on middle, Gayle blocks"
"skiddy bouncer outside off, but this was way over the batsman's head and out of his reach"
"look to muscle the pull over midwicket, but skews it straight to mid-off. Once again the pace doing the trick for KKR. Gayle clearly late on the shot, didn't get any power behind that whatsoever and it turned out to be a dolly. RCB slip and slide further. You can't take Coulter-Nile away from the action tonight, can you?"
"beaten by a jaffa! Floats this a touch ahead of length outside off, Binny feels for the delivery but the late deviation means it just shaves past the outside edge."
hops back to punch a length ball to cover
"got him. Flirting at that length ball with an angled bat, super seam position from Woakes as the deviation takes the edge through to Uthappa. Absolute carnage. This was Binny's chance to a win a game for his side, won't happen tonight."
"floats this full on off, Badree keeps that out"
works a length ball on middle and leg towards deep backward square leg. Good running
"play and a miss. Lunges forward to poke at that away-going delivery. Nibbling it around, is de Grandhomme"
"Got the previous one to slant away, brought this back in to nail him. Super. Negi looks to work across the line when he should have been looking to play straighter. Once he missed, he was a dead duck. Eden Gardens roars. <b> RCB in danger of being bowled out for the lowest-ever IPL score </b>"
looks to flay that up on the up over cover but is late on the shot
looks for a wild slog over long-on but bat nowhere near the line of the delivery. Beaten
"punched uppishly to long-off, Mills off the mark"
"back of length outside off, punched to cover where a misfield allows a single"
hops back and across to defend that short of length delivery outside off
"gets this to angle back in full on the stumps from wide of the crease, Badree plays down the wrong line. The ball misses the inside edge to hit him on the pad. Would've smashed the middle of middle."
looks to slash this over point but is beaten because of the bounce
"I'm not sure Aravind believes what he's just done! Length ball angling away, he punches this over cover, flew off the blade. Raced to the boundary."
"gets out of the way of that short ball, flies through to Uthappa"
"another nothing shot and gone! Length ball outside off, he looks to wallop this across the line over midwicket but miscues it towards mid-off. Kuldeep sprints in from long-off, calls clearly to keep the cover fielder off, settles underneath it and takes it on the move. Superb"
thick inside-edge down to fine leg. Played outside the line of that length ball that nipped back in
"gets this to wobble away from outside off, Chahal is beaten"
"pokes at a length ball going away with an angled bat, gets an edge that flies low to Pandey who dives to his left to complete a stunning catch. What a capitulation this. <b> RCB bundled out for the lowest score in IPL history. </b>"
