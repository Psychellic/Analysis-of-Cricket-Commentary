"back of a length outside off, no movement again, thick outside edge as he hits away from the body again, third man cleans up"
"back of a length at off stump, angled across him, but no movement in the air. Defended solidly off the back foot"

"back of a length at off stump, punched to mid-on on the up"

"short ball at leg stump, controlled pull shot, straight to deep square"
"back of a length at off stump, defended to point off the back foot with soft hands"

"good length, angled in at middle stump, pushed back to the bowler on the up"
"good length at middle stump, tapped into the leg side off the back foot"
"overpitched outside off stump, drilled straight to mid-off"
"good adjustment. This was short and wide, and it gripped in the pitch. He had shaped up for a cut shot and had to adjust for the pace. Did it nicely, rolled the wrists over it and slapped it past extra cover"
"overpitched, just outside off stump. Keeps the front leg away from the pitch and uses the room to lift this over mid-off"
"offcutter, sliding in at leg stump at a good length, tucked to short fine's right"
"oh this is close. Smith is trapped on the back foot. This skids in off a length and pings his back leg. You can see all three stumps as he's struck on the pad, but the umpire has turned down the appeal. Probably on the angle."

"goes for the sweep again. Gets a slight inside edge, onto pad"
"beaten for pace, but he survives. He leans in at this leg stump ball, looks to flick it after picking line early, but that's a slower ball. He chips it with no control, gets it wide of the bowler and to long-on"
"back of a length at middle stump, tapped on the up to long-on"
"beaten on pace once more. This is back of a length and Kishan wants to pull. Through the shot early and this goes over the middle stump, very nearly taking it"
"back of a length, this is quicker, and also beats him on pace. He's late on the pull and drags it off the sticker region, wide of long-on. They return for the second...just about, in Smith's case"
"and he <b>miscues yet another pull.</b> This is angled in at leg stump, back of a length. Closes the face too early, gets it off the top edge, but to deep square's left and into the boundary padding"
"slower ball, good length, down the leg side"
"if this pattern holds, Kishan will never pull a muscle in his life. Back of a length, slower ball, rises up on him and he misses the pull shot once more. This thuds into his back thigh and falls into the off side"

It goes high, towards the deep midwicket boundary where Nabi jumps backwards and can't catch it. Might have misjudged that, because he has no business being in from the boundary on a small ground. Kishan's <b>first IPL fifty has come up</b>."
"back of a length at middle stump, whipped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
"defends this slider off the back foot, wanted to pull"

"full toss outside off stump, pushed feebly to extra cover"

"back of a length at off stump, punches off the back foot to sweeper cover"
"back of a length, googly at off stump, chopped to sweeper cover's right"

"<b>yikes.</b> How To Lose Your Way 101. Googly, good length. Pitches at off stump. Finch seems to have picked it. That might be the only explanation to why he tried to bludgeon this over the square leg boundary at this point in the innings. Misses the slog sweep, loses his middle stump"

"full toss, angled into the pads, whipped gratefully to the long leg boundary"
"yorker floors Faulkner as he tries to dig it out. But he manages in the end. Takes some time getting up as Jadeja runs for the singl. Bowler pivots and shies at the non-strikers, can't get a direct hit"
"back of a length at off stump, dabs it to short third man, teases him at the non-strikers and earns a second via the overthrow to long-on"
"full ball outside off stump, driven to deep extra cover"
"bowled him. Good length ball angled in at leg stump, backs away and swings across the line and this one slides through from under the bat. Into leg stump"
thanks for coming. Good length ball at middle stump. The kind of regulation stuff you bowl in the nets when there's no batsman at target practice. And it's just as well with the way Sangwan plays this. No clue as he pushes at this well after it has burst through him and into the stumps
"yorker at off stump, stays leg side of this, squeezes it out to long-off"
"full and straight, he was going for, but this drifts down slightly and catches his pads while still moving, in front of leg stump"
"good length, angled wide across the off stump, and past the wide marker too"
"that is a strange bit of fielding from Warner. Like a glitch in a video game. Full toss at leg stump, swings across the line, gets it wide of long-on where Warner runs to his left and holds his palms up to his left. The ball went from under"
"back of a length outside off stump, pushed to sweeper cover on the up"
"vicious inswinger from outside off stump, beats the inside edge of the bat, beats the outside edge of the stumps"
"another inswinger, this starts on middle and thuds into the pads. Jadeja refuses the run"

"inswinger, back of a length. Pitches on off, beats his cross-batted heave, climbs over middle stump. But Jadeja sneaks a bye"
"offcutter, short and wide outside off stump, makes him check his cut. He can only find sweeper in the end"
"good length at off stump, looks to slog across the line, it's too quick for him. He can only bunt it back to the bowler"
"the perfect yorker. Pitches on the crease, takes the inside edge and clatters into the off stump"
"back of a length at middle stump, flicked off the hips to deep square leg"
"goes for the helicopter shot, misses by a long way. Once more, big inswinger. This was overpitched, not a yorker. But the movement is too much and he loses leg stump"
"And another. Munaf looks to clatter it on the up. But it's an inswinger, and he's never been good enough to hit that shot. It pitches on a length and takes leg stump"
"good length on off, straight. Blocked. Good start from Praveen"
"drifts on the pads, worked down to fine leg for a run. A little bit of swing, not much"
"short and wide outside off, some away swing. Carved to backward point"
"good length on middle and leg, worked away to midwicket with the direction of swing"
too straight again. Worked away to the right of short fine leg. Munaf Patel jogs a few metres towards the ball and let it go past. A better fielder may have made Dhawan work hard to complete a single
"well down leg again, wide called"
"126 kph, good length outside off, pushed away to mid-of for a single. A direct hit at the bowler's end, the third umpire is called for. Not sure why. Danny Morrison on air doesn't either."
"oh no, don't bowl there to Dhawan. Short and wide outside off, tripe. Dhawan slaps the ball in front of extra cover. Four more easy runs"
"four more. That's not a bad ball. Shortish outside off, Dhawan stands tall and just guides the ball behind point. It's a lightning outfield, the gap is found. Don't bother"
"four more. Rackin' 'em up. Back of a length on off, Dhawan flicks away through square leg, always wanted to go leg side. Whatever the length of that"
finds the fielder this time. Another terrific stroke. Stands tall and punches a lovely carve to backward point
"shortish and wide outside off, sliced to point"
"a short delivery on off, 132 kph, inside-edged into the pad, towards square leg for a single. Sunrisers well on their way"
"taken. Dhawan looking to go over midwicket, toe-ends the ball to mid-on. It was a good delivery, a slow offcutter outside off. Dhawan wants to drag a heave over midwicket but can only get the toe of the bat. Carries to Faulkner at mid-on, who dives to his front and takes a simple catch. Credit to Praveen for taking pace off"
"130 kph, good length and wide outside off, beats Warner's bat. He ain't happy that wasn't wided"
"another offcutter outside off, Warner watchfully punches a push towards point"
"on the pads, flicked to deep square leg"
"that's four extra runs. Full on the pads, henriques flicks to Smith at midwicket who labours towards the ball, lazily bends down and hardly gets a hand on it. Goes away for four. Awful fielding"
"Praveen's response is excellent. A good length delivery outside off, Henriques sees a slowish delivery coming at him and wants to hit that through the off side, but the ball moves away just a little. Just a little is all you need, especially at this level, to take the edge. Karthik completes the catch. Praveen has undone two batsmen with some wily bowling"
"good length outside off, pushed to cover, who has a completely unnecessary shy at the bowler's end. Raina fumbles the tough collection while backing up and concedes one"
"good length delivery on middle and leg, some swerve back in. Defended"
"fullish delivery around off, dabbed to third man"
"another slower ball outside off, this is great bowling. Defended to cover"

"a good length delivery outside off, hit back to the bowler. Impeccable lines"
"a slower ball a couple of stumps outside off, punched to mid-on"
"too straight this time, flicked to deep square leg"
"what batting. Just terrific. A low full toss on middle and leg, he knows if it's overpitched there is this option. So he drills a drive straight past mid-off with the fielder squarer than usual"
"a slower ball outside off, chopped away to extra cover"
"another slower one down leg, off the pad towards square leg"
"lovely hit. Coming down the pitch, gets a leg side delivery and flicks away through midwicket for a couple. Raina got a hand on that"
"120 kph, slower ball outside off, pushed to cover for a single. Good batting."
"fullish and wide outside off, played away to point. Oh, wait, it's four. Jadeja picks up and throws at the batsman's end. Kishan somehow totally misses that. It goes through him for another four extras. Shankar's bat was well inside the crease"
"<b>dropped.</b> Not an easy catch at all. Full and wide outside off. Karthik is closer than usual because of Faulkner's back-of-the-hand slower deliveries. But this is quick pace, a thick outside edge flies to his right, and he can only get a glove on that"
"fullish and wide, nicely driven wide of cover for a couple. The sweeper cover has to mop up"
"four more. In the air but in the gap too. In no control of that at all, a slower ball outside off. Warner's through his drive too early, it takes the leading edge and flies between third man and point. A little lucky there Warner"
"full outside off from Munaf, pushed away to the sweeper cover"
"full and straight, pushed towards Munaf's left who dives over the ball and concedes another single. Should have stopped that. That's four runs extra conceded by Munaf's fielding. Just not good in this format"
"on the pads, worked to square leg"
"good length on off, played to Jadeja at point. Warner is waiting for the call. It comes - 'no, no, no'. It's jadeja on the ball. Good call"
"fullish and straight, worked to deep square leg"
"good length outside off, slashed to the sweeper cover"
"flat outside off, pushed to long-on for a run. Nicely played, using the depth of the crease"

"another flat delivery outside off, played towards point"
"flat outside off, Warner gets across and works the ball to deep midwicket. It's in the gap and they get two"
"shovelled into the gap at midwicket again, but Smith prevents the second. Good fielding, attacked the ball"
"great batting. Back of a length outside off, Warner runs at Munaf and calmly guides the ball behind point for four. That's superb field manipulation."
"fullish delivery outside off, played away towards cover"
"picked his spot early but didn't quite execute. It was pace off the ball, a legcutter. So even though Shankar picked the length early, his swat resulted in a couple to deep square leg"
"shortish outside off, dabbed to third man"
"on a length down leg, worked to fine leg"
"that'll go for four. Full and wide from Munaf, Shankar gets down to his cut slightly late. It takes the toe end and races away to Karthik's right. No chance"
"short on the pad, worked to deep midwicket"
"flat outside off, nice length, nice trajectory. Pushed to long-on"
"that was a big edge. Huge moment in the match. Flat and wide outside off, <strong>Warner gets a thick outside edge</strong> on his cut? Karthik hardly appeals because it's so clear. Umpire Chaudhary says no, at least there was some confidence in his decision. But that's a huge moment. Yep, yep, yep, big edge, big spike on Snicko. Life."
"and that's filth. Warner earns himself that stroke by staying back, short and wide. Sliced behind point for four."
"nice, loop on off, worked to deep midwicket"
"the dangers of an inexperienced leggie. He'll bowl bad balls. This one is too short outside off, pulled through midwicket for four. Lovely batting"
"good length on off, pushed towards the sweeper cover"
"131 kph, good length on off, pushed away towards the bowler. To his right. Munaf dives and half-stops it, but can't prevent the single anway"
"full and wide outside off, carved away to backward point."
"a slower ball outside off, comes back in. Chopped towards the sweeper cover"
"a slower ball outside off, another legcutter. Pushed to long-on"
"full and straight, driven right back to the bowler. Tidy over from Munaf"
"short and wide outside off, 87 ks. Sliced to the sweeper cover"
"fullish on off, flicked to deep midwicket for a couple."
"well bowled but Warner is too good. A flat quick delivery on off, hammered through midwicket for four. Picked the length early and then his execution is spot on"
"a googly on leg, clipped to deep midwicket"
"lovely shot. 83 kph, overpitched from Soni outside off. Shankar gets underneath the length and lifts the ball over the bowler's head. Dead straight. Exceptional"
"another terrific area to hit the ball into. It's full, it's wide, it's spinning away. Shankar gets underneath the length and lifts his drive over cover. Sublime, thinking batting."
"good length on off, worked away towards square leg"
"full and wide, dabbed to third man. Good batting"
"full outside off, full face of the bat, driven to long-off for a run"
carved down to third man for another single
"superb placement. Back of a length outside off, lets the ball come onto him and then carves a cut between third man and point. Opened his bat face so early"
"pushed wide of long-on for a couple more, <strong>another IPL fifty</strong> for Davey W. Not his usual explosiveness, but he can bat any way now"
"flat on leg, worked to deep midwicket"
"flight outside off, clipped wide of long-on for a couple more. Making batting look easy"

"98 kph, fired in on middle and leg, worked to deep midwicket."
"on the pads, clipped to midiwcket"
"a short delivery on off, Shankar wants to pull but has to drag that pull through square leg. Takes the top edge and races down to the fine leg boundary"
"full outside off, moves away. Shankar misses a drive. Beaten on the outside edge"
"lovely shot. Full and wide outside off, Shankar's weight is on the back foot but he carves a slice over point for four"
"good length on off, the ball seams back in. Played back towards the bowler"
"on a length outside off, worked past midwicket for a couple. Only a matter of how quickly they want it now"
"no,maybe it's time. Flat outside off, Warner brings out the big guns. The switch hit. Just enough bat on that to get it fine enough for four to third man"
"fired in on middle, swatted to deep midwicket"
"flat and quick on off, pushed away to long-on for a fifty from Shankar. Quality innings under pressure"
"the dart, round-arm action. Flat and wide, carved to point"
"drops short outside off, Warner can't get adequately underneath that. His slap finds long-on"

"full on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
"a low full toss at 124 kph, driven to cover. Another dot"

"on the pads, flicked to deep square leg for a run"
"full on off, tailing back in. Driven to the sweeper cover for a run"
"wow. Saw midwicket was more towards square leg so put the ball where midwicket should have been. Flicked his wrists, dragged that stroke into the gap. Awesome"
"a low full toss on leg, worked to square leg for a couple. Nath dives to his left ans saves two, good stop"
"is that the first six of the innings? Is that the match? A short delivery outside off, Shankar pulls and finds the gap. The ball bounces a few inches in front of the boundary. Still no six"
"good finish. A yorker outside off, dug out towards the keeper"
"86 kph, lovely finish. Flight on middle, Warner gets underneath the length and lifts the ball right over the bowler for four. That means Sunrisers move to the next stage of the IPL, <b>they've qualified for the playoffs</b>. A fist-pump from Warner."
