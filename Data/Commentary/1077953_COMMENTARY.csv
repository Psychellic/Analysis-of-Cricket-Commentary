"pushed wider outside, left alone"
"tight at middle and off, defended to the covers...a comeback maiden"
"full outside off, driven to mid-off"

"back of a length outside off, jabbed towards cover"
a bouncer which zips over his head
"that's a ripper! Has he gloved it? Nope. Superbly-directed short ball at off stump, it follows Chase who only just manages to drop his hands and arch out of the line. That's what you saw at the Sabina Park of old"
works a short ball to the leg side
"round thew wicket, flicked into square leg"
"back over the wicket, and it's a lovely delicate shot as he opens the face and dabs it wide of slip, fine of backward point"

"round the wicket, outside leg, misses his flick and takes the pad"
"full outside off, driven in the air but it finds a gap through the off side and takes him to his half-century"
"in the air, over the in-field again! Chasing another full, wide ball. Wasn't close to the pitch, went through with the shot and it flew between cover and mid-off"
"sharp response! That was a rapid bouncer from round the wicket, registered at 133kph but seemed quicker, angles in at Dowrich who has to be quick to duck underneath"
"full and straight, nudged to the leg side"
driven off the back foot to cover
"short ball, cramps him for room as goes for the pull, but falls short of Yasir at deep square...bit of action in that over"
"this spins from outside leg, defended"
"that's a nice shot, picked the length early, was short, rocked back and whipped it through midwicket"
"oh my goodness, what a catch! I can barely believe this. They are just checking with the TV umpire. Soft signal is out. Chase got underneath a loft drive. It went very high, cleared mid-off who was inside the circle but Wahab turned, tracked the ball over his shoulder, then somehow manages to reach the ball with an out-stretched hand and, to top it off, is able to stop himself sliding into the boundary marker. You won't see anything better"
"two in two! And how the games changes. Round the wicket, spins from outside leg stump, but perhaps not as much as he expected, defeats the drive on the inside edge and castles him"
"round the wicket, full outside off, Bishoo whips it calmly through midwicket"
"over the wicket, touch short, defended to the leg side"
"full at the stumps, a neatly timed punch down the ground"

drops the bottom hand off the bat as he defends
"angled across, length ball but not close enough to off stump to make Holder play"
shortish on the hips and Holder nudges one through the leg side
"that's a beast from Wahab, kicks like a peevish mule from back of a length, Bishoo does well to drop his hands as he instinctively hops in the crease"
tossed up and pushed into the covers for one
"round the wicket to the southpaw, who presses forward to block"
"he's had enough of defending, has Bishoo... so he carts Yasir over deep midwicket for six! Flowing swing of the blade and it sails beyond the rope, right out of the screws"
"length ball, spinning in and turned down into the leg side"
"flicked to leg this time, in the air and there's a man out there... but the ball clears Babar Azam and then bounces over the rope for four! The fielder seemed to move in a few yards and then realise he'd misjudged it, otherwise Bishoo would have picked him out. Lucky"

"length ball, straightening on middle and leg, Holder stays back and punches one down the ground"
"tossed up, spinning in from round the wicket and whipped to short leg on the bounce"
"floated up nice and full, gets forward and pushes through mid-on for one more"
"smashed through the covers, Holder plants the front foot and hits inside out for a powerfully struck boundary"
"tossed up and Holder goes to the same part of the ground, lofted and this time with even better timing, it disappears over the rope at deep extra cover - more punishment for Yasir!"
dug in short and Bishoo seems to take a blow defending on the back foot
"snorting bouncer this time, too high, really, as the batsman flinches out of the way"
"round the wicket, 143kph and rearing at the top of Bishoo's noggin, he again manages to contort himself safely out of the way"
"hammers away back of a length and Bishoo prods at it tentatively, thick-edged but it lands short of backward point, goes through the hands and they pick up a single"

"tossed up on leg stump and Holder unfurls the reverse-sweep, collared through backward point and it races to the fence - that's the 50 stand between these two"
"flighted, reaches out to defend, comes off the outer half of the bat"
tossed up and prodded into the covers
"'megs!' That's gone through everyone, Holder stuck out a leg and it nutmegged him, beat Sarfraz and the dive of slip and ran away - but Richard Illingworth swiftly signalled dead ball (it brushed Holder's leg but he wasn't playing a shot)"
tossed up on the stumps and defended this time
worked into a gap in the leg side
"goes full and immediately the ball talks, shaping back in to rap Holder on the pads... probably swinging too much and they run the leg bye as the ball skitters away"
"pitched up wide of off, there's some curve on the ball as Bishoo thinks twice about following it"
"angled in and holding its line in the channel, left alone"
"yeesh, that's done the hokey-cokey, in and out at a good lick as Bishoo prods uncertainly and is beaten all ends up"
"pitched up in the corridor, left alone a little more confidently"
"sucked in and spat out again! Amir is curving this new ball like a scimitar already, Bishoo drawn forward and groping unsuccessfully"

"fuller, angling in on middle and leg and straightening, blocked cautiously into the off side"

"short ball, pushed across on middle and off, Holder arches back and drops his wrists"
"good length, pushed across on off, defended with bat close to pad into the off side"
"risky shot. Fullish length, outside off, Holder reaches out for it and pushes it out uppishly square of the wicket. Fortunately for him, there is nobody at backward point. But that was dangerous for more than one reason. Was wide outside off and had to reach out, so could have edged it as well"
"fuller, angled across, Bishoo shuffles across and lets it go in the channel outside off"
"full, outside off, pushed through point for a couple with an open bat face"

"full, outside off, carved to the left of sweeper cover with an open bat face"
"full, on the pads, Bishoo tries to glance it away but wears it on the pad as the ball goes to the keeper. Optimistic appeal from the bowler, that was never going to be given"
"full, on the pads, Bishoo pushes it into the on side, through the midwicket region"
"good length, pitching outside leg, Holder turns it away to deep backward square leg for one"
"back of a length and cutting back into him, gets an inside edge on to the pad as he sticks his bat out from the backfoot"
short of a length and angling in outside off. He tries to flay it through the off side with a half-angled bat but it was coming into him with the angle and cramped him for room. Gets beaten and the ball misses off-stump by not much
"fuller, coming into him, defended"
"chases a wide delivery, could have so easily edged there. Pitched right up and swings away sharply outside off. Holder reaches out a long way and the away movement saves him as the ball beats the outside edge. Sarfraz dives to his right to collect it"
and this one comes into him from a fullish length. Beats the forward push of Holder and raps him on the pad
"short of a length and nipping away, throws his hands at it with a half-angled bat and gets beaten"
"outside edge, gets past the diving second slip fielder. Good line from the bowler, around the fourth or fifth-stump channel, pitched up and swinging away, Holder pushes at it and the second slip fielder dives to his right but it gets well away from him"

"angling in on the pads, tucked off them through midwicket and Holder pushes back for the second to beat the throw"
"fullish, holding its line outside off, defended"
"is that an edge? Yes, it is. Amir fires it outside off and pitches it up. Swings away a little bit, not much. Bishoo swishes outside off, that's always an ill-advised shot to be playing, goes after it outside off without any feet and gets an edge to the wicketkeeper"
"fullish length, pushed across, takes a stride across to meet the pitch outside off and defend"
"fullish length, outside off, left alone"
"fuller, angling in on middle, pushed down the pitch"
"that's a great shot, brings up his fifty with a six down the ground. Full, just outside off, makes sure to give himself enough room by keeping the front leg out of the way, then just presents the full face of his bat as he lofts this over mid-off. Clean hit"
"good length, outside off, opens the face of his bat and gets it wide of the cordon for a four down to third man"
"short ball, outside off, left alone"

"bouncer, banged in on middle and leg and Holder ducks under"
"full, angling in to the batsman and misses the attempted clip and strikes him on the pad. Angle would have surely taken it down the leg side"
"fullish length, outside off, Joseph whips it powerfully to midwicket"
"the change in angle works. Fullish length, fires it from wide of the crease and angles it on. Gets it to swing in and burst through Joseph's blade. Amir gets down and performs a <i>sajda.</i> <b>First five-for for Amir since Lord's 2010</b>"

returns to getting forward and defending
"gets away with this! Nicely bowled by Bishoo, tossed this above the eyeline, Younis couldn't resist this time and tried to launch it down the ground. It skewed off a thickish outside edge, looped in the air on the off side, but landed between three fielders...two running back and one running in off the fence"

"floated up full on the stumps, defended again"
"slow and loopy on off, Younis stretches out languidly like the big cat he is and blocks"
"flighted a touch straighter and this time Younis untangles his limbs into a dextrous sweep through square for another single - that's his 50 (balls faced), too"
"ooh, nicely bowled, dipping and gripping and spitting past the bat as Babar gets lured forward. But on we go"
"pitched up and Younis creeps across, drives into the on side, mid-on has a shy at the non-striker's end but looked like he was in, regardless of hitting"
"Holder looking to bring the ball back in, slides on to the pads, though, easy pickings for Babar, who picks up his fourth four with a fine glance"
"shortish outside off, defended to the off side"
"pitched up outside off, driven on the front foot but mid-off gets across"

"Holder goes full outside off, draws Younis into a flowing drive... but there's not much timing and it bobbles to mid-off without troubling the scorers"
"well bowled, well played - short and rising as Younis goes back, it takes the edge but the hands had plenty of give and it lands short of gully"
"Holder drops in the bouncer now, ducked"
"fuller, Younis pounces on the drive again, this time Holder stops it in his follow through"
"draws his length back a touch, Younis pushes and gets an inside edge square on the leg side and they hustle through as the throw comes in"

lets go a full toss but Younis mistimes a drive and gets nothing for it
"tossed up and punched into the covers, again picks out a fielder"
"flighted, the legbreak straightens on off stump, Younis is forward to quell it"
"length around off stump, Babar comes across and blocks"
"touch full and straight and Babar clips neatly through midwicket, they come back for a comfortable two"
"full in the channel, maybe a hint of reverse swing back in but Babar lets it go"

"full and this time Babar is tempted into driving, doesn't get hold of it and mid-on cleans up"
whips a low full toss towards midwicket but again finds the fielder
"tosses the ball up on middle and off, comes forward to block"
this is landed a little further across outside off but the response from Younis is the same
"runs for Younis - plural! THIS IS NOT A DRILL! Skips out and takes the ball on the full, clipped wide of mid-on and Gabriel lumbers after it, using a boot to prevent four out by the rope"
"tossed up outside off, Babar goes down to attempt a ramp, or flick... and ends up being hit on the helmet. An unusual way to get sconed"
"flighted, steps out and drives towards cover"

"pitched up slightly leg side, a couple more for the Younis kitty as he glances fine... Getting there"
"goes full, better line and Younis straight-bats it back to the bowler"
Gabriel again slings the ball down the leg side and Younis edges closer with a nudge off the pads
"now goes short, chin music for Babar - he's not listening"
"another bouncer, this veers away down the leg side as the batsman ducks again"
"spicy bumper, that's a really awkward length, coming back at Babar but he#s able to drop the hands watch it through. Shouts of encouragement around the ground at the sight of that"
floated up and defended on off stump
"tossed up full and straight, this time Younis is down to sweep another single through square"
drops back and shovels a single into the leg side
"here he comes, lofted down the ground, is Younis going to reach 10K with a six...?! No, bounces just short, but onyl a couple away now"
"flighted, spinning away on off stump, waits in the crease to defend"
"pushed through a touch quicker and worked off the pads, fielded at square leg as they think better of running"
shortish and worked away into the leg side for a single to bring Younis back on strike
"slams the ball in halfway down, the bumper flies through above the ducking Younis"
"another bouncer, this one gets up well above shoulder height, Younis is hunkering down... Kettleborough signals two for the over"
"back of a length, there's some boing on this but Younis rides it and defends - but Gabriel had overstepped"
"scattergun from Gabriel, fired down the leg side and it hurtles away beyond the vain dive of Shane Dowrich for byes. Meanwhile, Younis is still stuck on 9998"
Gabriel slips another errant delivery down the leg side
pitched up in the corridor and this time Younis presses forward to block. The wait goes on
"pushed through outside off stump, Babar defends to the off side"
"filthy ball, dragged down and Babar has plenty of time to go back and slap four through backward point"

floated up on off stump and smothered on the front foot

"slightly straight, Babar leans into a front-foot block"
tossed up and Babar defends on off stump once again
"pushed through, a touch short and Babar whips it off his hip, square leg prevents a single... and that will be <b>tea</b>, with Younis a run shy of the much-discussed landmark!"
"comes forward, takes a ball from outside off into midwicket"
"there it is! Gets 10,000 with a sweep, a shot that has brought him so many of those runs, rolls his wrists, sends it wide of a diving short fine leg...he's quite emotional. Takes his helmet off, salutes the dressing room, punches the badge on his shirt"
"shorter, rocks back and knocks into the leg side"
"short outside off, waits for it and back-cuts down to third man to take Babar to his fifty...a very compact innings"

"short outside off, he rocks back and cuts firmly down to third man, was in the air for a while but very safe"
takes a stride down the pitch and drives from outside off to long on
"this time Babar cuts, wasn't quite so short, a little risky as he could drag it on but finds point"
prodded back to the bowler

"straighter, around off stump, taken into the leg side with a closed face"

pushed back to the bowler

pads this one away
driven off the back foot through the covers
"short, into the pads, flicked through square leg"
a gentle tap into square leg...very much in milking mode at the moment
perhaps keeps a fraction low but Babar had played very deep in his crease
whipped from around off stump to deep midwicket
"and there's his fifty, with another nudge through square...gets to acknowledge his team-mates again. Slightly calmer this time"
"still round the wicket, full at the stumps, driven to mid-off and West Indies are being run ragged now"
"this spins quite a lot from outside leg, doesn't get his gloves out of the way but the ball drops down and lodges in his pad flap"
defended to leg
"pushes this across onto middle and off, Babar leans forward"
"bat in front of pad, blocked"

"full outside off, keeps his bat in front of his pad...very confident in defence"

"short outside off, driven to cover"
"plays off the back foot, takes a thickish inside edge to the leg side"
"fuller, he comes forward and drives to mid-on"
"breakthrough! Return of pace has done it. Full outside off, Younis goes for the drive and the catch is taken low down at cover. A punchy shot, came from low down the bat, couldn't keep it down"
"in the channel outside off, left alone"
Babar gets forward to defend
"flighted, dritfing towards middle and leg stump, leans out and pushes into a gap"
"Misbah, magnificently bearded, gets across to defend his first ball from Bishoo"
"tossed up nice and slow, blocked on the front foot"
"slightly short, Misbah goes back and chops into the covers"
"was that the Bishoo googly? Not often spotted, this was floated full outside off and Misbah got out to dead-bat it"
"played on, West Indies have another! Gabriel takes his second wicket in three balls and it's another big one, with Babar set and perhaps beginning to think about a maiden Test hundred. Excellent pace late in the day and it came in at the batsman, took the inside edge and then cannoned into the stumps via Babar's thigh pad"
"pitched up, attacking the stumps again, Shafiq is equal to it"
"slightly wider, 143kph and tailing back in, Shafiq plants the front foot and leaves"
"Gabriel hangs the ball out in the channel, not quite threatening enough to make the batsman play"
"banged in hard, 139kph and rising to hit the bat label as Shafiq defends towards point"
fires down the bouncer but Gabriel is well over the front line here... A good three-four inches. Striving a bit too hard
"length ball, wide of the stumps and shaping back but again Shafiq judges it well and shoulders arms, completing a testing over that has helped bring West Indies back into the contest"
"full on off, Misbah gets a big stride in to defend"
"shortens his length and gets some lift, seam movement, hits the outside edge and flies to point on the bounce"

"pitched up, diligent line from Holder, again the old maestro is forward to cover it in defence"
"now Holder oversteps, Misbah steering the ball stoically to backward point"
"fullish on off, more solid blocking"
"yowzer, that's a decent ball to a new batsman, angled in and nipping away as Misbah hung back, breezes menacingly past the outside edge"
"Gabriel trundles through in the corridor outside off, Shafiq continues to leave"
closer to the off stump and this time the batsman is across to block
"line and length in the channel, Gabriel straining every sinew to get it through as quickly as he can... another leave"
"taken at slip! But it was on the bounce... Pace up at 141kph outside off, Shafiq essays a drive, gets it off the toe end and the ball skids to first slip"
fired in full and straight and he drops the bat on it in defence
"good length, 142kph in the channel, not coming back enough to make Shafiq play"
"good length around fourth stump, Misbah bows monkishly over the front pad"
"zipping through a foot outside off, left alone"
"Holder plugs away in the channel, fairly gentle, end-of-day pace, Misbah leaves again"

"pitched up and driven, Misbah stroking the ball wide of mid-off and he likes the look of it, calls his partner through and makes his ground as the throw comes in"
"touch short, around off stump, tapped down into the off side"
"nice shape on this ball, curving it away as Misbah comes across and is beaten"
"good length, 133kph outside off, deliberately plays inside the line this time"
"length outside off, Misbah steps out to defend... and for some reason Joseph appeals for lbw. And then, even more bizarrely, West Indies decide to <b>review</b>! That clearly came off the inside edge into the front pad, and it was miles outside off, too; might have hit a second set! So that's a review wasted, although they get them topped up in a few overs' time"
Misbah shuffles across and stabs a single through point
"length ball around off stump, solidly defended on the front foot"
"bit of extra bounce, 131kph and steered towards gully from the crease"
"ooh, nicely bowled, Holder spears a yorker towards the bootstraps and Misbah only <i>just</i> manages to get his bat down in time"
"close again, deflected into the front pad via the inside edge! Holder probing away, Misbah not quite seeing it big yet"
"touch straighter, flicked off the pads through backward square for one"
Shafiq comes across and defends a length ball
"pitched up, fourth-stump line, pushed into the covers coming forwards"
"good length, slightly too wide of the stumps and Shafiq gives it a steely glare through to the keeper"
"Joseph attacks the stumps, again Misbah doesn't quite judge the line but picks up one off the inside edge"
"in the channel outside, left alone by Shafiq"
"good length, aiming for the top of off stump, defended with a straight bat into the covers"
"cry of effort from Joseph, 137kph in the channel, maybe cutting his fingers over it a touch but the ball didn't come back enough to make Shafiq play"
"shorter length, holding its line through to the keeper as the batsman shoulders arms"
"plugging away on off stump, blocked coming across - Shafiq is still on zero but doesn't seem too fussed about it"
"slightly leg side, Misbah misses with a flick but the ball runs wide of Dowrich off the pad"
"short of a length, stays back and stabs defensively down into the leg side"
"length on off, this time he's forward and stuns the ball back down the track"
"full, 132kph and tailing in, Shafiq drives and it trickles off the inside half of the bat towards midwicket"
"touch shorter, no-ball signalled as Holder overstepped, tucked down into the leg side and Shafiq wants his first run, Misbah is on his knees sliding for the crease but he makes it as Hetmyer's throw from side on misses the target"
back of a length on the stumps and blocked into a gap on the leg side
"banged in short, not the quickest bouncer but Shafiq is crouched and out of the way"
Misbah shuffles across his stumps and defends square on the off side
"decent line from Joseph, angling in on off, Misbah watches it closely and defends"
lets this one fly through wide of the stumps
"length outside off, 132kph and shaping away from Misbah as he gets forward and leaves"
"slightly shorter length, holding its line and squirting off the outer half of the bat to point"
"fired in straighter now, Misbah nearly overbalance playing across his pads"
"short and down the leg side, Shafiq flicks across the line but doesn't get as much of it as he would like, presenting a glimmer of a chance for a leg-side catch to Dowrich... but the ball doesn't quite carry and he can't get down to it one-handed, the ball hurrying away for four to bring up the Pakistan 200"
moves across his stumps and tucks the ball away defensively
"short ball, rising towards the ribs, defended to leg"
Shafiq hops across on off stump and blocks
"slightly back of a length, defended... and Holder has overstepped again"
"angling in, length ball on middle stump, worked short into the leg side"
"finishes with a brisk bouncer, outside off stump, Shafiq is down in his bunker"
"rolls his fingers over the ball, defended on off stump"
"short and leg side, Misbah had gone across and pushed at a leg glance, it came off something and Dowrich held on to an excellent diving catch to his left... Was there some glove? Joseph didn't bother to appeal but Holder decides he might as well gamble with a <b>review</b>. Now we'll see, and replays show pretty clearly it was thigh pad, so Richard Illingworth's not-out decision stands"
"slings down a low full toss to begin with, Misbah chops it a little tentatively to midwicket"
"length ball, gentle pace at 129kph, wide of the stumps and left alone"
"slightly shorter, tailing in but not enough to make Misbah play"
"pitched up towards the blockhole, not quite yorker length and it's dug out safely towards mid-on"
"goes a touch full on off, Shafiq comes across to defend"
"back of a length ball, hitting the splice as Shafiq draws himself up to block"
"full, slightly wide, seams in a fraction as Shafiq goes to drive and the bat turns in his hands"
"length ball, starting wide and shaping away, left alone as the batsman steps on to the front foot"
"similar line, this one ducking back in a touch, Shafiq lets it go again"
"fourth-stump line, defended coming forwards"
"starts off full and a touch wide, 143kph and Misbah reaches for a push drive with an open face, skips to backward point on the bounce"
"full length, in the channel, not much swing as yet and Misbah defends"
"goes a touch wide and spears the ball in, slightly overpitched and Misbah times a half-volley back down the ground, Joseph gives chase and uses his boot to stop it just short of the rope"
"pitched up, good pace, 143kph but dead-batted coming forwards"
"fired in full, slightly scrambled seam, Shafiq jabs down on it"
"runs, a first boundary of the morning, Shafiq opens the face and uses Gabriel's extra clicks to guide the ball wide of gully to the fence"
"length ball a foot outside off, good carry through as Misbah ignores it"
"angled in on off stump, solidly blocked back wide of the bowler, into a gap for one"
"extra bounce off a length, Shafiq is across to cover it"
"tight lines from Joseph, not much in the way of lateral movement so far, defended again"
"shortish, 138kph and blocked once more in front of off stump"
"short of a length, slightly leg side and it skitters away off the pads as Shafiq flicks at it, four leg byes to fine leg"
"ooh, nearly a chance, Gabriel getting the ball to straighten on Misbah as he reaches out to defend and it hits the shoulder of the bat and loops into a vacant area square oft he wicket, they're able to take a single, too"
Gabriel goes a little too straight and Shafiq glances him for one more
"full and straight but it's another half-volley for the Eternal Misbah, who calmly clips a couple more through midwicket"
"dug in short, had the potential to get frisky but Misbah rides it and taps down square to the on side"
"hammers the bouncer, 141kph but it sails over the ducking Misbah"
"short of a length again, at the body and Misbah turns to try and jab to leg, comes off the hip wide of Dowrich... Actually, there was a little glove on it, so runs to the batsman"
"aiming for the top of off stump, shows it the maker's name again"
"lovely stroke, not greatly overptiched by Joseph but Shafiq is well forward and he just caresses it back past the bowler, fine of mid-off and racing away"
"scrambles the seam, this bounces a little more but Shafiq remains watchful in defence"
"pushed down the leg side, Dowrich does well to snag it diving to his left"
"fullish, 131kph in the channel, solidly blocked into the covers"
"pitched full, gets him reaching for the drive, thick outside edge from Shafiq... but it evades the dive of second slip and flies away for four! He couldn't quite fingertips on it but it looked like half a chance"
"dug in, quick and bouncing up on off stump, blocked"
"now the bouncer from Gabriel, Pakistan's captain is not interested"
"<b>dropped!</b> Dug in, feisty delivery, gets Misbah hopping and it comes of the glove and body before looping towards short leg, where Vishaul Singh gets down but <b>can't hold on!</b> It looked like he had it in his grasp diving forwards but the ball squirmed free as he landed"
"pitched up this time, smothered crabbing across on off stump"
"short of a length outside off, dropped down square on the off side for one - and Gabriel had overstepped, too"

"goes full, slightly outside off, gets forward to defend softly into the covers"
"pitched up in the channel and Shafiq plays it late, the ball bouncing towards the cordon from his block"
"length ball, comes across and blocks securely"
"fullish, tailing in and worked towards midwicket"
"gets him coming forward again, pushed along the ground to mid-off"
"touch shorter length, Shafiq drops it down into the off side but they think twice about running"
"this is too full, presents a juicy driving opportunity and Shafiq doesn't turn it down, not quite timed well enough to reach the cover boundary but they pick up three more"
"Gabriel lands the ball full in the channel, pushed into a gap coming forwards"
"goes short, Gabriel is going to pepper Misbah now, 141kph and he takes on the pull, gets it away to fine leg for one - brings up the fifty stand between these two"
"slams the ball in halfway down, well-directed bouncer but Shafiq is down early out of the way"
"back of a length, 142kph and rising in the channel, dabbed down square on the off side"
"full of a length, met with a thrillingly orthodox forward defensive"
"got him, quick and bouncy and takes the outside edge! Third wicket for Gabriel, he's chiseled out Shafiq... Probably could have left the ball but it was fired into the pitch, rising like steam outside off, singed the edge and Dowrich took it high to his right"
"gets a little too straight, worked off the body for one to fine leg"
"ah, there's a familiar sight, Sarfraz immediately stepping down the pitch, ends up bunting a length ball away"
"tight line on off stump, stays back and defends this time"
"nearly a mix up, turned off the pads to midwicket and Sarfraz seemed interested only to send Misbah back, the captain had to hastily get his bat back in... but the throw was off target anyway"
Sarfraz shuffles across and works the ball to leg again
"short and wide and sliced up and over the slips for four! Sarfraz isn't one to miss out on an opportunity to score, he flashed and flashed hard, and away the ball flew"
"back of a length, tucked down to the leg side"
"back of a length, straightens a touch as Misbah flicks across the line and gets a leading edge into the off side"

"pitched full in the channel, Sarfaz taking no risks this time, pushes back towards mid-off"
"touch short and over middle and leg stump, blocked to the on side"
"slanted in with the arm, tapped back towards mid-on"
"ooh, Sarfraz gets the hurry up, seaming back in as he hung back and played very late, but safely down into the leg side"
"length ball in the channel, met with a stiff punch to extra cover"
comes across to block on off
"line and length from Joseph, doing a good job of keeping things tight, Sarfraz defends again"

"fuller on off, shuffles into line and prods back to the bowler"
"length ball, on the stumps and turned to leg"
"flicked to fine leg, Sarfraz wasn't so keen for a second run but was finally persuaded by his captain, had to hurry as the throw came in to the non-striker's end"
"short of a length outside off, tapped towards point"
"Joseph continues to probe away around off stump, Sarfraz defends"
"fullish, sliding in with the arm, covers the line and pushes towards mid-on"
"Sarfraz sets off early and Joseph drags his length back, swished off the hips down to fine leg for one"
blocked in front of the stumps
"short ball, in the channel outside off, Misbah drops his hands out of the way"
moves across his stumps and flicks into a gap for a couple
"Sarfraz is well down the pitch once again, punching the ball wide of mid-off and setting off for the single straight away"
"digs in the bouncer, ducked by Misbah"
"length ball, sliding on to the pads, clipped for a single behind square on the leg side"
"short of a length, Sarfraz swivels to pull through midwicket, not perfectly timed but they pick up three"

"full at the stumps, driven wide of cover down to long-off"
"drifts outside leg stump, pushed off the pads to midwicket"
"a shorter delivery, he plays back and drives through point to the sweeper"
"that's dragged down short and he doesn't miss out, pulls it in the air over midwicket. A bit of a freebie"
"and this one is short outside off again, he's quickly on it and cuts behind point leaving the sweeper some ground to make up. Sarfraz bringing urgency"
"better delivery, full at off stump, he lunges forward and it takes a thick inside edge to the leg side"
"full at off stump, defended to the covers"
played back towards the bowler
"a bouncer, angles back at Misbah but no threat"
"that's a good one! Angling in towards the batsman, then moves away to beat the outside edge with Misbah committed to his shot"
"fuller, he presses forward, plays to cover"
"this one squirts off a thick inside as he comes forward, scoots to long leg"
big step forward and defends
"nearly! Lovely delivery. Pitches around leg, spins enough to take the edge but it dies in front of slip"
thrusts forward and blocks
"very full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"shorter outside off, he holds back on the shot and late cuts behind point"
all the way! Things are rarely quiet with Sarfraz in the middle. This time he goes on his back and slog-sweeps a full delivery well over deep midwicket
"gets caught on the crease, angling in towards the stumps, he jabs the bat down"
"full at off stump, defended in his crouched manner"
"defended on the front foot, travels to short leg along the ground"

"back of a length at off stump, defended"
fuller and driven to mid-on
plops the front foot forward and defends to cover
"well bowled, again...another outside edge which doesn't carry to slip. This actually took the glove, I think"
"almost gets in a tangle! He uses his feet, gets nowhere near the ball and ends up with a mixture of trying to kick it and play it"
"shorter, cut to point"
"plays back, tucks through midwicket"
"that's sweetly struck, brings his hands quickly through a cut shot but finds point"
"a boundary, he's hit a boundary! Gets a big full toss and flicks it through square leg. Almost took out short leg in the process"
"back on a length, defended to cover"
"angled into the pads, worked down to long leg"
works this off pads to midwicket
"full and straight, pushed to mid-on off the front foot"
a bouncer which doesn't get up very far and Sarfraz has to really bend his knees to avoid it
"nearly gets through...playing back to a ball that was pretty full, has to drop the bat down quickly"
"tries to go down the ground...and gets away with it! Gets right underneath this, hoists it a long way in the air, slices across the ball, loops over mid-off, Joseph, who can't back-track and get near it"
driven along the ground to long-off
defended to the covers
"floated up full at the stumps, he carefully stretches forward"
opens the face and pushes into the covers
"short of a length at off stump, defended on his toes"

"short outside off, stays in his crease and cuts to point"
"full at the stumps, defended"
"full and straight, punched firmly to mid-on"
"wide on the crease, angled in at off stump, played to the covers"
defended down the pitch
"pitches on leg stump, brings a stifled appeal for lbw as he traps it between bat and pad"
"that's a louder appeal...and looked straighter! And Holder has called the <B>review</b>. Kettleborough pondered for a while before saying not out. Pitches on the stumps, but has it turned too much? Misbah's pad came further forward after the impact. Yes, missing off stump with the turn. Reviewing 101: never question the Kettleborough"
defends a full ball to the leg side
pushes towards cover
"shorter, on the back foot, pushed to the covers"
"full and straight, sweetly struck to mid-on"
"flicks this fine down the leg side, moving well across his crease and down the pitch then sends this flying wide of the keeper"
"back outside off stump, pushes forward to cover"
"lovely shot...full and wide outside off, Sarfraz stays (relatively) still this time and drives square through the off side. Scores are level"
"better delivery, banged in short of a length, Sarfraz knocks it a little awkwardly to the leg side...but he's overstepped with the effort"
"there's the bouncer, 83mph, very short and angled over leg stump"
"back of a length, tucked through midwicket"
"very delicate, this a lovely innings so far, it's wide outside off, he waits then back cuts wide of slip"
"tossed up fuller, driven to cover"
"wider outside off, full again, driven off the front foot wide of the sweeper"
pushed square into the off side
full and blocked
pushed to the covers
"short outside off, driven at the top of the bounce to the point sweeper"
"full outside off, left alone"
"full at the stumps, a walking defensive shot back to the bowler"
"aims to work this round the corner, deflects off the thigh pad to long leg"
"low full toss, driven towards mid-off where there's a misfield so it gifts them a couple"
driven to mid-off without much timing
plays back and eases it wide of mid-on
cut to backward point
driven neatly to mid-off
"full on middle and leg, straightens a touch, blocked"
"short outside off, played from the back foot to the sweeper"
"drags a slog-sweep along the ground through midwicket, lack of timing actually helps him get back for a second"
"back of a length, shapes in a touch, pushed to the covers"
"angled into leg stump, Misbah misses his flick and gets taken on the thigh guard"
"fuller, on the pads, neatly flicked through the leg side but the ball refuses to run to the rope, stopping dead in the outfield about a meter short"
"full at off stump, a solid thud of a drive finds mid-off"
defended back to the bowler
"short outside off, back cut through point to the sweeper"
"driven to the covers, can't steal a single"
"touch shorter, spins and is played to the off side"
"fuller, driven along the ground to cover"
finds a gap out to the cover sweeper
"short outside off stump, sits up with the bounce, played with a straight bat to deep point"
"spins from the stumps, angled into the off side so he keeps the strike"
"over the wicket, loopy full toss which is swung through square leg and the brace takes him to a terrific half-century. Has given the innings some life"
"<B>missed stumping</b> by the looks of it. Yes, this squeezes between bat and pad as he looks to work the leg side, the back leg drags out but Dowrich can't gather it"
pushed to the off side
"uses his feet, makes this into another full toss which is flicked through midwicket. Nicely timed but it's just flicked back. And that's Sarfraz's 2000 Test runs. More applause from the balcony"
props forward and pushes to cover
finishes the session with a six! Of course he does. Only Misbah would play for lunch this way. It's a floated up full ball and Misbah dismissively heaves it over deep midwicket. You gotta love him
"round the wicket, floated up outside leg stump, Sarfraz clips it square of midwicket and they trot one"
"over the wicket, loops a legbreak on off stump, leans out and defends"
"tossed up, straightening on the stumps, Misbah goes back this time and nudges to leg"
"gives it some air, met with a steady block coming forwards"
"pushes through on off, stands up in the crease to defend"
"rolls his wrist over again, dipping towards off stump, Misbah taps it away stoically"

"similar touch, 134kph and a touch fuller, pushed towards mid-on"
"pitched up and tailing in towards off stump, Sarfraz blocks out the over - Joseph's seventh maiden"
"floated up around the line of off, smothered coming forwards"
"just a little straighter and Misbah decides this is the line to sweep, reaches to paddle the ball but finds backward square leg"
"tossed up outside off, Misbah pushes this one through mid-off for a single"
"oh, bowled him, behind the legs! Sarfraz was looking to sweep, might have actually played on... Bishoo celebrates his first wicket, he certainly got some turn, looks as if Sarfraz didn't get his hands quite low enough and played over the ball, off stump ended up out of the ground. No century for him today, but still a tidy knock"
""
"tossed up from round the wicket, this is straighter and tapped down to the leg side"
"waits on a length ball on off and nurdles into the leg side - there's the Misbah milestone, 5000 runs in Tests. Not quite the ovation that Younis got but still a polite round of applause from those at the ground"
"round the wicket to Amir, who doesn't get very far across but prods the ball away"
stays back and steers the ball towards point
"shortish, in the channel, Amir comes across and covers the line"
"back of a length, in the channel, gets him playing but tapped down safely enough"
"fuller, Amir is on the front foot and pushes through cover point to get off the mark"
tossed up outside off and Amir again gets forward and taps a single in front of point
"stays round the wicket, Misbah blocks"
"tossed up on leg stump, leans into another stolid defensive"
"gives it some air, dipping outside leg stump, tucked away square for one that gives Misbah his half-century - a raise of the bat, that's his first in Tests since the WI series in the UAE last year"
dragged down slightly and Amir opens his shoulders to slap a couple away through point
"slows it up, defended coming forwards"
"back of a length outside off, Misbah steers the ball towards point"
short outside off and this one is swatted a little more firmly through backward point for a single
"<b>dropped!</b> Joseph is round the wicket, dug in short, Amir slices a cut to gully... but Shai Hope <b>shells it!</b> He was diving to his left but should have been taken"
"goes over the wicket, blocked on the back foot"
"fires in a bouncer now, well-directed but Amir is quickly down and out of the way"
"length ball, angled across and pushed into the covers half forward"
"floated up outside leg stump, Misbah nurdles a couple more through midwicket"
"length ball, spinning in from outside leg, tapped away"
"flighted, stays back to this one and works it off his pads for a single"
"looped up outside off, Amir is down on one knee... and clobbered over deep midwicket for six! Fetch"
floated up and this is prodded into a gap on the off side
Misbah dead-bats to see out the over
Amir has a bit woolly woof at a length ball outside off and fails to connect
"chases the ball in the channel, nicked off - Joseph gets his man! It was short and wide enough to leave but Amir wanted to feel bat on ball and perishes via a thick edge into the keeper's gloves"
"poor ball from Joseph, short and well outside off stump, Wahab sets himself and cracks four through backward point with a dismissive swing of the bat"
"back of a length, tighter line, 130kph and left alone"
"digs in the bouncer, climbing high through to the keeper above the nodding Wahab"
"slightly short, 140kph outside off, left alone"
"Bishoo continues bowling round the wicket into the rough outside leg stump, Misbah defends"
tossed up on leg and blocked
"gives it some air, punched back to the bowler along the ground"
"drifting a little straighter, tapped through mid-off coming forwards and they take one"
"back over the wicket, nicely bowled, this, floating in on the breeze and then ripping past the bat as Wahab reaches for it"
pushed through quicker outside off and Wahab prods it square
Joseph gets a little too straight and Misbah continues to quietly accumulate with a nudge off his pads
"fullish length to start with to Wahab, who steps across and tucks the ball to mid-on"
"pitched up on middle and off, driven into the ground and again it trickles to mid-on"
"drops short, 130kph but sailing harmlessly overhead"
"length ball, aiming for the top of off stump, punched on the up to mid-on. Wahab is certainly grooving that shot"
"Wahab goes the other way and this time it pays off... full in the channel but it's floaty from Joseph, 139kph and drilled back past the bowler, beats mid-off and scuttles away to the rope, bringing up the Pakistan 350 in the process"
"tossed up on the stumps, Misbah pushes another single into the off side, happy to give Wahab the strike"
"over the wicket, flighted and spinning away as Wahab drives, gets a thick, low edge past backward point"
"round the wicket, tossed up and tapped short into the leg side"
"loops the legbreak on middle and leg, defended coming forwards"
"drops a little short, played off the back foot towards backward square leg"
"quicker, on leg stump and taken on the full, plopped wide of mid-on for a single"
Misbah gets across his crease to defend
"short of a length, on the body and flipped away through square leg to the sweeper for one"
"comes back, cuts him in half, past the inside edge with Wahab stuck on the crease, Dowrich has to leap to his left to stop it getting away for byes"
"bowled 'im, that's a beauty! Joseph has another, bringing the ball back in once again, slides through his defence like a hot knife, it's the perfect length to flick the leg bail and send Wahab on his way"
"short ball, again whirring back at the right-hander, Yasir hops around and fends it away square to get off strike"
"fired in full, Misbah opens his shoulders to give it some humpty, gets a thick inside edge to square leg"
"pitched up and drive without footwork, mid-on dives on it"
hammers the ball in short and Yasir jumps back to tuck it off his hips
"yowch, strikes him on the armguard, not a convincing approach from Yasir... Gabriel went short but the ball stayed low, forcing Yasir to thrust his arm at it while yanking his head away"
"that's a ripper, too, Yasir is shuffling forward and into the bouncer, he hops and jerks and manages to get out of the way as the flies through to Dowrich"
Yasir stays back and manages to shovel one through the leg side to get off strike
"banged in very short, 140kph and slightly leg side as Misbah ducks it... That'll keep Yasir on strike for the next over"
"full and straight, flicked to mid-on"
"back of a length, defended on the bounce to short leg"
hops into line and works it to short leg again
"rises over off stump, he drops his gloves and lets it go through"
"wide on the crease, good length outside off, guided one bounce to gully"
"full outside off, this bobbles on the second bounce to the keeper...variable bounce could play a part in this match"
"appeal for caught behind! They call for the <b>review</b> after Kettleborough says not out. Nips away on a full length, nice delivery. Bat hits the pad Misbah plays forward, seems clear daylight as ball passes the bat"
goes for a big shot...is this a sign? Heaves across the line of a full delivery and gets an inside edge into the pads
"hint of inswing, clipped off the stumps through midwicket and he turns down the run"
"<b>dropped</b>, but a tough one! Slips it down the leg side, Misbah gets a tickle on it and the ball goes underneath the glove of the diving Dowrich...did it carry? Maybe just. Got his glove to it"
flicks a full delivery to midwicket
"gets across the crease, shovels into the leg side but picks out midwicket"
"poor delivery, a freebie on the pads and it gets flick to long leg so back to Misbah"
gets under the bat with a yorker outside off that Misbah plays over the top of
"full, wide outside off, he reaches for it, the bottom hand comes off the bat and it dribbles into midwicket...this time he runs"
"back of a length, angling in from wide on the crease, jumps behind the line and defends"
"gets will forward, solidly behind the line, a very correct defensive shot"
an elegant flick from outside off to mid-on
"shapes into the pads, nudged through midwicket and now he doesn't run...not quite a consistent tactic from Misbah so far"
"props forward to a full delivery outside off, ball stops by his feet"
"edged, taken at slip but the fielder immediately indicates he's unsure if it's carried. It goes upstairs and the soft signal is not out. Misbah fencing away from his body at a back-of-a-length delivery, thick outside and not sure Powell has his fingers under it. Certainly some grass involved. This can't be given out given the initial uncertainty"
"full, wide, left alone"
chops a length ball into the pitch and it bounces to gully
"that's a solid thump...full and straight, Misbah swings through the line and clubs it wide of mid-on. He won't have the strike, but has the boundary"
"a bouncer, angled down the leg side"
"full, driven to mid-on"
"full outside off, he comes into the front foot and squeezes his drive behind point"
"slanted down the leg side, flies wide of the diving keeper...comes off the hip, and some glove as well"
worked into the leg side
"ducks into a short ball! Turns away from the delivery, it didn't really get up, and gets smashes in the chest guard"
"full outside off, defended to backward point"
"on a length outside off, 143kph, so still decent pace from Gabriel, left alone"
defends on the front foot to cover
"full at off stump, Misbah is turned square on as he defends"
"full, speared down the leg side, this time Dowrich makes a good dive across to gather"
"full outside off, left alone...not attempt to get the strike this time"
"direct hit does the job! Substitute fielder Blackwood from cover. Yasir came forward, pushed the ball into the off side, set off for the run, Misbah wasn't moving. Yasir was halfway down. Blackwood set himself, took aim and hit the base of the stumps. Good work"
digs out a very full delivery to midwicket
"full at the stumps, solidly behind the line, so decent technique in that defensive shot"
"a short ball, he goes underneath it"
"across onto off stump, bat and pad tightly together, defended to mid-off"
"touch shorter, very comfortably behind the line...looks better than someone who averages 7 in first-class cricket"
"a nicely timed flick through midwicket, in fact that's brilliantly timed, takes a full ball off the stumps and splits the two men in the deep"
"good length outside off, pushed back to the bowler"
"works off his pads through square leg, takes on the man in the deep and makes the second but a better throw would have been different"
"a sharp bouncer, 141kph, Dowrich needs a little hop to take it"
"another short ball, not quite the same venom, slanted down the leg side"
"more poor fielding, Misbah flicked this strongly off his toes but Hetmyer should have done better at midwicket. Handy over, 10 off it"
"full, at the toes, worked down to long leg so he's off the mark and off strike...slack from West Indies"
defends a length ball
defended
"full and straight, blocked"
"a bouncer over off stump, quite loopy"
"he's overstepped, and Misbah has stolen a single to mid-on so Abbas has a ball to survive...lead reaches 100"
"full, defended to cover"
"round the wicket, full outside leg stump, defended"
very wide down the leg side...called wide
"there he goes! Shuffles outside leg stump then launches a mighty slog-sweep that goes almost over long-on...straighter than he planned, but same impact"
"was preparing for a repeat, but then defends this ball which spins"
"very full, outside off, he drives and gets an edge wide of slip"
"over the wicket, full, blocked"
a juicy full toss which he drives to the left of mid-off but the run isn't taken
"full outside off, driven to mid-off"
tapped to the covers
"full and straight, Misbah plays across his front pad to midwicket"
"tucks a length ball into the on side, wide of midwicket"
"comes round the wicket, full and straight, very solidly defended back to the bowler...straight bat"
"a small appeal for caught behind, but this clips the pad through to the keeper as it beats Abbas on the angle from round the wicket"
"full outside leg, nudged away"
pushed back to the bowler
full at leg stump
"moves outside leg stump, Bishoo follows him and Misbah just taps the ball"
"clears long-off! He's into the 90s. For a moment didn't look as though he'd connected cleanly with this, but it was a good strike. Stayed in the crease, swung through the line of a full delivery"
and now he sweeps to deep square to retain the strike...high-class stuff
"full, straight, driven down the ground and he doesn't run"
works a straight ball to midwicket
"short of a length outside off, opens the face through point and takes the run on offer"
"round the wicket, on leg stump, defended into midwicket"
"a short ball, angled across, Abbas just manages to pull his bat and gloves out of the line"
"full, pushed across outside off, well watched and left alone"
"sharp spin! From outside leg stump, across the face of the bat. Yasir will like the look of that"
"leans forward, defends"
nudged to the leg side
"full at the stumps, eased down the ground to long-off"
"plays back, defends"
"think he tried to leave this legspinner, the ball rolls off the face but into the ground towards the slip"
"touch short outside off, driven from the back foot to deep cover"
"plays back, pushed the bowler"
"fuller, wide outside off, he presses forward"
"shorter, flatter ball, he goes down and sweeps even though the ball got quite big on him"
worked off the stumps into square leg and this time he trots through
"round the wicket, full, he gets well forward and defends confidently...he's doing an excellent job. Applause from the dressing room"
"brings out the reverse sweep from well outside leg, but deep point is out there"
"a shortish legspinner, he plays back and defends"
"same again, back and defends"
"spins across outside off, pushed through the covers"
"moves all around the wicket, then ends up back where he started and defends...one ball left in the over"
"there it is...not it isn't! Thought he'd done it. Moved around the crease again, then cut a short ball through the off side. Might have been three there, but he decided against it. Oh, the tension!"
"back and across on off stump, defends. Breathe"
"touch short, allows him to rock back and blocks"
"very solid, waits for it to spin, defends down by his feet on the back foot"
"he's given lbw! He calls for the <b>review</b> straightaway, or rather Misbah does! Turns and beats the bat. He's playing back. Taken on the back leg. Illingworth the umpire. Has he hit it? No Snicko or Hot Spot in this series. Clipping the top of leg stump. Out by a tiny margin"
"over the wicket, length around middle and off, turned back towards mid-on and a misfield gets Kraigg Brathwaite off a pair"
"puts it on a length in the channel, holding its line, Powell leaves"
"angled in, fourth-fifth stump line, again he judges it well and offers no stroke"
"shaping away from the left-hander in the channel, maybe a touch short and left alone"
"pushed in, closer to off stump at 140kph and Powell blocks"
"slightly back of a length, again Powell moves into line and defends"
"pitched up outside off stump and Brathwaite is looking proactive early on, leans into a punchy drive for four through the covers"
"length ball, drifts on to the pads, worked away for one"
"stays over the wicket, still getting warmed up pace-wise, Powell defends"
"<b>dropped!</b> Abbas in his follow through... Chance for another early wicket slips through Abbas' fingers (literally), this time from the fourth ball of his opening spell. Powell chipped back to the bowler's left and he got one hand to it, but it deflected to earth"
"insult to injury, on the pads and whipped powerfully away through square leg for Powell's first runs"
"short ball, down the leg side and Powell gets out of the way"
"angled across, <b>takes the outside edge</b> but lands short of slip! Younis couldn't quite get his hands under it and Brathwaite picks up a run"
lets this one go in the channel outside off
"length ball, closer to the stumps, Powell pushes back down the track"
"touch short, in the channel and driven to mid-off standing tall in the crease"
"fuller length, not a great deal of swing so far, as the lacquer wears off, pushed to mid-off again"
"gets this one to straighten, hits the leading edge and squirts away through backward point, just out of reach! Powell living dangerously"
"length, on the body, Powell plays it into his thigh pad and the ball balloons up but lands short of Abbas this time"
"fuller, angled across outside off, this is punched with more authority through cover for one"
"length ball, 130kph and holding its line on middle and off, Brathwaite gets a touch squared up defending to mid-on"
"slung down wide of the stumps, short of a length and slapped off the back foot, Shehzad leaps to his left and prevents any damage"
"good length in the channel, this stays very low as Brathwaite leaves alone"
comes across and pushes into the off side
"Amir sends the ball down a foot outside off, 137kph and holding its line, no stroke"
"pitched up but still a touch wide of off stump, curling away as Powell gets forward and shoulders arms"
"banged in short, more height than trousers on this bouncer, Powell ignores it"
"fullish, tempts him forward outside off this time, steered square along the carpet"
"too wide once again, there's some swing for Amir but it won't trouble Powell there"
"full and shaping away at 136kph, once again Powell is on to the front foot and leaves"
short and wide from Abbas and he's skelped through point for a couple more on the cut
"ooh, close... Pitched on the perfect neither-nor length and Brathwaite's footwork is accordingly befuddled, he ends up poking at it as the ball curves away past the outside edge"
fired in straighter and this is blocked into the leg side
"good length on off, 128kph and prodded away defensively"
"woosh, gets Brathwaite fiddling again! This was shorter, probably could have left it on that basis but he was sucked into feeling away from his body and again the ball beats the bat before thudding into the gloves"
hits a length on off stump and this time he gets in behind to block
"angled in with the arm, on the stumps and blocked to the leg side"
"pitched up, nice shape but slightly too wide to draw a stroke from Powell once again"
"full, 134kph, gets him driving... mistimed towards mid-off"
"good length in the channel, holding its line, nothing doing from the batsman"

jumps across and defends around the line of off
"drops short again, Brathwaite has one leg off the ground as he swats flamboyantly through cover point, well stopped just short of the rope by the diving Shehzad"

comes across and defends on off stump

"pitched up, in the slot to cover drive but again he finds a fielder"
"Amir is getting it a bit fuller now, there's a hint of movement as Powell drives, sending the ball to mid-on - who then hits the stumps with a needless throw, although it doesn't cost anything. That's a better line of attack for Amir, at least"
"pitched up around off stump, pushed back down the track"
"full, 128kph in the channel, punched into the covers coming forwards"
"probing away around off stump, the new ball isn't doing too much in the evening sunshine, blocked"

angled in a touch too straight and he's clipped through midwicket for one with a turn of the wrists
"wicket-to-wicket attack from Abbas, taken coming forwards and steered to point with an open face"
"he can! Brathwaite bowled, strikes first ball! Pakistan are cock-a-hoop at that intervention, right on the money from the off and the ball skids on, the batsman playing back but beaten for pace and off stump takes it right in the mush, flattened... How about that for an introduction?!"

"short ball, 130kph and only rising to hip height as Powell goes across and glances to fine leg"

"short outside off, Hetmyer stays back and pushes the ball square"
"slightly fuller, blocked into the off side"
"pitched up in the channel, Hetmyer makes a positive move forward and clips a drive to mid-off"
this slips out a bit too full and Hetmyer whips the full toss to deep backward square leg
"short ball, 136kph outside off, Powell rolls his wrists on a flick through square leg for one more"
"hammers the middle of the pitch, 138kph and tucked into the leg side, they hustle through as mid-on runs in"

"shorter, outside off, he plays off the back foot to cover"
"good little contest, Yasir targeting the rough, Hetmyer defending solidly"
"length ball outside off, he throws his hands through a square drive which bounces wide of diving cover point"

"a bouncer, over off stump, ducked"
"back of a length, angling into leg stump, tucked off the pads to long leg"
"short ball, outside off, and he was in no control whatsoever...goes for the pull, comes off the top edge and flies over the keeper"
"loud shout for lbw, full, he plays across it a touch but that appeared to be shading down leg side. Well, wow! Was hitting leg stump for three reds. Would have been out on review"

"loses his line again, on the pads and this time Powell gets a good chunk of bat on it and it races away fine"
presses well forward and defends to the man under the helmet
"well, he's not messing around with that! Tossed up in the footmarks and Hetmyer picks it up and disdainfully swings it over wide long-on. Tasty"
"what a response! Big spin from the rough, rags into Hetmyer who is playing back, he plays the ball down into his leg and it ricochets into the stumps. Massive turn, and a touch of bad fortune for the batsman"
"skids on, pushed into the leg side"
"full, outside off, left alone and that zips through...a bounce in Yasir's step"
"very full, this is driven with some power towards short cover"
"short of a length outside off, defended"
worked off the stumps through square leg...he wouldn't want to miss that
"pushed across, full outside off, Hope not tempted into a drive"
pushed to the off side
"he went fishing here, was full and quite wide, drawn into having a push...he pulls the bat away, but he'd already been beaten"
"hmmm, interesting, this one starts to come back into the left hander...encouraging shape"
"full, at the stumps, pushed to mid-off"
"this is nicely driven, to the left of mid-off, who then dives over it so has to give chase...Yasir perhaps a touch full to Hope?"
"that's delightful! Tossed up wide outside off, tempting Powell, and he responds with outstanding footwork then drives along the ground wide of mid-off"
"wide, not quite so full, Powell stretches a long way forward to defend. Absorbing stuff"

"on the stumps, defended to cover"
"comes round the wicket, outside off, left alone"
"drags the length back, Hope plays at this one with an open face"
"fuller, brings the drive this time, finds the gap through the covers but doesn't quite have the legs for a boundary"
"straighter, for a moment Amir is excited as Hope brings his bat down but it safely hits the middle"
"a little too straight, he can flick it away with the spin through the leg side"
"he's got another! A quicker delivery, skids into the front pad as Hope tries to get forward. He's called for the <B>review</b> but Richard Illingworth's decision looks a good one. Pitched around middle, just straightens a little. Pad first. Crashing into middle. Poor review, really"
"spin and bounce from the footmarks, he does well to keep this down"
defended down by his feet
played into the covers
"whipped off his body, away from leg slip, backward square leg tidies up"
"good length outside off, defended to point"

flicked into midwicket
thrusts the bat in front of pad to defend
worked round the corner to short fine leg
"that's four! What a session he's had. Another one wide in the footmarks, not so full this time though, and it doesn't turn as much, Powell presses forward and this time it takes the outside edge to slip. Lovely bowling."
"he's ducked into a short ball that doesn't get up, strikes him on the back. Sarfraz asks for the lbw!"
"angled onto the hip, he tickles it away and it flies between the keeper and leg gully...not millions miles from either"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"nearly finds the edge this time, delivered from wider on the crease, angling in and makes Bishoo play away from his body"

"short of good length, outside off, punched off the backfoot through covers"
"fullish length, in the corridor of uncertainty and holding its line, Bishoo reaches out for it without feet and gets beaten"
"and again, fires it outside off, Bishoo does not make an effort to get close to it, sticks his bat out and the ball beats the outside edge. A bit of seam movement away from the left-hander on that occasion"
"slightly closer than the other two deliveries, on a length and just outside off, Bishoo pokes from the crease and the ball just about straightens slightly to beat the edge"

"back of a length, outside off, there is all the room he needs to open up his arms and punch it off the backfoot through the right of point"

"slightly short, not much turn back in from around the stumps, defended off the backfoot"
waits for the late deviation from outside off as he steers it to the off side

"angles a full ball in wide of the crease, left alone"
shapes to drive but the ball tails back in late to roll back to the bowler off a thick inside edge
"back from over the wicket and angles a length ball across Chase, who watches it through to the keeper"
"just a touch ahead of length on off, Chase lets it go. Superb angle this. So far he's taken them away."
"appeal for lbw as he's hit on the pad while stabbing outside the line. Got an inside-edge. Even otherwise, he wouldn't have been out as the angle would've taken it across"
"full and straight on middle, flicked to midwicket"
"slow turn back into off, defended off the backfoot towards point"
gets to the pitch of the ball and works it down towards mid-on to complete a quick single
too full but he can't put that away. Squeezed back to the bowler
"sees the flight, gets down on one knee and biffs this over mid-on. Couldn't resist temptation, hit it well. Clean"
"worked back with the spin to the bowler. Yasir fires a throw head-high to the batsman, who takes evasive action. Frustration"

"didn't get to the pitch but went though with the drive, hit well but straight to extra cover"
squeezes the drive to the man at the edge of the ring at cover
"snuffed out at second slip. This is a nothing delivery, and the change of angle seems to have brought out a poor shot. Short of length outside off, no deviation whatsoever, he looks to slash but is late on the shot, the thick edge flies to Younis, who shows age hasn't dimmed his reflexes there. This is a fairly simple chance which he gleefully accepts."
"draws him forward by floating this up on off, defended to the off side with an angled bat"
got the first ball to move away and then slanted this back in full from wide of the crease. Dowrich looks to flick when he should've looked to play with a straight bat. Missed it altogether. Hawkeye confirms the ball would've hit middle and leg.

"touch short, but this one spins across a long way from off stump, Holder gets across and defends. Initially looked to wrist this to midwicket"
"too full and walloped. Gets to the pitch of the ball and lofts it over the bowler's head, one bounce into the boundary"

lunges forward and deadbats a full delivery drifting in to middle
worked with the angle to midwicket
"sharp turn but the length is too short, worked across the line to mid-on"
"punchy stroke off the backfoot to split cover and mid-off. Too short, uses the depth of the crease to generate the power. Cover fielder got a bad bounce"

"good length, around the fourth-stump channel, defended off the front foot into the off side"
"was that deliberate? Just short of a length, outside off, Holder sticks his bat out and gets it away past the second slip fielder off the outside part of the bat. Seems like it has nipped away from him, finding the outside part of his bat"

"comes forward to meet the pitch of this one, which is outside leg, turns a mile and goes off the outside edge, does not carry to Younis at slip"

"drifting down the leg side as he tries to angle it in, misses the attempted tuck of Holder"
"fired from wide of the crease, fullish and well outside off, left alone"
"loose shot from Holder. Pays the price. Wahab persists with the outside off channel. Fires it very wide, asking Holder to chase it. He does just that and goes after it without any feet. Gets an outside edge for his troubles and Sarfraz does the rest behind the stumps, gets down to his right to snaffle it. Loss of concentration from the batsman, perhaps"

"back of a length, on off, shuffles across and blocks into the off side"
"fullish length, angling in, defended to mid-off"
"that's five for Yasir. Flights it up and gets a little bit of drift into the batsman. Joseph gets across, playing for the turn perhaps. it does turn but from around leg stump channel and he cannot get his bat in front in time. Gets rapped on the pad and it seemed pretty plumb. Umpire Illingworth needs little time to give that one"
"pitched up on middle, defended with bat close to pad"
waits for this length ball to spin before defending off the front foot to the left of the bowler
"and that is it. The last wicket has been gifted away, a typical tailender's shot from Gabriel. Gets down for a big slog sweep, gets a huge top edge and skies it towards mid-off where Mohammad Abbas snaffles it. <b>Six wickets for Yasir</b>"

"fullish, angling in on off, defended"
left alone but that is very close. Angled in from wide outside off and the ball cuts back in late to go over off-stump

goes onto the backfoot and punches a shortish delivery to cover
gets a leg-bye off the deflection. Looks to fetch the sweep from outside off but this spins away to deflect off the pad to short third man

"flicked uppishly, but just short of midwicket."
"tossed up gently outside off, he gets forward and blocks"
"drifts this full ball on middle from wide of the crease, Younis looks to nurdle this to the leg side but the bat comes down at an angle as he prods outside the line. He's hit almost full on the pad. Would've most definitely gone on to hit the stumps. Looked like he got into a tangle while trying to defend. The bottom of the bat may have just got stuck into the pitch as he tried to turn that away. Hawkeye confirms it pitched on leg and would've hit leg."
"drifts in again but the length is a also a touch shorter, Misbah lunges forward and blocks"
"sees the flight, brings out the big broad shoulders, gets to the pitch of the ball and muscles it back over the bowler's head. Glorious"
"swung across to the leg side to complete the formalities! No time wasted. Consecutive sixes to finish this off. Tossed up again, Misbah down on one knee as he fetches the slog sweep from outside off. Handshakes all around. <b> Pakistan up 1-0 in the three-match series </b>"
