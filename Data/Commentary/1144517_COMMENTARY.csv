"<strong>caught at second slip!</strong> What a start! It was a 137kph back of a length ball on leg stump, not that short, Dimuth looked like he didn't see it out of the hand!

"137kph, back of a length, he stands tall and punches off the back foot to cover"
"139kph, fuller on middle, he drives firmly on the front foot to mid on"
"<strong>this cuts him in half and swings after passing the stumps!</strong> What a delivery. He tried to drive at a length ball on the up, it nipped in past the inside edge, past off stump and swung late beating de Kock. He didn't have much chance"
"back of a length outside off, he punches off the back foot into the gap at cover point"
"139kph, full on off, he pushes a drive wide of mid off and calls early and decisively"

"129kph, shorter into the hip, he gloves it down behind square and they take an easy one"

"128kph, short of a length on leg, he tries to pull, he's taken on the thigh pad, it rolls behind point for a leg bye"
angled down leg and he flicks this <strong>fine!</strong> The man in the deep is very square. That was a bad ball and he just helped it fine
"<strong>an appeal for LBW</strong> but it's not out. No review. He was hit high on the back thigh, squared up trying work to the leg side. Way too high"

"<strong>magnificently picked up and flicked over midwicket!</strong> 130kph, half volley on leg stump and Avishka helps himself with elegance and class. Lovely stroke."
"<strong>he holes out to mid off! What have you done Avishka?</strong> A length ball on off, he tried to loft this over mid on. It wasn't quite full enough, he miscued skying it high to mid off, Faf du Plessis was backing back from the circle and took the catch well. That was a gift from the Fernando. Needless shot in the circumstance"
"129kph, good length wide of off, he's happy to leave this alone"
"124kph head high short ball, he's shuffling forward but controls a pull forward of square to the sweeper"
"<strong>a waft and miss.</strong> Strange shot. This was good length but well wide, his feet were anchored and he just flailed the bat at it"

"good length outside off, he defends on the front foot"
"he pushes this on the front foot to midwicket and tries to pinch one, it's tight but they just get through"
"<b>uppish!</b> But short of van der Dussen in the covers. Again, Pretorius has just got the ball to stop in the track, and Kusal pushed too early at it with hard hands"
"fuller, straighter, and this is worked just wide of mid on for a quick single"
"there's a hint of excitement as Mathews works across his front pad, but he's got bat to ball"

"Rabada pushes this one a little wider outside off, and it's nudged carefully into the covers"
"short and rising on middle and leg, but it's pulled with some control down to fine leg"
Mathews is half forward to poke a length ball defensively to cover
"just a little too straight, and Mathews finds room on the leg side with a little flick, taking a single to keep the strike"
"<b>just short of Amla at slip!</b> Morris immediately hits a probing length, headed for the top of off, and a flat-footed push brings a thick edge. But the ball dips and dies in front of Amla"
"pushed too far down the leg side, and that's one for the extras column"
"that's better from Morris. Line and length, and Mathews is content defending"
"once again Morris hits that inbetween length, Mathews working it too leg with no great movement either forward or back"
"Mathews looks for space at midwicket for a quick single, but his shot is tapped to close to the fielder"
hopping defence from Mathews as Morris pulls his length back a little
"a tidy return from Morris, Mathews pushing his last ball into the covers"
"Rabada keeps it in the channel, but it's just wide enough outside off for Mendis to leave well alone"
"seaming in at 141km/h, and leaping at him off a splice-jarring length. The proverbial 'heavy ball'"

"flicked to leg, but again he can't beat the field"

"chopped down wide of third man, who scoots around to cut it off as they sprint through for two"

"this time the dab to third man comes off, and they amble through for one more"

"legbreak, floated up wide outside off. Mathews leans into it, but pulls his bat inside the line as it spins past him"
tapped defensively into the leg side
"another googly from Tahir, but it's read and worked to leg"
"another leggie to end the over, and it's left alone outside off"
"Mathews breaks the shackles! he shimmies down the track at a length delivery to put it in the slot, lifting it cleanly up and over mid on for his first boundary of the day"
"on a length, straight, and he offers solid defence"
"worked into the leg side, but not into space. Dot ball"
midwicket's got a little more work to do as Mathews flicks another straight one towards him
"<b>but he's gone now!</b> Using his feet worked for Mathews at the start of the over, but when he tries to do so again, he plays on and is bowled. Did Morris see him coming? He definitely pulled the length back a little shorter with this one, and Mathews was much too early on the pull as the ball stopped on him. Bat meets ball in the wrong place, and a thick bottom edge flies straight into the stumps"
"on a length and shaping gently in to Dhananjaya, who defends from the crease"
"full, straight, nudged back at him"
"pulled down too short by Tahir, and Mendis hops quickly on to the back foot to pull. No major damage done though, there's protection in the deep"

"Morris sticks to the plan, and Dhananjaya is happy to see the over out defensively"
"leggie from Tahir, and it's held back a touch with some flight"
Mendis lunges well forward to thread a single through the cover field
"and Dhananjaya follows suit, driving through the gap and out to Phehlukwayo at deep cover"
"dabbed down virtually off the stumps, but straight to slip (on the bounce)"
"flicked into the leg side, but not past the fielder"
"a diving midwicket fielder stops any thoughts of a quick single, and Tahir ends a tight over, having found some rhythm"
"on the drive, and it's a handsome shot but straight to mid off"
a backfoot punch finds cover
"another forcing stroke, but again he finds cover"
"just short of a length, and it's defended off the back foot"
"worked into the leg side, another dot"
"full length from Pretorius, but there's no timing on the drive and he completes a maiden"
"flicked off the toes, straight to short midwicket"
"Mendis waits and waits, then dabs, but can't beat the field"
"sliding straight on with the arm, it's picked and nudged down behind square on the leg side to turn the strike over"
"floated up very full indeed, but he read the flight well and digs it out down the ground, past a diving Tahir"
"width offered, a legbreak landing outside off, and Phehlukwayo has some work to do on the cover boundary"
"punched down to long on, one more"
"they're also both safe hands in the field! Pretorius offers just a hint of width outside off and Mendis tries to get after him, but  he's too early into the shot and spoons a catch towards extra cover, where Morris tumbles forward to hold a sharp, low catch. Sri Lanka's innings continues to meander, and South Africa are really putting the squeeze on"
"angled across Jeevan, who raises his arms to leave"
"<b>beaten on the drive!</b> Pretorius angles a full one across him, and Jeevan can't lay bat on his drive"
"more length, pushed across him, and this time he raises his arms high to leave"
"straighter, and Jeevan shows us his forward defensive to keep it out"
"Jeevan sets himself to work into the leg side, but it's not straight enough and the shot goes nowhere"
"floated up, on middle and off, and he's forward to defend"
"eased down to long on, an ambled single the result"
"Jeevan lunges forward and chips it a little uppishly, but safely into space through mid on for one"
"pushed to midwicket, where the fielder pulls off an easy start"
pressed out through cover for a single
Jeevan is well forward to defend this into the leg side

"Pretorius shoots one across his bows, Jeevan shouldering arms to let it through"
"Test match stuff here, from both sides. On a length, pushed across him, and Jeevan is having none of it, leaving well alone"
"yet another leave, Pretorius really stringing the dots together"
"and another one. Floated up outside off, and Jeevan pulls his bat well away from the ball to let it pass"
"whoops, this one slips out as a low full toss that's spanked back at him, Tahir bending low but letting it through his legs"
"<b>leading edge, but safe!</b> He closed the bat face much too early on a legbreak, popping the ball into the air, but fortunately for him there's no one at mid off"
a forward lunge and a defensive bat keeps this one out
"a hint of width, and it's tapped down towards gully"
"floated up outside off, and he's driven out to the sweeper"
"<b>first boundary for 59 deliveries!</b> And it's a handsome one. Dhananjaya gets right to the pitch of a flighted legbreak, sending the ball racing to the cover boundary with a flowing drive"
"pushed across Jeevan, who once again leaves it alone"
"a little too straight this time, and he's nudged off the hip for one"
"straight again with the right-hander on strike now, and he's clipped through square leg for a couple"
"nicely bowled, full and straight, prompting a defensive push towards mid on"
"punched just straight of mid on, and there's enough room for a quick single"
yet another leave from Jeevan as Pretorius sticks to his line outside off
"tossed up wrong un, he sweeps across the line from off stump forward of square"

"140kph, good length in the channel, he presses forward and defends"
"short ball into the ribs, he sits back and heaves a pull along the ground to fine leg"

"122kph, slower ball, short of a length, he's up on his toes pushing this to cover-point"
"<strong>Bowled him! Oh no! A premeditated reverse sweep and he misses it!</strong> Duminy coming around the wicket. It was tossed up on leg, he set up so early, hadn't even had a look at one delivery, tried to reverse sweep it behind point and missed it completely. It crashed into middle and leg."
"tossed up, 78kph, he drives neatly down to long off"
"looped up on leg, he pushes down towards long on but midwicket cuts it off"
"tossed up, on off, he drives back to the bowler"
90kph arm ball <strong>nearly sneaks through!</strong> He went back and jammed it between bat and pad

"back of a length on leg, he clips this off his pad through square leg to the sweeper"
"back of a length, wide of off, he tries to pull but mistimes it to mid on"
"133kph, short and wide, he cuts and it gets through Duminy at backward point to wide third man"

"very full almost yorker length, he digs this out back to the bowler"
"shorter length, he's back and punching to cover"
"drifting in and going on, he's back and needs to get the bat down to get a thick inside edge to fine leg. He wants two but is wisely sent back"
"<strong>lofted over mid on!</strong> Just got enough of it. He skipped down with intent, he lifts this over mid on in the circle and just got enough of it and runs away!"

"a bouncer, too high, and it's called wide"
"125kph, back of a length on off, he defends on the back foot to point"
"<strong>caught at fine leg!</strong> Morris gets his man. He looks upstairs again, gets this short ball higher, he tries to pull again but goes from low to high and skies it towards fine leg, Pretorius runs in and holds the catch securely."

Perera miscues a pull into the deep, Rabada misread it initially thinking he hit it better than he did. It dropped sharply. The big man run forward and plucked it just above the turf"

"<strong>lobbed to mid off and du Plessis hangs onto this!</strong> A length ball on off, he backed away and miscues this trying to go over mid off. Du Plessis backs back and takes this one easily"
"there's some shape straight away from Malinga, in to the left hander, but it starts wide and so is easily dabbed down to third man for a single"
"gentle shape away from the bat again, but Amla lets this one go past him and just has a look. Not a great deal of lift out of the track, and it dies on the way through to the keeper"
"slung down straighter this time, and Amla props half forward to defend"
"<b>timing and grace</b> from Amla, who is off the mark with a picturesque cover drive that sends the ball bouncing through the covers. It keeps the fielders interested, but there's enough on it to take it all the way"
"<b>four more!</b> And a bit more oomph in this one as Malinga strays in to Amla's pads and is dismissively flicked to the midwicket boundary. Grace on the off side, power to leg"
"<b>immediate riposte</b> from the bowler, who gets his line right this time and snakes an outswinger past Amla's outside edge"
solid forward defence to start with
"slightly wider of off, watchfully tapped in that direction"
"straighter this time, and without much turn de Kock defends into the leg side"
"de Kock looks for a glance to fine leg, but it's not straight enough for the shot"
"driven uppishly, but into space on the off side, and he gets off strike with a single"
"there's a hint of leading edge in this stroke from Amla, who set himself to flick to leg but ended up tapping this back to the bowler"
"<b>punched down the ground</b>, straight as an arrow. This was too full from Malinga, and too straight. But de Kock still had some work to do timing his shot on this track, and does so perfectly"
a glide down to third man turns the strike over
"<b>past the outside edge</b> as Amla pokes, somewhat flat-footed, at one that leaves him through the air and off the deck"
"slung through fuller and wider outside off. So wide, in fact, that it's called by the umpire"
"in the channel outside off, and Amla lets this one go"
"but it's no use if you bowl there. Having just moved a fielder out of the midwicket position, Malinga dishes up a leg-stump half volley that Amla gleefully thumps through the empty leg side field for four"
"Malinga pulls his length back and adjusts his line, Amla shouldering arms"
de Kock is forward to defend a full one into the leg side
"Dhananjaya comes around the stumps, de Kock defends to cover"
<b>eased through the covers</b> by de Kock as Dhananjaya floats one up a little too full and is met with a classical cover drive
"here's the danger that the offspinner brings! Dhananjaya pulls his length back a shade, and instead of turning this one rushes on with the arm to take the inside half of de Kock's defensive press"
"<b>how has he cut this?</b> There's virtually no width to work with, so de Kock makes his own, chopping a cut off the stumps and very fine down to third man"
and a quiet defensive push to end the over
"Amla leans into a front foot cut, but bottom edges the shot straight into the ground"
"on a length, just outside off, and Amla gets back and across to defend to point"
"Mali aims full, but it's not full enough and Amla whips another leg-stump half volley out to deep midwicket"
"de Kock stands up tall to pull a short one well in front of square on this slow track, but his shot finds a tumbling midwicket fielder and is stopped"
"<b>yorker!</b> Malinga is devastating when he gets it right, and he does so with this swerving, dipping toe-crusher. De Kock does well to keep his foot out of the way, but his bat can't come down quickly enough and the timber is disturbed. An early wicket for Sri Lanka!"
"very full once again, but not quite the yorker and definitely not straight enough, landing well wide of off. Faf digs out a drive to cover"
"slipping down the leg side, and they pinch a run off the pad"
Lakmak finds a bit of nip off the seam to square Faf up in defence
"<b>athletic stop from Avishka!</b> Faf sent the ball bouncing in his direction at cover with a firm back foot thump, but Avishka tumbled to his right to stop what would otherwise have been a certain four"
"fuller this time, and he's forward to push it back to the bowler"
Faf is forward to push this in to the covers
"whipped into the leg side, Faf getting a solid connection with that big backlift, and they push hard to get back for a second"
"Amla is nicely in to line as Malinga hits a length on off stump, but his push finds mid on"
"attempted bumper from Malinga, but it sits up and is pulled out to long leg with a roll of the wrists"
chopped down to third man for a single
"another yorker, and it's a slower one at just 117km/h, but Amla picks it and digs it out to point"
"<b>beaten on the drive!</b> Every so often, Malinga has found some shape away from the bat - especially when the ball is full, as this one is. Amla chases it with a drive, but he's beaten by the swing"
"Amla steps forward and angles his defensive push to guide a length delivery to point, covering a hint of movement away from him"
"his first ball lands full, outside off, and Faf drives him to cover"
"just short of a good length, outside off, and Faf dabs it down to gully"
"this is a difficult track to really find your timing on, and Faf's attempted drive goes nowhere, his bat making a hollow, woody sound"
"dabbed down behind square on the off side, but not into space"
"glanced off the straight and into the leg side, but a sharp dive from Jeevan at midwicket saves runs. Sri Lanka are up for this, and they're looking smart in the field"
"firmly driven back to the bowler, who palms the ball back onto the stumps. But Amla's bat is grounded behind the line"
"slightly slower through the air at 120km/h, but drifting in to the pads and helped further in that direction by Amla's glance"
"dug in short, but misdirected down the leg side"
"pushed through fuller and wider of the off stump, Amla raising his hands to let it pass"
"Amla is up on his tippy toes to guide a length delivery down behind point, third man sprinting around to keep them to one"
"Faf dabs a slower cutter down towards gully and wanders out, asking about a single, but he's sent back by Amla. And rightly so"
"a very fine glide down to third man very nearly brings four, but the fielder down there puts in a dive to haul it back in just inside the boundary. Good work"
"there's still a little outswing for Malinga, and the full-ish length is also a testing one. Faf is tested, but his forward defence holds firm"
"cracked out through the gap between point and cover, and they hustle for a second"
"Thisara offers width, but Amla won't be tempted, leaving it alone"
"<b>dispatched this time!</b> Again Thisara offered width, but this wasn't quite as short so Amla could very easily get on top of it to send a thundering drive out to cover point. Hit on the up, and very well"
nudged down behind square on the off side to turn the strike over
"Thisara finds some purchase with a cutter that nips in to Faf, but it's well covered and defended towards point"
"<b>aggression!</b> Du Plessis presses the issue by getting down the track at Perera. A neat little two-step gets him right to the pitch, and a slashing square drive brings runs. It was in the air, but right in the gap, and <b>raises South Africa's fifty</b>"
"Lakmal searches for some outswing, but this one doesn't deviate and the ball slips in towards Amla's pads to be flicked neatly through midwicket"
"rising off a length, just outside off, and Amla hops to get on top of it and guide to gully"
"Amla's on the drive, but he finds mid off"
"Lakmal floats one up full outside off, but Amla doesn't like the look of this one and leaves it alone"
"yet more width offered, and this time Amla does have a go. The ball comes off the toe-end and flies through point, the cover sweeper getting around to cut it off"
"placed through the gap at cover, off the back foot, and a Amla keeps the strike with a single"
"this one shapes in to Amla, taking the inside half of a defensive push and rolling into the leg side"
"<b>up and over mid off</b> by Amla, who holds the pose, expecting the ball to travel easily to the boundary. But it lands and plugs in the boundary, coming to a complete stop, so they have to run them. Amla does so with a smile on his face"
"full, wide and Amla finds a single with a thrashing drive out to the sweeper"
"and now Faf is on the drive. Another good-looking shot, but it's straight to that cover sweeper"
"<b>keeping a little low?</b> This definitely didn't get up too much off the pitch, but Amla is right behind it and defends easily enough in the end"
"a forward press with an angled blade sends the ball bouncing towards point, who stops it cleanly"
"Lakmal aims for the top of off, but he'll have no joy if Faf keeps his defence this watertight. Bat and pad right together. Beautiful stuff"
"<b>inside out over cover!</b> He can defend them alright, but he can also give the ball a good thump. Faf spots another full one with a hint of width on it, deliberately lifting the ball over the infield"
"Faf skips out again to get to the pitch, but this time his drive goes to the (newly positioned) cover sweeper"
"drifting in towards the pads, and Amla can't take full toll but finds a single behind square"
"Lakmal zones in on the stumps, Faf unfurls that forward defensive again. No getting past that"
quick single! Faf tapped it towards mid off and just set off. A direct hit might have been interesting
"accurate start from him, but Faf's forward lunge gets him close enough to smother it"
"nice and full again, but too wide, and Faf drives out through cover"
"pushed down the leg side, no turn so that's one for the extras column"
eased past the bowler for a single
"another legbreak, but it doesn't turn much and comes off the inside half of Faf's defensive poke"
solid defence once again from the South African captain
and a defensive push into the leg side ends the over
"Amla steps cleanly into a glide behind square, the ball bouncing through the fielder's hands to allow a single"
"<b>beaten on the outside edge!</b> Faf walks down at the bowler, but Lakmal finds some swing to beat his outside edge"
"full, on off stump, and Faf gets to it with bat and pad right together to defend to cover"
"bumper from Lakmal, and it finds Faf in an awkward position. Ball hits bat and drops to the ground in the crease, but Amla is alert to the chance for a quick single and calls him through before anyone can get to it"
"<b>superlative timing</b>, Amla rocking back and bringing his bat down on a ball that was headed through wide of off. He places it in the gap between point and third man, and though the third man fielder gets to it with a dive, he can't stop the boundary"
"short once again, and Amla rolls his wrists on a pull to collect a single out to deep square"
"nudged off the toes, but it goes nowhere"
"and Amla sweeps this time, turning the strike over with a single"
"Faf makes a bit of room, but a full one dips on him and he can only dig it out"
"whipped firmly into the leg side, where a diving midwicket cuts it off"
"headed down the leg side, but Amla can't do anything with it"
"full, straight, and Amla's straight drive is stopped by a stooping bowler"
angled down the leg side and Perera couldn't lay a glove on it! It went straight through his hands as he dove to high right! He covered the ground OK
"130kph, back of a length outside off, he cracks a back foot drive to cover. The sound off the bat was pure"

"127kph, good length, angled into off, he defends from the crease"

<strong>Given LBW!</strong> South Africa <strong>review</strong>. Amla looked happy to go but Faf talked him into reviewing. He tried to sweep and played over the top of it. Not bat involved. Amla is walking off already. Ball tracking says it pitched outside leg! That was always the query. It will be <strong>reversed. Amla has to walk back. Faf was correct.</strong> It pitched just outside leg. Only fractionally. It did look in doubt live but Amla thought it was out.
