"off-stump yorker, sliced to sweeper cover for a double"
"back of a length and angling in at off, hacked away to deep midwicket"
"middle-stump yorker, Carey clears his front leg and forces the ball down to long-off. 300 up for Australia, but that 353 appears a million miles away"
"120ks slower offcutter, back of a length and outside off, Cummins swipes early to the leg side and edges it behind. Dhoni dives forward to pouch it"
"banged in short on middle, Carey takes it on with a hook and bisects deep midwicket and deep square leg"
"really full on the leg stump, glanced away wide enough of short fine leg for a <strong>25-ball half-century</strong> - fastest by an Australian in a World Cup"
"shortish and angling away outside off, jabbed away to the covers"
"back of a length on middle, another slower ball, tugged away to wide long-on"
"slower back of a length ball on leg stump, backs away and muscles to long-on"
"back of a length and outside off, flicked to wide long-on for a double"
"Carey steps away outside leg, Bumrah follows him with a ripping yorker and gets it to zip under his bat. He's too good"
Carey jumps across off and does not connect with a scoop. Bumrah spears it down leg
"120ks slower ball, back of a length and bounces outside off, hard-to-pick variations. Swings and misses"
"another slower one outside off, offcutter, keeps low and spins past Dhoni after Carey misses again"
"back of a length and cuts away outside off again, Ctrl + C. Ctrl +V. Carey can't touch these"
"length ball on leg stump, pumped over Bumrah's head. Just 1 run off the bat in the 49th over a chase of 353. Bumrah, you beauty"
"touch too full on middle, Carey opens the face and slices to sweeper cover. Carey and Starc chance a second. Vijay Shankar (the sub) throws it to Bhuvneshwar at the non-striker's end. Starc is caught short. Australia nine down"
"knuckle ball, keeps low, nurdled away to the leg side"
"back of a length, snakes back in and chops Zampa into half. Past the inside edge"

"full and wide - possibly wider than a set of stumps outside off, Carey reaches out and carves to long-off"
"Bhuvneshwar closes out the game with his knuckle-ball variation. Back of a length on middle, Zampa splices it to mid-off. That is that"
