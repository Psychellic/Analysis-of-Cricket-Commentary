"<b>caressed through midwicket!</b> Gosh, de Kock is in some serious form. He just leans over and nonchalantly flicks the first ball of the innings neatly through the leg side"
Malinga's follow-up is an attempted yorker that ends up as a low full toss outside off and is tapped to cover
"<b>carved through backward point</b>, de Kock coming forward and opening the face of his drive to beat point. It wasn't quite out of the middle, and kept the chasing fielder interested all the way"

"nice end to the over from Udana, hitting a length in the channel and giving Hendricks nothing to work with"
"<b>timing!</b> De Kock barely seemed to hit this one, but it's raced back past Malinga, beating a diving mid on. The ball was hardly full, but de Kock finds the middle with his backfoot push"
"Malinga switches to over the stumps, beating the inside of de Kock's glance to ping him on the pad. Well outside leg"
nudged to the left of mid on for a quick single
"Hendricks works one off the straight into the leg side and they take on the midwicket fielder for a quick single. Kamindu's the man in that position, and he hurls in a shy with his left hand"

whipped backward of square for a single
"again Udana finds a touch of extra bounce, at decent nip too, reaching 137km/h, and Hendricks presses it to cover"
"<b>chipped to mid off!</b> Hendricks was itching to get going, but he was just too soon into this drive. The ball just held up in the surface and stood up on him, and the chipped shot presented Malinga with a simple chance at mid off. That's <b>Udana's first wicket in ODIs</b>. It wasn't the slower one, and Hendricks looks suspiciously at the pitch before he trudges off. Interesting celebration from the bowler, too"
"there's that extra bounce again, and du Plessis takes his bottom hand off a defensive push as a length delivery rises to hit the splice"
"Udana keeps it tight on off stump, du Plessis pressing forward to defend"
pushed down the ground for a quick single
"<b>thumped down the ground!</b> Du Plessis lets his bottom hand do the work to punch a full one down the ground. It has the beating of Malinga at mid on, and then rolls past a diving Mendis at the boundary"

"very full again, and <b>du Plessis drives powerfully down the ground</b>, presenting the full face of the bat into the shot. Kusal Perera dives at mid off, and he's clutching his knee as he stands up. Well, and he's left the field now as well, which is a little worrying for Sri Lanka"

"a touch short from Udana, de Kock stepping back to pull to midwicket"
"du Plessis steps into a good-looking drive, but finds the field"
"<b>chipped in the air!</b> Du Plessis drives back at the bowler, and I don't think he was trying to hit it in the air, but it comes out of the middle and bounces over Udana and away for four. It wasn't the slower one, it just stuck in the pitch"

"yorker, aimed for the base of middle, and de Kock digs it out to cover"

de Kock is back and across to defend into the leg side

angled down to third man
"<b>slashed up and over slip!</b> Well, the fielder was there for a catch, but du Plessis ramps his slashed cut to send the ball well over his head"
"<b>walloped over wide long on!</b> De Kock's happy feet get him down the track and right to the pitch, and who slams his shot over the infield and all the way for six"

"Rajitha strays in to du Plessis' pads, the South African skipper flicking him uppishly out to deep square leg"
"<b>he's almost taken out his captain!</b> De Kock powers a straight drive back down the ground, and du Plessis has to take evasive action to get out of the way of it, the boundary bringing up de Kock's third fifty of the series"
"pulled down to fine leg, de Kock getting up on one leg to send the ball bouncing away with a flair and timing"
"Rajitha aims this one much fuller, de Kock flicking out to deep square leg"
"du Plessis pushes to cover, but he can't find the gap"

"floated up on middle and leg, and he's forward to drive to long on"
"<b>sliced down to third man!</b> It was the legbreak from Akila, and turned away to take the outer half of du Plessis' slashing square drive. There's a slip in place, but it's well wide of him"
flicked to square leg
"<b>glanced away, first ball!</b> Fine leg is up, and Perera lets his first ball slip down the leg side. De Kock just needs to put bat to the leg stump half volley"
"<b>and again!</b> Perera offers a gift on leg stump, and de Kock flicks him down to the same region for four more"
"<b>three in a row!</b> Perera adjusts, pushing his line outside off, and de Kock crunches a drive through cover, on the up"
"that's a better line from Perera, and de Kock is forward to defend it"
a leading edge squirts through mid off
an angled bat sends the ball bouncing straight to point
"short of a length on leg stump, tapped to short fine's left off the back foot"
<b>has he edged that?</b> Yes! Malinga comes back and puts a stop to the madness. Faf is cramped on the hook and can only parry this gently down leg side off the leading edge. Dickwella takes a simple catch. Malinga got that to skid on at a leg stump line and Faf's angled bat costs him
and he is greeted by a bouncer. Bit too short at a middle stump line. He ducks to let it go

"length on off, tapped through the covers on the rise"
"full outside off, driven back to the bowler"
"length on leg stump, allows it to come on, stays inside the line and tickles it past short fine. To his left. Is that a bat or a time-travel machine? Thisara with some Déjà vu"
"no, seriously, is that a time machine? Another boundary, second ball, to short fine's right. QDK deep in the crease once more and allows it to come on. Deep backward square puts in a slide but has no chance"

"length and in at the pads, clipped to short fine's right. <b>That was bowled left-handed</b>"
"full on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
"<b>there it is!</b> He's waited too long. QDK finally converts. Short and wide outside off, allows it to come and chops it past point. He's mentioned it after the last game, the need to get 100 when he gets 80. After two tries, he screams. Kept his head a little when he got close this time, tightened his game, and he achieves the landmark"
<b>whoops</b> he loses shape the very next ball! So much for praising the composure. Holds his head. Knows he's made a mistake. Looks to pull this length ball from off stump and gets a leading edge that lands safely behind the bowler

"short outside off, pulled straight to midwicket"
<b>past the edge.</b> Another slower ball. Good length and just outside off. Jumps past the forward block

"full on off stump, steps out and drives to long-on"
"length on leg stump, pushed to midwicket's right"
"length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
<b>falls over</b> and the stumping appeal is sent upstairs. Steps out premeditatedly and is beaten in flight. This lands short of a length and he has to jump back to try and cut it. Just makes it back into the crease.

"slower ball, at a length and very wide outside off. Left alone"
<b>over extra cover.</b> Slow outfield and ordinary running. They get only two. Jumps into the leg side and creams this full slower ball over that fielder from off stump
"no stopping this. And it looks like Rajitha's been marked by QDK even before the game. Short of a length on leg stump, gets inside the line and drags this to the long leg boundary. Fine leg is in, so this is a good option"
"<b>pumps it</b> between deep square and deep midwicket. Slower ball dropped short, sitting up outside off. Walks down and smashes it, one bounce, over the boundary"
"length outside off, walks down and drives on the up, straight to extra cover"
"<b>got him!</b> QDK drives the momentum into the innings, but he can't keep it up past an over. Length outside off, runs down the pitch and looks to club this between mid-off and extra cover. It rises up on him and he gets an edge through to Dickwella. Rajitha has just managed to keep a part of his heel behind the stumps too. Another superb free-flowing innings from QDK, and he's given South Africa - and Miller - quite a launching pad"
