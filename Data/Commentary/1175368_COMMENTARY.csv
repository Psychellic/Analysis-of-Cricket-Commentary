"length at off stump, looks to pull, gets it to long-on off the inside half"
<b>taken at extra cover!</b> Short of a length in the corridor and too quick for Viljeon. He wants to whip this into the leg side but the ball's hit bat before he can even close the face on it. Sliced harmlessly in Morris' direction and he takes it with a reverse-cup

"full slower ball at off stump, watches closely and stabs this out to point"
"<b>taken by short third man</b> who has Rishabh Pant very close and also going for it! Complete breakdown in communication and they have a brief bicker about it. Rabada smiles - as long as it's in.

<b>just clears mid-off.</b> Slower short ball outside off. He hangs back this time and picks his spot. That fielder is in so he flat-bats it over him. Just.
"<b>over mid-off again!</b> Good batting, not the best last ball. Length outside off. He gets on his back knee and handsomely lofts this over that fielder and flat, over the long-off boundary"
"<B>through him!</b> And umpire Chaudhuri raises his finger. Full outside off, and the ball holds it's line. Shaw presses forward to drive with the offspin, but the ball whizzes past his outside edge, and Rahul whips the bails off. Was that caught-behind or stumping? Caught-behind it is.

"<b>KL Rahul holds on!</b> Sam Curran wheeling away in the leg side. The camera cuts to the Capitals dugout and you will not spot a smile there. Length ball slanted across the corridor, looks to club it into the leg side, gets a leading edge that is at a comfortable catching height for the keeper"
"length at off stump, hurries onto him and he defends into the pitch off the back foot"
<b>under-edge</b> bounces back down the pitch! Vihari backs away and is too slow on the pull at this short of a length ball. Shami takes some steps forward and collects
<b>splits the stumps!</b> What a gorgeous sight. Shami delivers - that's Capitals' last regular batsman gone. Wow. Length ball at middle stump. Backs away and swings across the line and this sounds as good at it looks when the ball splits middle and leg
"short ball outside off, backs away and swings across the line, beaten"
"<b>Ashwin with the Indian twirl of the wrists</b> that suggests, 'how did that happen?' Low full toss outside off. Avesh closes his eyes, looks leg side and swings his hands. The ball ends up trickling into the extra cover boundary"
"bouncer at at middle stump line, backs away and swings. Beaten"
"<b>leg stump outta there!</b> Stunning, stunning comeback from Kings XI Punjab. And Sam Curran has delivered. 20 off 10 in a position he'd never batted before in a T20, and now he's here, taking his third wicket, almost dead-set nailing Capitals fortune with an inswinging yorker that's gone past KG's slog. On a hat-trick!"
"<b>he's got it!</b> Sam Curran has sprung out of nowhere and taken a hat-trick! Yorker at off stump, Lamichhane looks to drill through the off side and completely misses. He has lost his off stump. Delhi Capitals have done an unbelievable job of losing this game"
