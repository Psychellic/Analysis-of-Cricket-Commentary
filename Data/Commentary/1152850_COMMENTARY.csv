"88mph, fuller length, well wide of off, he leaves this alone"
"88mph, shorter into the hip, he's taken on the thigh guard and it drops down"

"back of a length, top of off, he's half forward getting a thick inside edge on the bounce to short leg who is still deep"

"back of a length, 87mph on off, he's back and across and defending with the full face"
"good length, fourth stump line, he's forward and defending to point"
"<strong>given LBW!</strong> Burns <strong>reviews straight away</strong>. This looked high. Back of a length, pitching on middle, hit the back thigh inline with off. No bat involved. It missed the inside edge. Ball tracker says going <strong>over off</strong>! Not out. Good review from Burns. Not a great decision. That was way too high. Looked high live and proved thus"
"back of a length on off, he defends from the crease"
"shorter length, he's back and knocking this down off the splice of the bat"
"good length, fifth stump line, going across, he leaves"
<strong>huge appeal for caught behind</strong> given not out. No review from Australia. it flicked the back pad as it beat the inside edge. Great call from Kumar Dharmasena
"tried to leave, it runs off the face of the bat past gully and away to third man. Labuschagne makes a great effort to try and save it but his hand was brushing the rope as he hauled it in"
"good length, 88mph top of off, he's half forward, defending in a bit of a tangle but keeps it out"

"<strong>lovely on drive!</strong> Too full shaping in, he plays through the line with a beautiful flow of the bat and beats mid on. It raced away"
"<strong>thick inside edge,</strong> a french cut, well past leg stump though and away to fine leg. Hazlewood just dragged the length back a touch"
"<strong>sliced in the air but well wide of gully!</strong> A tempting length wide of off, not a half volley, he drives hard, he sliced a thick edge but it flies well wide of gully and away. A hint of luck"
"good length, fifth stump line, he makes a late decision to leave and just gets the bat out of the way"

<strong>Huge LBW appeal</strong>. Given not out. Australia think long and hard about a review but opt not too. Height the issue. This jagged in off the seam and hit the back thigh. Ball tracking said it was going over. Good call again
"89mph, angled in and taking the pad but it was going down leg"
"<strong>edged and Smith takes a juggling catch at second!</strong> Good length but way wide of off, wobbling away a touch off the seam, he didn't need to play but drove with hard hands, got a thick edge that flew chest high to Smith, it burst through his hands, bounced off his chest, he bobbled it up again as he falls to ground and then clutched it with the third bite!"

"87mph, shorter length on middle, he's back and working this wide of mid on"
"86mph, back of a length outside off, he's back and defending square away from his body"
<strong>waft and miss</strong>. This was 80mph well wide but maybe not short enough to cut. He was half hearted in cutting and missed it
"shorter length, he checks a pull shot and can't find the gap, picking out forward square"
"86mph, shorter and wider, he's punching neatly off the back foot through cover-point with lovely timing"
<strong>thick edge and it goes straight through Harris at gully!</strong> It went along the ground and Harris didn't get low enough. That was a better length from Siddle but it wasn't rewarded and it cost runs

"back of a length to rectify the previous error, and Burns is back into his watchful block mode"
"living off the seam, past the off stump as Root shoulders arms. Whisper it, but the zing of the Cummins/Hazlewood new-ball spell hasn't been replicated by the rest of the attack"
"tapped to the off side, looking for the gap but can't find it there"
"back of a length, Root rocks back for his trademark chop through the gully, parried by the fielder but they steal the single anyway"
"width outside off, but Burns can't cash in, as he drops his gloves and sways as the ball gets big on him"
"<B>sharper!</B> Banged in short from round the wicket, and angling into the left-hander, but Burns drops his hands well to sway out of line"
"pace outside off once more, pushed into the covers, a sharp return to the fray for Australia's strike bowler"
"<B>well bowled!</B> Much better already, just wobbling onto an ultra-full length and thumping the pads on the angle as Root struggles to read the line"
"<B>good riposte</B>, rising onto his toes, and chopping hard down through backward point. Siddle losing his line once more and Root cashes in"
"round the wicket, angled into the left-hander, who hops back onto his stumps to block"

hopping into the thigh pad as Siddle finds some nip on a good length
"right back onto the stumps in defence, played right under the nose"

"<B>snorter!</B> Big jag off the seam, from inches short of a good length, Root is beaten on the inside-edge as Paine gathers down the leg side"

"round the wicket, thumps the pads on a better length, but that looked to be doing too much after pitching"
squirted out through square leg as Burns closes the face on a full length and finds a thick inside edge. They all count
"full face of the bat presented this time, firmly out to cover"
"Urgh ... that was a bit loose all round. Short and wide from Siddle, and short and late from Burns, who seemed to be reflexively drawn into a slash, long after his brain had told him not to"
"beaten outside off, as Root allows himself to be caught on the crease for a nothing poke"
"<B>dropped at deep square leg, and it's a shocker from Siddle!</B> Oh my, that is a <I>massive</I> moment in this Test match. A non-descript short ball, carelessly flapped behind square, and well .. Siddle could have caught that with his eyes closed, it was just plopping out of the sky, straight into his hands!"
"banged in short, Burns ducks"
"attempted leave, takes the under-edge of the bat, and down into the cordon. Cummins is ticking..."

"full and fast outside off stump, 86mph, and left alone"
"<B>dropped again!</B> Wow, A sizzling delivery from Cummins, jagging off the seam and luring Root into a loose, angled poke outside off, but Paine behind the stumps goes at it with one glove, out of the pocket of first slip, and tips it over the bar! Gosh. If this isn't Root's day, I'm not sure he'll ever have one again..."
fired down the leg side
"jag off the seam, off the back foot, Burns plays inside the line"

"fuller outside off, he mistimes a drive to mid off"
"fuller on off, he defends on the front foot"
"<strong>dropped by Smith at second slip!</strong> Can you believe it?! It was full wide of off, he drove hard and got a thick edge, it waist high to Smith's right, he was a touch slow to go and there was no third slip in, he flung himself full stretch and got two hands to it but it went down. Tough catch but another chance."
"good length, nipping back, he gets a thick inside edge onto pad"

"back of a length, wide of off, he leaves it alone comfortably"
<strong>huge appeal for LBW</strong> but it's too high and going down. It seamed in and took him above the pad. Not a lot going for that appeal
"short and wide, he's back and dabbing a late cut, backward point dives and knocks it down but they get a run"

"<B>big movement for Marsh!</B> Curling wickedly, albeit from the hand, and Stokes gets in a tangle as he tries to flick off his thigh"
"leaning onto the front foot, pressed to cover"
"<B>terrible from Stokes!</B> That's a honking stroke, trying to pull Marsh off that nagging length, but he's picked the wrong one here, a steepling top-edge as he pivots on the spot, oodles of time to contemplate his error as point plucks the chance, hands cupped to the sky. Now then ..."

"short and down leg, he shapes to pull but elects to leave"
"good length, some outswing, he defends off the back foot pushing towards point"
"good length, some shape away, he plays a textbook forward defence, under his eyes"
"86mph, fuller length, angled in, he pushes firmly straight of mid on but doesn't time it well enough to beat the man"
"85mph, back of a length, he pushes to cover-point and calls for one but Root sends him back immediately. Bairstow beats the throw getting back comfortably"

"85mph, good length shaping wide of off, he leaves"
"good length, too wide, he leaves this"
"84mph, back of a length, fourth stump line, he defends on the front foot"
"<strong>bowled him! Another cracker from Cummins</strong>. Wider on the crease, angled in, it hits a good length, straightens a touch and Root is squared up on the crease, beaten on the outside edge and it crashes into off stump! Three quarters of the way up! Not dissimilar to the Old Trafford delivery"
"85mph, back of a length, nipping back and he leaves on length. It was wide of off"
"good length, 86mph, fifth stump line, he leaves shuffling across the crease"
"huge inswinger, 88mph, but it shapes way down leg"
"88mph, good length but swinging way wide of off this time and he leaves it again"
"<strong>inside edge through his legs!</strong> 89mph, good length nipping back, he had no idea, just prodded the bat in hope and it cannoned off the inside edge through his legs to fine leg"
<strong>appeal for caught down leg</strong> given not out. Australia <strong>review</strong>. Buttler looks worried. It was on the hip he was trying to glance but he has missed it and it clipped the hip on the way through to Paine. Not out remains. Australia burn a review
"back of a length, hint of shape, he's squared up defending on the crease"
"<strong>glorious cover drive!</strong> Slightly over-pitched, it was swinging away, his feet were anchored but his hands were superb, flowing through the line, he placed it between cover and mid off"

"<strong>LBW!</strong> <strong>An inswinging yorker!</strong> Bairstow <strong>reviews </strong> after a long chat with Buttler. It was a full yorker and his head fell over. He couldn't get the bat down in time, it hit pad first on the foot and ball tracking has it smashing into the base of <strong>middle and leg!</strong> England lose a review."
"back of a length on off, he's back and pushing this into cover"
"85mph very wide full outswinger, he shovels a square drive behind point, the man in the deep has to run around and can't prevent two"
89mph short lifter and Curran is clueless! He shuffled across and stuck his bat infront of his face in hope and it zipped past the edge
"<strong>hooked for six!</strong> 90mph bouncer, he premeditated getting inside and hooked it flat and just over fine leg into the crowd!"
"89mph, shuffles back and across and cops a length ball on thigh guard"
<strong>Plumb LBW!</strong> Way too good from the World No.1! Curran thinking the short barrage was coming copped a full inswinger and was trapped plumb infront as he shuffled across. Oh no! It's a <b>no-ball</b>! A check upstairs has shown Cummins over-stepped! Wow. He's always close but that was over. Leach no longer the only one in the series to do that
"nearly losses leg stump! He shuffled back and across, he fired full at leg but it missed"
"a short bouncer, nipping well wide of off, he stays inside it"

"84mph, good length outswinger, he leaves this comfortably"
"86mph, good length, outswinger, he leaves wide of off"

"87mph, back of a length, swinging away, he is squared up and withdrawing the bat inside the line"
"<strong>sliced in the air but wide of gully!</strong> It was full and shaping away, his feet were nowhere as he drove and sliced across it but it flew safely through backward point"
"fuller on off, he mistimes a drive, again feet anchored, getting it to mid off"
<strong>slashes a cut shot backward of point!</strong> Too short and wide and he thrashed it head high into the gap at backward point. It went to the fence in a flash
"81mph, shaping in and gets a <strong>thick inside edge</strong> trying to cut but he was cramped. It missed leg stump and went to fine leg"
"85mph, short and wide and climbing through to Paine as Buttler leaves"
"83mph, fuller on off, some shape in the air, he drives without much footwork pushing it to mid off"
"inswinger, 83mph, Buttler spots it clipping it from middle stump to wide fine leg"
"<strong>caught at second slip!</strong> Brilliant from Marsh. Good catch from Smith. Terrible shot. It was full and angled across, it didn't shape back, just went on with the angle, Curran threw the kitchen sink and the dish washer at a drive, but his feet were nowhere near the length, got a thick edge and Smith took the sharp chance head high. it flew to him"
"86mph, good length, fourth stump, he's back and defending"
"very full, he drives inside out but straight to cover"
"back of a length, fifth stump line, he leaves this alone"

"83mph, angled down the leg side he can't glance it"
"85mph, shorter length, off stump, he's back and across"
"<strong>another yorker and it's LBW!</strong> Mitch Marsh on fire! This was fired into middle and leg, it hits Woakes on the toe as he falls over. The Aussies were celebrating as the finger went up. Woakes checked with Buttler before heading off. There may be a query about it sliding but it looked to be hitting leg. Ball tracking had it smashing leg stump!"
"84mph, full and straight and he keeps it out with the full face"
"<strong>hit him in the chest!</strong> A nasty short ball, Buttler didn't know what to do, tried to sway and just copped it in the chest"
"86mph, back of a length wide of off, he leaves this decisively"

"shaping down the leg-side, tucked off the pads"
sliding past the leg stump this time
"low full toss, on the off stump, Archer stabs into the covers and jogs through for the single to keep the strike. Too early to shield the tail, of course, but Australia won't mind that"
"<B>aggression from Archer!</B> Advancing to the short ball, and pulling off the front foot as the ball doesn't get above waist height. Short leg dives for cover"
"<strong>beauty!</strong> Back on a good length, angling back in and beating the inside edge as Archer is caught on the crease"
spliced defence on the back foot as Hazlewood hits the seam and jags it towards the cordon
"banged into the ribs, and fenced down, short of the lurking lid-man"

"<B>edged, but safe, through third man!</B> Buttler is squared up on the back foot, a fat leading edge squirts safely through gully"
"<B>edged again, and inches short of slip!</B> Crikey, get them where you can! Warner at first slip was fractionally too deep to scoop that on the half-volley..."
"late on the shot, a back-foot block to silly point, and a sharp single"
"<B>perfection from Hazlewood!</B> No tailender in the world is going to negotiate that... probing line, shaping in on off stump, seaming half a bat's width away, and sure enough, that half a bat is all that it needs for Paine to gather a slender curling edge! Another cherry-picked wicket from a cherry-ripe seamer. England are nice and crispy now"
fired down the leg side
"on the hip, nudged down into the leg side"
"pressing onto the front foot, half-forward to Siddle"
"back of a length, attempted pull through the leg side"

"over the wicket again, messing with Leach's angles as he wears one in the thighpad"
"on the legs, nurdled to backward square"
"<B>steps back, and smoked over long-off!</B> That's the way to do it! All decorum can go hang. England need their runs before their wickets run out!"
"<B>yee-har, Beast Mode is a go-go!</B> Clears the front dog, smears an outrageous full-frontal wind-up high and handsome over long-on! Have some of that, Test cricket!"
"<strong>attempted reverse-paddle!</strong> It's like the halcyon days of June and July all of a sudden. Doesn't connect this time, but the crowd are loving the intent"

"banged into the hip, flicked for the single - Leach wanted two but Labuschagne did well to slide and stop"
"back of a length, Buttler was set for the short ball but it wasn't as short as he expected. Short midwicket intercepts, and Leach will have the strike"
"<B>good start!</B> Lovely curling inswinger to the left-hander, and beats the outside edge by a whisker ...and Marsh is down in his followthrough. A touch of cramp..."
"beats the outside edge first up, right on the money as you'd expect"
firmly fenced into the covers
swished off the toes through backward square. Excellent stroke in the swingy circumstances

"banged in short again, Leach is tucked up at 89mph as he fences behind square, but Buttler turns down the single"
"<B>sweetly driven</B>, so sweetly that Leach sets off for an instinctive and fully justified single. The trouble is, he's also gone and kept the strike! Still, if he plays like that, where's the problem?"
<B>zippy bouncer!</B> Leach watches it well - better than many of his senior team-mates - and flings his head out of harm's way
"much fuller, but playing very late on the back foot, driven back into the crease by the previous bouncer"
"fires one into the pads, looking for the top of off again, but Leach works in airily past short leg for the single. Buttler has a rare sighting of the strike"
"Buttler makes room, Cummins follows him, and beats him on the outside edge, past leg stump, with late outswing. As you do"
"solidly clipped out to deep midwicket, everyone is back on the boundary so that's an easy single"
"squared up from round the wicket, but a fat and low outside edge through the cordon <strong>brings up the 250!</strong>"
"short, pulled, Labuschagne can't sight it out of the setting sun and England scamper back for two"
"short again, pulled again, <B>smashed into the stands!</B> Buttler's fifty comes up with a pure piece of white-ball biffing, and suddenly battle is rejoined by England's topsy-turvy, ludicrous Test team..."

"on the back foot, blocked into the off side, huge cheers as Leach does what he does best, and lingers"
"shades of turn as Buttler stays in his crease for a sighter, and slaps a flat-footed cut to point"
"<B>reverse-sweep!</B> Buttler's seen enough already, regulation turn from leg to off, so he reverses his hands, hits with the spin through fine leg"

"on the back foot, nudged to the leg side, as Labuschagne bowls into the wicket, avoiding too much air"
"a fraction short, crashed off the back foot, Buttler jogs the single to extra cover. One ball for Leach the Leech"
"round the wicket, speared into the toes, Leach flicks square and is sent back on the single. Rightly so. Buttler has the strike."
"an air-shot outside off stump, good line and length, and Buttler can't connect"
"defended under the eye-line, waiting for the ball to come to him"
"inside edge onto the pad, which takes the pace off the shot and allows them to rush back for two as the fielder tears in from the rope"
"fuller length, pushed from deep in the crease to long on, no single yet"
"duly tucked to mid-on, for the dot ball..."
"flick into the gap at midwicket, perfectly pilfered off the pads"
"half-tracker, pulled to the midwicket sweeper, as Buttler turns down the single"
"swinging into the pads ... not a particularly threatening delivery, but with the field as it is, it's effective"
"tighter line, a hint of shape on a middle-and-off line. Blocked"
"very full, clipped uppishly to deep midwicket again. Leach is left with two to survive"
"shape back into the left-hander, as Leach defends on the back foot. He's down at 80mph now, after touching 85 in his first spells"

defended on the back foot
"on the legs, clipped on the up, an easy two as the ball plugs on the boundary's edge"
"late outswing on a very wide line, Buttler strides across his crease to chase it, but can't connect"
"clipped in the air, but wide of mid-on"
a swing and a miss with the field now up. Skims over the bails by a few inches
"booming outswinger, well bowled, and well taken, Buttler couldn't get bat on that without edging it. And Leach will have the strike for the final over of the day"
"solid block, leaning onto the front foot. Can't argue with that"
"<strong>bouncer! Thumps the forearm and flies to gully!</strong> Australia appeal, and might well have reviewed if Leach hadn't given the game away by pointing to the point of impact"
"short again, Leach ducks this time"
fenced off the hip to the leg side
"stands tall on the back foot, blocked to the off side"
"fired down the leg side, and that is that!"
"85mph, fuller on middle, plays a lovely on drive but straight to mid on"

"good length, 85mph, angled in to the top of off, he defends from the crease into the off side"
"he walks way across outside off and is hit on the pad outside the line of off, it trickles away behind square for a leg bye. He wasn't that far outside the line. There was barely an appeal. It was high"
"86mph, fuller outside off, he pushes this neatly to the gap at cover"
"<strong>thumping cover drive on the up!</strong> What a shot. It was a good length and shaping but well wide of off, he drives on the up with beautiful hands flowing through the line and smashing it through cover-point"

"short ball, lifting outside off, <strong>just past the edge</strong> as he jumps back trying to defend"

"he advances, Marsh drags the length back and he defends on the move towards mid on"
"80mph back of a length outside off, he stands tall and crunches a back foot square drive to deep point but doesn't run. Supreme shot for no run"

"83mph, fuller on off, he is pushing, half forward, driving to mid off"
"<strong>leading edge through a vacant fourth slip!</strong> Good length, pitching on leg and nipping across, he closed the face, got a thick edge but it flies safely through where fourth slip would have been. Only two slips in"

"<strong>edged but short of first slip!</strong> 87mph, short ball, he jumped back in defence and edged it but soft hands saw it go to ground"

"another sharp lifting delivery outside off, <strong>beats the bat</strong> again by some margin as it flies to Paine"

"short and wide, 82mph, a gift and he leaves! A lot of players may have thrashed at that"

Looks to be a gap between ball and bat on the replay. Ultra Edge says ... there's a tiny spike! <b>He's given out!</b> Decision overturned. Wow. Legitimately looked like he missed it"
"91mph, short into the thigh guard, it bounces off his hip behind square"
"85mph, full angled into off, he clips this with the angled wide of mid on, nice timing and control"

"touch of width outside off, and Labuschagne is lured by the extra bounce and hint of movement! Late on the cut, and he chastises himself"
"attacking the stumps, full and threatening, flicked firmly off the toes to Buttler at a very deep short leg, who fields and shies in one fluid movement"
"shaping into the toes, and solidly blocked back down the track"
"tight line, angled in, cautious in defence with a very straight blade"
"very full once more, stabbed back down the track where mid-on gathers. Probing from Broad, as England scent an opportunity"
"<B>very loose!</B> There's that fifth-stump line, with a bit of movement away, and Smith wafts flat-footedly and nearly finds the edge!"
"tighter line on a full length, Smith stabs the ball back at Archer, at 90mph, who gathers and shies in a fury! That's got the crowd going!"
"sharp again from Archer, a bouncer aimed at the body but sliding over the shoulder as Smith flinches inside the line"
"right up to the toes, Smith shuffles outside off and digs out the full ball."
"back of a length, rising outside off, Smith shuffles and pokes to point with a loud 'wait on!' for emphasis"

defended with a firm face as Smith shuffles into line
extravagant leave outside off
"well bowled, tailing in again on that very full length, but Smith gets enough bat on that to flick past square leg, who fails to gather to allow him to get off the mark"

"whistles through the bouncer once more, that's the one for the over, as Smith ducks"
"<strong>wafty wafty! </strong> There's that line again, outside Smith's eyeline, and shaping away from a fifth-stump line. Smith isn't looking entirely composed just yet..."
"better leave as Smith lines up the width outside off, and lets it be"
"sharp once more from Archer, fizzing it through on a fuller length, outside off again as Smith shoulders arms. A maiden, and a probing one too"
"pushed across the right-hander, a bit of shape as Labuschagne chases the drive into the covers"
definite tail back into the right-hander this time as Labuschagne plants his front foot a touch. Encouraging signs for Curran
"<B>cracking strike!</B> Curran gets this one wrong, floating it up on a very full length outside off, no bend in the air, and so simply pounded through the covers"
"pushed across the bat, and Bairstow appeals as he gathers! No review, as that was bat on ground, not ball. But the swing was appreciable and induced the error"

"a pre-meditated stroll across his stumps, back foot outside off before the ball is delivered, and a French-cricket flick through midwicket ensues"
"good battle this. Smith is challenging Curran to pin him lbw, with the one that curls back in on a very full length. Opening his stance, and inviting the one that shapes into his leg-side flick. Extraordinary contortions"
"<B>there go those hands!</B> He's right back on those stumps again, but this time Curran pushes it too far across the body, So it's a free hit for those hyperactive wrists, pongo-ed through the covers!"
"back and across to block it away. This is fascinating. There's no doubt that Curran is offering a whole new challenge, but Smith is equal to it so far"

"zipping the short ball through to the keeper, as Archer keeps zinging it down"
"short and sharp, lifting into the ribs at 88mph, and well played, down into the crease"
"<B>beaten!</B> A bit of nibble on the back foot, and that one grazes past the <I>inside</I> edge as Bairstow gathers well down the leg side"
"very full, tailing in towards the off stump. Pressed firmly back to the bowler who gathers in one hand"
"tapped back down the pitch, and a cunningly snaffled single to allow Smith to escape the strike. Broad gallops in from mid-off but can't intercept"
sliding past the leg stump as Curran drags his length back
"<B>edged clean through the cordon!</B> Chasing the outswinger, and drawing the error. Labuschagne survives as Stokes dives in vain at second but can't get his fingers on it"
"left alone, as the chastised Marnus recalibrates"
"pressed back down the track. England's window of opportunity remains ajar, but they need to make this pressure count"
"walking across the stumps, flipped off the hip to backward square"
"<strong>clipped supremely off the toes!</strong> In the slot for the shot, but he cashed in supremely"
"flicked to the leg side as he walks across the stumps. Labuschagne is becoming a complete clone of his senior partner, mannerisms and ticks and all"
"flicked off the legs, past the despairing dive of Bairstow. Woakes was straining for the swing, but ended up serving another loose delivery"
right behind the line as Woakes finds the channel outside off this time
back and across to defend out to midwicket. Not the most tidy introduction from Woakes there...
"<B>huge appeal!</B> Smith walks across his stumps and is thumped in front of off as he's beaten  by the late curl. but his instant reaction is to gesture to umpire Dharmasena that it is too high ... he's probably right, but close!"
"<B>massive appeal as Smith offers no stroke!</B> But once again, his peerless knowledge of his stumps' whereabouts has saved Smith there. There was curl back from outside off, but it was clearly not doing quite enough. Excitement abounds!"
"<B>sharp bouncer!</B> Grrr... Curran shows he's got an extra gear, as Smith sways out of line"
left alone with that exaggerated point of the bat as the ball zips by
flicked to the leg side as Smith walks across to off agan
"<B>thumped on the pads again!</B> But Smith just knows better than any umpire where his stumps are. More late bend from Curran, but it's always wide of off. He knows he's in a battle though!"
"better from Woakes, stump-to-stump line as Labuschagne squeezes a defensive stab back down the pitch"
"good length again, pushing forward from the crease, and  picked up in the covers"
"strays a touch too full, trying to keep the stumps in play, but the angle into the legs is bread-and-butter for a composed batsman, who flicks calmly through the gap at midwicket"
"squared up on the back foot, a touch more nip off the pitch there"
"wide line outside off, no stroke this time"
"<B>finds the splice!</B> Better from Woakes, tight line, good nip, holding its own on off stump, and the cordon gathers..."
"swished off the pads, down the leg side, and Smith escapes the strike"
full length and pushed back up the pitch
"outside off, shaping away on a full length, 82mph, which is brisker than not. And left alone"
"leaning forward, stabbed to square leg, Smith gets the strike back for the final two balls of the session"
no stroke offered this time
"round the wicket to mix things up, but Curran over-compensates and fires it down the leg side. And so ends a lively opening gambit on the second day."
"good length, fifth stump line, he leaves as it wobbles past the stumps"
"<strong>whipped from off stump through square!</strong> 83mph half volley and he clipped it beautifully, probably squarer than he wanted but it flew to the rope"
"84mph, floated up outside off, he strides out and defends with his eyes over the ball"
"86mph, good length, wider line, he leaves this alone"
"full on off, angling in, he glances this fine to fine leg from off stump"
"good length, wide of off, he's shuffling across to leave"
"82mph, good length wide of off, he leaves"
"good length wide of off, he leaves this alone"
"back of a length, 83mph, angled into off, he defends on the front foot"
<strong>square drive sliced up and over backward point!</strong> It was wide and full and he drove hard and slashed it high over backward point. Not in control but he took a calculated risk there and flashed hard
"84mph, good length wide of off, he leaves this due to the length"
"83mph, fuller fifth stump line, he pushes forward with the full face to mid off"
"89mph bouncer over leg, he ducks underneath with ease"
"88mph, good length wide of off, he leaves this with ease"
"87mph, good length, angled into the top of off, he defends from the crease"
"86mph, good length, top of off, he shuffles back and across and nudges this to the gap at midwicket. Just for a change"
"87mph, good length, fifth stump line, he's defending, a little unsure pushing to point"
"88mph, good length, wide of off, he's leaving this alone as it climbs from a length"
"<strong>short and wide and hammered! Glorious back foot square drive.</strong> On his toes, on top of the bounce, placing it behind point."
"long half volley, Smith hammers this but straight to cover"
"83mph, fullish length, outside off, he caresses a drive with control to cover"
"83mph, back of a length middle and off, he's back and across and working this to midwicket"
"84mph, good length, wide of off, a hint of shape away but he leaves watchfully"
"85mph, good length, wide of off, he leaves early"
"<strong>big inside edge onto pad</strong>. Good length, nipping back but it was a thick inside edge. If he missed it, it was outside the line too"
<strong>cracking 86mph bouncer</strong>. Labuschagne was late to duck but he got under it just. He took his eye off it and fell backwards. Brutal ball
"87mph, good length, fourth stump line, he's forward and covering the line in defence"
"good length, 87mph top of off, he's back and working this wide of mid on for a single"
"87mph, top of off, he's back and across and clipping this beautifully behind square for a couple"
"89mph, long half volley, he's hanging back but placing it inside out wide of mid off and is running with the stroke"
"good length, 86mph, wide of off, he leaves this alone watching it all the way"
"good length, fifth stump line, 87mph, he leaves again"
"85mph, full angled into off, he pings a drive powerfully but straight to mid on"
"good length, 87mph, climbing outside off and he leaves on length"
short and wide and Smith mistimes a cut! He lashed at it but was frustrated as soon as he made contact. Picked out the fielder at point
"<strong>back foot cover drive to a wide half volley!</strong> That's the trademark shot of this series. How many times has he done it? Wide volley, He's hanging back and then open chested just hammers it through cover point"
"86mph, good length, fourth stump line, he's in behind it covering off and defending with the full face"
"88mph, back of a length on off, he's defending on the back foot"
"back of a length, leg cutter on off, he's turned around defending off the back foot"
"88mph, back of a length wide of off, he leaves"
"<strong>rearing short ball hit him on the bottom elbow!</strong> He's down. That hurt. Short and rearing. He fended off the back foot, it missed the inside edge and hit flush on the right forearm"
"88mph, back of a length, outside off, he's back and across and defending"
"83mph, good length top of off, he's slightly squared up on the back foot but defending without issue"
"good length, 85mph, fourth stump line, he's back and across and defending again"
86mph angled way down the leg side and he can't catch up with it
"82mph, good length, top of off, no swing or seam, he's back and defending"
"angled way down leg, 81mph. He's not getting any shape"
"81mph, good length, a hint of shape away but wide of off, he leaves"
"88mph, fuller outside off, he shuffles back and across to smother it in defence"
"89mph, shorter length, he's back and tucking this off the ribs to square leg"
"<strong>edged but along the ground wide of gully!</strong> Done all ends up. Angled in, nipping away, he was squared up, but with soft hands the edge went down and wide of gully"
"87mph, fuller length, fourth stump line, he is back and defending to cover"
<strong>cracking bouncer!</strong> It climbed and he was jumping back and then dropping the hands as it flew past his ear!
"good length wide of off, he leaves this alone"
"85mph, angled to leg, he clips this neatly but straight to square leg"
"84mph, good length, fourth stump line, he's back and across and defending"
"84mph, good length, top of off, he's back and working this to midwicket"
"good length, fourth stump line he is back and dropping the bat on the ball"
"good length, fourth stump, he's back and defending"
"85mph, bouncer, he ducks under it easily"
an <strong>inside edge</strong> onto pads shuffling infront of the stumps! That was plumb if he missed it. It rolls behind square for two
"<strong>Plumb LBW! He missed this one.</strong> Labuschagne has a long chat with Smith almost trying to convince him they need to review. Smith says 'no, mate'. Smith was right. He shuffled back and across to a full inswinger and was hit below the knee roll infront of middle. Big breakthrough"
"good length, angled in, he's defending half forward"
"fuller on off, he drives with a punch, straight of mid on, they push for three, they get it easily but Bairstow faked the ball was being thrown to his end! Smith dives full length for no reason! Everyone is laughing"
"<strong>pinged off middle behind square!</strong> What a shot. This was the same full and straight ball that Labuschagne got out to, Smith clips it for four off the middle of the bat behind square"
"back of a length, outside off, it climbs, he is surprised by the bounce, he knocks it down awkwardly"
"86mph, angled across from over the wicket, fifth stump line, he leaves"
"86mph, fuller outside off, he drives but doesn't middle it to mid off"
"good length, well wide of off, 86mph, he leaves"
long volley and <strong>hammers a cover drive!</strong> too easy for Wade. He loves it there
"better length, angled across, 86mph, he leaves on length"
"82mph, back of a length, top of off, he is back and defending"
full inswinging yorker <strong>almost gets through!</strong> He just jams the bat down and squeezes it out
"good length, angled across, he leaves this alone, no swing then"
"back of a length, he's back and across working this neatly wide of mid on"
"83mph, swinging into off, he's back and across working this neatly with the shape through midwicket for a couple"
"fuller on middle, 83mph, from right infront of the stumps he picks this off past forward square with ease for two more"
"good length outside off, he's back and defending to mid off"
"wide of off stump, shaping across the left-hander, no stroke offered"
"Wade strides to the pitch of the ball outside off, then leaves alone on the angle"
"<B>big appeal!</B> Not sure it came back quite enough, but Root is going to <B>review </B> all the same. It was angled across the left-hander and jagged in off the seam, but this looks high and off-sided to me... yep, and umpire's call on impact too. And a big fat inside-edge too, not that the umpire's noticed. Not England's cleverest review of the series. One from the Paine school of reviewing, in fact"
"speared into the pads, and pushed firmly through midwicket, a long chase to haul that back in"
"squared up to defend into the off-side, body right behind the line of the ball"
"<B>sumptuous!</B> Full-length, right in Smith's slot with his weight back in the crease, and those booming hands swing through the line, for a clean blow through long-on"
"on the legs, no swing this time, and the ball shapes right into Wade's arc as a leg-stump half-volley"
"outside off, shaping away as Wade leaves alone. Better line, forcing Wade to make a decision"
defended off the back foot
punched on the up to the leg side
"leaning out of the crease, meeting the full length with an angled bat"
"wide line, through to the keeper"
"outside off, across comes Smith to tuck this off his hip in that time-honoured fashion"
"back of a length, just enough width for Wade to free his arms, with a thumping upper-cut through the covers. Lovely strike"
"tailing into the pads, flicked to the leg side"
"pushed onto the back foot, blocked into the off side"
worked off the legs
right back and across to blot out the full length. Woakes isn't offering a great deal to England today
"outside off, tapped to the off-side from deep in the crease, a bit of a sighter for the batsman"
"Wade advances to the pitch this time, having decided that there's not a huge amount of turn. Clipped to mid-on for the single"
clipped to midwicket with half a stride out of the crease
"<B>just out of Buttler's reach at short leg!</B> Turn out of the footmarks, rips behind square... was there bat, not sure... but definitely turn"
"watchful in defence, less bite on this one"
"scuffed up to mid-on, Wade almost yorks himself in his eagerness to get to the pitch, but does the needful in the end"
"squared up in defence, a hint of late shape away from the left-hander, as the ball squirts out to gully"
"fired down the leg side, Curran asking the ball to do too much on that occasion"
"full-faced defence, Curran keeping the ball wobbling as Wade stays watchful"
"huge appeal, a lot of pondering for Dharmasena, and<strong> up goes the finger!</strong> Superb bowling from Curran, irrespective of the upshot as <B>Wade reviews</B>, late swing on a full length, bending into Wade's pad on a leg-stump line. He was a long way back, was it doing too much? No, <b>it's clipping leg!</b> Due reward for a spell in which he has kept all the Aussies honest, not least the man who still eludes his grasp... But England's 294 is looking healthier now..."
"width and outswing, Marsh opens his face and stabs a nondescript chop into the cordon"
"back of a length, blocked on the back foot straight back down the line. It's a wicket maiden and a hard-earned one too"
looped into the toes and Smith clips another easy single to the on-side
leaning forward to cover all bases
thumps the pad and <strong>my word that is tight!</strong> Marsh played for non-existent spin and so looked all at sea as the ball clobbered him. It needed to turn to take the stumps though. Erasmus is unmoved
punched to mid-on with intent but little timing
forward and blocked back down the track
"soft-handed edge - well, relatively soft-handed at any rate - as Marsh steers an off-stump line into the cordon"
"curling back towards the off stump, chopped out to the covers as Smith closes up in his stance"
"swinging onto the legs, Smith gives it a clobbering with oodles of bottom hand, but a strong leg-side ring is in place to cut that off"
"outside leg this time, easy pickings for a clip to backward square"
"wicket-to-wicket line, bending back towards off stump. Marsh kneels in a defensive posture to press the ball back to the bowler"
"clipped with intent, on the up through the leg side, Curran isn't finding quite the right line all of a sudden"
chiselled off the toes to deep backward square
"round the wicket, outside off, flogged square, out through deep point where Archer takes a tumble to gather"
a hint of pop from just back of a length. Smith stretches to meet the pitch and gets a little surprise as he does so
drawn forward once again with a very full face
soft-handed defence into the covers
"<B>Smith's tenth consecutive Ashes fifty!</B> And it comes up in style, a gallop down the track, not quite to the pitch, but he committed his hands to the task and launched a dismissive thwack high over long-on!"
"outside off, pressed to point"
"full face of the bat, driven into the covers, but straight to the man"
"compact drive, meeting a touch of width with an open face, but extra cover is on hand to gather"
"very full, just outside off, Marsh is beaten with a bit of a flaccid stab, very flat-footed"
"squeezed out through backward point, Burns gives chase to intercept"
"on the back foot, blocked to the on-side with a hop across the crease"
"twinkle-toed hop across the crease, so calmly flicked off the pads, and the weight of the shot is perfect to allow them to rush back for two, It's relentless!"
"full length, tailing in, pressed into the covers"
"outside off, tight lines, good carry, solid leave"
sliding past the leg stump
"back of a length, leaping past a loose chop into the off side. Flighty from Marsh"
"full length, lovely upright seam, inviting the drive, punched straight into the hands of silly mid-off"
defensive prod into the off side. All very regulation from Broad in that over
"<B>crashed through the covers!</B> Curran changes the angle to come round the wicket, but that's right in his arc, a thumping bottom-handed biff!"
"there's that saunter across the stumps again, picking off the angle into the stumps and helping it round the corner"
"bottom-handed thump to mid-off, getting right underneath the full length"
"over the wicket now, full once more, punched back to the bowler in his followthrough"
nudged off the legs once more
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"driven, but with no intent, a scuffed under-edge flaps into the leg side, as Broad aims full and fuller again"
"on the legs, nudged firmly to midwicket"
"tight lines from just back of a length, fenced off the back foot to the on-side"
"good delivery, tail into the front pad, full once more, and just about squeezed away off an inside edge"
"<B>short and wide, that's loose from Broad</B>. Marsh was just starting to feel the pressure with a complex field, lacking a point to encourage the drive. But that was a freebie"
"right up to the toes once again, pushed back down the line. That will be <B>tea</B>."
"<strong>bouncer</strong> first up, he's under it easily"
bouncer again and Smith half ducks half pulls at it? Odd shot as it flies over his head
short ball angled down the leg side
"good length, fifth stump line, he leaves this alone"
<strong>pulls in the air but it falls safe</strong> well short of deep square. He checked the shot. Awkward stroke. Not advisable against Archer's bounce
"87mph, good length, fourth stump line, he defends on the front foot"
"84mph, angled into off, he works this from the back foot forward of square"
<strong>lovely drive through cover-point.</strong> Over-pitched and he leans out and drives superbly placing it square of cover
"angled down leg, comes off pad and rolls behind square"
"86mph, half volley, leg stump, clipped firmly to deep square"
"87mph, good length, fourth stump, he plays a textbook forward defence"
"back of a length, outside off, he dabs this away to a gap behind point"
"88mph, full outside off, he drives handsomely to mid off"
"high bouncer, he shapes to pull but wisely ducks"
"86mph, good length, fifth stump line, he pushes hard with hands to cover"
thumping cover drive but straight to the man. Lovely shot but picked out Buttler
"another bouncer, 87mph, he ducks easily under it"
"87mph, shorter length, it climbs at Marsh, he stands tall to knock it down to point"
"good length, 84mph, back of a length, he's back and defending"
<strong>half volley and caressed through the gap at cover.</strong> You could call that a gift. A long half volley. He's faced tougher underarms than that
"shorter length, outside off, he's back and across defending into midwicket"
"84mph, bouncer, too high, he ducks under. Barely dropping his head"
"<strong>bouncer</strong>, 83mph, short over leg stump and he ducks again"
"85mph, full yorker on middle, he gets the front leg out of the way and digs it out"
"86mph, back of a length, wide of off, he's happy to leave"
"full toss, shin high, he blocks this towards mid on. It surprised him a touch at 85mph"
"good length, 91mph, fifth stump line, he leaves again"
"<strong>caught at fine leg!</strong> A huge error from Marsh. It was short into the ribs, he played a pull shot but it wasn't awkward or hurried, he just helped it on it's way but got a top edge and it carried straight to Leach at fine leg. He did not have to move! Marsh will be kicking himself. Archer has four of five"
"<strong>huge appeal for LBW</strong>, not out is the call. Sliding down. No review. He shuffled back and across to a full ball fired in but might have got a tickle on it. It looked leg side anyway"
"86mph, back of a length on off, he's back and hurried in defence"
"half volley, Smith crunches this wide of mid off and Broad makes a wonderful diving save"
"77mph, back of a length angled across, he looks like he has a week to defend this"
"swinging down the leg side, 76mph, he got too far across to tuck this to fine leg and missed out"
"79mph, short attempted bouncer but it ballooned off the surface wide of off"
"good length, 79mph, wide of off, tempting but Smtih doesn't get tempted"
"<strong>dropped by Root at first slip!</strong> Wow! Short and wide, extra bounce, he tried to upper cut, gets a thick edge, it goes high to Root's right, Stokes sticks left arm up and it might have put Root off at first, he gets two hands two it but can't haul it in!"
"good length, wide of off, he leaves this alone"
"shorter length, angled well down leg and Paine lets it pass"
"90mph short ball, he pulls, but goes from high to low to get it down along the ground to deep square"
"back of a length, off stump, he's back and defending"
"good bouncer, 89mph, he ducks under it well enough"
bouncer down the leg side and it takes off! Too high for Bairstow and it's called wides as it runs to the boundary
"another good bumper, over off stump, he drops the knees and sways inside the line"
"<strong>huge LBW shout</strong> given not out. Swinging down leg. Classic left arm inswinger to a right hander, he fell over, it swung into the front pad but was swinging down leg"
"back of a length, on off, he defends from the crease with the full face"
"back of a length, 81mph, he stands up on the back foot and punches to mid off with no timing"
"80mph, length ball on leg stump, he's back and clipping this straight to midwicket"
"fuller length, 81mph, fourth stump line with some shape back in, he pushes on the front foot to mid off"
"<strong>play and miss</strong> outside off. Good length angled across, it nips away, he played for the shape back, fending on the front foot, it beats the edge"
"86mph, back of a length, <strong>a little leading edge trying to work to leg, it pops up but lands safely on the off side</strong>. That was a mistake"
"beaten by a beauty, angled in and straightening, fourth stump, going just past the edge who plays inside the line. Smith gives him a nod"
"shorter length outside off, he pushes off the back foot, 90mph, bat away from body"
"87mph, back of a length on off, he's back and across working this to midwicket"
"back of a length, 91mph, he stands in behind it and defends with the full face"
bouncer sprayed well down the leg side and Smith has no interest
"82mph, good length, on off, no swing, he defends half forward"
"<strong>beaten</strong>, 84mph, fuller, hinting to shape in, pitches and seams away, he missed it by miles"
"80mph, back of a length, he punches off the back foot with no timing to mid off"
"<strong>caught behind!</strong> Way too good. 82mph full, hinting to shape in again, but again it pitches and goes with the angle, he got sucked into the drive, gets a thin edge and Bairstow takes a simple catch"
"<strong>Plumb LBW!</strong> Curran on a hat-trick! Cummins <strong>reviews</strong>. If he hasn't hit it, he is plumb. Full swinging down the line, hit on the shin. No bat. Ball tracking has it smashing middle and leg halfway up"
"low full toss, attempted yorker outside off, he opened the face and ran it through the vacant gully for four! Crowd got excited but it was too full and off target"
<strong>short and wide and cut away with ease!</strong> 86mph but in the hitting zone. He stood tall and placed it through backward point
"short lifting ball, he stands up to defend, it drops down on the leg side but he didn't know where it had gone"
"good length, top of off, he's back and defending"
<strong>steered between second and gully along the ground!</strong> Not sure he meant to get it that fine but we was trying to get it wide of gully. He opened the face to run the full ball to third man
"good length outside off, he defends into cover"
"good length, fourth stump he defends on the front foot"
"good length, top of off, he's back and defending"
"good length top of off, 78mph, he's covering the stumps and defending again"
half an appeal for LBW but it pitched outside leg and Smith got an inside edge onto pad while defending
"good length, shaping in, 82mph, he's back and defending this from middle stump"
<strong>beaten</strong> hanging his bat at a length ball that nipped away wide of off
"82mph, bouncer, he ducks underneath it comfortably"
"86mph, good length, outside off, he leaves this alone"
"85mph, full and swinging down leg, Bairstow can't glove it cleanly and they get a bye as it bounces away"
"good length, 87mph, wide of off he flashes and misses trying to square drive off the back foot"
"<strong>87mph, bouncer,</strong> a good one, outside off, he has to lean back and sway inside the line and drop his hands"
"87mph, short ball, he gets in an awkward spot half ducking, half playing but runs it off the face wide of gully"
"87mph, good length on middle, he gets a thick inside edge to fine leg"
"82mph, good length, angled across him wide of off, he leaves"
"81mph, good length, shaping in, on off, he defends off the inside half of the bat to forward square"
"81mph, full shaping into middle, he clips this to square midwicket"
full and swinging into the pads but an appeal is in hope rather than genuine optimism. Swinging too far
"angled across, 78mph, going the other way, he covers it through and defends it well enough"
another appeal for LBW but again it's doing too much and swinging down leg
"drifting in, 53mph, he works this off the front foot to midwicket"
"flatter and shorter, he's back and exposing off stump to cu through cover, they take on the deep sweeper for two, Siddle is stretching at the non striker's but getting there"
"tossed up outside off, he reaches out and drives inside out through cover-point to the sweeper"
"tossed up, on middle, he defends on the front foot"
"flatter, not much bounce, he's back and pushing to cover"
"tossed up, on off, he strides forward and defends with the full face"
"swinging into leg stump, he clips this nicely wide of fine leg but timed it too well to get two. Jofra raced in and threw a rocket back to Bairstow"
"82mph, back of a length, wide of off, he's happy to leave"
"fuller, 80mph, shaping in he drives handsomely to mid off"
<strong>beaten</strong> by one that angled in and straightened a touch off the seam. Just past the edge as he defended from the crease
"85mph, attempted yorker, he gets it on the full, pushing through point for a single"
<strong>play and miss</strong> trying to upper cut over the slips! Smith is annoyed at himself
"dipping into the toes from round the wicket, and blocked"
"fully forward, head over the ball"
chiselled out to the leg side as Leach plugs away on a probing length
crunched back to the bowler as Siddle leans forward in defence
"solidly blocked, line, length, areas"
"defended once again, tidy over to the tailender"
"he's walked across his stumps and <strong>Smith has missed a straight one!</strong> STEVEN SMITH HAS MISSED A STRAIGHT ONE! Oh my word ... a perfectly reasonable off-stump angled delivery, pretty innocuous if truth be told, but it did little enough not to bounce over the top as the master momentarily muddled his calculations. Would have crashed into middle and leg, two-thirds up. And well, crikey. England have a golden opportunity now!"
"lovely delivery to greet the new man! Back of a length, nipping just a touch before it reached Lyon, then curling past the edge. This is getting interesting"
"width, hard hands, airborne for a while but wide of gully ... every run counts"
"nip on a good length, shaping into the pads, Woakes has his tail up, understandably"
worked to the leg side with a tuck off the toes
"he's trying too hard now... too much width on a full length, and a kitchen-sink square drive fizzes to the rope. Four-balls abound for the leaky Woakes, but that was a ... moment"
"back of a length, rising into the splice at 85.8mph. A sharp loosener that Siddle plops at his feet"
"a loose-wristed, flashy drive along the ground through the covers. Good intent from the tail, chipping away at the deficit, clawed back on the edge of the rope"
"up on the toes, that's well played as Archer bends his back on the short ball, outside off"
tucked into the leg side as Archer strays onto the pads
"leaning back for the uppercut, but can't make contact on a feisty lifter"
"down on one knee for a hopeful drive, not quite there for the shot"
"open-faced crash out to deep cover, Siddle is showing excellent intent to whittle away the deficit. Full again from Woakes"
nudged to the leg side
"standing tall on the drive, 83mph from Woakes, which isn't much sharper than Curran. Mid-on gathers"
"fired down the leg-side, can't connect on that one"
"back of a length, and <B>big nip off the seam</B>. Too short to snag the edge, but looked dramatic"
"<B>yee-har!</B> Lyon thought that was in his slot, and had a wipe. It, err, wasn't"
"sharp and angling into the pads, a leading edge out to that man in the covers"
"back of a length, shaping towards off, and solidly blocked on the back foot"
"yorker, full, straight and 87mph. Well dug out with a stab of the toe of the bat"
"<B>times the pants off a square drive!</B> Just a fraction too much width, and just full enough to reward a fling of the arms. Lovely intent"
"a wildly predictable bouncer. <B>Drive that, sunshine! </B>Siddle doesn't. But he does duck"
"back on that probing length, targetting the off stump, and duly blocked"
beaten on the back foot as Lyon plays over the top of a cramped punch
wide enough to play inside the line as Woakes finds more nip off the seam
"<B>pumped on the up, over mid-off!</B> Deep in the crease, anticipating the bouncer, so Lyon makes a virtue of his weight being back in the crease, and swings for the hills with oodles of bottom hand!"
a more conventional tail-end mow across the line. Siddle has a word...
"<B>spanked over square leg for six!</B> Woakes fires in the short ball, Lyon knew it was coming, and raises his front leg like a right-handed, tailended Lara to deposit him into the stands!"
"right behind the line this time, and pressed back down the pitch"
"opens the face on a full-length delivery, pushed with composure into the gap at point"
"short, sharp, fizzing down the leg side, Bairstow does well to reach it with a dive"
"<B>clattered through the covers!</B> Stand-and-deliver stuff from Lyon, like a less demonstrative Darren Gough at Sydney. Clearing the feet, freeing the hands, spanging it like a forehead with a frying pan"
"sharper from Archer, as you'd imagine, and zipping through to the keeper"
"short, pulled, top-edged, swirling to Leach ... who <B>drops it!</B> He made good ground, eyes on the ball, and actually had the ball under control until his elbows wrecked everything. And that is Archer's five-for gone for the moment..."
short again.Siddle decides discretion etc ... and ducks
"outside leg, Lyon climbs into a sweep, but can't connect properly"
"swept again, a defensive line to the aggressive Lyon. Backward square tidies up and they take the single"
"swept again, to backward square again. Measured so far in this over"
"another sweep, the fourth in a row. Bairstow intercepts with a shimmy"
"yep, you guessed it, a sweep, straight to the man on the 45, who gathers well to prevent the single"
"six sweeps out of six, and Archer at fine leg does the needful"
"<B>beautiful yorker!</B> Archer reaches into his ODI box of tricks, a perfect little doodlebug of a knuckleball, 20mph off his top pace, fingers hidden behind the seam as if switching off the motors to glide to its target, and crashes into the off stump, right on the creaseline, to complete a richly deserved five-for! Lyon had no answer whatsoever, but that was a superb counterattacking cameo that has eaten into a dangerous deficit"
"banged in short, fenced to slip, and <B><strike>dropped</strike> by Root!</B> Bafflement all round. Did that hit the grille, no? The glove... straight off the nose either way, and first slip was completely wrong-footed. Nope, grille it was, even though the run was given."
"attempted yorker, but fired past the leg stump this time"
"nip off the seam, sharp and straight, into Siddle's thighpad"
"<B><I>outstanding</I> snaffle from Burns in the gully!</B> That is stunning, reminiscent of Stokes at Trent Bridge in 2015! Full length to his right, stretching so low that he was almost reaching behind him by the time it reached him. Pace does the trick for the tail once more, as Archer leads England off with his second six-for of the series!"
"sharp from the outset with a phalanx of slip fielders chirping away. Short and rising over the stumps, as Burns lifts his arms high out of harm's way"
"<B>fierce from Cummins, and Burns wears this on the shoulder!</B> His first instinct was to rise with the bounce, but he chose to bail out, and it pings over the keeper for runs!"
"<B>crashes into the grille!</B> That is <I>savage!</I>. Short, straight, steaming in towards the armpit, and it looks like a deflection off the top hand too. Wade at short leg is very much in business if this is Cummins' mood. The physio is out for the mandatory check-up but Burns seems fine. England won't mind the time being taken out of this mini-session either..."
"short again, but wide enough this time for Burns to sway calmly inside the line"
too wide to tempt anything. Burns happily accepts the sighter as Paine leaps in front of first slip to gather
"what an over. This one is just back of a length, fizzing past a vertical bat as Burns just about plays inside the line. Now then Denners. What's it to be at the other end? There could be a Test career at stake in the twilight here..."
"full and probing, shaping in towards the stumps as Denly brings out his best and most vertical defensive push"
"on the back foot, hops back and across to block"
"outside off, and <B>that's jagged away wickedly</B>. Denly is lured with hard hands and gets away with it"
"head over the ball, lining it up on off stump, then removing the bottom hand as if to confirm his calibration. That's alright, don't want to be playing at anything wider though.."
"blocked down into the crease, solid in defence once more"
"shaping into the pads, solid contact from Denly as he flicks towards Wade at a very deep short leg. A maiden to open Hazlewood's account"
"fuller length for the moment, but not full as such, as Burns raises his gloves high as the ball passes outside off"
"short, sharp, ducked. Three slips and a gully watch with intent"
"outside off, whistling through to the keeper, but a wide enough line for Burns to leave well alone"
"full and fast, and this time Burns has to play or lose his off pole! Driven uncomfortably back to the bowler, but that's watchful from Burns"
"outside off, back of a length, Burns leaves with relief"
"round the wicket now, and that's another fine bouncer! Hunting Burns's scone as he leans inside the line, watching it all the way. Gosh. This is an examination, but Burns is doing the needful. Six more balls tonight... at the most"
"firm hands, pressing forward to meet that probing line and length. Three slips and two gullies await"
"firm in defence on off stump, right under Denly's eyeline. Solid"
"<B>edged, and dropped!</B> My word, that was the line that gets Denly in so much strife, Outside his eyeline, back of a length, a firm-handed push, and it's crashed into Harris's fingers at the first of the the two gullies. He didn't pick it up at all in the fading light, and it's ripped the webbing too! Harris leaves the field, and Denly stays!"
"banged in short, Burns ducks"
"back of a length, flicked off the pads, out to the leg side, precious runs as Burns manages to sneak it out of the reach of leg gully"
"<B>huge appeal</B> and surely that's outside leg! No, <strong>Dharmasena's finger is up!</strong> Oh wow... <strong>Burns reviews</strong> ... but Hazlewood was adamant, the celebrappeal tipped the balance, I suspect. And it is a good six inches outside leg... Oh dear... and with that, it's <B>stumps!</B>"
"angled into leg, he clips this nicely off the pads just past short leg and away for a couple"
"86mph, good length, top of off, he defends on the front foot"
"87mph, too full and he <strong>drives very neatly with just a push straight of mid off!</strong> Lovely shot from Denly. That will boost his confidence"

"fuller on middle, he checks a drive with good timing to mid on"

"bouncer, 81mph, down leg, he ducks under it easily"
"87mph, good length, top of middle, he defends from the crease pushing to mid off"
<strong>cut up and over backward point!</strong> Good shot. Short and wide and he deliberately lifted the cut up and over backward point. Nicely put away
"good length, wide of off, he leaves this alone"
"good length, top of off, he defends taking the bottom hand off the bat"
"short, into the ribs, he turns his back and cops it on the back, it runs behind square for a leg bye. No shot offered but the run counts because it is evasive action"
"short lifting ball outside off, he leaves this getting his gloves above his head"
"fuller and wider and shaping away, he leaves"
"yorker length on off, he digs it out to mid on"
"82mph, good length, angled into the top of off, he defends on the front foot from the crease"
"86mph, good length, fourth stump line, he gets a thick inside edge onto pad and it rolls away"
"good length, wide of off, he's happy to leave"
"83mph, <strong>beaten</strong> by a ball that nips away sharply and bounces past the edge"
"good length, 87mph, wide of off, he leaves this time"
"back of a length, on off, he is squared up getting a thick edge that runs along the ground to gully"
"shorter length, 85mph, on middle, he's back and turning this on the bounce to short leg"
"short ball, down the leg side, he gets the gloves out of the way and Paine flies like Superman to take it one handed on the stretch"
"back of a length, 86mph, top of off, he is defending from the crease"
"<strong>fabulous check drive straight of cover!</strong> Fuller length, he gets a great stride forward and trasfers the weight, punching it straight of cover with superb timing"
"89mph, short ball, outside off, he is late trying to withdraw the bat, it comes off the bottom edge and drops down well away from the stumps"
"88mph, cracking bouncer, angled in, he does well to drop to one knee and sway under it"
"84mph, back of a length, it jags sharply away and he prods and misses"
"88mph, <strong>beaten again</strong> playing the wrong line as it climbs from a length wide of off"
"back of a length, 87mph, angled into off, he defends from the crease"

"86mph, good length, wide of off, he leaves comfortably"
"85mph, good length angled across wide of off, he leaves"
"88mph <strong>bouncer</strong>, he sees it early and gets underneath it"
"back of a length, 88mph, middle stump, he's back and pushing this to mid on"
"<strong>short lifter,</strong> 89mph, he drops the gloves inside the line"

"83mph, good length, angling in, he defends on the front foot pushing it firmly to mid on"
"84mph, good length outside off, he pushes away from his pad, gets a <strong>thick inside edge</strong> but it falls short of short leg"
"fuller on off, 86mph, he mistimes a drive but can't quite beat the diving mid off. Wade was very wide and had to move swiftly"
"87mph, good length, fourth stump, he pushes at it, slicing it to backward point"
"tossed up, he goes back, it slides on, he jams the bat down and squirts it behind square"
"tossed up, he skips down and drags a drive to mid on along the ground"
"tossed up outside off, he clips it with the turn to midwicket"
"looped up wide of off, not much turn this time, he pushes off a thick outside edge to backward point"
<strong>skips down and checks a drive straight over the bowler's head!</strong> Great intent. He got down quickly and nailed it flat
<strong>skips down again and launches this all the way straight of long on!</strong> Even better shot! Got to the pitch and lofted this powerfully. They are looking to attack Lyon by the looks
"good length on middle, he defends on the front foot"
"good length, angled into middle, he defends with the angle closing the face to square leg"
pushes with hard hands getting a thick inside edge to a good length and it ricochets onto his body
"fuller on off, he drives fluently but can't beat mid on"
"over-pitched, he pushes a drive firmly placing it through cover-point, he didn't try to over hit it, just placed it nicely for three"
"back of a length on off, he covers up in defence on the crease"
"full on middle, he works it with the turn straight to short leg"
"angled down leg and spinning further down, nice take from Paine"
"56mph, good length, on off, he's back and punching this to cover"

"flatter on off, he tucks it to midwicket"
"flatter on middle, he skips out and pushes firmly at it away from his pad"

"short of a length, 85mph, he defends pushing away from his body to point"
"back of a length, into leg, he misses out trying to tuck it square and was taken on the thigh guard"
<strong>over-pitched and driven magnificently straight down the ground!</strong> What a way to bring up the first <strong>50-run opening stand of the series!</strong> Genuine half volley and he crunched it with the full face
"good length, fourth stump line, he defends half forward into the off side"
"tossed up on middle, he closes the face but the leading edge runs safely to point"
"fuller on middle, he whips this through square leg to the sweeper"
"<strong>caught behind!</strong> Short and wide ball does the trick for Lyon! It was a drag down, Burns rocked back to cut hard, it stayed down a touch and he got a bottom edge, Paine stayed low to take an excellent catch. Didn't Australia and Nathan Lyon need that."
"full on leg, he reaches out and works this neatly with the turn through midwicket for a couple"
"higher and fuller, he works this squarer but not with as much timing to get a single"
"shorter on leg, he's back and working this behind square"
"86mph, good length, but well wide of off, he leaves this alone"
"86mph, fuller length outside off, he pushes on the front foot to mid off"
"good length, fourth stump, he's squared up a touch getting a thick edge that runs into the gully"
"<strong>bouncer</strong>, 82mph, over leg stump and he ducks"
"84mph, good length, fifth stump line, he leaves this alone"
"good length, off stump, he leans forward and defends"
"back of a length, punched into the off side"
"banged in short, Denly ducks as the ball flies through. Seems a touch quicker today, all this sun has gone to the turf's head"
good carry once more as Denly leaves alone on a fifth-stump line
"shoulders arms once again, Cummins pounding away outside off, but Denly isn't being drawn outside his eyeline today"
"fenced down into the cordon, riding the bounce with enough of an angled bat to send the ball downwards"
"banged in short again, and Denly ducks as the ball slides over the shoulder"
"outside off, line and length, no stroke offered"
"<B>slashed up and over the cordon!</B> That's entirely deliberate from Root, flicking his wrists into a belated uppercut and getting plenty on the ball to send it soaring over the slips. England's intent this morning has been top-notch"
"good riposte, tight line and fuller length, cramping Root into a hurried inside-edged block"
"back of a length, wider line, easily left alone with high hands"
"over-pitched, a bit floaty on an off-stump line, and Root clunks into a solid drive into the gap in the covers"
"tighter, fuller, shaping back towards off stump, and Root squares up in steadfast defence"
firmly forward and pushed into the covers
"compact in defence once more. New fatherhood has given Denly a new resolve. That, and a goober of a dropped catch last night, of course..."
forced into the off side with a jab of the bat
"pushed back into the crease, 85mph from Cummins as the ball curls into a defensive block on off stump"
"width, and cracked with greedy intent through the covers! He didn't quite time it, though the shot was definitely on. Cover tidies up with a chase inside the rope"
"<B>squelch!</B> Cummins goes up a gear and clatters Denly in the knackers. Ouch. Root is tittering at the non-striker's end, as the crowd groans after watching the replay on the big screen. Down on his knees, and taking a moment or two, as well you might... he'll live. And he's done his breeding for this year anyway!"
"<B>edged! And short of first slip!</B> Very soft hands from Root, though it was a genuine nibble. Good areas ..."
dabbed to the off side and through they jog
"outside off, Denly shoulders arms with due reference"
"on the back foot, flicked to the leg side"
shaping in towards the stumps and thumps the pad-flap. No appeal as that was clearly high. But good movement through the air on a challenging length
head right over the ball to block solidly back up the pitch
"angled bat, into the off side, Cummins stalks back to his mark with the look of a man not getting his Just Desserts"
"slightly leg-sided, in the slot for a casual tap off the legs to midwicket"
"crunching drive! High-elbowed elegance, into the covers, but gathered well with a tumble"
banged in short as Cummins bends his back once more. Denly ducks
"<B>in that channel outside off, and an inside-edge ensues!</B> There's that vulnerability once again, outside the eyeline and unsure of his alignment. Cummins nips it off the seam, and it fizzes over the stumps and away through fine leg"
more solid in defence on the front foot
"two slips and a gully as he starts with a probing delivery on a full length, just a hint of shape away from a defensive prod"
"tailing into the toes, and <strong>clipped sweetly through midwicket!</strong> That's a freebie."
"outswing, and <B>indecision!</B> Met with a solid drive into the covers, England run on the stroke alone, but Wade at mid-off pounces well to send them scurrying back as the shy comes in at the non-striker's end"
just the beginnings of movement through the air as Root blocks
"in the channel outside off, and <B>Root is beaten!</B> That was seam rather than swing, jumping past the outside edge"
"very full, attacking the pads, and Root stabs his bat down in defence. Decent over"
"good start, as Siddle hits a good length, nips it back off the seam, and strikes the thigh pad"
"full and probing, that's the length for Siddle. Denly walks into a defensive block back down the pitch"
<B>open-faced drive!</B> Deliberately steered through third man as Siddle offered just enough width on that full length. Leaky
"over-compensates with one that tails into the toes, but a firmly timed clip is gathered at short midwicket"
"advancing to the pitch, slightly scuffs an aggressive drill through the covers. Clear intent, but wants to be careful..."
"more jag off the seam on a good length, thumps the pad again"
"leaning forward to drive into the off-side, a bit of outswing to contend with"
"on the legs, straightens a touch as Root mistimes his clip to midwicket"
"outside off, back of a length, driven to the off side, just placed into the covers with a wave of the bat"
"worked to the leg side, another single to the cause"
"head over the ball, blocking out the intruder. England's milking of the change bowlers, and their brief pounding of Lyon, has been very impressive today"
"up on the toes, stroked past point as Marsh offers enough width to free the hands. Another trouble-free four-run over"
"sitting back in the crease, prodded back down the pitch"
"caught in two minds this time, as Denly tries to rock back but ends up squeezing a back-of-a-length delivery back down the pitch"
"drilled off the back foot again, but good lift from a fullish length cramps the stroke"
"defended with a vertical bat, right back in the crease. Denly's approach has changed a touch since that inside-edge, just a touch reticent for the moment"
"hurried into a push to point, leaning belatedly onto the front foot"
back and across to see off the full length once more
"leaning forward, pushed into the off side"
"<strong>edged and gone!</strong> That's a big, big moment and it's changed the mood of this morning's session. Playing for the turn but this one slides on a touch, kisses the edge and fizzes into the hands of Smith at slip. England remain in a strong position, but it's the opening that Australia so desperately needed."
solidly onto the front foot
"head over the ball, pressed back to the bowler"
"full face once more, guided to mid-on with a big stride to the pitch"
"hustled a touch on a fuller length! Straightening towards the left-hander's off stump, and requiring a late adjustment. Good over for Lyon, but England won't necessarily mind seeing spin playing a role..."
fired past the leg stump
"full and straight, compact in defence on the front foot, walking into the stroke"
"tight lines, full length, Denly squares up in defence. Lunch will doubtless be on his mind now"
"attacking the front pad, but without the appreciable shape that he was getting in the first innings. Stabbed to cover"
"nip back into the body, a waft of the bat as the ball deviates, and the ball somehow ends up in the cordon. Close to the inside edge, but looked like a deflection off the body only"
"firmly onto the front foot, guiding the ball back down the track."
"round the wicket, fired into Stokes' pads, and a deflection past the lurking short leg"
solidly onto the front foot
"nudged back down the pitch, using his feet to stay positive as the break approaches"
"solid clunk of willow as Denly places his bat in the line of the ball, on middle and leg"
"squeezed uppishly to mid-on, half a thought of running on the misfield. Not happening"
"pushed back onto the stumps, slight alarm as the ball wriggles down into the crease, but that's safe enough. And that's <B>lunch</B>."
"good length, 86mph, top of off, he leans forward and defends on the front foot"
"86mph, good length, angled across off, he leaves comfortably"
"87mph, full on leg stump, he tries to whip but it comes of pad and rolls away for a leg bye"

"87mph, fuller angled into off, he drives firmly towards mid off"
"87mph, over-pitched wide of off, <strong>he leans forward and rives nicely through cover and he timed it well enough!</strong> Nice stroke"

"drifting in, good length, sliding on, he defends with soft hands on the front foot"
"nice shape and loop, he strides forward and defends"
"tossed up, he drives firmly to mid off who is deep and they get one"

"full on off, he drives but mistimes it, dragging it to midwicket"
"back of a length, 86mph, top of off, he's back and forcing this to mid off"
"<strong>pulls in the air, not in control, but it's short of deep square</strong>. It bounced well short of Lyon on the rope. It was banged in, he pulled decisively but didn't nail it, and it bounced short of the man on the rope"
"angled into off, he drives on the up with the angle to mid on"
<strong>skips down and lofts beautifully inside out with the spin over mid off!</strong> Superb batting
"flatter on off, he leans out and defends with the full face"
"<strong>rips past the edge!</strong> Good length, he went back and it spins and bounces sharply. Might have disturbed the surface a touch"
"<strong>dropped by Smith at slip!</strong> Sharp chance. Not that short, he gave room to cut, got a thick edge that flew to Smith chest high but it burst through the hands! Really tough. It flew at pace. They stick or they don't and it didn't. Lyon drops his head. He had Stokes dropped at slip on 33 at Headingley too. Another tough one"

"flatter wide of off, he cuts and <strong>Labuschagne dives straight over it!</strong> The old Sydney Harbour bridge. It races away"
"<strong>thumping sweep shot!</strong> Drifting into leg, he got down on one knee and smoked it flat forward of square! No one is out there. It was hit so hard the cameras didn't see it go for six!"

"outside off, swinging across the left-hander and no stroke offered"
"standing firm on the back foot, pressed out to short cover with a vertical bat"
"very full, nibbling away from middle stump to off. Soft-handed prod down into the crease"
"on the back foot, solid defence into the covers and a well-judged single to keep things ticking"
leaning onto the front foot and blocked to the off side
"very full,  wobbling on a good length from round the wicket and blocked"
"wider line, a bit of turn out of the rough but easily ignored"
"tossed up into the pads, nudged with intent to midwicket for the single"
"back of a length, tucked off the pads past short leg"
"fuller, straighter, gripping just a touch from the pitch on off stump, but solidly fenced to safety off the back foot"
"compact drive, to mid-off"
"back of a length, pulled round the corner and <strong>there's a bit of bat on this</strong> as it deflects off the pad flap behind square. Tantalising for Paine as he sprints round, but lands safe"
"tailing into the toes, clipped to the on side"
"back of a length, enough width to free the hands. <strong>Pounded behind square through third man!</strong>"
"angled to the leg side, tucked compactly off the toes"
"full and straight, into the pads, defended to mid-on"
"sliding into the pads, tucked very fine, and very sweetly to the shortest corner of the ground. <strong>Denly marches onwards</strong>"
"better line, looped onto a good length outside off and drawing a down-on-one-knee block"
"head right over the ball, hands out in front of the pad, pressed back to the bowler"
"outside off, rising off the deck and punched uppishly to point"
"striding onto the front foot, and gathered at short cover"
"<B>inside-out slog, and sliced over mid-off!</B> Heart-in-mouth time for Denly, the ball gripped the deck as the bat heaved through the line, and Marsh back-pedalling couldn't get a finger to it!"
"outside off, shaping away, Stokes lines it up and lets it go"
"<B>massive appeal for lbw, and this looks quite tight!</B> Stokes was on the rampage, and walked right across his stumps, but the line was tight and the ball crashed into his hello-sailored back leg... a long way down...  <b>missing off,</b> says the replay. But Australia don't review"
solidly into line
"opens the face for another stolen brace through the cordon, Australia's fielders getting the run-around"
"punched into the off side, gathered with a slide by Cummins"
"left alone outside off, on a rising line through to the keeper"
"round the wicket, tasty knee-high full-bunger, and Stokes channels the spirit of the World Cup final, 49.6th delivery, to dink to mid-on rather than launch it for glory"
leaning forward to block
smothered on the front foot once more
"over the wicket, a wristy drive into the covers"
"round the wicket, a hint of grip from the footholes, and blocked on the back foot"
"big appeal for caught at short leg, or lbw, or something, as Stokes reverse-sweeps. But nope, nothing doing"
"a bit of conventional swing, curling in on a full length"
"standing tall in defence once more, solid and defiant"
"punched with hard hands back through the line of the ball, Hazlewood sticks out a boot to intercept"
"angled into the off side, and pressed to cover"
"full face, back down the line of the ball"
"tailing in, on a full length, firmly fenced back down the pitch"
"a hint of over-spin as the ball leaps into Stokes' back-foot block, out of the rough"
"<B>rips through the gate, and over the top of leg!</B> Can't do much about that, except that Stokes was playing across the line. But Denly at the other end might like the sight of that..."
"back and across, working with the spin this time"
"flicked to the on-side, a sharp single, Wade's shy comes in ... and<B> Paine can't gather!</b> Direct hit would have been tight..."
"nurdled off the legs, into the gap at midwicket"
"flicked off the toes, out through square leg. Lots to ponder in that over ... much of it for Australia themselves, you suspect. This lead is starting to get daunting"
flipped off the legs out to deep square leg
"reaching on the drive outside off, not quite timed"
"more of Hazlewood's trademark tail back into the stumps, Denly squares up in defence on the back foot"
"back of a length, attempted honk through the leg side, Denly's feeling limber now, but doesn't quite connect on this one"
"round the wicket, tailing away, Stokes feels for the ball and under-edges into his pads. Well bowled"
"crashed hard out through the covers, a long chase from the substitute Bancroft, in pads too, as he's in business at short leg, but a good dive cuts off the boundary"
nudged off the toes to the leg side
"<B>smoked into the stands!</B> Marching to the pitch of the ball, out comes the golf swing over long-on, and up comes Stokes' fifty!"
"on the legs, tucked square"
"ooh, <B>bites the glove</B>... sharp lift off the deck, Stokes was feeling for the ball, and Bancroft can't quite reach it..."
"clip to the leg side, and <B>a direct hit would be out!</B> It's a poor shy from Wade though, and the moment is lost... Stokes living dangerously all of a sudden!"
"blotted down into the crease, to end an eventful over"
"immediate intent from Stokes, galloping to the pitch and blocking into the covers"
"dabbed into the off side, fully forward once more"
"rolls the fingers on a fuller length, Denly defends as the ball loops up off the bat and pad"
"well bowled, that's Denly's Achilles heel, outside his eyeline, and drawing a reflexive stab when he could have left alone"
<strong>that's a freebie! </strong> Siddle just hasn't been at the races this Test. No pressure building up as he strays onto those pads and gets flicked insouciantly through midwicket
"<B>edged, but short of Paine!</B> Golly, it's all happening. Siddle gets back on that straight and narrow, kisses the edge of a tentative poke, but there's not enough pace on this ageing ball (ageing seamer...) to reach the keeper!"
"round the wicket, into the rough again, tucked to the leg side. Marnus is keeping things lively at his end"
"advancing to the pitch, thumps the pad, speculative appeal, Labuschagne doesn't reckon he played a shot, and he's probably got a point. But on we go"
"pounded over the leg side, keeps deep midwicket in business for a while, but doesn't carry"
tucked off the legs as Denly advances to the pitch too
"full toss ... <strong>Denly's diet is a full-on buffet now!</strong> Chooses his spot wisely, a compact punch back past the bowled and through long-on"
pitches way outside leg and no appeal this time
dabbed to the off side
"standing tall in defence, pushed into the covers"
"round the wicket, probing around the top of off stump, but a soft-handed block into the covers ensues from Stokes. Milky"
"firmly pressed to cover, as Siddle probes away on a better line now"
"<B>firmly struck on the drive!</B> That's Denly's danger area maybe, but his confidence is flowing as he strides out of the crease, and places the ball though point"
enthusiastic appeal from  behind the wicket but Siddle isn't interested. Sliding down and a hint of bat too
"round the wicket, big turn down the leg side, fenced behind square as it goes"
"outside leg, Denly isn't interested as he pats it away with his backside"
"well bowled, drifting across the right-hander, and taking the leading edge as he elects to play on a leg-stump line"
"outside leg, backsided-away again..."
"back and across, watchfully patted out to cover, deep in the crease"
"tossed up way outside leg, Denly sticks out a boot, and that will be <B>tea</B>"
"81mph, good length, angled in but it's a fourth stump line, he leaves wisely"
"good length, 85mph, angled into off, he defends on the front foot"
"nearly squeezed through. Good length, tailing back, inside edge onto pad as he's half forward"
"85mph, good length, angled into off, he gets it off the thick inside half of the bat to square leg"
"85mph, good length, he drives on the up to mid off"
"good length, wide of off, he leaves on the front foot"
"tossed up, on off, he drives back to the bowler"
"drifting outside off, he leans out and defends to cover"
<strong>advances and pounds a drive straight of mid off!</strong> Great footwork. He got down to the pitch and with a full swing hammered it along the ground straight of mid off
"shorter length, he's back and working neatly behind square"
"flatter sliding into middle, he's back and tucking it to short leg"
"arm ball, fired into off at 59mph, he's back and defending"
"84mph back of a length outside off, he's back and guiding this with an open face behind point and it runs away, Lyon has a long chase but slides full length to haul it in"
"good length, top of off, he's forward to defend"
"<strong>glorious straight drive!</strong> Over-pitched, he checks a drive powerfully back past the stumps and it races away"
"short, a touch wide, he cuts but mistimes it, high on the bat, places it in the gap behind point"
"shuffles forward to an 85mph length ball, he defends on the move"
"<strong>cracking square drive!</strong> Length ball, width offered, he sets a base and slaps it through cover-point. A dismissive stroke"
"tossed up, not a lot of turn, he pushes forward and defends"
"tossed up outside of, he whips unconvincingly through forward square but finds a gap, Labuschagne is slow to come in off the rope and allows two"
"flatter on middle, he defends on the front foot"
"flighted on leg, he clips this with nice timing to deep forward square"
"<strong>another missed chance!</strong> It spun from middle, he was defending from the crease, gets a thick edge and it hits Paine's knee and bounces over Smith at slip!"
"<strong>Bowled him!</strong> Absolute cracker from Lyon. Drifts into middle and leg, spins sharply, he pushes hard down the wrong line, it rips past the outside edge and clatters into middle and off!"
"85mph, good length, top of off, he's defending on the move to cover"
"85mph, fuller length, fourth stump, he drives with the full face towards mid off"
"good length, top of off, he defends on the front foot"
"<strong>french cut!</strong> It wasn't really that close to the stumps. But a thick inside edge trying to cut, goes to fine leg"
"<strong>beaten</strong> by a beauty, angled in, nipped away, he's caught on the crease defending and it zips past the edge"
"angled down leg, it wobbles through to Paine and he cops it on the fingers and it bounces down to fine leg for byes"
"shorter length, he's back and working this to midwicket"
"<strong>shaped to paddle sweep, then made a late call to late dab on one knee!</strong> Smith was so surprised, he completely missed it at slip. They get two"
tossed up outside off he drives to mid off
"full on off, he punches back to the bowler"
"flatter, 58mph, he's back and defending from off stump"
"flatter and fired outside off, he's back and blocking this to cover"
"good length, off stump, he pushes to a gap at cover-point, easy one but he called no for some reason"
"good length, 84mph, fourth stump line, he defends towards point"
"<strong>big appeal for LBW</strong>, not out is the call. Siddle went wide of the crease, fired into leg, he missed it, hit on the knee but it was angling down. They wisely didn't review. It was missing leg by miles according to ball tracker"
"<strong>how did that not bowl him?!</strong> Wide of the crease, tailing in, it went through the gate and over leg stump! Wow! Paine couldn't glove it as it swung after pitching"
"back of a length, wide of off, tailing in, he chops a drive back to the bowler"
"<strong>caught at slip! Via Paine's thigh</strong>. Denly misses out on a maiden test ton. What a delivery. Angled in and nipping away, Paine coming up meant Denly wasn't as far forward, he got an edge prodding from the crease, it hit Paine on the right thigh and carried all the way to Smith at first slip"
"tossed up, outside off, he whips with the turn, uppishly but short of midwicket"
"tossed up, he's back and covering his stumps in defence"
"59mph, drifting across outside off, he tries to paddle sweep but is hit on the pad"
"shorter length, 55mph, he's back and tucking this to short leg on the bounce"
"59mph, flatter on off, he's back and turning this to short leg"
"looped up on leg, it spun sharply and bounced, hit the pad. There's an appeal but it is aborted. Missing leg"
"very full on off, he drives firmly to mid off"
"<strong>punched off the back foot through cover-point!</strong> Shorter length outside off, he gets up on his toes, on top of the bounce and with a vertical bat hammers it away through the gap"
"<strong>nearly a return catch but a boundary down the ground!</strong> Fuller, he checks a drive on the up, in the air, just away from Siddle's left hand and it races away. The timing was extraordinary"
"good length fourth stump line, he defends to cover"
"wide of the crease, angled into leg, he clips this easily off the pads through forward square leg, didn't nail it but picks up three"
"<strong>steered behind point on the front foot!</strong> A wide long half volley, he opened the face and steers it through the gap behind point with nice timing"
"good length, angled into off, he defends from the crease"
"83mph, angled into middle and off, he works it with control and the angle forward of square leg for a couple"
"full and tailing in from outside off, he lays into a drive and drags a drive to mid on"
"85mph, good length, fifth stump line, he's back and across and defending to cover"
"back of a length, 84mph, he <strong>plays and misses</strong> trying to punch off the back foot through cover-point"
"84mph, back of a length, wide of off, he leaves this one alone"

"83mph, shorter length, off stump, he's back and across and defending"
"good length, 87mph, tailing back close to off, he leaves on the front foot"
"wide of the crease, 84mph, back of a length angled into off, he's back and punching back to the bowler"
"85mph, fuller, he's driving, not as fair forward as he would have liked but timing it well enough, straight to mid off"
"<strong>cracking forward of point!</strong> Short and wide, he sweated on this, got in a great position and punched the cut shot forward of point."
"87mph, good length, wide of off, he leaves this alone"
"fuller, on off, he drives inside out through cover-point for a couple"
"84mph, angled down the leg side and he misses the glance"
"good length, angled into middle and off, he stays crease bound and punches this on the up to mid on"
<strong>beaten</strong> by an 84mph delivery that nipped and climbed outside off. He just fended from the crease. Would have taken some skill to nick that!
"back of a length, 87mph, he's up on his toes and punching off the back foot to point"
"good length, 80mph, tailing in, gets hit high on the thigh guard and it drops down on the off side"
"80mph, good length, top of off, he defends on the front foot"
"<strong>caught at first slip! Superb catch by Smith</strong>. The umpires get together to send the catch upstairs. Soft signal is OUT. Caught clean as a whistle. Superb catch low to his left. Bairstow is gone. Great delivery. Good length angled in, it straightens a touch, he's caught on the crease, gets an edge, it flies low to Smith who is the only slip and is standing wide, Paine dives and flings his right glove infront of Smith but he pouched it beautifully with two hands low to his left"
"back of a length, fourth stump line, he's back and across and defending"
"short ball, he pulls unconvincingly, mistiming it in the air but safely wide of midwicket for a couple"
<strong>swing and a miss</strong> driving on the up as it tails away wide of off
"flatter on middle, he's back and defending"
"<strong>magnificent cover drive!</strong> Drifting outside off, he leaned out and caressed it past cover against the turn. Timed the pants off it"
"quicker on middle, no spin, he defends from the crease"
<strong>huge LBW appeal</strong> given not out. No review. It was in line. Was it too high? Maybe. He was back on the stumps and hit high on the pad
flatter on off he defends from the crease
"fuller on off, he drives to long on"
"full and tailing into off, he gets a thick inside edge driving, it goes wide of midwicket for a couple"
"good length, top of off, he defends from the crease"
"good length, 86mph, he mistimes a drive on the up, dragging it to mid on"
"<strong>flash and miss</strong> trying to drive on the up, it tailed away wide of off"
"<strong>attempted cut but misses</strong> again, this was not that wide and not that short, a cut shot probably wasn't on"
"shorter length, he plays a back foot square drive to the sweeper on the fence"
"on the back foot, blocked back to the bowler"
"outside off, Curran thrusts out a pad, Lyon appeals for the lack of shot, but that's turning away from the timbers"
"clipped to the leg side, leaning out of the crease"
"big turn on a good length, Curran dangles the bat and doesn't get close"
leaning back to chop the quicker ball into the off side
"back and across, and punched into the off side"
"outside off, lifting off the deck, Buttler pulls his hands out of harm's way"
fired down the leg side
"angled bat, fending off the one that shapes back towards off"
"tight angles, into the pads, threatening to shape towards the cordon. Solid block on the front foot"
"back of a length, and jabbed behind square. Curran sensibly declines the single"
"sliced through point, another single"
stretching forward and defended back down the pitch
"into the legs, and clipped to midwicket"
dead-batted defence into the covers
inside-edged through the leg side
"round the wicket, dipping into the legs, flicked off the face past short leg"
"half forward, pressed back to the bowler"
"hauled through the leg side, that's good aggression from Curran, weight falling backwards but his eye is as keen as ever. A valiant dive from Lyon to no avail"
"too wide, too full, and<strong> flogged through the covers!</strong> Dropping the back knee, freeing the hands. Violence from one so small!"
"<B>slashed again, through the ring again!</B> Backward of point this time, as Curran climbs into the width. He's in one of his moods..."
punched into the covers for the single
"a good salvage on the boundary's edge as Buttler unleashes through long-on, clipping uppishly off the pads"
into line to punch back down the pitch. A productive over
"opens the face on the back foot, tapped to backward point"
"solid areas, blocked"
"bite off the deck, spinning past a compact defensive prod. This pitch is offering plenty"
"tossed up into the pads, flicked through midwicket for the single"
"defended on the back foot, pushed to the off side"
"turn past the leg stump, Paine gathers well as Buttler keeps his back foot anchored"
"banged in short, Curran senses him coming, and rocks back for a premeditated pull to backward square"
"on the legs, 84mph, fenced to midwicket for another single"
"short, leg-sided, Curran's gloves are close to the ball as it passes, but not close enough"
"<B>same line, and this time it's tickled!</B> Technically a strangle, but seeing as it was the second in a row down the leg side, you could almost call it a plan. Back of a length, Paine leaps to his right to gather, and Cummins has his first of the innings, and 28th of the series!"
"walks across his timbers,<strong> flicks through fine leg</strong>. Slightly off-line from Cummins and that races away"
"pushed back into the crease, back of a length on off this time"
"too straight first up, and Buttler flicks firmly to deep midwicket. A slip from Woakes, but they get back comfortably"
"pushed back into the crease,  but opens the face nicely on off stump to pinch the single through the cordon. Soft hands"
"whistles past a flimsy back-foot waft, a bit of curl through the air, from back of a length"
"leaning forward, solid prod to cover, line and length from Hazlewood, as ever"
"bouncer, a touch too short to trouble Woakes, who ducks"
"firmly into line, and blocked to the off side"
"zips past the outside edge, on the back foot. Good wheels at this late stage of his series' efforts"
"awkwardly into line, fending off the full length on off stump"
"wider on the crease, angled into the stumps, and fenced away"
"too full, but <B>what a shot from Buttler!</B> Width to free the hands, a big stride to the pitch, and larruped through the covers"
"nips back off the seam, tucked up on the back foot, squeezes into the cordon"
"shoulders arms outside off, tidy areas"
"short and into the ribs, tucked to the leg side, riding the bounce"
"very full, speared into the pad, pressed to cover with a closed face, playing slightly across the line there"
"<B>shot!</B> Just a waft of the bottom hand, feet already in position as if by magic. High elbow, glorious balance, and scorched to the rope!"
"opens the face on the back foot, and <B>filleted through the cordon!</B> Calculated from Buttler, he's in the mood now"
"firmly into the off side, the score is up to 300, and the lead is already more than the Headingley chase... scenes..."
stabbed into the covers
fired down the leg side
"into the pads, fenced to the leg side, as Buttler falls over in his stance, but picks himself up quickly"
"lifting into the hip, and flicked behind square"
pushed into the off side
hopping into line as Cummins zips down another back-of-a-length 86mph stump nibbler
closes the face on a shovel to the leg side. England keep ticking along
"punched off the back foot, back down the track"
"probing away on an off-stump line, just back of a length. Short cover gathers"
"back and across, shuffling in the crease in a pre-meditated fashion, and clawing a short ball from outside off as Siddle responds"
"lifting into a back-foot block, solidly behind the line"
"full and straight, fenced away with a straight bat on middle"
"poked to cover, off the back foot. Decent enough areas"
"swinging away on a wide line, no stroke there"
punched compactly into the covers to move ever closer to that fifty
"squares up on the back foot, and pushed back past the bowler"
"open face once more, worked out to point off the back foot"
"conventional outswinger, tight to off stump. Woakes shoulders arms"
"<B>screamer at second slip!</B> A wild thrash outside off from Woakes, as he chased the outswinger. It was travelling so quickly but Smith saw it all the way, leapt like a rampant salmon, and plucked a worldy in a single outstretched right hand. Think Andrew Strauss at Trent Bridge in 2005, but a mirror image. Such hang-time!"
"<B>now Buttler's gone too!</B> A top-edged pull shot, Labuschagne steams in behind square, makes good ground, and clings on inches from the ground! In its own way, every bit as good, diving forward at pace is one of the hardest catches to judge,  but he did so to perfection! Now then!"
huge cheers for a trademark back-foot block. None shall pass!
"pressing out of the crease, lining up the angles and dabbing them away"
"up on the toes, punched to the off side"
"clipped off the legs, no way through there"
"rising on the back foot, fending away the lifter"
<B>short and sharp!</B> Archer has a reflexive wipe off his eyebrows but didn't know much about that
"flicked off the legs, in the air for a while, but that won't carry to either man back on the rope. Awkward for Archer though..."
"very full, into the toes, and <B>Leach rifles it through long-on!</B> Intercepted in the deep but who cares, the crowd are loving it!"
"pushed back into the crease, Archer fends away, awkwardly but effective, bat in front of body"
"nurdled off the legs, backward of square"
"outside edge, safely through gully, and another single"
"turn out of the rough, into the left-hander, who pokes watchfully off the back foot"
"firm in defence, walking down to the pitch of the ball to negate the footholes"
"tucked off the hip, past the lurking short leg"
"short and leg sided, a gimme for the pull, but Leach can't connect with a wild swing"
"tapped to short square leg, playing with the spin once more"
"right on the money this time, ripping into the knee roll. Actually, that was a few inches short of the foot hole and still took off. Good signs for Leach who'll be aiming at similar tomorrow..."
"flinched off the hips, Archer's not enjoying the line of attack, but gets enough bat on it to ride the bounce"
"<B>throat ball!</B> That's a sizzler from Cummins at this stage of the Test. Short, tight to the body, aimed right at the bonce, and Leach flings his head out of line as his gloves take the heat"
leaning back out of harm's way as another snorter fires past
"<strong>short again, sharp again, </strong>gutsy defence from Leach, watching the ball all the way, and staying on top of the bounce"
"<strong>flinched past short leg!</strong> Bancroft got a fingertip to it, flinging himself to his left, but Leach escapes the strike and lives to fight on tomorrow"
"well played, back and across, staying right behind the line, and England push through to the close"
"beats Leach outside his off stump, defensive prod forwards and it flies past the edge"
"beaten again, Leach gets on the front foot and Lyon turns one sharply past his bat"
"drops one a touch shorter, Leach rocks back and <strong>tonks it through the covers</strong> off the back foot. <em>Superb </em>shot!"
"oops, tries the big slog-sweep this time and is beaten"
"a touch wider outside the off stump, big turn and Leach leaves it alone"
"<strong>beaten </strong>for the fourth time in the over. Not as much spin this time, but straightens, and squirts past Leach's prodding defensive shot through to Paine"
"back of a length, just down the leg side and Archer misses out looking to whip it out into the leg side"
"short ball in towards the ribcage, Archer plays at it and gloves it just to the right of Bancroft at short leg"
"length ball, slightly down the leg side, 85mph/137kph, looks to flick to leg and misses out. Paine appeals, and is convinced by this one so <b>reviews</b>... Looks like this has just skimmed the underside of the glove. Yep, decision overturned! Stop press: <strong>Tim Paine has successfully reviewed! </strong>"
"short ball to start, and a jumping defensive shot off the back foot that flies away into nomansland"
"short and straight, Broad clears the front leg and looks to swat this over the leg side, but predictably misses the ball"
"short again, Broad steps to the leg side again, hoping to biff one through square leg but ends up evading it at the last moment"
"fullish on off stump, popped out into the off side, and Leach sets off for a single and is sent back"
"wider of the off stump, left alone"
"beaten outside off, looking to chop one through point"
"straighter, Leach looks to tickle one round the corner, sets off and is again sent back"
"full and straight, squirted out towards gully for no run"
"full on off stump, and defended out into the off side"
"<strong>bosh! </strong>Length ball, Broad steps outside leg and <strong>thuds </strong>this for a maximum over midwicket! Not timed sweetly by any means, but enough on it to evade Siddle's reach on the fence"
"short ball, Broad jumps outside his leg stump like he's got an errand to run at square leg, Cummins follows him, he tries to upper cut and misses it completely!"
"short ball, has another swat at it, and misses it again"
"length ball on leg stump, Broad clears the front leg, and gives it the <strong>big ol' heave-ho</strong> over midwicket for another six! There is nothing, I repeat nothing better in Test cricket than watching Stuart Broad bat when he's in this ridiculous mood"
"fuller, on fourth stump or thereabouts, Broad hurtles outside his leg stump <i>again</i>, has a flash at it and gets nowhere near it!"
"length ball, and finally an orthodox bit of cricket as Broad is drawn forward on the defensive and is beaten outside the off stump"
"just full of a length, bit of drift but not much turn, Leach defends stoically"
"full on off stump or thereabouts, good turn this time and Leach defends with soft hands"
"tossed up on off stump, Leach tries to follow Broad's lead with a big mow over midwicket but top-edges it up, up, up.... and into the hands of the off-balance Hazlewood running round from mid-on. <strong>Australia need 399 to win!</strong>"
"fired down the leg side, the cry of <strong>'catch it'</strong> goes up but Bairstow only just gets a glove on it after substantial late movement. Byes given, though..."
"length ball outside the off stump, just the 82mph/132kph to start, and Warner leaves it alone"
"<b>beaten</b>, if you've seen Broad bowl at Warner this series you can picture this ball in your head. Pitched on that difficult length around 6.5m, little bit of movement away, Warner is squared up and beaten"
"straighter, and tucked off the pads out into the leg side. They scuttle through for a couple"
"<strong>beaten again</strong>, Warner is drawn forwards, Broad scrambles the seam and it flies through past the outside edge"
"back of a length ball, a little too straight, and Warner defends out to mid-on, leaping off the back foot"

"back of a length outside the off stump, runs the fingers over it, and Harris leaves it alone"
"full on leg stump, worked out to mid-on"
"length outside off, left alone"
"full on off stump, Harris is drawn forward and this squirts out towards point off the outside edge"
"<strong>jaffa!</strong> You know the drill, just slightly full of a length and a fraction outside the off stump, Harris tries to defend but is beaten and this is a coat of varnish away from clipping the stumps"
"goes slightly fuller, and Harris launches a <strong>sweetly-timed drive</strong> just past Broad's right hand in his follow-through down through mid-off for four!"
"length ball on or around off stump, Warner jumps in his crease and defends, lets out a loud <strong>'no!'</strong>"
"length ball, wider of the off stump, Warner tries to flash it away through cover point but is <strong>beaten</strong>"
"length ball on off stump, defended out towards mid-off"
"fired straighter, Warner is jumping around in his crease looking to work it out to leg and is struck on the pad, stifled appeal from the slips but that was way down leg"
"<strong>that's more like it!</strong> Short and wide outside off, and Warner punches this off the back foot through the covers for four!"
"length ball in on the pads, worked out to midwicket and they scramble through for a single"
"length outside the off stump, Warner thinks about playing at it but withdraws the bat at the last moment"
"fullish on leg stump, and flicked away through square leg for one off the pads"
"length ball a fraction outside off, pushed out into the covers for no run"
"<strong>grubber!</strong> A touch full of a length on fourth stump, Harris is drawn forward and this doesn't get up off the pitch at all, dribbling through to Bairstow"
"<strong>shot!</strong> Broad strays a smidgen straight, and Harris calmly flicks this through straight midwicket for four!"
"<b>tiimber!!!</b> Off stump goes cartwheeling and Broad wheels away in celebration! You know how this story goes really, Broad from round the wicket to the leftie, angles it in, it straightens a touch off the seam, beats Harris' edge and thwacks into the top of off. Yet again in this series, England have an early wicket!"
"back of a length, and worked out into the leg side"
"<strong>beaten! </strong> Hangs one on a length on fourth stump, Warner prods forward, it moves away late and flies past the edge"
"<strong>nearly!</strong> Archer finds the edge this time, but Warner plays it with hard enough hands that it flies between third slip and the diving right hand of Buttler at gully and away for four"
"another firm edge from Warner, squirts away out to gully on the bounce"
"short ball, Warner drops the hands and sways inside the line, <strong>89mph/143kph</strong>"
"<em>weird </em>ball! 86mph and back of a length but this stays low off the surface and ends up striking Warner on the pad... think it was going down leg, and England decide against the review"
"a fraction full of a length, on fourth stump or thereabouts, and Labuschagne leaves on length"
"fullish, punched out towards mid-off on the front foot, and beats the diving Archer to race away for four! 373 to go..."
clipped through midwicket for three
"<b>gone!</b> Do not adjust your monitors, Stuart Broad has got David Warner <i>again</i>! Again, you know the drill. Round the wicket, on a length, Warner has a nibble at it, and edges it to slip where Burns takes a good catch. Seven times in the series!"
"length on his off stump, Smith shuffles across and defends with a very straight bat"
"fullish outside the off stump, looks to drive through the covers but doesn't time it and finds the fielder"

"full on fourth stump, shuffles across and defends back down the pitch"
"full on fourth stump, Smith moves across very early this time and drives this <em>sweetly </em>with his front leg out the way for four through the covers!"
"outside off, left alone, more good carry to the keeper"
"fifth-stump line to the right-hander, Labuschagne shoulders arms once more"
solidly into line this time
"probing away in the corridor outside off, all very cat and mouse as Broad dangles the ball out there. Left alone"
"too straight, tailing into the pads and flicked behind square for the single"
"fired past the leg stump, Broad targetting the pads early on in Smith's innings, but over-cooking it on this occasion"
"speared towards the off stump, across the right hander, and prodded back down the pitch. A bit of wobble but not much swing"
"stabbed into the covers, 80mph, a touch below his first-innings pace so far. Shaping towards the cordon"
"this one does straighten a touch! Bending back from a leg stump line, and an inside-edge on the attempted leg glance"
"a wafty drive, chasing the width, back foot outside off, but relying on hands and eyes rather than footwork"
"<strong>pounded with disdain through long-on!</strong> That's supreme from Smith, all levers and angles and timing. Belted with the full face"
"prodding across the crease, worked out to the off side"
"probing on a good length, and solidly blocked"
sliding past the leg stump
"a not-entirely-flowing pull, seizing the shorter length and hauling it behind square"
"<B>big hoop into the pads</B> but Smith was onto that so quickly, sauntering across his stumps and helping it on its way"
pressed back down the track with a very full face
"tight lines, lifting from just back of a length as Smith hops into line and leaves alone"
"swing on a full length, tailing back towards off stump from that left-arm line. Poked to square leg"
"shaping past the leg stump this time, as the swing takes it too far"
solid front-foot poke. Into the covers
"<B>fires it out wider and lures the loose slash!</B> This one doesn't swing, just goes with the angle, and draws the error. Well bowled..."
Marnus is chastened as he presses forward with head over the ball
"tidy lines once more, dots up the maiden with another off-stump banana ball. An EU-sanctioned banana, mind you. Doesn't deviate far from the straight, but just enough to look the part"
"<strong>Drift and, gosh, that's a anxious leave!</strong> Expected that to spin but it just kept on coming. So close to off stump!"
pressed solidly into the off side
"a forceful whip off the toes, helicoptering the ball out of the rough and out through midwicket"
"stoutly onto the front foot, and punched to cover"
a touch of turn as Labuschagne pokes slightly uncertainly through third man
head over the ball and blocked back down the track
"<B>beauty!</B> Shaping in, hitting the seam, exploding from a good length and past a flailing edge"
"good follow-up, tighter line on middle and off, bending back in, blocked in front of the pads"
"<B>this is a fine set from Curran!</B> Pounding that same patch of turf outside off, but again this one leaves him on pitching. Marnus is left poking at thin air"
"hard-handed jab, on a full length, Curran wears it in his followthrough"
"outside off, pulls his bat inside the line, in that Smith-lite manner of his"
"wider line, easier leave. But that's a fine over. Asking questions every ball"
"<B>a murderous mow through the line, but that's gone high!</B> Clothed the slog as Leach found some turn, but it lands safely short of Broad at long-on. Golly"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"leaning forward, solid block on a full length"
"poked to the leg side, hard-handed jab as Leach probes away"
"back of a length, sliding through a touch quicker and flatter from round the wicket. Fended away with a hop into line"
"drawn forward, very full face of the bat in defence"
"fenced to square leg with a watchful jab, more cunning late tail back into the pads"
"cracked on the up, lots of intent in the stroke from Smith, but short extra cover is in place"
"outswinger, sliding across Smith's bows, a slight change of approach, and it draws a fat but safe edge, low out to backward point"
"pre-meditated stroll across the stump, and another clip off the hip behind square"
"good areas once more, left alone as this one holds its line through to the keeper"
"outside off, another leave-alone to dot up another probing over"
"flicked back down the track past the bowler, using the feet with intent"
"shorter and wider outside off, that was there to be thumped behind square, but point gathers. A missed opportunity"
"<B>big turn, beats the edge, off come the bails!</B> Bairstow loves it, and this looks <B>very out!</B> Labuschagne's back toe was dragging out of the crease as his weight toppled forwards, and the third umpire doesn't waste much time!"
"turned with the spin from the rough, to short leg"
"down on one knee, and <B>out comes the slog sweep!</B> Very effective on this occasion, nailed through backward square"
"turn again from outside off, but into the hip as Wade flicks it behind square"
squared up on the back foot to fend away the late shape from back of a length
defended into the leg side as Curran aims a touch straighter
<B>lovely line!</B> Bending around a loose poke on off stump
"attacking the off stump, Wade presses forward to block on the front foot"
"<B>asking the question again!</B> Curling gently at a lively pace, on a perfect length... Wade is beaten"
"slides in the shorter ball just to mix it up. Another fine over, lots for Australia to ponder with him in the attack"
firmly pushed into the off side
pops a touch as Smith over-balances a touch as he leans out of his crease. Lots to ponder
"thrashed with intent, but only as far as mid-off. Smith doesn't want to get bogged down here"
"opens the face for an attempted guide through third man, but can't beat the field"
"<B>pops off an inside-edge, but safe!</B> A huge groan from the crowd, Buttler stretches a hand at short leg but can't get close"
"inside-out drive, a long way down the track and right to the pitch of the ball. Good intent from Wade, but England won't mind seeing Australia playing their strokes. It will confirm the sense that this pitch is not easy to defend on"
"pumping high-elbowed drive, inside-edged a touch as mid-on gathers"
"back and across, fenced away on the back foot to short cover"
"crashed uppishly as Smith plants his feet in the line of the ball outside off, and flings his hands into a drive to mid-off"
"round the wicket, changing the angle as Smith responds by pressing the ball to mid-on with a full face"
"straightening from a middle-and-leg line, round the wicket again, but Smith taps gently into the gap for another single to midwicket"
"flogged uppishly out to deep cover, Wade joins in the aggressive approach once again"
"galloping down the pitch, and <strong>so nearly stuffing Wade in the flight</strong>. Fends the ball back down the pitch eventually"
right behind the line to block this time
"back and across, Wade has a slash outside off, and <B>so nearly edges to the keeper!</B>"
galloping to the pitch once more. Cat on hot tin roof stuff
"gallumph, gallumph, prod. Thrusts his pad at the ball, five metres down the pitch"
"out of the crease once more, cramping the angles for the turn by whatever means he can. It's been a fine start to Leach's spell... and that is <B>lunch</B>"

"back of a length on fifth stump, Wade rides the bounce and times a square drive just behind Denly at gully, and it races away for four!"

"late movement in off the seam, on a length, and bounces over the top of off stump as Smith shoulders arms"
"length on the pads, bit of movement again, and flicked out into the leg side off the pads"

"outswinger, hung outside the off stump and left alone"
left alone outside off
"a touch wider, and left alone again"
"struck on the pad, slightly full of a length outside off, big appeal... but not given, and they won't review. Struck on the back leg, height an issue, and possibly outside the line too"
"bit of movement outside off, but Smith defends"
"full on fifth stump, Smith plays one of those <em>mad </em>shots where he <strong>larrups </strong>one from outside off through midwicket, all along the floor, and picks up four!"
"short ball, Smith ducks underneath it. Untidy from Bairstow behind the stumps, who drops it"
"angled across Wade, on a length outside off, and driven out to mid-off"
"too full and a hint of width, and Wade <strong>crunches </strong>a cover drive to the boundary! High front elbow, holds the pose... glorious!"

"another beautiful, forceful cover drive from Wade, but Leach fields it well at short cover, diving to his right"
"shortish outside off, Smith shuffles across, then drops the hands and sways inside the line of it"
"fullish just outside off, looks to whip it through straight midwicket but this skews off the bat out to mid-on"
"<strong>gone, the plan works!</strong> Caught at leg gully! Steve Smith is out, ladies and gents, and he hasn't even got fifty! Length ball, no great menace in it, Smith looks to tickle it round the corner, and Stokes dives low to his left at leg gully to take a sharp catch. England are ecstatic, and are surely now in the box seat to square the series"

"tight to the stumps, full outside off, and Marsh plays an <strong>elegant square drive</strong> through point for four! Lovely stroke"
"hangs one very wide outside off, Marsh briefly thinks about going after it but leaves it alone in the end. Broad is fortunate that one wasn't called wide"

"full toss, Wade gets down the track and <strong>belts </strong>it away through wide mid-off for four!"
"length outside off, Wade skips down and turns this into a half-volley, thumping it over midwicket for four! A couple of bounces before it goes over the rope. That was the shot he was trying to play at Old Trafford..."
"much shorter outside off, Wade rocks back and cuts it unconvincingly behind square, and it races away for another boundary!"
"skips down again, and drives it back to Leach, who then tries to hurl down the stumps but Wade is back. Hit that straight into the ground, and the crowd think it's a catch. Amateurs!"
"full and straight, fired in at off stump, and clipped out into the leg side for no run"
"edged, and gone! Another <em>great </em>catch from Burns and <del>Marsh is gone!</del> Nope, hold on... <strong>he's overstepped!</strong> Great ball from Woakes, hitting that difficult length just outside the off stump, takes the edge, Burns takes a brilliant catch diving low to his left, but it's all for nothing!"
"hung outside off on a length, Marsh shoulders arms"
"length ball on off stump, defended out to mid-on"

"<strong>beaten! </strong>Textbook outswinger from over the wicket to the left-hander, on a length, hint of movement away and it beats Wade's defensive prod"
"very full and straight, lunges forward to defend back to the bowler"
"flighted up on off stump, and <b>this might be out!</b> Smashed into the fielder at silly point, loops up to short leg. Soft signal: not out. Thumped into silly point's boot, but it looks like it bounced just short of it. Yep, confirmed as not out. That would have been a bizarre dismissal!"

"fullish on off stump, lurches forward to defend"
"fullish outside off, Marsh gets across to defend"
"drops it a touch shorter, and Marsh defends off the back foot"

"hustled a touch on the back foot, straightens on an off-stump line"
"<B>good nip off the deck</B>, thuds into the shoulder of the bat and deflects through the cordon"
"<strong>short and wide, and slapped!</strong> Woakes has served up a few too many four-balls of late, any width is getting walloped at the moment, perhaps because he's not quite got his nip of recent times"
"<B>that one nipped though!</B> Wicket-to-wicket line, jagging off the seam, thumping into the knee-roll. England appeal but that's going over"
"floaty length, in the slot for the drive, pressed cautiously to mid-on"
"over the wicket, drawing Wade down the pitch once more, he's determined not to let the ball pop out of that rough"
"<B>a madcap slap, and short midwicket is in business!</B> Inches short of Root as Wade drags his smear across the line"
"back of a length, doesn't turn much, and Marsh has a crack off the back foot"
"skids through everything, and spangs into the helmet! Nutmegged Bairstow, and that'll be<B> five runs</B>"
"drawn forward again, Wade's method is mostly madness. But he's getting something, anything behind the ball, whenever he gallops down the track. squeezed to point this time"
"another march to the pitch of the ball, another crunch into the covers where Broad stoops well to gather. Frustration for Wade as he thumps his pad in annoyance"
"opens the face on a wild sliced yahoo, and <B>dropped at gully</b>. Though Burns did well to get the hang-time to be fair"
nudged into the on side
"tapped into the covers, an urgent scamper as the shy comes in, and <B>it's a direct hit!</B> Wade however immediately turns for the overthrow, so the third-umpire review is clearly redundant. Yep, safely home"
"hustled on a full length, jabbed to point with a hurried flash of bat"
"opens the face, and slices a drive to point"
"shovelled off the toes, that's a sweet strike from Wade, whose proactive footwork against Leach is rubbing off against the quicks. A shimmy to the pitch and a fruity clip"

"straightening on middle again, deflected with a kneel to cover"
"back and across, finds enough of a gap at mid-on to rush the single"
"fully forward, Wade gallumphs to the pitch again, and punches hard past the bowler, who can't quite intercept"
"padded away, pitching outside leg on this occasion"
"padded away and a <B>huge appeal!</B> But Marsh just about got his angles right. Pitching on leg maybe, inches outside in fact, but clearly missing off as it clipped the knee-roll"
"fired into the toes, an 84.8mph loosener, clipped hard to square leg"
"shaping into the left-hander's off stump from round the wicket, tucked with the angle to midwicket"
"that's a dangerous length, the top-of-off angle that has ripped holes in Warner's technique. Wade blots this one away though"
"banged in short, and <B>hooked with aplomb behind square!</B> Leach couldn't pick it up so that's whistled to the rope. Well played, with a roll of the wrists"
"<B>short, sharp, and that's struck Wade on the shoulderblade!</B> Bairstow back-pedals, and fumbles the gather behind square! Just as well there was no bat on that one..."
fended away. Signs of life from Archer as he rouses himself for what could be an important spell in the context of this afternoon
"outside leg from over the wicket, padded away easily enough"
poked away with the knee-roll again
"leaning forward, pressing the ball away with the shin this time. It's like watching Warne at Adelaide all those years ago .."
"back and across, more forceful this time as Leach drops his length, and Marsh under-edges into his crease"
"fired across the right-hander this time, flatter and faster, at 60mph, and poked to the off side"
"angled bat, leaning into a defensive prod. A maiden"
pushed back onto the stumps to defend that round-the-wicket angle
"short again, another swiped pull behind square. Credit to Wade, he's not dying wondering here"
"full and sharp, 87mph now, attacking the top of off and poked back down the line of the ball"
"back of a length, and<strong> that's a lovely strike,</strong> a round-house pull, cashing in on an 87mph half-tracker that just sat up nicely. Wonder if there might be more gas in the next one...?"
"short again, tighter line, Marsh hops back and across to defend with a straight bat"
"short again, whistling over the shoulder as Marsh flinches inside the line"
"no messing around from Wade, down on one knee, a compact paddle sweep to get up the other end, and to bring up <strong>a scrapper's half-century</strong>. Well played"
"floated into the blockhole from round the wicket, Marsh leans forward to dig out the full ball"
"patted into the covers, bending the knee to guide the stroke"
"clipped on the up, midwicket is on hand to tidy up"
"back of a length, looping onto a leg-stump line. Blocked"
"outside leg, wafted slightly uppishly out through square leg, but there's no fielder there so no drama"
"fired past the leg stump, swinging away for Bairstow to gather with a dive"
"in the channel outside off, a judicious leave from Marsh, at 86mph"
"looking for the yorker, but this one is speared down the leg side too. Sharpish pace, at 86mph, and decent carry from a full length"
that's a better bouncer. up to<strong> 90.4mph all of a sudden</strong> as Marsh sways inside the line
<B>great take from Bairstow!</B> Late swing on the bouncer as Marsh sways once more. Good mounting aggression
"short and wide, Archer gets his lines wrong on that occasion, and Marsh is well balanced on the back foot,<strong> carving hard through point</strong>. Australia are brawling!"
"round the wicket, dipping into the left-hander and squeezed into the covers"
"clipped off the face of the bat, pushing out of the rough to midwicket"
"<B>prodded straight to short leg!</B> Root makes the breakthrough! And it was a bit of a sucker dismissal! On the legs once again, two men around the corner to gather anything played off the pads, and that's poked straight into Buttler's breadbasket! He'd been padding them away perfectly happily to the left-armer, but the change of angle of Root's offies lured him into the stroke"
"tossed up, outside off, stabbed to cover to get off the mark"
"hustled on a full length, a touch quicker and flatter too as Wade blocks away"
"<B>big rip!</B> Root's having some fun now, a massive tweaker out of the footholes as Wade plays back and just about avoids committing to the stroke"
"<B>huge appeal for something!</B> LBW, caught at short leg. England are very excited and <B>review</B>... but that's missed the bat, and would have missed a third set! He was beaten for pace either way"
"<strong>fizzing bouncer from Archer!</strong> Paine ducks, but he's getting warm now ..."
"outside off, left alone on a fifth-stump line"
"<B>open-faced punch through the covers!</B> In the slot, and Archer grimaces as that whistles to the rope"
"tries another drive, but inside-edges back to the bowler"
"back of a length, thuds the splice, deflects down into the gully"
"on the back foot, and punched back to the bowler, hurried a touch out of the rough"
"drawn forward this time, and blocked"
"<B>ambitious from Wade!</B> A sliced drive out of the rough, gets good bat through the ball, but point gathers sharply"
"dancing feet, and smothering the spin"
"<strong>another inside-out slap over the covers!</strong> Broad is briefly in business for the catch, but does brilliantly with the chase and slide to claw the ball back and save the boundary"
"crashed hard into the covers, and that's<strong> zinged to the rope</strong>. Possibly the end of the Root experiment for today."
"<strong>inside-out punch through the covers!</strong> Wade hitting against the spin but that's brilliant, a quickstep down the track, and head right over the ball on impact. Lovely striking"
"crashed down the ground once more, it's wild but effective, as he's judging the length so well. He'll be stranded if Leach can get one to bite past the bat though"
firmly forward. And squeezed to the leg side
"fired into the pads, worked to the leg side around the front pad"
"down the track, slapped out to deep midwicket, and <B>Curran can't scoop it up!</B> So close to holing out on the stroke of tea! He gathered it on the bounce, maybe <B>a foot shy of reaching him</B> as he dived forward. Lucky lucky..."
"more compact in defence, and back down the track to seal the session"
"starts with a nagging outswinger, fullish in the channel outside the off stump. Wade punches it straight to Archer at wide mid-off"

"bit of a loosener, on a length outside off, and pushed out into the covers"
"fullish outside off, 87mph/140kph, but a bit of a half-volley really, and Wade <strong>drives sweetly through cover point</strong> for four!"
"straighter, 87mph/140kph, and flicked off the pads out to long leg for a single"
"very tight to the stumps, straightish length ball, Paine looks to tickle it round the corner. It flicks off the thigh pad, <em>just </em>out of reach for the diving Bairstow, and skims away to the boundary"
"length ball, little bit of nibble off the seam, Paine pushes it out to cover for a jogged single"
"full and straight, <strong>big shout! </strong>Erasmus says no, but Root <strong>reviews</strong>. Looked like it might have pitched outside leg, but was definitely hitting... Wade was looking to work it into the leg side, UltraEdge says no bat involved. But Hawk-Eye confirms it was pitching outside leg, and that will be that - no more reviews for England!"
"fires in an inswinging yorker to start, which Paine digs out from under his feet"
"fullish, strays a little too straight, and Paine clips it off his pads for four down to long leg. A composed steer round the corner"
"length ball, sliding across the right-hander. Paine punches out towards mid-off, starts to set off for the single and then realises it isn't there, so sends Wade back"

"slightly full of a length on off stump or thereabouts, Wade presses it out into the covers"
"bumper, pulls, off the top edge... <strong>six!</strong> Not too much pace, sits up nicely and Wade swivels it around the corner. Long leg was in the game, but it flew over him"
"sharper bouncer this time, 87mph/140kph, and Wade ducks underneath it"
"hangs one outside the off stump, Wade leaves it alone. 88mph/142kph"
"another short one, a fraction too straight and Wade weaves underneath it, <b>90mph/145kph</b> this time"
"slightly full of a length, Wade blocks it out to mid-on"
"tossed up, fullish and very straight, Paine prods it back to the bowler"
"a fraction shorter, but Paine lunges a long way forward and defends"
"goes on with the arm, and Paine defends back down the pitch"
"tossed up on off stump, Paine is down the track but can only work it to mid-on off the inside edge"
"a touch shorter and wider, doesn't get up much off the pitch, Paine looks to cut but it flies under the bottom edge"
"lunches forward on the front foot, defends a full ball out to cover"
"outswinger angled across him, Wade has a waft at it and is <strong>beaten</strong>"
"similar ball, but Wade weaves inside it and leaves it alone this time"
"length ball, nurdled out to point for no run"

"<B>there it is!</B> Worked off the legs, with a huge roar of 'YEEESS!' and through he gallops for his fourth Test hundred and second of this series.

It's the same policy as England have pursued all series. Get the bloke at the other end!"

"forward and blocked, solidly over the ball"
"tidy areas, Siddle leans forward as the ball straightens on middle and off, and another over ticked off"
"<B>got him!</B> Wade finally succumbs to the one that bursts past his edge! He'd advanced with such fearlessness throughout a brilliant innings, but this time Root dipped it late, got good bite past the edge, and Bairstow's gloves were sharp as a tack!

"on the back foot, twirled onto a full length, fenced away"
"<B>down on the sweep, picks out square leg </B>- who has literally just moved into position. And Root himself scoops it inches from the turf! He didn't even have to move, just stooped to conquer. And  England so nearly home now..."
"<B>Root seals the contest with a screamer!</B> Over the wicket, clipped hard out of the left-hander's rough, and Root - now at midwicket, flings himself low to his left to snaffle the winning catch in his outstretched left hand!"
