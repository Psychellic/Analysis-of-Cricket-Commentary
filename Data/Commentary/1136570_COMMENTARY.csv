Hit it well, and looked like it was gonna go over long on, but Pandey jumped, took the catch, and then threw it back in since he was falling over. Tried to return and complete the catch, but the ball falls short. He threw the ball back in with just a bit too much power. Saves five runs nonetheless. <b>Time out</b>"
