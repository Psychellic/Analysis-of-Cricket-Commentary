"short of a length and Samson chooses to pull. Was that the right shot selection? Easy in hindsight but he was influenced into the pull because of his excellent eyes. Picked the length so early and decided to pull, but the ball was angled away. As a result, his bat isn't in the right position and his under-edge clatters into middle stump."

Full delivery down leg, Pant misses a flick and is distarcted by the big appeal. The lbw call is rather close. But the answer from umpire Barde is not out. The ball ricocheted towards raina at slip, who picked up and threw the stumps down at the batsman's end. Pant was lackadaisically saying no for the run to his partner without grounding his bat into the crease. A result of inexperience."
