"drift down leg - figures, he's not had much cricket in the lead-up, even if he might have bowled 100 overs in the nets at training"
"a second one that's off target. There's gorgeous carry off the surface, but Southee needs to shift his line towards off stump"
and there we go. The bounce is too much for Fletcher who attempts a cut at a back of a length delivery that's too quick and flies through to the keeper
"hits the deck on and around off stump, Fletcher lets it go"
"lovely shot. He shifts his weight legside of the ball, waits for it to get right under his eyes, and basically cuts it off the stumps, focusing on placement. Gets the gap between point and cover point."
gets across on off stump and nudges the shortish ball out to long leg.
"length, jags back into him, and he defends from the crease"
"fuller, down the leg side, and called a wide again as King leaves"
"fuller, driven hard, and fielded at cover"
"length, moves back in and beats the batsman for pace. Good bounce on that as well, and that dissuades Jamieson from going up in appeal"
"full, down the leg side, and collected by Seifert way down to his left"
"SMASHED! It's in his arc, and Fletcher is able to swing freely, picking it up from outside off, and spanking it over long-on"
"short, and cuts this hard, and high over third man. <strong>Fletcher is warming up to the task here</strong>"
"dug in short, and he pokes this towards point. They set off for a single, and it's a risky one. A <em>direct hit</em> would have had King, but he makes it"
"full, and swings away late as King looks to go down the ground. Beaten by the late movement"
"length, and he looks to go over mid-wicket. Goes off the toe-end, and actually goes bang in between the bowler and mid-on. Off the mark with some good intent"
knocked to the off side for a single
"this was quick, and it bursts through Seifert as it goes down the leg side"
"punished, straight back down the pitch. Fuller ball, quick, and that allows him the leeway to swing happily. Past mid-on before he could react"
"length, angles into him. He initially looks to back away, and then adjusts just enough to tap it towards mid-on. Quick single taken"
"<strong>SHOT!</strong> These West Indians are taking no backward step. Bennett digs it in short, and angled into Fletcher, but he backs away and absolutely swats it over square leg"
"shorter in length, and he wallops this away towards deep square leg"
"this will be a no-ball. Full toss, intended to be a slower ball, and he overcooks it. Ends up going over the waist"
"that's a forehand top spin down the line from Fletcher. Slower ball from Bennett, but it sits up due to the length. Allows Fletcher to back away and flog this over cover"
"short, and he drills this through covers. What an over for the West Indies!"
"full, fast and driven through covers. Southee goes across from mid-off and just cuts it off"
"<strong>Ferguson makes the breakthrough!</strong> It's not a shot that Fletcher would be too proud of either, actually. Swipes across the line to a fast, seam-up delivery that just did a bit of inward movement off the seam. Fletcher was determined to get this over the leg side, and ends up missing it fair and square"
"length, fast and straight, and he defends"
"fuller, fast again, and beats the batsman for pace. There's an appeal for leg before, but there was no doubt this was heading down the leg side"
"length, tucks him up for room, and he can only defend this"
"<strong>Ferguson has another one!</strong> Hetmyer, who was looking a bit edgy after those dot balls, looks to back away and swat this through the off side. The ball is on a good length, fast, and catches the outside edge as it goes through to Seifert. Ferguson punches the air in delight"
"length, angles into him, and he defends"
"thrown wide by Southee, and he has a flash at it, and <strong>sends this down third man's throat</strong>!"
"length, angles in, and he defends towards short mid-wicket"
"length, just around off, and Powell is beaten as he looks to drive. Just a hint of away movement, possibly off the seam"
"Ferguson takes this at fine leg! Dug in short, and Powell gets into an awful tangle as he looks to hook this. Off the top edge, and Ferguson juggles the ball a bit, before latching on to this"
"length, angles across him, and he plays it towards point"
"Ferguson on fire, as he gets Pooran leg before. Pooran reviews immediately, and indicates this has hit his glove. It's a fast, full ball and Pooran is beaten by the sheer pace of it. Don't think this has gone anywhere near bat or glove. He looks to flick it away, and is beaten. It's just a question of where it pitched. Umpire's call on pitching, and hitting the wickets."
"full, fast, and Allen just gets some bat on this. Just in time. <strong>Clocked at 151 kph!</strong>"
"too quick and good for Allen! Just on a length, and moves across him as he looks to defend. <strong>Bowled at 148 kph</strong>"
"a little short, angles in, and Allen doesn't know a lot about that. It comes in contact with his glove and goes away towards square leg"
"short, fast to Pollard, at 149kph, and it strikes Pollard on his left elbow. Pops up towards leg slip, but falls well short"
"dug in short again, and Pollard ducks under this 151kph thunderbolt this time"
"length, comes back into him, played towards short mid-wicket. Quick single taken, fraught with risk, but Martin Guptill fails to hit the target"
"length, around leg, and he drops this with soft hands towards square leg, and they charge through for two"
presses forward to defend a length ball around off
"fuller, wider, and Pollard <strong>edges this </strong>as he drives. Just past Ross Taylor at slip, and it runs away to third man"
"skips down the wicket, and turns a length ball into a virtual half-volley. Whips this away towards deep mid-wicket"
<strong>superb.</strong> Uses the incoming angle into his pads to whip this away in front of square on the on side. Finds a vacant spot between deep mid-wicket and long-on
"<strong>edged, and just short of slip!</strong> Top ball again, fast and accurate. Allen, on his part, did well to ensure he didn't poke at it with hard hands"
"outside off, and beats him as he looks to push at it"
"fast, outside off, and he guides this down to third man. Absolutely races away, and beats a diving fielder at the boundary"
"short, 151kph, and smacks Allen on his left shoulder as he ducks into this. Runs away over slips for four leg byes"
"full, fast, and a bit of width. Allen looks to swing hard, but misses this by a fair distance again"
"short again, and Allen ducks inside the line of this"
"The first ball, he gets Pollard to play across the line, and has hit the pads. Given out, and Pollard has reviewed immediately. Has he gotten an inside edge? It's hard to tell at first glance. The ball did straighten after pitching, and was probably going to crash into middle. But yes, there's been a little nudge off the inside. Crucial review, and well taken by Pollard"
what a response from the big man! Just stands up tall and smacks this over long-off with a 78m maximum
"short from Bennett, and Pollard can duck under this. This went at 134kph, and the relative lack of pace after Ferguson must make it easier for the batsmen"
"short ball, and Pollard moves inside this and allows it to hit his body. It runs away to fine leg, and there's a run out appeal as they come back for the second. He's made it home, though"
"short of a length, angles in, and he plays this towards square leg"
"short, just outside off, and he plays this to point"
"full, down the leg side, and called wide. Pollard did have an almighty heave, and will believe he nearly picked up six for this"
"fuller, played away on the on side. Picks up a quick single"
"full, but way down the leg side again"
"a bit short, around off, and he plays it with soft hands towards point. Quick single taken"
"short, and he allows this to pass, just outside off"
"length, angles in, and he plays this down to fine leg"
"off cutter, and Allen gets a little jammed as he shapes to play this away. Gets this towards third man."
"short, defended with a little hop"
"fires it into the pads, flat, Allen nudges it behind square leg"
stays back and flicks a shortish delivery on middle and leg to the left of short fine leg
"slightly slower through the air, but the trajectory is still flat enough that the batsman goes back and works it to midwicket. Overthrows from there - Santner himself running across and flicking the ball back - allows a second"
"ooooh, he was looking to launch that. A little more flight from Santner, but the second he sees it dipping, Allen changes his shot and defends"
"sliding down leg and Allen does the sensible thing, glancing it fine for four to fine leg."
outside edge and it races away past short third man's left. The cut shot works. Most shots work on this ground.
heaves it over into the fun-loving crowd at deep square leg. Neesham's efforts to bowl hit the deck backfires.
another short ball that soars into the crowd. This time off the top edge and right over the wicketkeeper. Pollard's pull shot is clearly fail-proof
"whips it away. This is the danger of bowling to Pollard. Especially on a ground so small. He is marginally less devastating when the ball is at his throat, but Neesham doesn't have the pace for that. He is made to realise that cold hard fact. So he goes full and straight and Pollard sends it to the fine leg boundary with an imperious flick"
He. Has. Smashed. That. It's full. It's in the slot. Pollard clears his front leg and absolutely pummels the ball over long-on
"beats him, after summoning a little extra pace off the pitch. Pollard is looking to swipe the back of a length ball over midwicket but it flies past him"
"swivel pull, with Pollard making sure to roll his wrists on the ball. He's only looking for a single. He gets it"
backs away but is still cramped as Jamieson follows Pollard with a short ball that comes up over his chest. Excellent work
"another one that he digs into the wicket, Allen evades it outside off"
attempts the ramp as he sways his body out of line of a back of a length ball on off stump. Doesn't connect. Good idea though
"backs away to try and cut the ball on and around off stump, but Jamieson's extra bounce is too much of a menace. The debutant came into this over under pressure. He's done well so far."
"bouncer again, Allen ignores it and then looks at square leg. Pollard does too, with considerable disbelief. He can't understand why that hasn't been wided."
glides it to third man. End of an outstanding over from Jamieson.
"top-edged six. This is only 142 kph. Clearly a warm up delivery. It's short and on off stump, Allen instinctively goes for the pull and gets enough on it"
"clever cricket. He knows the next ball will be full. And even though it's at 145 kph, he's ready to smack it down the ground"
"keeps the pace on - and he's knocked him over! A 146 kph short ball that keeps following Allen even as he clears the front leg. A half-hearted pull shot comes out and as a result, he feathers an edge through to the keeper. Once more, Ferguson's sheer pace and the fear factor in his short-pitched bowling fetches him a wicket. It's his best figures in T20Is"
blocks a shortish delivery at 148 kph to midwicket
bouncer wanders down leg and Seifert really can't get across - and more importantly - up in time. Too quick.
"<b>what a ball, what a spell, he has five!</b> He has pace. He surprises batsman. He makes them fear for their well being. And here, he hits the deck, gets extra bounce, makes Paul recoil from his shot - a simple dab to third man - which ends up a glove to the keeper. Spectacular, accurate, relentlessly FAAAAAAAAAST bowling. Only the second Black Cap to get a five-for, after his captain Tim Southee"
"oooooh, he's kept it out. Ferguson was going for six. He had it full and straight. He had his pace up too. But Cottrell willed himself to stand in front of the stumps - even if he is deep in his crease - and blocks it with a perfectly straight bat."
"great start. He slides it on, preventing Pollard from getting under the ball and heaving it away. Good stuff."
backs away because he knows the left-armer is angling it all into his pads and pulls to deep square leg. Doesn't take the single
"quick and wide outside off, slugs a length ball outside off away to deep midwicket and refuses the run again."
"outstanding stuff from Santner. He varies his length this time, going for the blockhole, and Pollard can only dig it out.... <b>Oooooh, scratch that. he's overstepped!</b>"
"<b>maaaaaagnificent</b>. The free hit ball becomes a dot and Pollard, having gone down one one knee to whack it into the leg side, just looks bewildered. Superb thinking from Santner again, going wide and keeping it out of the hitter's reach"
<b>that's fifty to the West Indies captain</b>. Pollard pulls a flatter one to the left of deep square leg
"he's reaching out. He's almost losing balance. And yet. And yet the ball flies into the stratosphere. Pollard is one monster hitter. Santner did everything right in the over. Even this ball, he looped it up, but got it to dip and kept the line outside off stump so that the batsman would risk losing balance if he went slogging. But Pollard is just too good"
"dabs the back of a length ball to third man, and even as he was setting up for the shot, Pollard had begun running to take strike"
"top edge flies away behind the keeper. Back of a length and outside off brings the pull shot, and the extra bounce actually takes the ball away to the fence"
"<b>it's out of the ground</b>! It. Is. Out. Of. The. Ground. Pollard loads up a pull shot and it is such a ferocious one. Earlier today, he made a review that looked just as ferocious. Man, he's been in a mood since then."
"and this won't help calm him down. A slower ball beamer strikes Pollard on the stomach and he goes down - for the briefest of seconds. Bennett apologies for the mishap immediately and continues apologising but Pollard doesn't even look at him. He's seething inside. Or he's just in his zone and doesn't want anyone in there with him. Phew, this is one hell of an innings"
"walks across onto off stump, prompting Bennett to go wider with his yorker. Very tough on the bowler as he is penalised. If he'd bowled within the tram lines, that could well have been another six"
he's able to sneak one within the tramlines
"looks to go full and wide, and just misses the tramlines this time"
"he's gone a bit closer to Pollard, and he swings this one through mid-wicket"
"fires one in quicker, and he is only able to play it towards deep mid-wicket"
"swing from around middle, and going down leg. Seemed to get pretty close to the pads as Guptill tried to whip it away, but called wide nonetheless"
"short ball, and there's a shy at the striker's end. Could have been close, but with nobody backing up, this has gone for extra runs. <strong>Four of them!</strong>"
"a hint of swing back in, and it allows Seifert to pick this off his pads towards square leg"
"short, just a little wider of off, and Guptill has a close look and lets it pass"
"Cottrell gets the big breakthrough, and pulls out the salute! Short, fast, and Guptill tries to cut this away towards third man, but it flies off the edge through to Pooran behind the stumps"
"<strong>beauty!</strong> Hint of away swing, pitching on a good length around off, and Conway goes fetching for it and can't make any contact"
"short, slapped hard into the ground, and towards point"
"length, driven hard towards cover"
"down the wicket, and lofts it with the flow of the arms, and does enough to clear long-off"
"Allen drags this a bit shorter, and he goes back and goes inside out through the extra cover region. Superb shot again from Seifert"
goes back and drives towards cover. Allen goes flat and straight with it
goes back to slap this away towards point
"straighter, flatter, and played towards short mid-wicket"
"short, fast, and into the body, and Conway swivel-pulls this away. Not completely in control, but gets it wide of short mid-wicket, and he gets his first T20I runs"
"fuller, a bit wider, driven handsomely but straight to mid-off"
"fuller, driven well but cut off by point"
"short, but quick, and while he tries to swing this away, gets it down towards fine leg"
"angles this down the pads, and Conway moves across a touch and just glides this down to fine leg. Well played!"
"<strong>lucky this time!</strong> It runs down to fine leg for four again, but off the inside edge. Fuller from Cottrell, and gets Conway to look for the drive. No foot movement, though, and that causes this to go painfully close to the stumps"
"short, angles in, and he cuts this. Short third man, inside the circle, fails to stop this low to his left"
"bashes a length ball, angling into him, and gets it away towards deep mid-wicket"
"length, angles across Conway, who defends towards point"
"dug in short, and he hooks this, but straight towards a man down at the deep square leg fence"
"short, and he looks to go over third man. Called a wide"
"<strong>taken after some struggle by Powell!</strong> Seifert looks to make room, expecting a short ball, but Thomas goes full, and Seifert ends up skewing this in the air, to the left of Powell at mid-on. He holds on, juggles it, and eventually sticks with it"
"fast, just outside off, and he cannot get this away"
"flat, straight, and defended from the crease"
"<strong>well played this time!</strong> Waited for it, stayed deep in the crease and played it towards deep backward square after Allen dropped it just a tad short"
"cuts hard, but straight to point"
"fuller, straighter, and banged back down the ground, well into the stands. <strong>Phillips lets out a scream as he goes for the shot</strong>. I think he's done some muscular damage in striking that."
"stays deep in the crease, and pulls this over deep mid-wicket. Superb shot, almost like a baseball swing"
"short again from Allen, who's looking to fire them in hard and straight, and this time he goes hard past short fine leg"
"short, and fired away like a bullet through mid-wicket"
"length, angles in a touch, and he plays this towards mid-off. Picks up a single"
"short, angles in, and he looks to glide this over the slips. Called a wide, which looks a touch harsh at first go"
"fuller from Thomas, and Phllups has played this one on. Appeared to be expecting the short ball again, and that's what Thomas capitalizes on. Gets this fuller, just around off, and Phillips is in no real shape to get the cut going. Goes off the inside edge, and bounces on to the stumps"
"length, angles in from outside off, and Taylor leaves"
"knuckle ball, dug in a bit short, and Taylor defends. Has to send back Conway, who had come almost halfway down the pitch before turning back"
"fuller, and beats him on the inside edge. Taylor lucky not to get a nick, or to get bowled"
pitches it up and Conway gets forward for a mistimed push to mid-off
steps out and slices a length ball outside off through cover point
"huuuge shout for lbw, the umpire shakes his head, impact outside the line, but West Indies will not be denied as they run Taylor out! It's Allen at point who swoops in on the ball after it pings off Taylor's pad. The batsman, having been stuck on the crease, takes off for a single. His non-striker doesn't respond. Allen has seen the confusion. He runs towards the wickets at the keeper's end, dives with his eyes on his target, underarms the throw and it's gone. Taylor just walks but the umps are checking to make sure everything is okay. It is."
"glides a back of a length ball outside off to the third man boundary, keeping it well to the right of the fielder in the circle"
"short but doesn't get up, which allows Neesham to rock back and pull behind square leg. Good shot. Excellent placement"
"<b>nearly chops on</b> as Williams delivers a lovely slower ball, aiming it well outside off stump. The batsman reaches out for it, looking to slice it past point. Gets lucky"
pings off his pad as he is forced to shuffle back and across against Thomas' pace to fine leg
"comes down the pitch and launches a wide, length ball into the crowd who are extremely happy for something to shout about."
"glorious shot. He's waited on it. Nearly perfectly. There isn't all that much room, but because he has delayed the late cut, he's able to beat point on his right but there is protection further in the deep."
whips a straight ball away towards the square leg boundary. Outstanding connection again while playing a difficult shot against high pace
cuts a slightly shortish delivery but it's straight to point
comes down the pitch but this time he's beaten for pace and bounce. This pitch is still fairly juicy.
"carves a back of a length ball, but since the line is too close to him, it goes into the covers"
"full and angling across the left-hander, Neesham swings hard at it and makes no contact"
"full and outside off, knocks it back down the ground, and Pollard, racing and diving to his left from mid-of, keeps it to one."
nails the straight drive. The ball is up there. All he needs to do is give it the direction it needs to hit the tiny straight boundary. And he does it with some style.
"back of a length and outside off, attempts the cut, but it's too far for him to connect"
"lovely slower ball, Conway is leaping up. He's wound up. Nerves from the first game. So as well as he notices the length, he doesn't spot the change in pace. Not at first at least. But eventually he does, delays the bat swing and swipes it into midwicket. Oh, Paul's overstepped. It was a beautiful change up, but he's overstepped"
"looks for the yorker to minimise the damage inherent in a free hit delivery. Conway looks to dig it out, but instead he somehow manages to skew it to the third man boundary"
slugs it down the ground. Neesham has hammered that and he's been given the chance to thanks to Williams choice of a wide half-volley
"sliding into the pads as he continues to go around the wicket in the over, Neesham loves this kind of bowling. He keeps his feet out of the way and whips it behind square leg"
whacks the full toss down the ground and a man from the crowd leaps across to gather it. Eden Park is having fun. A crowd in a cricket match is having fun. We're getting there. We're getting there to being normal again
"pounds the half-volley down the ground and even though long-off gets to it, there is so much power on the shot, that it simply rebounds off Allen and hits the boundary. <b>That's the fifty partnership</b>, in just 20 balls."
goes over the wicket and takes the pace off. Neesham as a result is only able to get a single with a dink to square leg
"slower ball surprises Conway. It's the offcutter, which Conway is trying to tap fine to third man, but the ball grips in the pitch and bounce sharply past him."
pokes it through the covers to retain strike
"looks to swing a fierce delivery on middle and leg, but it's a smidge too quick for him. Inside edge onto pad results in a scampered single. Good call from Neesh."
"<B>top edge</b> juuuuuuuuuse over Pooran! The keeper does so well, leaping up so high, as high as he possibly could. But it evades him well enough and scurries away to the boundary. Neesham keeps swinging. He will not stop"
works a good length ball on off stump to deep midwicket
"yorker on leg stump, Conway can't do much more than dig it out"
"angled into the pads, Conway looks for the pull, but it comes off his thigh pad and goes to short fine leg"
"dropped by the bowler! But it came at him so fast! Even so, Cottrell is furious with himself. He did so well, spotting Neesham making room and following him to both cramp him and nail it into the blockhole. Death bowling is a problem for Cottrell, but this one was sweet. It could have been sweeter."
"starts with a fine yorker, on leg stump, no room to work with. Conway pushes it to long-on"
hangs back and heaves a back of a length ball away to the left of long-on
"through Pollard at mid-off! Neesham gets enough power to beat the West Indies captain. And putting power on a full toss isn't all that difficult for a batter like him. His job in this team is to finish things off, remember"
"slower ball, pushes it wide outside off as well. Neesham manages to bunt it through the covers off the very bottom of the bat"
<b>launches it over fine leg</b>. Another full toss that gets the treatment. Paul began this over with a pin-point yorker. His search for more has led him astray. Neesham on 44 off 19 - that's what Maxwell got in the Australia vs India game and people were going mad about that innings
"back of a length, slower, and outside off. Neesham looks to drag it into the leg side, but he can't reach"
"<b>stops a six!</b>! Fletcher at deep square leg tracks an outstanding flick shot from Conway. Remember, Pollard never puts any pace on the ball. And the square boundaries are the big ones here at this ground. Given all that, it is amazing that Conway times it so well. He would've thought it was clearing the boundary, but Fletcher goes back, leaps over the rope, catches the ball and then flicks it back"
"taken at short third man. Pollard may just have turned the game. He is just such a good leader. Took it on himself to deal with a match going away from his team for the second time today and has Conway dabbing a back of a length ball, that may have bounced a touch more, to Thomas"
"full and outside off, he drives to extra cover"
"no room, no pace, top class. Santner, the new batsman, backs away and only plops it back to the bowler"
"that's outta here! Pollard attempts a slightly low percentage ball. A short one. Santner spots it, clears his front leg and thumps it over deep midwicket"
hammers a full and wide delivery to long-off
fires it into the pads and it's quick enough to beat Neesham's flick shot
"beats him with a pitched up ball angled across the left-hander. Santner needs to give the strike back to his big-hitting partner at the other end. Oh darn, it's a no ball. It's a free hit. It's undoing all the good work"
"he's missed a wide full toss! But it's another no-ball. Keemo! They've called it for height, but that looked very tight to me."
hits to mid-off and sprints through.
no-ball call again! And this one is the worst of all because it gets a wicket. Neesham heaves the slower beamer - clearly over his waist - over to long-on
slugs a length ball on middle and off over to deep midwicket
"gets the yorker right but Neesham is able to turn it to midwicket and before the fielder in the deep can come up, they get two."
"strikes him on the hip as he looks to pull a quick, short one at the his body"
a wild beamer. Paul is warned for it. This one is at full pace. It comes right for Santner's head. He gets himself leg side of the ball and heaves it away towards - I think - long-on. We have a free hit now
"takes the pace off as Santner walks across his stumps and flicks it in the air. It's taken at deep midwicket, but it's a free hit so no harm to the batsman"
"nudges a good length ball down to long-on with the intention of getting two, but it doesn't happen that way"
gets the yorker right and Santner can only dig it out.
he's got it. He's not been at his best tonight. But he gets a length ball here which allows him to clear his front leg and launch it over long-on. Superb shot. Gets the crowd on their feet.
"walks across and swings a full ball outside off to long-on. Cottrell is bowling at such pace, and is getting those yorkers right in there, that <b>Santner's broken his bat</b>"
dabs a back of a length ball outside off to third man
follows him with a shortish ball and Santner is able to pull it away to deep midwicket
slices a good length ball outside off to short third man
"it's all done! New Zealand have it. Santner gives them it with a six over deep midwicket. He was eyeing it. He knew Pollard would be taking pace off. He was deep in his crease, desperate to get under the ball, and got under it he did."
