we have a run out appeal here. It's a yorker on leg stump. He gets down to paddle it but it gets tangles up in his legs. He takes off for a run instinctively and Wade pounces on the loose ball and flicks it onto the stumps. Sent upstairs...the batsman has made his ground

"whoa, big moment. Taken. 142 kph. It's a high full toss outside off, Head eyes the short boundary but the ball skews off the outside half to cover. Head has a look at the leg umpire, but the ball is below the waist. A bad ball, but Archer and the Hurricanes won't care"
"another productive full toss outside off, pushed to cover"
"three full tosses on the bounce, not literally. Carved to the finer of two backward points. The throw is decent to the bowler who parries the ball onto the stumps, but Ingram is safe."

"nice tag team work at the boundary. Possibly match-winning. A short delivery on middle and leg, Ingram backs away and pulls towards deep midwicket.

"another awful delivery. Full down leg again, Wells misses out on five runs, clipped down to fine leg."

"DOT BALL! Short outside off, and quick. Wells tries to cut the ball through third man but fails to connect. Good idea, but just missed out on four"
"plumb in front! 144 kph, a low full toss and dead straight. Lehmann misses a flick, misses the ball and is struck in front of leg. Was it sliding down? Didn't look like it. Another dot ball. New man in. Hurricanes in front now?"
"gone? Bye or run-out. A yorker outside off, creeps underneath the bat. Wade rips off the glove and throws the stumps down at the batsman's end with Wells short. Is that the match? Three dots in succession. The game has swung"
"good length on leg, Rashid backs away and swings, badly bunted away towards midwicket. Falls in no-man's land, for two!"
"superb bowling, a 144 yorker on leg. Not much Rashid can do but jam it out to mid-off"
"the crowd goes wild. Full and straight, hit out to mid-off. And without an extra, this game is done"
"superb last over from Archer. Short down leg, pulled away towards midwicket. Archer sprints after it, but can't get there. The Strikers can't run nine either, so the Hurricanes put up a <b>seven-run victory</b>"
