"the nervous poke. The openers' occupational hazard. Similar length ball, angling away, this time he draws a push. Beats his outside edge"

"Pant saves byes. This is well wide of leg, and Pant flies across to his leg. Not called a wide"
shuffles across to get bat on ball for the first time today. Bunts this shortish ball to leg
"England are off with a mistake from Pant. Bumrah tests him down the leg side again, Pant dives, but can't control the ball"
"starts with a wide full ball, left alone. Not called wide"
"nice little push-drive to get off the mark. Front foot moves, hands stays under the head until the last moment, and he then guides this overpitched delivery through cover"
"on a length, on off, slight shape away, defended with a slightly open face by Jennings. That's a good area. You have to play at these balls"
"fluent drive. Slightly away from the body but Ishant has bowled full and Jennings shows faith in the pitch to play that drive. The balls speeds away as it reaches practice pitches, but Jadeja gives a superb chase and saves one run"

"good leave. Both on length and leave. This one pitches within the stumps, and goes a touch higher and a touch wider than the stumps"
"on a length, outside leg, defended to leg"
"pitches one up after pushing him back all over long. This is the attempted inswinger to the left-hand batsman, but it starts too wide outside off to take his edge. Jennings beaten on the drive. No feet there"
"<strong>beaten</strong>. That's a good ball. A brave ball. The ball hasn't been swinging much but Ishant has shown the courage to bowl the drive ball. Cook drives at it, but it leaves him at the last moment. The front foot not close enough to the ball"
"short of a length, into the pads, Cook thinks easy single, but the ball comes on slowly and takes a safe leading edge to cover"
"short of a length, down the leg side, Cook fails to make contact, Pant makes the collection"
"on a length, angling in towards off, defended from the crease"
"slightly short of a length, stays back to punch this to cover-point"

"full, just outside off, almost a belated decision to play it, but the pitch is slow enough to not punish him for it. Jennings gets a single to mid-off"

"and that vintage Cook cut. Short and wide from Bumrah, he rocks back, and scatters the pigeons with his cut in front of square"
pulled away this time. Bumrah drops short. The pitch is too slow for that. Cook dismisses this from his presence. Through square leg it goes

"full outside off, left alone"
"on a length, angling in, defended to mid-on"
"wide length ball, left alone. Good carry this time"
"a touch straight this time, but the ball moves away towards off, which makes Jennings can't play an adventurous shot through leg. Just pushes this back"
"fuller, outside off, and left alone. This one carries through too"
"fuller, closer to off, but still fails to draw a shot from Jennings"
<strong>into his helmet</strong>. This bouncer stays lower than expected and gets a ducking Jennings on the side of the head. Thank god for helmets. They might need a new one at the end of this over. Jennings off strike for the moment

"on a length, hits the outside half of the bat, runs to the right of cover, they come through for a hesitant but eventually safe single"
"length ball outside off, slight shape away, played with an open face to point. This is such an easier pitch than all others. This shot would have brought a wicket in other matches. Now goes off the middle of the bat"

"follows a wide length ball, guides it to point"
"short of a length, on off, Cook right behind it in defence"

"full, just outside off, solidly defended"
"on a length, just outside off, defended solidly off the front foot"
"<strong>beats the bat</strong>. That's a special delivery on a slow pitch with no swing. He bowls on a length, just outside off, Jennings has to play the angle, but it pitches and leaves him. Jennings doesn't follow it, which is the good thing he does"
"too full and too straight this time, pushed to mid-on"
"wide length ball, left alone. Some movement away again. Have we reached the stage where the ball starts swinging? Around that 15-over mark"

"signs of inswing from round the wicket as Cook hops back on the off stump and edges with soft hands down through third man. Well bowled, pretty well played"
"too wide to tempt him there, a big yawning leave, reminiscent of Brisbane 2010. He's played every other shot in his book this morning, so why not the best of them all?"
"solidly forward on off stump, bat and pad defiantly glued together to meet the movement back in"
"flashed on the up, but pressed very firmly in front of backward point so no danger there. That was rising outside off, and Cook felt in the mood to have a go"
pushed back down the ground
"on the hips, shovelled round the corner to backward square leg"

"better line, shaping into the stumps and pressed back down the pitch"
"<B>reverse sweep</b>. That's a tremendous connection, whistling through the vacant backward point. He played that shot supremely in his debut hundred. That feels a while ago now..."

"outside off stump, left alone this time, good carry through to the keeper"

pushed onto the back foot to defend
"pokey defence, we've seen that before, meeting the off-stump line with solidity on the front foot"
"firm once again, a vertical bat on an off-stump line. Shami gathers"
meeting the rising length on the back foot. No way past
a flash down the leg side as Shami errs in line. Cook swings into a pull and just about avoids gloving to the keeper. That would have been a terrible way to go
firmly punched to the off side
"<B>Jennings goes!</B> And out of nowhere, India strike! A familiar dismissal for Jadeja too, a tight wicket-to-wicket line, an attempted nudge to leg, but it comes straight off the face of the bat to leg slip! Cook, as mentioned, has been undone in that manner in recent times... Jennings will doubtless have just reminded him of the danger. And he is livid as he departs, thumping his bat with his glove as he walks off"
nudged to leg
"firmly forward, picks the gap at backward square leg and he's off the mark"
solid defence on an off-stump line
"flipped into the pads once again, and another bread-and-butter single"
chiselled on the up to the leg side
"outside off, far too wide to lure Cook out of his comfort zone"
"firmly forward, and defended back down the pitch"
"a switch to over the wicket, a gentle outswinging half-volley and a calm push to the edge of the long-off boundary. Measured and focussed"
back around already. Seen enough of that line. Cook meets this one on his toes and punches to cover
"whipped out to the leg side, and gathered with a dive at short midwicket"
hops onto the back foot to block to cover
"ello ello, Bumrah's back and immediately finds some jagging late movement as Moeen is drawn forward outside off and beaten. Well bowled..."
this one goes straight on from round the wicket and is blocked compactly under the nose
"rising on middle stump, Moeen nudges it well off the hip and out to square leg"

"wide line, through to the keeper"
"outside off, and through to the keeper"
"on the pads, tucked to the leg side, and another quick-called single. This is potentially the last over before lunch ..."
"round the wicket, through to the keeper once more"
another well-judged leave. India persisting with a round-the-wicket approach in this session but haven't quite forced enough shots
"<B>beauty!</b> That's the spot for Bumrah, jagging away at 88mph, Moeen can but hold his bat on an off-stump line and pray"
"firmly forward, and defended back down the wicket"
"length ball, outside off, allowed to angle through"
"short of a length, pitched outside off, defended outside off"
"on a length, around middle, angling away. Cook gets a stride in, lets it go"
"on a length, pitches outside leg, swings towards off, defended off the front foot"
"on a length, starts outside off, angles away, and Pant has to collect it"
another length ball allowed to go through to Pant
"really full, swinging delivery. Moeen has a drive outside off. Beaten. The sound from the bat hitting the ground creates <strong>half a shout</strong>"
"stays full, gets closer to off, has shape away from him. Moeen leaves it alone this time"
"full, this time on the stumps, making him play, swinging it away towards off. Moeen plays late and defends it well"
"on a length, just outside off, swinging away, left alone"
"and goes straighter to make Moeen play. The ball moves away against the angle from around the middle line. Moeen closes the face of the bat, and gets a leading edge. This would have been caught at gully on a quicker pitch, but it rolls to point here"
"<strong>beauty</strong>. Bumrah is turning it on here just when the pitch looked flat. On a length, just outside off, Moeen has to play the angle, but the ball pitches and moves away. Bounces extra too. Beaten"
"length ball, middle and off, angling away, left alone"
"short of a length, middle and leg, angling away, hits the inside half of the bat as Cook defends"
"on a length, middle and leg, swinging away, defended outside off"
"starts outside off this time, and it is an easy leave"
"<strong>dropped</strong>. Rahane drops Cook at about fifth slip. A better ball from Ishant. On a length, middle and leg, swinging towards off. Cook pokes at it, gets a healthy edge, and Kohli has a man at the right place. This is low but not too low, but Rahane fails to take it. Do India's fielders have a treat for Cook in his last Test after resurrecting his career in Southampton four years ago?"
"down the leg side, and Pant has some work to do, which he does well"
"outside off, past Moeen's bat, who plays inside the line"
"<strong>dropped by Kohli this time</strong>. This is a much more difficult chance. Moeen plays a loose shot after having been tied down for long. Gets a thick edge that seems to be flying wide of third slip. Kohli dives and gets his left hand to it, but it doesn't stick. Half chance really"
"length ball, middle and leg, swinging towards off, defended with a straight bat"
"<strong>the change-up delivery</strong> after taking everything away for two overs. He flips the seam position in his hand, and bowls one to move back in towards Moeen. The batsman is not expecting it, and leaves it alone, but the he is lucky the ball doesn't nip back in enough to trouble his stumps"
"full awayswinger now, and it has been left alone"
"down the leg side this time, but Moeen misses out. Pant makes a collection"
"length ball down the leg side, and Cook can't get a touch on it. Missing out on a few boundaries down the leg side"
"on a length, middle and off, allowed to angle through to the keeper"
"fuller, just outside off, Cook doesn't feel like a drive or a poke"
"<strong>beaten</strong>. Cook's concentration wavers. He has a poke after leaving a few. This is on off, and Cook indulges in a defensive push even as the ball angles away. Lucky not to edge it"
"fuller, on off, swinging away, another defensive push. This time he feels bat on ball. Middle of the bat on ball"
"on a length, on off, angling away, and Cook back to leaving it"
"Moeen has a drive. The mid-off is wide. Pushed straight of him as Bumrah pitches up, looking for swing. The session is 21 minutes long, and these are the first runs since lunch"
"<strong>big shout, not given</strong>. India have reviewed it. Moeen doesn't offer a shot to one that Bumrah has got one to move back in. That is the variation ball. It has surprised Moeen again, who is caught shouldering arms. The bounce from the pitch, though, is carrying it over. India lose the review"
"back to swinging it away, and Moeen lets it go"
"Moeen continues to rub salt into the wound. Gets four off an outside edge. Looks to play a full ball to leg, the swing takes the leading edge but it rolls between the slips"
solid defensive shot to a similar ball now
<strong>another lbw appeal</strong> as Bumrah gets one to move back in again. This time Moeen is playing a shot and is still beaten on the inside edge. Again the bounce is carrying it over. No review from India this time
defends a length ball just outside off
"fuller but also wider, Cook thinks of a drive, but lets it go"
"full, outside off, allowed to angle through to the keeper"
"closer to off this time, Cook has to play at it, gets a thick inside edge, takes a single to square leg, and also, importantly, he might have taken Moeen away from Bumrah, who has been torturing him"

"full, around middle, angling away, left alone"
"length ball, into the pads, clipped to midwicket"

"full, outside off, slight shape, defended with an open face"
"full, just outside off, Cook forward in defence"
"wider this time, slightly short of full length too, and is left alone"
"on a length, slightly short of a length maybe, Cook stays back and defends this to cover"
"oh the Cook cover drive. A rare sight. Classic cover drive. Gets his stride in, and sends it crashing through cover"
"on a length, just outside off, shaping away, defended off the back foot"
"on a length, straight, defended in front of middle and off"
"nice swing towards off after starting from around middle. Moeen has to play this respectfully, and he does"
another ball goes unpunished down the leg side. Pant has to collect and send it back to Bumrah
"on a length, outside off, holding its line, left alone. The inswinger must be around the corner"
"and there is the inswinger, swinging too much, beating the inside edge and going for a leg-bye. Headed down leg"
"wide length ball, Cook has nothing to do with it"
"short of a length, angling in, defended off the back foot"
"bouncer, easily ducked on an easy-pitched pitch. Pant has to stretch to leg to prevent byes"

"wide on the crease, bowls a length ball, outside off, left on bounce, and rightly so"
"wide length ball, left alone"

solid front-foot defensive again
"darts this into the pads, picked away for a single"

"wide on the crease, pitches a length ball wide outside off, left alone"
"wide on the crease again, bowls a wide length ball again, Pant does the rest"
"angled in from wide on the crease, defended solidly by Moeen"
"well done Pant as Shami angles one down leg, and gets some late movement away from the wicketkeeper. Pant stretches himself in his dive and prevents byes"
"on a length, turning into the pads, punched to midwicket"
"flat, on a length, punched to mid-on"
"flighted, slower in the air, driven to mid-n this time"
"wide on the crease, angles a flat delivery in, defended to leg"

"tries the big slog sweep, gets a thick inside edge into his boot. The ball doesn't lob up for a catch"
"length ball, angling in, Cook defends this off the back foot, on the hop"
"<strong>another poke from Cook</strong>. Short of a length, makes Cook play the angle, but this one seams away past the edge. The keeper and the slip have heard a sound, they appeal, but it is not given, and rightly so. Big gap between bat and abll"
"Cook is back to leaving them alone, and Pant has to deal with a late wobble as he collects this"
another poke. Shami is troubling him with the angle from wide on the crease. Beaten again as this one holds its line. India have been bowling well this hour
"<strong>beaten again</strong>. Shami has unsettled Cook completely. He is angling the ball in from wide on the crease, Cook is having to play at them, but the ball is seaming away enough to miss the edge. This has happened thrice this over"
"short of a length this time, no movement either, so easier for Cook to defend"
"jabbed defence, on the back foot"
"stretching forward, rolls the wrists on impact to nurdle the single to wide mid-on"

"<b>another play and miss! </b>Superb from Shami, finding that channel outside off from round the wicket, with a nibble of movement past the bat"
"a wider line but Moeen is beaten again, this time by himself as he is drawn into a stroke"
"very wide on the crease, creating a huge angle back into the left-hander. Moeen defends on the back foot, underneath his eyes"
"<B>snorter!</b> Perfect wrist, right behind the ball, and this one curls in late, explodes off the deck, passes the inside-edge, top of the stumps and the outstretched glove of the put-upon Pant as he sprawls down the leg side!"

"shaping down the leg side once more, but Moeen gets bat on this one to change the pattern of the over"

""
flicked off the toes
"over-pitched from Jadeja, and once again, Cook's eye for the opportunity is faultless. A stride to meet the pitch, a punch through the line, and there's no cutting that off at long-on!"

"clipped urgently up to mid-on, but this time there's a man in the way"
fenced to midwicket
"beaten outside off, this one really flies off the deck"

"outside off, keeps low after swinging as Moeen dangles his bat out to dry"
"angled in, beats the edge, Moeen can't lay a bat on those, and just as well for England's sake. This is a fine spell but he just can't get his rewards"

"flicked firmly, on the up through midwicket"
"down the leg side, can't make contact"
"a low full toss, that's a bonus, but Cook can't beat short midwicket with his urgent flick. At least, for his sake, he didn't bunt it straight to the man"
clipped uppishly to mid-on
firmly forward to defend once more
"beaten outside off, and Moeen holds his bat just sufficiently inside the line to avoid the nick. England's 23rd play-and-miss since lunch!"

"wider line this time, ends up in the keeper's gloves once more, but Moeen was not committed to that one"
"another formidable piece of bowling skill, shaping back into the batsman and zipping past the inside edge"

"firmly forward this time, planting the front dog with determination"
angled bat down to third man. Another single to the cause

"fenced off the back foot, pushed  back down the line"
fully forward and blocked back down the line
fully forward and blocked back down the track
"round the wicket once more, and nothing Shami does seems able to snag the edge. Moeen living dangerously. But living all the same. And frankly, that's the way to do it. A bit of sky-diving, croc-wrestling etc ... beats the quiet life"

"solid contact, meeting a more half-volleyish length with a full face. Shami gathers with a smile, and looks for all the world as though his afternoon's work is done"

clipped to the leg side
"aggressive from Cook, hitting firmly on the up towards midwicket as Jadeja's line strays"

"watching the ball all the way onto the bat, a hint of late movement on a full length, but defended to mid-off"
"inside-edge, down to fine leg, and that will be <B>tea</B>"
"some swing but starts too wide, easily left alone"
"on a length, just outside off, slight shape away, gentle pace, defended with an open face"
"on a length, holds its line in front of off, takes a soft outside edge to deepish point for one"
"Pant made to dive down the leg side again. Bumrah misfires this way down the leg side. Pant gets himself up Shawn Michaels-style, fliing"
"<strong>beaten</strong>. A length ball, outside off, holds its line, Moeen has a poke but doesn't follow it all the way as it seams"
"and there is a gift on the pads, Moeen clips it away to square leg. A rare loose ball that can be put away. Other loose balls have been too far down leg"
"<strong>
Kohli reviews a not-out lbw call</strong>. I think they will lose this review. Short of a length, angling in, past his inside edge, hits him on the thigh pad with Cook in the air. One of the poorest reviews this series. Bouncing well over the stumps. India have no reviews left"
"short of a length, on off, defended from the crease"
"on a length, outside off, defended with an open face. Slight shape away"
"short of a length, angling in, punched square of midwicket for one"
"length ball, into the pads, easy single"
and another single nurdled away off the pads. This is Cook zone now
"another length ball into the pads, another nurdle for one to leg. Cook must be loving this now.Tired bowlers, easy-paced pitch, time to milk it now"
"full, really full, dug out to cover"
"length ball, outside off, left alone. Pant collects it by his shoelaces"
"closer to off, makes him play, Moeen defends solidly"
"this is the one that swings into Moeen, who plays it late, under his head, still gets a soft inside edge onto his boot"
"<strong>beaten again</strong>. This is just too good. On a length, just outside off, then seams away to miss the edge. Moeen does well to not follow it with his hands"
"length ball, outside off, opens the face to send it to point"
"short of a length, middle and off, pushed past mid-on for one. He shuffles across to get behind the line here"
"wide length ball, seams away, left alone"
"length ball, outside off, defended with an open face"
"leaves one outside off now, ball just about holding its line"
"there he has a slight poke as the ball swings away from him against the angle. Does well to not follow it too much, though"
drives a length ball but can't beat the man at cover
"there will be no hundred for Cook unless he gets it in the third innings. There is a disappointed sigh at The Oval but then the crowd rises for Cook as he goes off after playing one on for 71. This is on a length, just outside off, possible with the switched seam position to send it back in. Cook is surprised by the movement back in, and gets the inside edge as he looks to defend"
"wide the length ball, left alone"
leans nicely into a forward-defensive to a length ball outside off
"A long long long appeal with no reviews left, and Joel Wilson finally gives it. Joe Root reviews it. This is full, and looks pretty adjacent. Not sure why it took Wilson that long to give it. Root falls over playing an inswinger, also plays across the line, not showing it the full face of the bat. The ball hits him in front of off, and would have hit leg. The replay confirms that, and England lose a review. Pretty ordinary review again. India right back in this"
"length ball outside off, defended from the crease"
"length ball on the pads, clipped away for one"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
"on a length, swinging in, Bairstow gets a big stride in, and defends. No big drive like the previous two bowled dismissals"
"one more duck for Bairstow, and Ishant has bowled really smartly. Batting not great from Bairstow. His stumps have been the target, Ishant tries that first up, but then bowls one outside off. The ball holds its line, Bairstow follows it with his hands without getting close to it. Easy catch for Pant. What an absolute turnaround here"
"wide length ball, holds its line, beats the edge on a forward defensive"
"<strong>falls short</strong> of third slip. Stokes walks at Ishant, turns this into a really full ball, doesn;t drive at it, which means the edge dies in front of third slip. What bowling by India since lunch"
"wide length ball, shapes away, left alone"
"on a length, holds its line, played with soft hands, the edge rolls along to point"
length ball down the leg side. Lost count of how many such balls England have failed to score off. Pant collects
"full, asking him if he wants a drive, Moeen pushes at it, finds cover"
guides this length ball with hands to gully
"full, close to off, Moeen watchful in defence"
"<strong>beaten</strong>. This is too good. On a length, angling in from round the wicket, Stokes has to play at it, and then it seams away to beat the edge"
leaves this alone outside off now
"pitched up, teasing him, Stokes leans forward, then decides against a drive"
"walks down at Ishant, who tries the movement back in with the angle this time. Stokes gets an inside edge onto the pad"
"length ball, angling in, pushed to mid-on"
"wide length ball, left alone as India clock another maiden"
"turning in, from a length, guiding between forward and backward short leg. Gets a single"
"fired down the leg side, Pant makes a collection on the rebound"

"wide length ball, left alone despite the angle back in"
"wide on the crease, Stokes walks down the wicket again, defending a length ball to cover"
"wide on the crease again, bowls a wide length ball, and is left alone"
"slightly short of a length, holds its line, beats a defensive prod"
"walks down the wicket again, turns this shortish ball into a good length one, and defends it to mid-on"
"on a length, outside off, Moeen stays back to defend"
"wide on the crease, turns a length ball back in, defended"
"full, outside off, driven to short midwicket"
"full outside off, driven to long-on"
"full, outside off, driven down the ground, but mid-on is up now so there is no single here"
solid front-foot defensive to end the over
"<strong>beaten again</strong>. Moeen playing a freak innings. Still seam for Shami. Slightly short of a length, seams against the angle. Moeen has to play at it, and is beaten"
"this one angles in from wide on the crease, Moeen plays with an open face, and gets a single in front of backward point"
"Pant can't do anything about this. Length ball, pitches middle and leg, and moves extravagantly after pitching for four byes down the leg side"
"this one seams a touch after pitching full, takes the outside edge of Stokes, but it is a soft edge and gets him a single to point"
"short of a length, angling in, worked to leg for another single"
"on a length, angling in, defended from the crease"
"down the wicket, Jadeja sees him, pulls back the length, Moeen is hit on the pad"
"darts a length ball outside off, left alone"
"on a length, outside off, defended off the front foot"
"down the wicket, right to the pitch of the ball, drives it back to Jadeja"
"beats his inside edge this time and appeals for a leg-before, but Moeen is well outside the line of the stumps"
"slight shimmy down, pushes this wide of Jadeja, and steals a single. That is playing with fire, but they make the single"
Shami sprays again. This has pitched middle and leg and seams and swings big time to not give Pant any chance. Still called byes. That should be wides surely?
"on a length, outside off, pushes to the side of mid-off for a single"
"driven on the up. Stokes leans in, puts no half measures in, and takes advantage of the absence of a cover fielder"
back to leaving it alone now outside off
"full, just outside off, defended back to Shami"
solid front-foot defensive to end the over
"slow in the air, tossed up outside off, defended off the front foot"
"flatter, quicker, pushed to mid-on"
"shorter, flatter, punched to deep midwicket"
"gores back to a length ball, can't get timing on the cut, finds the man at cover"
"flatter, quicker, pushed to midwicket"
"flighted outside off, defended solidly off the front foot"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"another well-judged leave. Moeen is toughing it out, but no time for relaxation. As soon as he's mastered this ball, there'll be a brand-new one round the corner"
"beaten outside off once more, as Moeen wafts it through like an ineffectual doorman who's dropped his VIP List."
"<B>nails it through the covers!</B> Shot, Mo! On the front foot, places the bat in the line of the ball, and dinks it to the rope. Classy in between whiles"
flipped through the leg side
"head over the ball, solidly onto the front foot and pushed back to the bowler"
nudged to the leg side
"Mo's on the charge! A two-step down the wicket, and pumped up and over the leg side. Not quite timed, but the ambition is unmistakeable"
solid in defence
glanced through fine leg with the furtiveness of a spy on a park bench. The keeper's left glove was loitering as that whizzed by
"fired down leg as Stokes charges again, and he does well to slam a pad in the way to avoid being stumped down the leg side"

"flicked to mid-on, finds enough of a gap for the single"
keeps low and just about dug out as Stokes is deceived in flight
"skids it through and <B>Stokes is nailed on the pads!</b> That is plumb, he lined up the wrong stroke to that delivery, it was too fast and flat to be working through midwicket, and England's evening stumble in the park is gathering pace!"
"round the wicket, flicked off the pads to open his account"
"outside off, no stroke offered"
"nibbles off the seam once again, Ishant shaping in and zipping away. This has been a quality examination"
right behind the line of the ball to defend
"angled bat, guided down to backward point where Dhawan dives well to intercept"

"round the wicket, darting into the stumps, punched to short cover"
"striding forward to drive, mid-off intercepts"
"back of a length, tight line, left alone"

"attempted thrash through the covers, can't get it away. The grind goes on"
"round the wicket, left alone"
"banged in short, no stroke there"
"<strong>beaten once again!</strong> To be utterly nitpicky, that was fractionally too short to endanger Moeen's edge, but it jagged sharply and looked impressive"
"short again, ducked again"
"outside off, and through to the keeper, more extravagant lift off the deck"
"flipped out through midwicket, as Ishant strays a touch too straight onto the pads"
"chiselled up to mid-on, Moeen remains steadfast on 49"
"fuller length, straight as a die, tucked to the leg side again"
"turning from off, down the leg side, Moeen ignores"
"shuffling onto the back foot and blocked outside off, kept a touch low as Jadeja hustles through"
"flicks through the gap, and cheers for Moeen Ali's gritty, gutsy fifty. Promoted to 3, and he has endured, somehow, for a 167-ball knock that has spanned the best part of four hours"
"flicked to leg, can't beat the field"
"through to the keeper, Sharma's economy gets all the more economical"
"outside off, no stroke this time, a hint of movement away from the left-hander"
"<B>edged, gone, Moeen snicks one at last!</B> A carbon-copy of pretty much any one of the 30-40-odd plays-and-misses that he has totted up in his innings. Lifting off the deck, arrow-straight line on off stump, and demanding a stroke. The end of a diligent, self-denying knock. And India's hard-working day of toil gets better!"
"short, swinging, absolute no chance for Pant to intercept that, waaay down the leg side, but it's more byes against his name. 21 in this innings alone..."
"attempted leave from Curran, and he's gone for less than 20 for the first time in his career! A graze off an under-edge, you'd have been better off smashing it, son! England are now officially in freefall. Again"
"full length, dragged forward, blocked with head firmly over the ball"
an open-faced drive into space at extra cover. What can Buttler do from here? Hint: It starts with 'welly it' and ends in 'son'!
"eased into the covers, Shami holds his groin after bending to gather. A minor worry for India, but he's still smiling"
patted into the covers once again
"big turn on a full length, hit the footmarks and looked more dramatic as Rashid shouldered arms"
fizzed through on a tighter line. Another leave alone
"round the wicket again, too wide to tempt Rashid. Right, Jos. Is it time for Beast Mode?"
two steps down the pitch to meet a wide line from Ishant. Defended into the covers
"well bowled again, tight line and good lift off the seam. Buttler leaves alone"
"outside off, angling back in towards the stumps, a well-judged leave"
"<B>big nip back into the pads, and Ishant seems convinced about something!</B> It must be an inside-edge, as that was missing leg. Sure enough, an <B>umpire review</b> is coming up and the soft signal is out! The ball carried to slip,  but nope, <B>there was no bat involved</B>. On we go"
"driven, and that's what Buttler can do! Just a touch over-pitched, and there's no let-off when those wrists get punching through the line"
"outside off, jagging back off the deck, and over the stumps"
banged in on an off-stump line and that zips into the splice as Rashid comes forward
"onto the front foot, punched to the leg side as Rashid stretches over the ball"
"another outrageous piece of late swing down the leg side, giving Pant no chance yet again. It's a cruel game"
"defended on the back foot, body right behind the line"
"fully forward, full face of the bat, pressed back down the pitch"
more tantalising late swing into the right-hander as Rashid stretches watchfully forward
"tight wicket-to-wicket line, jagging in towards middle and leg. Blocked on the back foot"
"<strong>huge appeal, and up goes the finger!</strong> Buttler <b>reviews</b> but he's already wincing, which suggests very strongly that there's no inside-edge. Lovely shape once again from Shami, from off to middle, but <b>hold on, there's bat!</b> Buttler survives, and he's rather surprised about it"
"outside off, big outswing. No stroke. I strongly doubt we'll see the new ball tonight on this evidence. Shami is making this ball talk Hindi!"
tucked to the leg side
"outside off, back of a length, Rashid lets it go by"
another leave-alone and another over chalked off
"more big swing with the new nut, flicks the pad down the leg side"
"banged in short, Rashid stabs off the back foot, through third man. That's a well pick-pocketed boundary"
"full length inswing, worked around the front pad"
"banged in, Rashid ducks, Pant gathers well down the leg side"
"big hoop, bending in from outside off, defended with resolution"
"outside off, bending through to the keeper"
"tight line, curling away from the right-hander, no stroke offered"
clipped out to midwicket
"lining it up outside off, nothing doing there"
"played right under the eyes, but Buttler is clearly lining up the leave before feeling obliged to get his bat in the way"
"tucked to the leg side, and another single to the cause"
""
"well bowled, very full length, bending late as Rashid smothers the movement on the front foot"
"outside off, huge appeal from the slips, but Bumrah's not interested. That was Rashid hitting the turf as the ball eluded the edge"
"well batted again, reminiscent of Rashid's defiance at Dubai 2015-16. Head right over the ball to block on a full length"
"through to the keeper, tight to off stump"
"zipping inswing, but down the leg side. Another good take from Pant"
"<strong>stunning delivery!</strong> A gallumphing inswinging yorker, bending fast and late towards the timbers, but that's an even more brilliant piece of batting. Bumrah's up for the lbw, but Rashid middled that!"
"starts with a wide length ball, left alone"
"has a nibble at a wide length ball. This doesn't swing in, and goes away, past the outside edge"
"looks to drive a length ball, slightly early into the shot, ends up playing it to mid-off"
"and follows a wide length ball again. Playing for the inswing, but this one pitches and leaves him. Remember this is only a three-over-old ball. <strong>Beaten</strong>"
"Ishant gets away here. Full ball on the pads, Buttler misses out, the ball kisses his pad for a diving collection for Pant"
"inswinger on target now. Pitches on a length, outside off, swinging back in, past the inside edge, towards the middle stump. The extra bounce saves Buttler from an lbw here. Rashid on strike now"
"a bit of a loosener from Bumrah, Rashid climbs into that floaty full wide ball, and exploits the gap at cover. Extra catching man for Rashid, which means he has open spaces there"
"angled into the pads, hits him flush but going down leg. Pant has to do work to his left again"
"on a length, angling in towards off, defended from the crease"
solid defence from the crease to a length ball angling in towards off
"bouncer, doesn't climb up as much as expected, but Rashid ducks under it without trouble"
"big inswinger from wide outside off, Rashid stays back, plays late, gets a single to the gap at cover. England not looking to protect Rashid at all. He will be on strike next over too"
"big inswinger again, past the inside edge, on target, but it hits Rashid high on the thigh pad"
hits Rashid high on the bat as he defends another inswinger. Watch out for one that holds its line but Rashid still plays at it because of these inswingers
"<strong>big big shout but not given and India have no reviews left</strong>. This looks a good shout. Swinging in, past the inside edge, not bouncing over, Umpire Dharmasena says no, and India don't have reviews because they were poor with them yesterday. It did sound like an inside edge to me live time, and replays confirm it. A slight inside edge, another good decision on the field"
"the variation, the one that holds its line, but it is wide outside off, and is left alone easily"
"full inswinger, defended solidly by Rashid"
"another big hooping inswinger, Rashid looks to defend off the front foot, gets an inside edge onto the pad. This is high anyway"
"outswinger, starts outside off, left alone"
"on a length, slight swing away from outside off, played with soft hands, gets a single in front of point"
"big inswinger, headed towards middle stump, hits the inside half of Rashid's defensive bat. Rolls away to square leg"
"this insiwnger starts wider, swings less than the previous few ones, and beats the outside edge as Rashid looks to defend"
"length ball, angling in more than swinging in, easy to line it up and defend"
right forward to defend an inswinger pitched fuller than the previous few balls
"walks at Ishant who pitches it wider, and hits the inside edge of Buttler's bat on the drive. The ball rolls to mid-on"
"strays down the pads with this inswinger but this is precisely why the fine leg is fine. They keep this glance down to one, and also get Rashid back on strike"
"short ball, higher than the ribs, Rashid goes back, fends, keeps it down, places it wide of short leg, gets off strike"
<strong>big shout</strong> for a big inswinger but this is clearly going down past the leg stump. The umpire agrees
"tries the variation ball, the outswinger. It doesn't swing much but it holds its line. It is full, and is driven straight to mid-off"
"nicely played by Buttler. A length ball outside off, pushed wide of mid-off, and he retains the strike for the start of the next over"
"too full from Bumrah, driven to sweeper cover for one"
"wide on the crease, gets it to hold its line outside off, but it starts too wide to make Rashid play"
another leave outside off having got a big stride in
another leave outside off as Bumrah stays away from the inswinger. Seems to be setting him up for that lbw ball. I would be watching for it if I was Rashid
"tires the straight ball but Rashid is equal to it. To be fair this is an outswinger that starts on the pads, and is too full too. Clipped wristily away for four"
"tries the bouncer, doesn't get too much elevation, Rashid slips under it"
"big inswinger, starts too straight, Pant has to put a full-length dive just to get a hand to it. Saves three byes but concedes one. Rashid back on strike"
"on a length, outside off, swinging back in, defended from the crease"
"big inswinger, a touch too full, Rashid drives, is hit on the inside half of the bat"
"a length-ball inswinger, played with soft hands, worked to leg, gets a single"
"this one straightens outside off, but too wide to make Buttler play"
"wide length ball, defended off the front foot"
"this one skids through, and Rashid is given out lbw. He reviews it, though. This is on a length, outside off, seams back in as opposed to swinging. Goes past the inside edge, hits him low on pad. The review shows firstly that Bumrah has made the adjustment with the front foot and is nowhere near flirting with the no-ball. The projection shows it is clipping leg, and the decision stays, but England don't lose the review"
"pitched up outside off, pushed with an open face, gets a single to deep point"
"<strong>lovely bowling</strong>. Wide on the crease, gets movement away against the angle. Buttler has to play at it. Gets a thick edge wide of second slip"
"another skiddy incoming ball, Buttler defends it to leg. makes the adjustment to low bounce well"
more lucky runs for England. Actually just the one run as Kohli has got the third man finer now. Edged away again as the ball holds its line against the angle. Goes wide of second slip for one
and Broad takes the single off the last ball of the over. So no shielding of the tail just yet. This is a length ball that angles in and runs off the inside half of the bat to long leg
"digs this in short, gets only about chest high, Broad fends to point"
"short again, doesn't rise very high, Broad goes back and easily drops this to cover for one"
"wide length ball, driven to deep cover for one"
"tries the full ball, Broad is deep in the crease, but pushes this well to mid-off"
throws his bat at this length ball just outside off. It goes in the air but there is no man at cover. They get four for this
"short of a length, into the ribs, fended away in front of backward short leg, gets a single"
"good quick bouncer angling across him, Broad is airborne, and moves out of the line at the last moment"
"short of a length, outside leg, Broad moves across and misses out on runs there"
"nice shot. Drives a length ball, in front of deep point, gets two for it"
"full toss on the pads, Broad late on the shot, misses it, but gets four leg byes to very fine fine leg"
<strong>got him in the ribs but Broad has a chest guard on</strong>. Hits him under the arm pit as Broad takes his eye off the ball as soon as it is pitched short and straight at him. Not much show of pain
"better this time as Broad bowls this bouncer on middle and off. Broad knows it is angling away, and stays away from the line of the ball"
"big outswinger that also seams away after pitching. The length is full too. The line, though, is wide, and Buttler shoulders arms"
"closer to the umpire this time, bowls straight, the ball seams a touch, takes a thick and soft outside edge for a single"
"short of a length, outside off, fended away past that diving fifth slip. Should have been pitched up to Broad with the amount of movement he is getting"
"<strong>lovely bowling</strong>. Full, close to off, seams away after making him drive. Beats him"
"length ball, outside off, stays back to punch it to deep cover for one"
"<strong>beaten again</strong>. Length ball, Broad drives for the angle, it pitches and seams just a little, but enough to beat his bat"
"short of a length, angling in, stays a touch low, pushed with an open face to deep point"
"good take from Pant. This is a bouncer over Broad's armpit, and it keeps rising as it goes past the stumps. Pant flies and makes a one-handed collection"
"tries the fuller ball now, but bowls only on a length. Not really full. Broad has time to adjust even though he is caught with his eight back. Clips this off the pads for one"
"on a length, angling in towards off, pushed to sweeper-cover for one"
"length ball outside leg, but Broad has shuffled too far across to be able to take advantage of it"
"straight length ball, seams back in, beats Broad's big drive and hits him in the thigh area. Rolls off safely"
"has a nibble at a length ball outside off, and it seams away to beat him once again without <strong>actually taking the edge</strong>"
"overcompensates and starts too straight, and is clipped away for two runs to deep midwicket"
"on a length, slightly short of a length actually, left alone outside off"
"starts straight again, but this one seams away towards off, and Buttler has to be watchful. Doesn't close the face, hits this straight to mid-on"
"too straight once again, and Buttler can close the face this time and take a single to deep midwicket"
"and he bowls short, Broad right behind it and defends it back to Shami"
"pushed through flat outside off from round the wicket, Buttler drops back and slaps one through point"
"over the wicket, fired in on off stump and Broad leans out defensively"
"flat and steered away on the front foot, comes off the outside edge and they scamper through for a third as the ball rolls away towards the rope"
"back round the wicket, tossed up and defended coming across"
"slightly short, Buttler latches on and crashes four through backward point. Shout of 'catch!' from Jadeja but he <i>belted</i> that past the fielder, Kohli, I think"
"floated up full in the channel, this time Buttler ignores it"
"shortish, Broad drops back and leaves"
"length ball, holding its line in the channel outside off, left alone"
"angled in, 82mph, Broad closes the face, gets a loopy leading edge fine of mid-on and they hustle the single, despite a direct hit at the bowler's end"
"shaping away a fraction in the corridor, Buttler leaves"
"fuller, 86mph and drawing Buttler out, he dabs into the covers for another quickly run single"
"length on the pads, shaping in and jabbed to the leg side, short leg is in and he gets something on it going to his right, prevents a run"
"flat trajectory outside off, Jaddu firing it through wide, allowing Buttler to go back and pick out deep point"
"stays round the wicket, pushed through on the pads and clipped for one more"
"floated up a bit slower, defended on off stump"
bit of width on offer again and Buttler cuts this firmly behind the sweeper to come back for two
"tossed  up, tapped into the off side"
"flat delivery, no fizz on it as Buttler leans out and pushes one more through cover"
"good length around off, 84mph and prodded towards mid-off"
"in the channel, going away as Buttler drops back and leaves"
"Buttler comes across and taps into a gap for one, releases the pressure again"
"round the wicket, speared in and then straightening, a fiendish line and Broad is beating on the back foot"
"again he nips the ball past the edge, 85mph but fractionally too short as Broad fiddles outside off"
"fuller and straighter... and that's boshed down the ground for four! The on drive is one of the toughest in the book, not much foot movement but all timing from Broad, a schoolboy opener who is irking India at No. 10"
"length, veering in menacingly, climbing through past the inside edge as Buttler is tucked up on the walk... Half an appeal from behind the stumps but Ishant wasn't interested"
"this is too straight, Buttler skelps a whip through square leg for four, <b>brings up the fifty stand between these two</b>"
tucked into a gap for one
"round the wicket, short ball, dabbed down towards gully on the back foot"
"Broad backs away and throws the hands at a wide-ish length ball, slices one through backward point"
"back of a length outside off, 81mph and Buttler again collects an easy single with a back-foot drive through the covers"
"pitched up, <b>finds the edge as Buttler goes hard at a drive</b>, but it stays low and shoots wide of the two slips for another boundary, takes him to 49"
"ooh, good response, hits the seam on a length and it smuggles its way through past the bat as Buttler pokes from the crease"
"touch short, Buttler gets bat on ball this time, stabs wide of extra cover for a couple - <b>that's his half-century</b>, fifth time he has passed 50 in a Test this summer and just what England needed, after last night's fit of the vapours. The crowd know it, too"
"slightly back of a length, lets this one fly through"
"pitched up and crunched through cover on the front foot, there's a sweeper to keep them to one"
"pitched up and poked into a gap square on the off side, they trot one and Broad keeps the strike"
"short ball from round the wicket, Broad again runs a single through backward point"
"full on off, Buttler leans into a ping down the ground, sends it to mid-off"
"touch back of a length, seaming in as Buttler defends into the off side"
"pitched full, that's in the slot and Buttler smokes it like a pair of morning kippers through extra cover for four"
goes back and across and drops one more into a gap on the off side
"pitched up, slightly wide of the stumps, Broad is out on the front foot and steers a drive for a couple. All becoming worryingly easy for England... although it might betray just how good this pitch is, and how well India bowled yesterday evening"
"touch back of a length, 83mph and curling away as Buttler shoulders arms"
shortish and poked through point on the back foot fur a couple more
"lovely line from Shami, smooth as calligraphy, a curlicue on the end as it beats Buttler's back-foot prod... Maybe a touch short, if we're quibbling"
speared in straighter and worked through midwicket
"oh, was there a sound...? No, apparently not, just Broad hanging back and missing with a push outside off"
"full length and he has a dip at this, mistimed back to the bowler"
"pinned in the crease, that's boomeranged back at Buttler... <b>but doing too much?</b> Joel Wilson certainly thinks so, and India don't have any reviews left to take issue with that decision"
drops back and works a single to the leg side
"pitched up in the channel, Buttler presses out and punches to mid-off"
"length on off, 84mph and Buttler dabs it down into the covers, they amble through for the single"
"shaping in and then out on a good length, the hokey-cokey does for Broad, but his thick-edged slash <b>flies over the slips and away for four!</b> And the scoreboard rumbles on"
"back of a length, holding its line outside off, Broad plays inside"
"flicked off the stumps towards fine leg, England wanted a second but Buttler can't get back"
"good length, defended back towards the bowler"
"nipping away off the seam from over the wicket, again Shami is fractionally short as Broad wafts at it and fails to connect"
"back of a length, 83mph and Broad is squared up but gets away with a thick edge low through gully for one"
"<b>still no luck for Shami!</b> Big swing, worthy of Benny Goodman, but it does too much with Buttler back in the crease and hanging his bat out in the wind"
"plugging away in the channel, left alone this time"
"shaping across the left-hander, short of a length and left alone"
"Broad gets bat on this, steered towards gully from the crease"
"lovely line, nipping away as Broad drops very deep and misses. Too good, which is better than too bad, I suppose"
back of a length and fended away off the body
"Broad is going so far back and across he might end up at point, he squirts this in the air through midwicket but the ball lands safely <b>and England bring up the 300</b>. Have to say I didn't see that coming"
"slanted across as Broad pushes down the wrong line, but survives once more"
"thudding into the pads with Buttler back on his stumps, Dharmasena isn't interested... Maybe a touch leg side? The ball deflects away for a leg bye"
"stays over the wicket, Broad flicks him fine for one"
"length ball in the channel, Buttler opens the face and squirts a run through backward point"
"full outside off, driven through backward point, another single on offer to the sweeper"
"good length, 86mph and shaping away in the corridor as Buttler goes back and across and leaves"
"short of a length and pushed down the leg side - and that is <b>lunch</b>, with England having tipped the game firmly back their way"
"full, from wide on the crease, push to mid-off"
"wide on the crease again, Broad paddles it for one"
"outside edge, soft hands, past slip, more runs for England"
"tries the big drive, the ball turns from the rough, goes past the outside edge, Pant doesn't collect cleanly"
goes back to defend a length ball
"flatter, into the pads, easily worked away for a single and he retains the strike"
"short of a length, outside off, punched wide of mid-off"
"short of a length, angling away, punched to cover"
"<strong>full, really full, draws the edge</strong>, but it doesn't carry to second slip and also goes wide of him. Kohli gets a hand to it, keeping them to one"
"short of a length again, angling in, punched wide of mid-on for one"
"on a length, stays back, punches it to mid-off"
"goes back to another length ball, punches it to mid-off confidently"
"on a length, outside off, Buttler goes back and takes an easy single"
"wide on the crease again, darting it in, defended to leg"
"<strong>KL Rahul is not dropping anything here</strong>. This is a sensational catch. A catch that is not quite appreciated enough when watching on TV. Broad tries to drive a length ball over mid-on, gets too much under it, and hangs it up in the air, but it looks like it will clear Rahul. Rahul, though, sprints back, keeping an eye on the ball, sees it fall over his shoulder, and then dives full length to catch it. Rahul has had a great catching series"
defended off the front foot
"fired in, defended off the back foot"
and that's where Buttler takes the single to retain strike
"full, angling in, on off, driven to mid-off"
"on a length, on the pads, clipped away to deep midwicket for four more. Dhawan runs from deep square, sticks his boot out, and nearly hurts himself by landing on the ball"
nicely punched away straight of mid-on for a single
"full and straight, Anderson defends off the back foot"
beaten outside off as he looks to defend a length ball
"and a big cheer around the ground as Anderson plays out the over. Staying back, covering the stumps, and keeping this full ball out"
reverse sweep from the middle-stump line but he can't beat the man at point
"length ball, on off, defended off the back foot"
"down the wicket, not to the pitch of the ball, pushes this to mid-on"
"short of a length, punched away to deep cover. The ball gets a bad bounce off the practice pitches but Dhawan recovers well. Buttler turns down the one"
"and Buttler takes the single, trusting Anderson to play out the last ball"
"and Anderson plays out the last ball by staying back, covering the stumps and bringing the bat down in time"
Buttler enters T20 mode and enters his 80s. Gets under a length ball and smacks it over wide long-on for a big six
drives this on the up but straight to extra cover
"bouncer, and Buttler hooks. India are bleeding. This one files over long leg. This is a top edge but it sails over the short boundary"
"slower ball, Bumrah enters T20 mode too, chips off the edge to deep cover. Buttler turns down the single"
"and Buttler takes that single, trusting Anderson to play out the last ball"
"Anderson follows the same process. Stay back, cover the stumps. Bumrah tries the full ball for lbw but slides it down the leg side. Big applause again"
"on a length, outside off, stays on the back foot to push this to extra cover"
"slightly short, but finds extra cover again"
"flighted outside off, misfielded by Kohli at extra cover, and that gives them two runs. Kohli goes one-handed at this, and gets a bad bounce"
"flatter, defended off the back foot"
"tossed up wide outside off, Buttler doesn't play at it"
"and Jadeja ends the innings. India refuse to give him the easy single to manipulate the strike, and it works for them. Buttler looks for the big shot to a length ball, it is not on, the ball turns, and takes a thick edge to slip where Rahne takes a good catch. Buttler ends on 89 and walks off to a big applause"
"punched away first ball. Goes back to a length ball that is swinging away, gets three through cover"
"fire down the leg side. Bairstow, who is back with the gloves, makes a diving collection"
"length ball, outside off, no movement, left alone"
"on a length again, Dhawan stays back and defends a length ball"
"short of a length, there us width available, and it is punched away past point. They take two"
"length ball, no movement, angles into the pads, nudged away for one"
"seam movement with an accurate ball, and Dhawan is a sitting duck here. On a length, just outside off, no swing in the air, he plays the line, and then the ball seams back in to hit him plumb in front. Dhawan has a long chat with Rahul, has half a mind of reviewing, but walks off without doing so"
"really full, some movement away, takes a bit of a leading edge to mid-off"
"full again, holds its line slightly, defended off the front foot"
"wider, full, left alone by Pujara. Broad bowling the full aggressive length"
"on a length, angling in, defended from the crease"
"slightly short of a length, no swing, hits the inside half of the bat as Pujara defends"
"wide length ball, left alone by Rahul"
"full, just outside off, defended off the front foot"
"length ball, angling in, stays back to defend"
"<strong>edged</strong>. Falls short of third slip. He advances at Anderson, who shortens the length. Rahul plays with soft hands, which is why the edge doesn't carry"
lovely shot. Only slightly short. Not too wide even. Rahul goes deep into the crease and plays the classic late cut
advancing down the wicket to drive this to mid-off
"length ball, outside off, defended off the front foot"
"wide length ball, seams away, left alone"
"swing in, but swings early, Pujara lines it up and pushes it to leg"
Pujara plays for the inswinger because that is what this length ball is in the air. Then it pitches and holds its line to <strong>beat the bat</strong>
"inswinger, into the pads, worked away for one"
"short of a length, Rahul shapes up to punch it, the ball comes back in, Rahul plays the shot still and gets a single for it"
"pitched up outside off, easing into his spell... and Rahul languidly biffs it up, up and away over cover, for an unceremonious four that may or may not have got Stokes chuntering straight off"
"short ball on the body, tucked down into the leg side... Hello, looks like KL lost his shoe going for the single there. Stokes hands it back to him at the non-striker's end, seems a friendly enough exchange. Rahul definitely looking to be positive"
"angled in, short of a length and worked away to the leg side for one more"
"back of a length, 81mph and again he's a touch straight allowing Rahul to steer one through square leg on the back foot"
"pitched up in the channel, Pujara steps across and sniffs the wind"
"touch shorter, coming in and defended back down the track"
"oh, that's not gone right... <b>Spooned over extra cover running back!</b> Rahul taking positivity a bit too far with another inside-out drive, wasn't the length for it and the bat skewed in the hands but the ball <i>juuuuuuuussst</i> manages to clear Moeen as he turned and gave chase"
"good length on off, 84mph and Pujara defends softly coming across"
"probing line, 84mph, blocked on the front foot again"
"hits a length, fourth-stump line and Pujara bows his head over a monkish block into the covers"
"sliding in, there's swing but Broad is a fraction too straight to start with and Pujara can simply tickle it to fine leg for four"
lets this one go in the channel
short of a length outside off and Rahul runs it through backward point on the back foot
"Stokes bangs it down in the channel, Pujara lets this one go"
"79mph, comes across on off stump and defends"
"over the top of off stump, Puj lines it up"
good length ball around the line of off and he's again across to defend
this swings back in appreciably at 80mph but Pujara watches the ball closely and sees it off
touch short and wide as Rahul gets into line on off stump and leaves
"length ball in the channel, looking for mischief, left well alone"
"fuller and tailing in, 83mph and met on the front foot, pushed to extra cover"
"full and driven, flowing square drive as Rahul presses out, but England have a deep point in which keeps them to a single"
"fired down in the channel, nothing doing from Che Pu"
"driven again, Broad is pitching it up but this costs him runs, nicely timed and although Buttler gamely gives chase all the way to - and then beyond - the rope he couldn't prevent four"
just back of a length outside off and defended coming across
"pitched up, not quite the yorker and Rahul gets his bat down on it"
"length on off stump, tapped into the covers"
"banged in short, Rahul swivels on the hook... and it nearly goes all the way! In the air but he got hold of it pretty well, fine leg never in the picture"
"better line and length from Stokes, defended into the off side"
lets this one zip through outside off
pitched up around the line of off and met with a solid dead bat
"fired in full, holding its line fractionally and Pujara clamps down on it in defence"
Pujara comes across and defends
"pitched up, 84mph a foot or so outside off, no stroke demanded or offered"
"good length, tight line outside off but not much swing and Pujara is happy letting it go"
"gun-barrel straight in the channel outside off, left alone"
"pushed in with the arm and then straightening a fraction on off stump, blocked off the inside half of the bat"
"length delivery, Rahul jumps across and blocks"
"excellent line, this nips away as it hits the seam to leave Rahul groping at thin air"
"spanked through the covers, not a half-volley but Rahul glides smoothly on to the front foot and creams this for four"
touch short of a length and Rahul jabs down on it
slightly back of a length in the corridor and he runs this through backward point for one
hint of shape here as Rahul comes across and plays the ball down
"ooh, this jags back late, hit the seam with Rahul lining up the away-swinger, struck on the thigh and probably heading down"
"blocked playing back, <b>and the ball bounces over the stumps!</b> Little bit of luck for Rahul, there"
comes across and steers this into a gap for one
touch short and wide as Pujara watches the ball through
"swerving in to hit the back pad, England go up for lbw... but umpire Wilson (eventually) shakes his head! That looked like an outswinger that went in rather than out again, maybe a touch high and leg side - and <b>there was some bat on it</b>, too"
"shortish length outside off, tapped through backward point"
"good pace from Stokes now, 86mph as Pujara comes across on off stump"
"back of a length, defended square from the crease"
"Stokes digs in a bouncer, aiming for the top of Pujara's block and it flies through over his shoulder as he stays low in his stance"
"another bumper, the line is around off and it is again too high to interest Puj, who ducks as it sails through"
"short of a length, 83mph outside off and tapped towards point"
"length delivery, Rahul drops it down in  front of square but cover swoops to prevent a single"
"pitched up on off, patted back towards the bowler"
"in the channel, still not much in the way of lateral movement, poked through point to the sweeper"
"tighter line, more watchful defence from Pujara propping forward"
"a touch straighter with his line, 84mph and blocked from the crease"
"ah, now is that the ball beginning to go for Anderson...? slightly short, so Pujara can track its path, but it nips away appreciably through to Bairstow"
"over the wicket, pitched up around off stump and blocked on the front foot"
"full, tempting in the channel, 78mph but Rahul doesn't bite"
"hint of inswing for Curran to the right-hander, KL covers the line"
goes back on off stump and runs a single down to third man
"touch short, 81mph on middle and leg, tucked square"
pushed across the bows and Pujara gently steers it into the off side - just a single off the over
"pushed through on the stumps, touch short and Rahul clips into short leg off the back foot - Cook actually turned his back on the ball, which isn't what you're supposed to do. Don't think he'll last there"
turned with the spin for a single behind square
tossed up and Pujara comes well down the track to defend
"big shout for lbw, Pujara lunging out and hit on the front pad as the ball spins in... Not given! Probably outside the line, plenty of doubt for the umpire"
"<b>dropped!</b> Cook can't cling on one-handed! That was a genuine chance, very catchable as the ball caught the inside edge and then ricocheted off the pad - he seemed to get a good paw to it diving to his left, but the ball went quickly and then to ground! It was actually past him, so tough to react in time"
"dragged down now, Pujara whirls on a forehand smash to deep square leg to finish an eventful over"
"bit of width on off, Rahul runs one off the back foot"
lets this one go in the channel
"pitched up in the corridor, Pujara is happy to leave those"
"well bowled, draws Pujara out, looking for the inswinger but it skips away off the surface, past the outside edge"
"full, Che Pu presses forward and defends on off stump"
"good length, 82mph a foot outside off, lets it go"
"fizzed down outside off and there's some grip, the ball stays a little low as Rahul gets the toe of the bat down on it in defence"
tossed up and blocked coming across
"flighted, now Rahul waltzes out to meet it, clipped into the ground through mid-on for one"
"pushed through quicker to Pujara, who blocks coming forwards"
"flatter and played on the back foot, dabbed for a single behind square on the off side"
"tossed up, slightly wide and punched through the covers, they'll come back for two before heading off for <b>tea</b>"
"on a length, pitches on leg, angles towards off, defended off the front foot"
"nicely put away by Pujara. Short of a length, there is room available, and Pujara rocks back to punch it through point. Half-century for this partnership"
"fuller this time, Pujara drives to mid-on"
"on a length, middle and off, no swing, defended off the back foot"
"on a length, on the pads, nicely clipped away for a single"
"pitches this up, around that off stump, and Rahul defends off the front foot"
Pujara skips down the wicket to defend one
"down the wicket again, this one turns from the rough but doesn't bounce much. Defended well"
"right to thie pitch of this one, drives to the left of Moeen who makes a diving save"
"leaves the crease again, not to the pitch of the ball, but does well to drop it down to leg"
and he finally gets the short ball after having skipped down four balls in a row. Gets a single to deep point
"premeditated paddle sweep, he gives up the stumps, the ball turns from the rough, past his bat, and <strong>just over the stumps</strong> and past Bairstow. Rahul is playing positively, and with that come a few close calls"
"on a length, holds its line in front of middle, defended to leg"
"full, just outside off, driven nicely but fails to beat mid-off"
"short of a length, outside off, punched wide of mid-off"
pulled away. The pitch doesn't have much pace so keeps this short ball down well
"on a length, just outside off, angling away, left alone"
"slight swing but from around leg, and the only person it bothers is Bairstow, who dives to his left to collect this"
"sharp turn from the rough, takes <strong>the inside edge</strong> but goes wide of short leg"
"Pujara down the wicket, not to the pitch of the ball, but kicks it away"
"slightly too full, clipped to leg, but not past the diving short midwicket"
"leaves the crease again, gets to the pitch of the ball and drives it back to Moeen"
"and jumps down the track again, Moeen maintains the length, Pujara plays with the turn, and gets a single to deep midwicket"
"tossed up, nearly a half-volley, driven to long-on for a single"
"this is like <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFOjvZaXeQ8' target='_blank'>Wasim Akram to Dravid</a> at a slower pace and slight less seam and slightly less dramatic. Unplayable ball. Shapes up to swing back in the air, it is swinging back, pitches on middle and off, Rahul has to play for the swing, but it pitches and seams the other way to beat the outside edge and hit the top of off. Sensational bowling"
bouncer first up. Kohli a little late to sight it but good enough to stay away from its line
"on a length, at the stumps, defended from the crease"
"slight swing back, enough to draw an inside edge onto the pad from Kohli"
"short ball, about chest high, defended off the back foot"
"this one angles away, but Kohli is right forward in a solid defensive shot"
"Moeen is in the rough again, Pujara forward in defence but not to the pitch of the ball"
"down the wicket, not to the pitch of the ball, and kicks it away"
"leaves the crease again, the ball is not in his reach again, it turns in, hits the inside half of the bat, but goes wide of short leg"
Pujara still leaves the crease and drives with the turn to get a single to deep midwicket
"<strong>beaten first up</strong>. Beautiful bowling. Slow. Teasing. Dropping on him. Then turning from the rough. Past the inside edge. Hits the pad, which is outside the line"
"slightly shorter, allows him to go back and work it for a slightly risky single to square leg"
"the swing last ball has got Kohli playing at balls he shouldn't be playing at. Full, just outside off, Kohli plays for the swing, the ball goes with the angle, and <strong>beats him</strong>"
"on a length outside off, allowed to angle away to the keeper"
"short of a length, Kohli is ready on the back foot, works it past square leg for two"
"full, swinging in a touch but not as much as Kohli expects. Runs off the outside half of the bat to cover"
"on a length, pretty straight, angling towards off, defended off the front foot"
"this one does swing back in, past the bat, but headed down the leg side when it hits Kohli's pad"
"slightly short of that rough, Pujar goes back to play it to leg, but there are two short midwickets in place to deny him the single"
"shortish again, punched to the squarer of the short midwickets"
"on a length this time, no misbehaviour from the pitch, defended to leg"
"turning from too straight, and worked through the leg gully area for two"
"too short again, worked square on the leg side for a single"
"slightly fuller than the rough, whipped away to deep midwicket for one"
"short of a length, outside off, looks to run it to third man, but the slow pace of the pitch means he ends up playing this towards backward point"
"<strong>beaten</strong>. Curran is beating the Kohli bat with alarming frequency. On a length, around off, it seams away a touch. Kohli plays for the swing. Doesn't get a touch"
"short of a length this time, pushed between point and cover for two"
"that is the thing with Kohli. You can trouble him all you want, but the moment you make a mistake, he climbs into you. This is a half-volley with no swing. Kohli leans into it with a cover-drive between mid-off and cover"
"on a length, around off, defended off the back foot"
big inswinging attempted yorker. Kohli equal to it. Picks it off the toes for a single to square leg
"that's a drag down from Moeen, and Kohli goes deep into the crease to pull this for four"
"still not in the rough, allows Kohli to go back, but this time he plays this to short midwicket"
"Kohli allowed to stay back again, works this offbreak to square leg. No run"
"Kohli looks intent to stay back. This is a length ball, but he goes back to work this to short leg"
"tossed up this time, but too full and too wide, driven against the turn without trouble"
"lovely batting. Skips down the wicket, finally is at optimum distance from the pitch to of the ball to be able to play an attacking shot. Drives this straight of mid-on, all along the ground"
"<strong>and nearly gets Kohli first up</strong>. On a length, outside off, seaming away, Kohli has a push at it. Beaten. Anderson must be wondering what he needs to do to get that edge and for a fielder to hold on to it"
"fuller, draws the drive, gets the edge, but a really thick and soft one, which rolls to point"
"Anderson thinks he has finally got Kohli. Dharmasena says no. England review for lbw. This seems like a fantastic decision from Dharmasena on the first sighting. And Anderson is denied again. Full ball, just outside off, late swing back in, beats him comprehensively. Not given on the field. The review shows umpire's call on impact. <strong>Oh Anderson comes aww so close again</strong>"
"and Kohli rubs it in by ruthlessly punishing the loose ball, clipped away off the toes for four"
"on a length, just outside off, Kohli walks into the shot and defends solidly"
"straight, on a length, Kohli defends to leg"
"full, outside off, left alone"
"wide length ball, left alone again"

"outswinger, just outside off, Kohli presses forward to defend it"
"on a length outside off again, swings away, and allowed to do so by Kohli"
"goes wider on the crease, makes Kohli play because of the angle. Defended off the middle of the bat"
"on a length, outside off, left alone again. Back to that Edgbaston-like contest now. Don't expect Kohli to take any risks here"
"<strong>beaten</strong>. Double attack here. Broad bowls full, Pujara has a nibble, the ball holds its line, the edge is not taken"
"tries the inswinger, Pujara equal to it, and England have the field for it with a midwicket in place. Normal conventional swing this time"
"length ball outside off, defended off the front foot"
"wide length ball, left alone after getting a big stride in"
"inswinger now, on a length, shaping back towards off, Pujara solid in defence"
"another inswinger, from wide on the crease, Pujara drives wide of midwicket this time. Brings up India's 100"
"length-ball outswinger, left alone"
"tries the lbw ball at the stumps, defended from the crease"
"outswinger now, Pujara watches it closely, lets it to through to the keeper"
"on a length, just outside off, swings away, left alone"
"this is a very rare mistake from Pujara. He is mindful of that inswinger threat. He might just have premeditated because of that after Anderson has been bowling outswingers all over long. This is on a length, outside off, Pujara commits to a push, and the swing away takes the edge. Anderson gets rewards but this is not the man he really really wants"

"full, outside off, pushed wide of mid-off for one"
"on a length, just outside off, swings away, defended from the crease"
"full, outside off, pushed to cover"
"and Anderson keeps taking men other than Kohli. Lovely bowling. Goes wide on the crease, makes Rahane play the angle back in, and then swings it late and away. Takes a healthy edge to first slip"
"goes full, looking for the inswinger, I think, and Vihari prods tentatively forward in defence, takes the inside half of the bat"
"short ball, coming in at the body, deflected wide of Bairstow as Kohli gets his hands up out of the way"
"hangs a length ball out wide, Vihari lets it go"
"big in-dipper, smacking into the back leg, England go up in unison... but Joel Wilson shakes his head! Thoughts of a review from England, but they elect not to. Swung a long way, and maybe height was a question"
"good length in the channel, he's happy to leave again"
"angled in with the arm, 85mph and worked to the on side"
pitched up and tapped into the covers coming forwards
"full and swinging late as Kohli closes the bat face, a low edge runs back towards the bowler and Anderson sticks out a hand to grab it in his follow through"

slightly back of a length and left alone outside off
"nipping back again, struck high on the front leg - this time it's given! Vihari now <b>reviews</b>, and it looks like the bounce may save him. Yep, that was clearing leg stump by a distance, <b>so umpire Wilson's decision is overturned!</b> Stay calm, Stuart!"
touch back of a length and tapped down into the on side
"gets off the mark in Tests, <b>although he nearly runs himself out in so doing!</b> Dropped short into the covers and Moeen races in, the underarm throw would have tested Vihari's stretch for the line - but it misses!"
"short of a length, Kohli is deep in the crease and working a single behind square on the leg side"
"pitched up around off stump, met coming forwards"
"full, swinging sharply and late, Vihari lines it up okay, though, punches to mid-off"
"pitched up a touch wide of the stumps, Kohli leaves it be"
"pushed in straighter, trying to inveigle the ball between bat and pad, Kohli defends"
"full, nibbling off the pitch as Kohli's bat comes down at an angle... <b>but a thick edge loops in front of backward point!</b> Kohli duped, but the chance doesn't go to hand"
back of a length and worked away off the hip
"dug in short, only 78mph but Vihari ducks it"
comes across and defends into the off side
"full and shaping in, flicked in the air, <b>out of reach of leg slip's dive!</b> England thought their trap had worked for a moment there!"
Vihari drops on to the back foot and defends softly
"short of a length, dabbed away through backward point from the crease"
"bumper, at the body, Kohli is in an awkward position trying to pull but with the leg-side catcher in his mind, manages to punch it square for one"

"short ball, 84mph, lets it go outside off"
"probing away outside off, Vihari continues to play watchfully, no stroke offered"
full and wide enough for the batsman to ignore as it bobbles through
"banged in and cracked to the fence, punishing pull shot from Kohli, sends it for four to deep backward square leg"
"half an appeal for lbw, mostly from behind the stumps, the ball veered in late to hit high up the pad - heading down"
"good length in the channel, Vihari is across and shouldering arms"
"coming back, but this started quite wide and he can leave once again"
"rising off a length, 82mph, tight defence on off"
"pitched up, again looking for the inswinger as Vihari presses out to defend. He's taking his time, here, but looks in good order... Not flustered by the lbw-that-wasn't and the lbw-that-wasn't-given"
"shortish outside off, Kohli calmly watches it through"
"full and very wide, doesn't tempt Kohli - though he would have need go-go-Gadget arms to reach it"
"short ball, 80mph and swatted away through midwicket for a single"
pushed down the leg side as Vihari comes across
"good length on off stump, 85mph and defended pressing forwards"

"better length, curving in as the batsman steps out and defends on off stump"
"touch too full and straight to finish, clipped past square leg for a couple more - expensive over, Kohli easing his way up towards fifty"
"banged in short, Vihari takes on the pull... <b>and a top edge sails all the way over the rope at fine leg!</b> Not in control, but he got plenty of bat on it. Ollie Pope then put down the catch, one-handed, over by the dugout"

"short ball, Kohli pulls imperiously, no worries about his technique, just one to deep square leg"
"full outside off, there's a sound as Vihari tries to jam down on the ball... was it an outside edge? No, bat on ground, from the looks of it!"
draws a false shot again! Length ball outside off and it doesn't come back in as Vihari follows it
"ooh, that's a top shot to finish another eventful over, caressed down the ground - lovely timing for a straight four"
lets this one go outside off
"Stokes strikes, lands the big fish! <b>Flashy drive and Kohli edges to second slip!</b> Plenty of passion/spirit/niggle flying around out there, Stokes in the thick of it, and Kohli has made a misjudgement... Driving on the up with the ball just holding its line, Root gobbled up the chance.

"slightly fuller, closer to off, this time Jadeja doesn't play at it"

"outswinger that starts outside off, and has been left alone"
"on a length, Vihari gets a stride in, and then watches it swing away to the keeper"
"not yet, still bowling the outswinger, <strong>and beats Vihari</strong>. He finally has a push at a widish length ball. Lucky not to edge it"
another outswinger. <strong>Another play and miss</strong>. Angle from wide on the crease makes it tougher to leave this length ball
"in the air this looks like it will be an inswinger, pitches full and just outside off. Vihari has to play at it, but the ball pitches and seams away. <strong>Beaten again</strong>"
"wide length ball, shaping away, left alone"
"slightly short of a length, angling in, Jadeja plays at it, but the ball seams away to beat the outside edge. India enjoying the kind of luck England did. But will this last for as long as it did for England?"
"<strong>beauty</strong>. Fuller this time. Around that 6m length. Jadjea has to play at the angle, but the ball pitches, kicks and leaves him. Beaten again"
"<strong>and another play and miss</strong>. Broad keeps getting a few inches fuller, and still the edge eludes him. Jadeja pushes at the line but doesn't follow the movement away with his hands"
"tries the straighter ball for an lbw now, but it slides down the leg for a leg-bye"

"full outside off, swinging away, Jadeja resists the temptation of having a go"
"<strong>another play and miss</strong>. Almost the perfect ball. In the 5m area, which is full. Close to the off stump. Jadeja has to play at it. The ball just swings too much"
"<strong>now he gets the edge</strong> but it falls well short of the third slip. On a length, on off, Jadeja plays at it but with soft hands"
"overcompensates. Bowls too full, which is still okay, but he bowls this on the leg stump. Jadeja doesn't miss out. The ball reaches the square leg fence in a matter of seconds"

"outswinger, starts around off, on a length, defended from the crease"

"<strong>another play and miss</strong>. This is full, pitches within the stumps, draws a drive, but moves too much to take the edge"
"tries the big inswinger, but bowls a wide half-volley,which Vihari - after hours of anticipation - accepts gleefully and drives it through cover"
"now the accurate inswinger, but Vihari is equal to it. Letting it swing and plays it right under his head for a single round the corner"
"full, just outside off, the ball seams to hit the inside half of the bat, and they steal a single to mid-on. Anderson goes at Vihari's end, who didn't know the throw is coming at his end, and casually makes his ground without sliding the bat in. <strong>No direct hit, no drama</strong>"
"<strong>another edge refuses to go to hand on the full</strong>. Length ball outside off, enough to draw uncertainty because he has been bowling a lot of inswing. This ball holds its line. Vihari's soft hands makes sure it falls short and goes between the first and second slips"
"on a length, just outside off, no movement, defended solidly"
"on a length, around off, he has to play at it. Does well, defending it under his head"
"full and wide outside off, easy leave for Jadeja"
"nicely played by Jadeja. Length ball again, around middle and leg, angles towards off, Jadeja plays with soft hands and an open face, guiding it down and wide of the slips. No third man in place"

"probing away from round the wicket to the left-hander, Jadeja lets this one go too"
"<B>huge appeal!</b> Have to say, I thought there was a sound, and Stokes is convinced! <B>England review</b>. This one just cramped Jadeja for room on the back foot, but nope, UltraEdge is clear. Another tremendous call from Dhamasena who hasn't got much wrong at all in this Test"

"outside off, attempted sweep and strikes the pad"
"stretching forward, a snick off the edge as the ball turns back in from a tight fourth-stump line, and <strong>up goes the finger!</strong> But hang on, Vihari <B>reviews</B>. His bat and pad were very adjacent ... but so too was the ball. UltraEdge confirms a medley of noise at the moment of impact, and the third umpire has 'no reason to overturn'... England have their wicket!"
"slides on with the arm and beats the edge! Tremendous line and length, testing the new man"
"pressing forward, and gathered on the bounce by silly point. A successful over, in the final ten minutes of the session"

"flatter, quicker, fuller, pushed to long-on for a single"
"<strong>big lbw shout</strong>. Not given. England don't review. This is pitched middle, doesn't turn, beats the inside edge, hits him in front of middle and leg. Not given. Not straightening enough. Umpire's call on the replay"
"flighted, pushed to mid-on"
"short and flat, cut wide of sweepr cover for two"
"cut away again, Moeen too short twice in a row"
"the drift gets Ishant. Just like Vihari. Flighted offbreak, moves away in the air, gets out of his eyeline. He plays the defensive shot for the offbreak, but it doesn't turn in as much as expected. But enough to take the outside edge"
"nice offbreak, this one turns back in to hit the inside half of the defensive bat"
"on a length, on off, right forward to defend"
"wrong'un, the line outside leg gives it away, defended to leg"
"slightly short, cut away for a single. No, hang on, he turns the run down"

"flighted, Jadeja reaches its pitch and turns this to short midwicket"
"long hop, Jadeja cuts in front of square, but Buttler makes a diving save at extra cover"
"He punches this shortish ball nonchalantly between point and cover, dusts off his sword, telling India he has been kept away from action for way too long, and then wields it. Another fifty for Jadeja"
"fat, punched away, can't beat point"
"long hop, pulled away to long-on for single"
Rashid is the gift that keeps giving. To India. Another long hop. Pulled away to deep midwicket. Surely England get Rashid out of the attack after this?
"wrong'un, too short, pushed to point for one. Jadeja has decided he doesn't need to shield Shami from Rashid"
"turns out he needed to shield Shami. Not from Rashid, but from himself. He has return-gifted Rashid a wicket. Has an almighty swing at a wrong'un with an in-and-out field in place. Broad takes the catch at long-on. Not good from Shami"
"dropped at silly point. An on-target googly, full, turning back in - would be plumb lbw but for the inside edge - goes to the left of silly point where Jennings can't hold on"

"Jadeja takes a four. Anderson tries to bowl wide outside off, Jadeja opens the face on it, gets a thick edge, which flies between the first slip and the wide one"
"<strong>all happening</strong>. Shouts of catch it, but it seems to have gone off Bumrah's body to Bairstow on the half-volley. Jadeja wants to steal the bye, Bumrah not open to it, Jadeja has to rush back to his station"
"<strong>falls short</strong>. Broad digs this in short, the ball tails back in as Bumrah tries to leave it. Anyway, it has come off the arm guard"
"bouncer now, wide outside off, easy to leave it"
"there is the full ball, swinging back in, defended back to Broad. Draws a big cheer from the Indian supporters in the crowd"
"bouncer, tails back in as Bumrah tries to swerve out of its line. Does well to avoid a blow"
"<strong>nearly bowled as he leaves alone an inswinger</strong>. Doesn't come back enough, though. Bumrah has survived a whole over"
this length ball seams back in as Jadeja sets him up for a big shot. Inside edge onto the thigh pad
"length ball, slight shape away, pushed to deep point, and turns down the single"
"on a length, outside off, defended from the crease"
"but hang on, Jadeja doesn't give him two balls. He gives Anderson a big hit. This is fullish, swinging in, and he has smacked it back over Anderson's head. Deficit under 60"
"short, into the body, tries the pull, misses, Bairstow makes the collection down the leg side"
and Jadeja keeps the strike now with a single he runs down to third man
<strong>beaten</strong> as Jadeja pushes at a swinging ball outside off
"Jadeja continues to frustrate England. This is a good length ball, swinging back in, hits Jadeja's pad and flies wide of slip for a couple. Just one slip in place now"
"full, speared into the toes, Jadeja has a swing but is beaten on the inside edge"
Jadeja hooks and he does so fine of long leg. He is hurting England as the deficit is around 50 now
"he goes for the big hit to a full ball, which swings away and <strong>beats him again</strong>"
"Broad bowls a full wide one, Jadeja drives, the fielder at point gets a touch to it, and they take the single. Deficit exactly 50. Jadeja on strike first over"
"full, around off, gets an inside edge, thinks of a single but decides to farm the strike"
driven to deep extra cover and he turns down the single
"lovely running. He has mis-hit this towards long-on, and has the presence of mind to know there is two available here, and has the speed to back it up. Lovely batting"
"mows a length ball across the line, there is no deep midwicket in place. Jadeja has given the Indian supports a voice in the stands"
"short ball, Jadeja mis-hits the hook, but it clears mid-on who is up. They take two. Not one. Should have taken just the one"
"Anderson tries the short ball into the ribs, but Jadeja coolly taps it behind square on the leg side for a single. Retains the strike"
"half-volley, driven to long-off"
"full again, nearly yorker length, pushed to mid-off"
"on a length, punched to long-off, turns down the single"

"flighted outside off, pushed towards deep point, turns down another single"
"length ball outside off, defended off the front foot"
"full, half-volley, dug out, Bairstow appeals for toe first, but it is not"
this one <strong>turns past the bat</strong> as Jadeja looks to defend
"Moeen does well. Accurate delivery, draws a defensive shot, doesn't give Jadeja the option to attack without a risk. The ball doesn't turn, hits the inside edge of the bat. Short fine leg is in to deny them the single"
"outside off, no need to play against that one"
"shaping in on the pads, an ambitious appeal but clearly sliding down. Good full length though"
"pressing forward, repelling all borders"
"another optimistic shout, this time for a lobbed catch to short leg. No bat involved, and clearly leg-sided. A few bob each way there."
"another big inswinger, but Bumrah is equal to the task once again, striding forward to smother the ball with bat almost pressed straight down in the crease"
"back and across, good line and length from Broad, but Bumrah is right behind the line. Job done for now"
"fully onto the front foot, looking to stroke the ball into a two-sized gap"
"forward, nudged to the leg side, again from round the wicket"
"tossed up, dipping on middle and leg, stabbed to the on side"
"forward, blocked into the off side"
"back of a length, punched to mid-on, thinks of the single but it's not on yet"
"<strong>there it goes!</strong> Jadeja wafted to short square leg ... Bumrah was back on his heels and was in no position to respond. Broad's shy is fast and flat, the bails are whipped off with ease by Bairstow, and India's battling innings is done"
"sharp pace on a leg-stump line, rises into the thigh-pad as Cook is squared up"
"onto the back foot, and a ripple of applause as Cook lays bat on this one, tapped to short midwicket"
"well bowled, bursting off the seam, and angling across Cook, who just about doesn't commit to a stab outside off"
"a more confident leave, wider line, shaping away, not chasing that one"
"squared up a touch on a fuller length, takes a fat outside-edge but squirts along the ground to backward point"
"through to the keeper, back of a length, easily left alone. A maiden to launch proceedings"
"<B>beautiful line from round the wicket.</b> Drawing Jennings into the drive, with bounce and movement off the seam. Chancy!"
"<B>huge appeal!</b> This one jags back into the front pad, but the bounce is key here, surely climbing over the stumps, for all that Jennings was beaten all ends up"
"well bowled again, hanging this one just half a yard further back, and bending off the seam. Jennings uses soft hands to drop it into the cordon, reasonably confidently"
"lovely shape out of the hand, straightening on an off-stump line and drawing Jennings down the pitch"
"forward and blocked into the leg side, a straighter line this time."
"strays onto the pads, and Jennings is away with a calm flick through backward square"
"slanting across the left-hander, shaping from leg to off, and fended away with neutral footwork"
"whistling past the off stump, too wide to draw a stroke this time"
"well bowled, so tight to the edge of the bat, and climbing off the seam"
"a fraction wider, Jennings leaves alone again"
"solid in defence, and poked back down the track. There was the inswinger, but this time Jennings' bat was in position to respond"
"on the back foot, blocked back down the pitch"
"well bowled, lovely lift off the deck as Cook can't help but follow the movement away from the bat"
"much fuller and straighter, attacking the stumps but Cook chisels hard off the pads to short midwicket. Well positioned fielder cuts off the runs"
"defended on the back foot, body on the line as Ishant keeps it tight and straight"
sliding down the leg side
"another one that does too much, or rather asks the ball to do too much. Just goes with the angle from round the wicket, sliding past leg stump, instead of bending deviously into the hands of the cordon"
"<B>in the air but safe!</b> Cook stretches forward, and that's a fat outside edge, flies fast and square past the right hand of gully. Close!"
forward and blocked to the off side
"on the back foot, defended back to the bowler"
"inside-edged, down into the crease as Bumrah lifts one into Jennings' back-foot poke"
"glided into the covers, well enough timed and placed, and ironic cheers for the single"
"on the hip, tucked through square leg. Cook is off the mark with another trademark nudge to the boundary. The game will miss that, truly..."
forward and pressed to cover
"swinging into the legs, clipped sweetly in front of square. Each peasy"
head over the ball... forward and poked to cover
"sliding into line on the back foot, pushed back whence it came"
"outside off, no stroke this time"
"stretching forward, pushed into the leg side"
"patted out to point, it's tough going out there"
"outside off, another play and miss to launch his spell"
"that's more like the shot he was looking for, a half-committed drive, just watching the ball into the middle of a measured push to wide long-on"
"on the pads, and make that 2223 runs in leg-side clips for Cook! You can't bowl there to Alastair Cook ..."
"<B>massive appeal, but outside the line!</b> Trapped on the crease by the one that keeps coming back in from round the wicket, but that flicks the pad-flap with the stumps still visible round Cook's legs"
"<strong>beaten!</strong> Shami, in between a few loose ones, is picking up where he left off in the first innings. Another one ghosts past the edge with a proud seam and good bounce"
"steadily into line, poked back down the track"
slides back to defend
"nudged through the leg side, much like his first-innings dismissal, but picks the gap this time"
"leg-stump line, looking to straighten into the pads. Cook playing round his front pad"
flicked to the leg side once again
"well bowled, biting the rough outside the left-hander's off stump and leaping into Jennings' midriff"
squared up on a leg-stump line and defended again
nurdled out to square leg
"pressing on the up, into the covers."
sizzler... bursts past the edge with a wondrous seam position. Can't lay bat on that one!
"<strong>that's unplayable!</strong> Angling in to the left-hander, exploding off a perfect length and beating the outside edge of a committed drive. What's a bowler to do?"
"<B>beaten again</b>. This is absurd. Shami just dangles it out there, his perfect wrist position demanding movement off the deck and getting it. Cook is all at sea"
"forward, solid, finds the middle of the bat to finish the session! A grin from Cook as he looks at his bat in grim triumph. He's passed his first test of his second innings of his last Test."
stays back to defend a length ball
big lbw appeal as Jadeja beats him on the sweep but he has got himself out of the line. Kohli reviews the not-out call. And the replays confirm it. Clearly outside the line. <strong>Another poor review from India</strong>
half forward to defend a length ball to leg
"plays another sweep, this time he succeeds and paddles it through the vacant leg slip region. Surprised to see no fielder there. This is where he was caught last innings"
"short of a length, could be runs, but stays low, and he can't time this"
"another shortish ball stays low, punched wide of cover for a single this time"
"wide on the crease, wide length ball, Jennings shoulders arms"
"short of a length, angling in, defended back to Shami"
"wide on the crease, on a length, angling in, no seam, defended off the front foot"
"<strong>another beauty from Shami</strong>. This holds its line against the angle, beats the forward defensive, and what's more it wobbles late on Pant, who ends up parrying this away for four byes"
"short of a length, angling in, defended to leg"
"wide length ball, left alone. Another late wobble on this. Pant collects this clean, though"
"tossed up full, 91kph, defended"
"flatter, Cook goes back to punch it, but the ball stays low and <strong>beats his bat</strong>"
"flighted this time, Cook right forward in defence"
"flatter, and Cook goes back to push this to mid-on"
"really full, 93kmph, pushed to mid-off"
"big lbw shout as there is big turn from the rough, but again it seems to have hit him outside the line. Kohli reviews it again after much deliberation. Cook is on the back foot this time. Impact way outside the line, and India have lost the reviews already. Kohli just getting desperate. <strong>Is this the fastest any side has exhausted its reviews in Test cricket?</strong>"
"wide length ball, left alone"
"confident drive off the front foot, straight to cover, though"
"on a length, angling in, defended to leg"
"no need for reviews on this. Shami finally strikes. Poor shot from Jennings. Poor leave actually. The first rule of leaving is that you cover your stumps and at least make the umpire make the lbw decision. Here Jennings leaves the ball, but his off stump is exposed. This length ball seams back in, and takes the top of that exposed off stump"
"wide on the crease, angling it in, defended to leg"
"wide length ball, Moeen leans forward, uses soft hands, drops this into the covers, and pinches a single to get off the mark"
forward defensive. Jadeja wants this. One might pop up
swept away right away. Moeen doesn't want Jadeja to settle into his groove. Gets four. Keeps this down
forward defensive again
"wide on the crease, on a length, defended back to him"
"<strong>natural variation</strong>. That's how Moeen got his wickets. Length ball, outside off, Moeen plays for the turn, but the ball goes straight on to beat him"
"flatter, Moeen goes right back to push this to short midwicket"
"full, outside off, left alone. Cook covers the stumps when doing so"
<strong>beaten again</strong>. Length ball. Cook pushes from the crease. The ball seams back in but not as much as Cook seems to have budgeted for
"wide on the crease, length ball, angling in, left alone. Again covers the stumps when he does so"
"fuller, closer too, Cook has to play at it, and he does so defensively to leg"
"short of a length, Cook looks to play off the hip, but the ball stops on him a touch. Ends up playing this back to Shami"
"solid front-foot defensive to end the over. Shami asking the right questions, and so far, with some luck, Cook has ma aged to survive"
gentle pace to loosen himself up with. Left alone outside off
Pant has to stretch himself down the leg side to prevent byes this time. Two looseners now
"short of a length, Moeen resists the opportunity to cut it. Leaves it alone"
"short of a length, outside off, seaming away, Moeen plays inside the line of it"
"short of a length again, angling in, Moeen defends it"
"short of a length again, around off again, Moeen defends watchfully"
"wide length ball, and Cook has a strange push at it. Unlike him. That is all thanks to the seam movement on other balls. <strong>Beaten once again</strong>"
"really wide length ball, Pant does the rest"
"<strong>and he beats Cook again</strong>. Wide on the crease, makes Cook play the angle, and then after pitching the ball leaves him. This is a very unusual Test for Shami"
"a touch too full, easily defended to mid-on this time"
"wide on the crease again, this one continues with the angle, and Cook defends this back to Shami"
"full, wide sucker delivery, Cook has a drive at it, and it <strong>still manages to seam away and beat him</strong>. Some day Shami is going to get five wickets in three overs to even out this amount of bad luck"
"on a length, middle and off, seams away against the angle just as Moeen looks to play this to leg. Also there is extra bounce. Hits him high on the bat as he defends this back to Bumrah"
"on a length, just outside off, shapes away, defended under his head by Moeen"
he is getting progressively fuller and straighter. Gets it to shape away too. Moeen has to be watchful in defence
"on a length, around off, defended from the crease again"
"this one seams back in from a similar area. Moeen is playing them late, and adjusts to defend this to leg"
"on a length, straightens a touch, runs off a soft outside edge to point"
"full, outside off, driven square, point is deepish, cuts this off. No single even because the man is Jadeja"
length ball from wide on the crease. Defended off the back foot
<strong>he beats the bat once again</strong>. Cook plays the length ball for the angle but it leaves him and somehow manages to miss the edge
finally gets a slightly loose ball. A touch too short. He goes back to softly punch it past point for two. First runs of the session for Cook
"wide on the crease, short of a length, straight, punched to mid-on"
"people say Shami should bowl fuller to take the edge but he is <strong>beating the bat even with long half-volleys</strong>. This is driving length if ever there was one. Cook is not striding out forward, that gives the ball the time to seam away, and - surprise surprise - once again miss the edge"
"full, driven to long-on for an easy single"
"tries to sweep a full ball from outside off, it stays low, Pant manages to get his leg in the way and prevent byes"
goes back to defend a length ball
"<strong>beaten on the sweep</strong>, half a shout for lbw, but this is well outside the line. Who knows India might have reviewed this too? If they could, that is"
pushed to deepish mid-on and pinches a single
lovely chip shot after leaving his crease. Clears midwicket. That's all he is trying to do. Gets two
"short of a length, stays low, he manages to keep it out, and takes a single to leg"
"full, angling in, drivable length, Moeen has a drive, but it seams to beat the bat. <strong>Again</strong>"
"Moeen flashes, and as a man in the Indian dressing room used to say, flashes hard. Wide length ball, and he just goes after it. Not in control, but he manages to send this between the slips and point"
"Moeen refuses to drive this time, and defends one back down the ground"
"short of a length, seams back in, <strong>beats the inside edge this time</strong>. Good thing he didn't take the edge but because Pant fails to collect it cleanly. Another bye against him"
"a touch too full, a touch too straight, punched straight of mid-on for a boundary that will surely bring him relief, and will also bring a lot of statisticians considerable anguish. He doesn't stop at 12345 career runs. Skips the station altogether"
"wide on the crease, fullish, this time they have the mid-on up to prevent the easy single"
"short of a length, Moeen doesn't cut"
"on a length, stays back to defend it"
"down the wicket, not to the pitch of the ball, ends up defending. Can do so because there is no silly point in"
"too full this time, pushed wide of mid-on for a single"
"on a length, outside off, Cook gets a stride in and defends"
"on a length, straight, shapes towards off, defended back to him"
"close to the umpire, on a length, just outside off, defended from the crease. Playing them right under his head"
"on a length, pitches middle, seams back in, beats the inside edge. Going down. India lose another opportunity to waste a review because they have only two reviews every innings"
"length ball, outside off, left alone as it straightens a touch"
"length ball, outside off, seams away, kicks up too, but too wide to make him play. Pant collects it by his throat"
"on a length again, no seam, angles in, and Moeen defends it"

"tossed up outside off, defended"
"full, outside off, worked to leg for one"
"length ball, middle and off, defended with an open face"
"<strong>dropped by Rahul</strong>. Finally he too drops one. Everything is now officially going wrong for India. Ishant hangs this out there, asking Moeen to drive. He does. Gets a thick edge. Rahul drops it at second slip. Head high. Just travels too quickly for him. Just bursts through his reverse cup"
"on a length, middle and off, angling away, defended with an open face"
"on a length, holds its line in front of off, defended to mid-off"
this is pitched outside leg but holds up a little and Moeen ends up playing it back to Ishant as opposed to the leg-side clip
"length ball, middle and off, defended from the crease"
"full, outside off, defended back to Jadeja"
"length ball outside off, defended off the back foot"
"full, outside off, driven wide of mid-off for one"

swept away from outside off for one
"length ball outside off, defended off the front foot"
"on a length, pitches outside leg, defended back to him"

"short of a length, punched to cover-point"
"length ball on the pads, clipped away for a single"
"stoutly onto the front foot, and punched firmly out to deep cover. A confident resumption from the man of the moment"
"big bite from outside off, Moeen goes back to defend bu this one leaps at his midriff"
"more confidently blocked on a similar line, less venom in that delivery"
"<B>bowled through the gate!</B> Well, the new nut has done the trick for India, but that was also an unnecessarily loose drive out of that dangerous rough from Moeen, a man who has done well to shelve his flights of fancy in this match, but couldn't resist this time. It was, also, to be fair, a fine ball, biting off the ideal line and length and crashing into the stumps, via an inside-edge. A timely strike!"
cautiously defended into the off side
"a fraction too much width, a well-judged backcut, and he's off the mark"
"tight line, a hint of shape across the left-hander. Cook won't be lured there"
more tempting bend towards the cordon. Another leave
"forward, and poked into the covers"
"round the wicket to mix up the line, Cook leaves once again as Ishant ploughs that furrow outside off"
"shaping into the thigh pad, Cook can't flick this one away"
through to the keeper
"back of a length, too much width, Root seizes the rare loose ball and batters it through backward point"
"on the back foot, sliding back and across to defend once more"
"<strong>that's a lovely strike</strong>. Emboldened by the previous four, this is nowhere near a long-hop, tighter line too, and an open-faced punch fizzes through third man"
"faster, flatter, Root defends"
"hustled on the back foot, forced into his shell by the pace of Jadeja's darts"
leaning forward to smother the spin on the front dog this time
"off-line to open his spell, Cook chips firmly off his pads for the umpteenth time in 291 Test innings, and picks off more runs to no-man's land at deep midwicket"

"rising onto his toes on the back foot, stabbed to the cordon"
looking to work the ball to leg from outside the line of off stump
"through to the keeper, no stroke this time"
dabbed to short cover
"<B>inside-edged drive!</B> A touch loose as Cook is tempted rather as Moeen was before him, but gets away with it"
chopped through backward point
"<B>pops up in the air, Kohli scampers back but can't cling on in one hand at backward point!</b> Was there bat? Not convinced, but lots of excitement!"
deflected into the cordon as Jadeja hustles from round the wicket
"skids through once again, tight wicket-to-wicket line"
"clipped cathartically off the pads. That's how Cook rolls, soak up the pressure and find the release"

"raps the pads, off an inside edge, deflects into the covers for a single"

"solid in defence once more, bat and pad tight together on the front foot"
"solid once more, pressed to mid-off with a full face of the bat"
"<strong>superb!</strong> Extra oomph in that delivery, swinging across Cook and kicking off the deck. He is drawn into the stroke but gets away with it"

"positive footwork, stretching forward, and finding the gap in the covers with a firm drive"
"rising onto the toes, stabbed into the covers"
"forward once more, punched to cover"

"outside off stump, good carry off the seam"

"solid in defence, leaning onto the front foot"
"very full, but speared into the toes, clipped uppishly to the leg side"
"<B>flashed in the air, but wide of third slip!</b> That was loose, driving on the up with his hand away from the body, but at least he flashed hard..."
"<B>that's more like it!</b> Supreme balance and footwork, standing tall to the over-pitched delivery, perfect head position, allowing his bat to fizz through the perpendicular, all the way to the rope at a very straight long-on"

forward and punched to the off side
"leaning onto the front foot, pressed out to point for another scampered single"
"round the wicket, attacking off stump, and fenced away with a diligent block"
"leaning forward, driven into the covers"
defended straight back down the pitch
"<strong>well, that one definitely swung!</strong> Huge hooping inswinger, down the leg side and well gathered by Pant. That'll give England something to think about"
"more inswing, but Root is down the pitch in a pre-meditated fashion, taking the lbw out of the equation before whipping him imperiously through square leg! Shot!"

"clipped out to midwicket, working round the front pad"
"solidly onto the front foot, right behind the line"
"opens the face, guided into the vacant region at backward point"
"slaps the pad but pitches way outside leg. A shriek from the bowler, but not really an appeal"

leaning back for a slap to point
solidly onto the front foot
"round the wicket, tight line as ever"
"<strong>oof, dangerous from Root!</strong> Looking to glide through third man, but that was quicker through the air and Root was in no position to combat it as it slipped over the top of his unguarded stumps"
"<strong>stunning delivery! </strong>Round the wicket, a perfect parabola, bending towards middle then past off, beating the edge as Cook had no choice but to cover the line. So close"

"decent shape on a wide line, Root leans forward to defend into the covers"
"big inswing, but sliding down the leg side this time"
"shaping in towards the off stump, confidently poked into the covers for another single. Cook is back on strike for the first time this morning"

a swish down the leg side as Bumrah tests the middle of the wicket once more. Pant stretches behind the stumps but can't gather cleanly

more diving practice for Pant as Bumrah spears one down the leg side.
"<B>tempted!</b> This one lifts off the deck, on a very tight line, and Cook flirts outside off"

"another short ball, Cook climbs into a pull and <strong>under-edges into the cordon</strong>. Not ideally played... but safe"
"a bouncing bomb outside off, Cook leaves with more discipline this time"
forward and defended back down the track. He's into the 60s
"half-forward, and defended back down the wicket"
"defended once more, on a yorker length this time. Bumrah is keeping it lively"
"drags his length back this time, but still arrow-straight. Root is having to keep his wits about him in this spell"

angled defence into the off side
"stands tall on the back foot, and punched cautiously to point"
solidly behind the line
"<strong>another sweep, another freebie!</strong> That's the wrong field for a man who trusts his sweep so emphatically. A fraction too wide again from Jadeja and that's helped kick his innings along. He's deep into the 40s now, almost before you notice him"
"round the wicket, too wide on this occasion, and Cook pats another single to deep point to march into the 70s for the second time in this match"
solid in defence once more
"sliding down the leg side, another stretch for Pant"
"up on the toes, poked to point for one more single"
"closes the face on impact to nudge this one into the leg side, but can't pierce the field"

a punchy drive into the covers
"<B>dropped!</b> That really flew, a back-foot slash from Root outside off, Rahane saw it late, and palmed it up and away. That was travelling"
padded away to the off side
"chiselled backward of point, too wide from Jadeja once more"
patted back down the pitch
"swished across the line, cannons off the pad and into silly point's hands. Half an appeal but India have burnt their reviews so no recourse. None really needed, to be fair"
"a languid cut to third man, and Root brings up the century partnership from 171 runs"
"squared up on off stump, and an inside-edge into the pads flies to safety in the covers. Cook extends his stay by one. Sangakkara is within a boundary now"

"drilled into the covers, knee bent for extra intent"

thumped to cover once more

"stabbed to cover, looking for the single but nothing doing there"
"length ball, seams back in, lobs off the thigh pad for a leg-bye"
"bouncer, sticks into the pitch, Cook is early into the shot, gets a nick onto the chest, though. One more to his credit"
"on a length, too straight, clipped away to leg"
inside edge as Cook drives at a length ball. The single takes him past Sangakkara's career tally. Two much-loved greats
"wide length ball, square-driven, down on a knee"
"lovely take from Pant. He has had rough times behind the wicket, but this time he catches up with another wayward ball down the leg side and puts in a full-length dive"
"full, outside off, driven to deep cover for one"
"tossed up outside off, on a length, defended off the front foot"
"flatter, Cook goes back and cuts, gets a single"
Root is in mood to dominate now. Skips down the wicket. Not quite to the pitch of the ball but that also gives him room to swing his arms. Goes over mid-on for six
"Root defends a length ball that doesn't turn, but he gets the inside edge onto the pad"
thinks of a late cut to a length ball but lets it slip into the keeper's gloves
<strong>beaten</strong>. Shami gets one to hold its line against the angle from round the wicket
"on a length, outside off, Cook goes back, pushes it towards point, takes another single"
"yorker this time, nearly squeezes under the bat, but Root keeps it out"
"short of a length, Root looks for the cut, this Shami's skiddy bounce beats him and this doesn't sit up for him"
"digs this in short, the ball doesn't rise at all, pulled away in front of square where substitute Thakur fails to prevent the boundary"
"widish length ball, goes back to run it down to third man for another single"
"widish length ball, Root plays it late, runs it past slip for two more"

"short, widish, another cut"

"Jadeja fires this in short of a length, and overthrows brings Cook's up hundred. He can afford to be expressive now. His family is watching, his successor as captain is at the other end, all of England and a major part of world cricket fans... all on their feet. A never-ending applause. You have deserved it, sir. He waves his bat 360 degrees to accept the applause. Then ends it with a tug on the ear. The applause is not ending only. Cook is a little embarrassed. Never wanted to be the centre of attention. He now is. The sunset can wait. Cook ain't done yet. Not for a while. Save tonight. From the break of dawn

"sharp turn from out of the rough, into Cook's ribs and to backward short leg. Jadeja mock-appeals"
"full and fast, pushed to mid-on"
"Vihari has got a wicket in his first Test. And that too of the opposition captain. Root is looking for quick runs, and tries to slog-sweep this but it stops after pitching in the rough and takes a top edge to deep midwicket where substitute Pandya takes the catch"
"Vihari is on a hat-trick. Would you believe it? He has dismissed two centurions in two balls. Cook looks to cut, the ball skids through, and the edge settles in Pant's gloves. Every single Indian fielder shakes his hand. The last walk back for Cook. A big applause from the stands. Another generous reaction from the crowd. Cook takes one look back, raises his bat, waves it overhead, and walks off. Bairstow pats his back too. What a career. The old batsman has left the crease. And we know that he is done"
Stokes defends as if his life depends on this. A big stride in
"flat, into the pads, pushed to midwicket"
"full, dipping, Stokes has to get his bat down quickly. Digs it out"

"on a length, outside off, pushed wide of cover for another single"
"yes Stokes is looking to enjoy himself out here. Short of a length, wide, and punched through cover-point for four"
square drive now. Stokes has been watching these off. Surely he has fought with himself to deny himself strokes. Now he is nailing them. And how he has earned them. An extravagant on-the-up square drive to a wide length ball
"left alone outside off, the ball doesn't turn, but the angle is not big enough to trouble the off stump"
"slightly short, Bairstow goes back to cut, gets a bottom edge into Pant's toe"

"and he bowls on the pads, clipped away to long leg"
"short of a length, still some seam movement, beats the inside edge Bairstow looks to punch it"
"<strong>five penalty runs</strong>. Helmet is the long stop for Pant. This ball is wobbling big time, beats Bairstow's inside edge, and then goes through Pant's gloves too. Hits the helmet behind him smack. Kohli sees the funny side of it and pushes the helmet further back"
"short and wide, and this Bairstow takes the gift, crunching it through cover-point"
"Bairstow is bowled one final time this series. Finally some luck for Shami. Bairstow pushes at an outswinger, but the ball doesn't move as much as he expects. Takes the inside edge onto the stumps. Bairstow falls but he batted with the right intent. England now lead by 395"
"full, outside off, driven to long-on"
"on a length, outside off, driven to mid-off"
"Jadeja gets a wicket after so many overs. Buttler plays a low-percentage shot looking for quick runs. Looks to hit across the line of a wide full ball, the ball turns, takes a thick edge, and lobs up for a catch. Hang on. They are checking the no-ball. It is very close. The umpire has to decide whether his heel is in the air behind the crease when the toe lands. It is not very clear either way but the benefit of the doubt goes to the bowler"

"wide length ball, left alone"
"<strong>beats the bat this time</strong>. Full, just outside off, seams away, goes past the push"

"<strong>beats the bat again</strong>. This is quite full, Curran is on the back foot, the ball holds its line, but doesn't take the edge"
"short of a length, holds its line, pushed back to Shami"
"<strong>and past the bat again</strong>. Shami goes wide on the crease, angles a length ball in, Curran pushes at the angle, but it holds its line just enough to miss everything"
and Curran rubs it in with a nice punch to a length ball for a couple to deep cover
"full, angling in, pushed straight of mid-on for one"
"advances at Shami, looks to cover the movement, but still can't. <strong>Beaten yet again</strong>. Shami can just stare at the pitch and at the batsmen. Got to love Shami's attitude. Doesn't say anything to batsmen. Just gives them a cold stare"

"outside off, kicks off the deck. Through to the keeper"
"outside off, a measured clip to mid-on"
"worked to the leg side once again, standing tall on the back foot"
"<B>crashed into helmet at short leg!</b> My God, Vihari wore that clean on the badge. Absolutely leathered into the lid, and he felt that in spite of the protection. A lengthy time-out, rightly so, but he's okay. A warm round of applause and on we go. Wonder where the ricochet went? <a href=https://www.durhamccc.co.uk/news-and-media/one-of-the-most-bizarre-catches-in-first-class-history/ target=_blank>Axar Patel would have caught that...</A>"

flicked into the leg side
leans back and flogs out through extra cover. Stokes is in the mood now ...
"panned into the deep, Rahul at deep midwicket steadies himself, and pockets the catch - his 14th of a prolific series. The end of a decent cameo, but England aren't quite done yet"
poked into the off side
"onto the front foot, worked into the covers to get off the mark"
"on the back foot, attempted glide to third man, but can't make the angle"
"very cleverly played, Rashid waits until the ball is almost behind him before patting behind square, very fine, and up comes the 400 for the first time in a Test innings this summer"
pushed into the covers
"<strong>explosive bounce!</strong> Biting outside off, and passing Rashid at shoulder height. That'll make his eyes light up..."
clobbered through cover. Still runs to be had out there!
"open face, guided to point"
slog-swept over slip ... interesting placement. A fat top-edge and more runs to the total
stoutly onto the front foot to block
"well watched, faster and flatter, and Rashid picked that off the stumps, but couldn't beat a diving slip"
"slapped into the covers, a big leading edge, over point"
"<strong>hammered hard, back down the ground!</strong> Not quite timed, but the intent is plain, clearing the front leg and dumping a one-bouncer over the bowler's head"
"<strong>steps back to slap another four through point!</strong> This over has added up. 12 in total, and the lead is past 450 ... surely Root will call them in soon"
"attempted reverse-hoick, can't make contact"

"testing line, a fraction too short, but hooping out of the hand. Fenced down into the crease, off the back foot"
"through to the keeper, no stroke offered"
solidly into line once again
"<B>very loose</B> Rahul climbs into a violent cut, but can't connect. Just as well really. That had a snick written all over it"
"good shape, well judged by Dhawan, lined up and left alone"
"outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, dabbed to point and Dhawan is off the point with a scampered single"
"this one shapes into the right-hander, who closes the face on impact to work to the leg side"
"fired down the leg side, good carry once more as Bairstow gathers"
"stabbed into the leg side, very full length"
nurdled to the leg side
"pressed back down the pitch, one hand comes off the bat on impact"
"<b>huge appeal as Dhawan is pinned in front of middle and off!</b> Playing round the front pad, from round the wicket, and gets his bat in a tangle on the full length. Vague thought of using a review, but if there was no bat involved, that was plumb!"
"on the legs, tucked to square leg"
"lfiting into the pads from over the wicket, but that's very much headed down leg"
"<strong>plants the front foot, that's absolutely plumb, surely!</strong> Pujara wants to review, but he's taken too long, but that's probably a blessing for India, as he was utterly adjacent"
"flicked into the leg side, another single to fine leg"
"<strong>outside off, and Broad has bagged Kohli for a golden duck!</strong> Unbelievable scenes! Just dangled a little further outside off than usual, the sort of line that he could have battered through the covers, but he was half-cocked in defence, and India are in tatters now"
pressed into the off side
cautiously into line
"very wide line, almost too wide. No stroke offered, understandably enough"
tapped into the off side. A riotous over completed.
"straight as a die, front foot planted, but whittled comfortably in the end through square leg. Rahul doubles the total"
"<B>living dangerously!</B> Outside off, slashed wildly over the gully, not quite timed but you can't have fielders everywhere"
"<B>another huge appeal!</B> Very adjacent to the lbw, but was there an inside edge? If so, this may well have ended up at slip! Nope, no bat, but they will check the lbw while they are at it... and it's going over the top. Drama!"
"onto the front foot, probing away on a full length, patted to mid-on"

"on a length, just outside off, defended solidly"
"outswinger, on a length, outside off, Rahul plays the original line of it and doesn't follow it with his hands"

draws him into a forward defensive. This is what you want as an offspinner when you have rough to work with
"<strong>nearly bowled</strong>. Rahane goes back to defend a length ball. He does it well, but the ball runs off the face of the bat back towards the stumps. Bounces over the stumps"
right forward to defend this time

"short of a length, straight, Rahul defends off the front foot"
"starts too straight with the inswinger, Rahul flicks it off the pads, very fine, gets four, into the 40s. First fifty from an Indian opener this series coming up?"
"tries the full inswinger, Rahul gets the front toe out of the way and defends"
<strong>half an appeal</strong>. Rahul is so concerned about that inswinger that he pushes at this shortish outswinger. Beaten but still alive
and he cashes in on a long half-volley. Stands tall and drives this past the diving man at cover

"fuller now, goes straight on, and Rahane blocks this without trouble"
walks down the wicket to defend a length ball outside off
<strong>beaten again</strong>. Beaten on the outside edge by a wide inswinger. Surely there is no need to play at these?
"wide length ball, no swing, left alone on the angle"
"full, really full, slight shape back, driven to mid-off"
"short of a length, starts on middle and off, Rahul shuffles across, opens the face of the bat, gets a single to third man"
"<strong>beaten again</strong>. Short of a length, middle and leg, Rahane plays for the swing, but this one leaves him, opens him up, and still fails to take the edge"

"fuller straighter ball after having dragged Rahul across. However, Curran is not fast enough in the air to make him miss this one. Defended pretty solidly"

"too full this time, defended easily back"
"<strong>shooter, appeal for lbw</strong>, and not given. Root reviews. Rahul goes back to defend, is shocked by the low bounce, but is clearly hit outside the line of off. That is a Kohliesque review. Now England don't have any left"

length on off stump and defended softly
"another bumper, takes a blow on the body trying to play off the back foot"
"short again, <b>feathers the shoulder of the bat</b> - gone! England's tactics pay immediate dividends, and Vihari adds a first Test duck to his maiden fifty (and three wickets) earlier in the match. This came back at a nasty height for the batsman and he just couldn't drop the bat down out of the way in time"
"over the wicket, angled across and defended with a straight bat on off stump"

"too full, pushed wide of mid-on for another single"

"on a length now, draws a defensive shot from Pant"

firmly defended back down the line
"right behind the ball once more, keeping Anderson at bay with a straight bat"
"on the pads, nudged to the leg side. Back-to-back maidens for Anderson, serving a reminder of the challenge that India will face to keep up with this run-rate."
"over the wicket this time, Pant doesn't have the freedom to swing from this angle, and chooses to press back down the line"
"steps back for a slash into the covers, not quite timed"
"big turn on the back foot, raps the pad in front of the stumps, but that pitched about two feet outside leg"
"prodded away once more, finds the gap on the leg side"
"<b>down on one knee, and launched into the stands for his maiden Test hundred!</b> Fantastic bravado from the young man, getting right underneath another legbreak from over the wicket, ignoring the fielders and the match situation, and taking the fight right to the final session!"
"attempted steer to the leg side, wafting across the line a touch, but connects well enough"
"forward again, pushed to short cover"
"tight line, solid defence. Four more balls for a wicketless session"
outside off with Bairstow standing up to the stumps. Left alone
"firmly onto the front foot, driven into the covers"
"wide line outside off, through to the keeper"
"left alone once again. Four maidens in a row for Anderson, but that's not the story of this session. What an effort from Rahul and Pant!"
"full, outside off, defended back to Rashid"
"pitches this really wide, Pant leaves it alone. Turn back in, but from too wide"
"turn from wide outside off again, past Pant's pad, but not enough turn"
another leave as Rashid keeps hiding this wide outside off
Pant is just exceptional. Rashid bowls one ball in Pant's reach and he smashes it back over his head. Utter disdain
"<strong>inside edge</strong>. Rashid finally draws a cover drive against the turn from outside off, but it goes safely wide of the stumps"
"wide full toss. Anderson is trying the cutter but overpitches. Misfielded at cover, conceding the single"
"nice inswinger, that is the ball that has troubled Root, but the zip in the pitch is gone, and Rahul punches this back on the up"
"short of a length, Rahul goes back to play the late-cut, but he can't beat backward point. Lovely diving save from Buttler"
"hits the outside half of the bat on this forward defensive, but they take a single"
"wide length ball, left alone"
"tries the cutter, lands it on a length outside off, Pant defends with an open face"
and he continues to bleed. Rahul is hardly playing a shot here. The feeblest of pretences to play one. They are given two leg-byers for that
"jumps out of the crease, a billion Indian hearts stop, the ball drops on him, but Rahul defends well"
"now gets the short ball, and he works it to leg for one"
"wide into the rough again, kicked away"
more extras. Kicks back in out of the rough. Hits the top of Bairstow's gloves and goes for byes
this is some crazy excellence from Pant. Rashid is bowling wide. This is almost off the pitch but Pant reaches it and drives it over extra cover. This is future right now
"India are looking for a lot of runs before the new ball. Rahul walks down, chips a length ball over midwicket. A whip really. This is exhilarating"
now Rahul stays put and defends a length ball
"into the pads, clipped to midwicket"
"cutter, on a length, outside off, driven to point"
"on a length, angling in, defended off the front foot"
"full outside off, driven to the right of cover-point, a <strong>yes-no</strong>, but Rahul is back and safe"
trying the reverse sweep from out of the rough and against the spin. This is some audacious batting. Beaten but this is turning too far
"tries the big slog sweep, beaten by the turn, hit on the body, but again turning too much"
"the usual drag down, Pant pulls but straight to midwicket"
"I am not sure this is intelligent batting. Pant is not picking Rashid, and just going for the big slogs now. The googly turns out of the rough, and between slip and keeper for four more byes. The partnership is 200. Big applause. They don't care how they are coming"
"big stride in to try to defend this, hit high on the bat"
goes deep into the crease to keep this shortish shooter out. Anyway well wide of off
"on a length, angling in, runs off the inside edge for one"
and he finds some kick and movement. Pant thinks of pushing at it but withdraws
"wide length ball, left alone. Playing on Pant's patience now"
"wide length ball again, he looks to run this down to third man but Stokes puts in a dive at point to deny them"
"short of a length, wide, punched straight to point"
"fuller, wider, Pant thinks of a drive but decides it is too wide"
"Shane Warne, eat your heart out. Adil Rashid shuts everyone up. This is some humble pie for me and others. What a special ball. In the rough, almost at the edge of the cut strip. Rahul stays back to defend it as it turns sharply. It just turns too much and hits the top of off. Rashid proves his worth finally. It would have taken a great ball to get Rahul here, and Rashid has produced it. Big ovation for Rahul"
looks to defend at another legbreak pitched in the rough. Beaten on the outside edge
"sharp turn from the rough, bounce too, Jadeja manages to keep it down. Need a backward short leg too"
<strong>appeal for inside edge into the body and then the catch</strong> as Pant tries the big sweep and the ball lobs up. Not given. Rightly so. Comes straight off the shoulder. Dharmasena is having a blinder
"premeditates a sweep, Rashid fires this in, then tires a reverse sweep, gets into a tangle, and hits his own foot. All too comical right now. But not quite"
"tossed up outside off, defended back to Rashid"
"short of a length, angling in, defended with an open face"
"short of a length, wide, he looks for a cut but sees extra bounce and withdraws from the shot"
"wide length ball, left alone"
"full and wide, asking Jadeja if he feels like a drive. He doesn't"
"short of a length, wide, another leave"
"looks to run this down to third man, and <strong>is beaten</strong>"
"turns in from outside off, Pant goes back and swats it into the off side"
strides forward and pads away a ball on the leg side
"flighted just outside off, defended back to him"
"full, outside off, right forward to smother the turn"
"pitched in the rough now, too short, goes across to run this to point for a single"
"this is not smart batting. He has not been picking the googlies, but he is still swinging hard. This googly runs off the outer half of the bat for a catch to long-off. Pant is distraught. He has played a sensational innings but the last 15 minutes or so have not been intelligent. Rashid has proven his worth, though"
"wide length ball, left alone"
"length ball angling in, defended in front of off"
"walks down the wicket, Anderson bowls wide, left alone"
"on a length, closer to off, angling in, left alone"
"wide on the crease, angling it in, defended off the front foot. Can't get the single to retain strike"
"walks down the wicket, Anderson hides it wide outside off, Jadeja can't manipulate strike. Ishant to face Rashid now"
"and googly first up, but too short, and Ishant keeps it out"
"legbreak, Ishant gets a big stride in, and it runs off the outside half of the bat. Ishant limps the single"
"too full as he looks for the rough, driven out for a single"
"wrong'un from there, beats the inside edge, hits the pad, but it is turning too much"
"<strong>over silly point</strong>. Ishant defends instead of padding this away. Off the handle of the bat it gets but over silly point's head. Kick these away, Ishant"
"and he plays the defensive shot again. The ball stays low, but since it has pitched outside leg he is okay"
"full, outside off, defended back to him"
"full, puff of dust as Jadeja drives. Early into it. Played to cover. Watch out for cutters here"
"<strong>dropped by Bairstow</strong>. Anderson still level with McGrath. Draws the edge as Jadeja pushes at this length ball outside off. The edge is dying to the left of Bairstow. He puts a dive in, gets the fingertips to it, but can't hold on"
"walks down the wicket, leaves a wide ball alone"
"walks down again, Anderson bowls short, he pushes it to point. No singles available on the off side, and he is bowling outside off"
and he hides it wide outside off for another dot. Ishant on strike again
"front of the hand to make it turn less, it still turns <strong>past the outside edge</strong>"
"slower in the air, dipping on him, defended off the front foot"
"legbreak outside off. Ishant has picked it, and left it alone"
"googly, and seems Ishant has picked it as he drives at it even though it is pitched wide. Goes off the splice of the bat but safe"
"another wrong'un but too full, driven square to point"
"legbreak, and Ishant has picked it as he doesn't play at it. This is gutsy and intelligent batting from Ishant"
"full and wide, Jadeja gets a stride in, and leaves it alone"
"down the wicket, Jadeja defends it with an open face. Outside half of the bat"
"Jadeja walks at him again, Anderson has to bowl wide again. Another leave"
"down the wicket again, this time Anderson bowls at him, and Jadeja defends solidly"
"and he skips down the wicket again. Anderson tries the bouncer, and he lets it pass under his armpit"
"down the wicket again, and a solid defensive shot to end the over"
"<strong>and this is probably why he is playing</strong>. Tries to kick this out of the way, the ball turns past his pad, hits the bat, and lobs over gully. Sorry no bat. Some part of the body"
now he lets this fullish delivery hit his pad
"swept away. Ishant doesn't let him settle into a groove. He seems to have picked the googly. Amazing batting. The sweep, though, has made him hobble more now. He is struggling with his ankle"
kicks this away as it is pitched outside leg
"flighted well outside leg, and kicked away"
"flat, front-of-the-hand delivery, Ishant stays back to keep it out"
"and immediately you see there is bounce in it. Full wide ball, left alone. Puff of dust from the rough"
"this one lands in front of off, and seams back in a little. Jadeja gets an inside edge to save himself"
"inswinger for the left-hander, but it starts too straight and is headed down leg when it hits Jadeja's pad"
"lovely outswinger, starts at middle and off, heads towards off, Ishant plays late and defends. He is a trooper, is Ishant"
tires the straighter ball for the lbw but Ishant stays back and plays it late and keeps it out
"<strong>beaten</strong>. That's a beauty that would have troubled a top-order batsman. Angling in, making him play, then pitching and leaving him"
"looks for swing away, starts middle and leg, but the angle takes it down the leg side"
"full, middle and leg, Jadeja looks to play to leg, the ball moves, takes the leading edge through point"
"swing back in, this ball has lbw written all over it until Ishant brings the bat down in time. This is such a remarkable effort by the injured Ishant. Never a shirker"
"wide length ball, left alone. No swing"
"tries the really full lbw ball, but Ishant keeps it out again. Big applause for him"
"Given caught at the wicket but Ishant has reviewed it immediately. Again that swinging ball that nips away after pitching. Too much for the tailender. On a length, just outside off, Ishant covers the swing, but the ball leaves him and takes a thin outside edge, UltraEdge confirms. The first replay was not conclusive, but technology leaves no doubt. Dharmasena has eked out another unsuccessful review"
"full, outside off from over the wicket, defended solidly"
"on a length, on off, angling away, left alone"
slight swing back in from around off. Jadeja plays it late and defends
"on a length, on off, holds its line, defended"
"<strong>inside edge</strong>. It's not written in the stars for Anderson, I think. Loose drive from Jadeja. Gets an inside edge past the stumps. Desperately unlucky"
"Jadeja manages to farm the strike now. Flicks this away with the wrists, past midwicket"
"Curran buzzes in like a humming bird armed with a samurai sword, curves one past the outside edge as Jaddu comes across"
"length ball, shaping away in the corridor, left alone this time"
"pitched up, touch too straight and that's whipped through midwicket, there's no one out there and it'll trundle for four"
"perfect line, drags him out, <b>kisses the edge</b> - Jadeja's a goner! Bairstow grabs this one tumbling to his left, Curran leaps and punches the air, India are nine down! And the opportunities for Anderson to go past McGrath are dwindling, too"
"pitched up wide of off stump, leans out and lets it go"
"another wide-ish ball, again Bumrah props forward and leaves... Deliberate from Curran?"
"straight line, curling a touch as Shami flicks across the line towards fine leg - but they don't run"
shortish and this zips through past the shoulder of the bat
"BOWLED 'IM! <b>Anderson does it with the final wicket of the series!</b> Middle stump is flattened! Nip-backer, through a lackadaisical defence, rattling the woodwork - just like Test wicket No1 - and Anderson becomes the most prolific fast bowler in history as <b>England seal victory by 118 runs</b> and take the series 4-1. How's that for a cherry on top of the summer?"
