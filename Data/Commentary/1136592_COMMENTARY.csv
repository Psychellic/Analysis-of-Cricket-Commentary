"a nice and full start. Full and moving away, on middle and off, punched away to mid-off from the crease"
"a bit of width! Full and wide, the ball moving further away. Shaw mis-times a drive towards extra cover."
"Delhi's first runs. On middle and leg, flicked away easily through deep square leg for a single."
"edged and gone! An inside edge is taken by Buttler. A golden duck for Munro. It's nice and full again, inviting a drive. The ball moves back in, in the air. Munro goes driving, but he's played slightly outside the line. A thick inside edge is found, Buttler dives to his right and takes an easy catch. Excellent bowling to persist with that full length in swinging conditions."
a good length delivery on middle to start to Iyer. Pushed to mid-on
"a short delivery outside off, a very clever change in length to earn himself a dot ball. Banged in and Iyer ducks. One over, one for one."
"short and wide from Archer, not the best start. Slashed away to backward point."
"dug in short again, Shaw gets underneath. The one for the over, well used again"
"back of a length, down leg though. Nudged down to fine leg for one."
"too straight again and picked away. Not been a great over, 135 kph, on the pads. Iyer just gets a bit of bat on that and tickles the ball fine, to the fine leg boundary."
"back of a length around off, defended away to mid-off"
"the second bouncer? No, says the square leg umpire. How do bowlers keep getting away with this? Dug in very short, Iyer ducks and looks at the umpire immediately."
"a pick-flick for six. Back of a length, down leg, Shaw gets underneath the length and chips the ball elegantly over midwicket for six. Massive hit."
"shorter, back of a length outside off. Shaw gets over the bounce, watches the ball down and guides to short third man"
"goes again, six more. He's just picking length very quickly. Once he does that, it's all a bit too easy for class batsmen, like de Villiers. Shaw shows some of his skill with a bottom-handed loft over mid-on."
"a good yorker on middle and leg, jammed back towards mid-off"
"swatted away into the gap at extra cover. It's another short, slower delivery. Shaw picks the variation early enough and thrashes the ball into the gap at cover"
"dropped! Almost stuck. 135 kph, low full toss is belted back at Dhawal. Fight or flight kicks in because it's aimed at his head. He gets his hands up and catches the ball, but it pops out slyly and lies on the ground, grinning back at Dhawal."
"flat outside off, nudged away towards midwicket"
"lovely shot. Flat outside off, Shaw backs away and punches a drive quite comfortably through cover"
"flat and straight, the ball spins back in, worked away to deep midwicket"
"carved away through backward point. Full and flat, and quick outside off. Iyer stays inside the line and scythes the ball in the air and in the gap"
"full around off, pushed to long-on"
"finds the fielder this time. Short and wide outside off, a cut finds point"
"full outside off, Iyer still manages to angle his bat face and guides the ball to cover point"
"a cutter, an offcutter outside off. Nicely timed away to the same fielder."
"finds the gap this time. Full and wide, Iyer gets forward and slices a drive to deep point"
"has he got enough? Just about to clear mid-on. Back of a length offcutter. Shaw picks the length but not the variation, which is why the timing is bad. Still, he gets enough to chip the ball over mid-on and into the boundary"
"four more! Good comeback this from Delhi. Another cutter, Shaw just times his bunt this time. Much more in control, decent-enough timing for the short boundaries and four through mid-off"
"goes through with the shot again! Three offcutters from Unadkat and they've all been smashed! Shaw goes through with another lofted drive, this time he gets plenty of timing and power behind the stroke. Clears mid-off easily."
"the googly outside off, just outside off, chopped away to point."
"a googly, outside off, swept to deep square leg. Too full"
"90 kph, flat on middle and off. Iyer comes down and misses a flick, struck on the thigh pad"
"it's very full again, around off. Iyer clears his front leg and powers a drive to cover, all along the ground."
"the quicker one, Iyer knew what was coming. All he does is chip a lofted flick over long-on. Full and very quick, smashed!"
"six more, into the stands! This one is dropped short, around off. Iyer rocks back and swats a pull over deep midwicket. Great hit again. Playing the spinner's probabilities"
"goes short, a bouncer on middle and leg, Shaw gets underneath that."
"that's a poor ball, very lucky he's got away with that. Looked like a short legcutter, but on the hips. Shaw swivels on a shot and picks out deep square leg"
"full outside off, punched away to the sweeper cover for one"
"full on middle and leg, pushed to long-on for one. Biding their time"
"a good length delivery is tapped towards point. Iyer sends Shaw back. The throw from point to the non-striker's end is accurate, but the ricochet allows one overthrow."
"strays down leg, wide"
"a slower ball on middle, worked to deep midwicket. Decent over."
"six more. That's the third six he's conceded. Runs down to the pitch of the legbreak, knows it's wide outside off so the off side is a better shot. And drills a lofted drive over cover. Just clears the boundary"
"chipped back to the bowler! It's a legbreak, around middle, extracts some turn. Shaw stays in the crease, looks to drive the ball to long-off, but he's not in a great position. Because of the turn, all he can do is hit a leaden-footed poke back to Gopal"
"the googly, on middle and off, blocked back"
"nicely bowled, some flight and dip, around off, defended back"
"81 kph, the googly, pitches outside leg. Pant unwinds and looks for a slog sweep but misses. He's struck on the pad"
"that's the fourth six he's gone for. Some more flight outside off, Pant has had enough of plodding about. Swings through the line and lifts the ball comfortably over long-on"
"full outside off, a thick outside-half dab to third man"
"wanted to help that along, but was beaten for pace. A back of a length delivery that's on the pads, he looks to flick that down to fine leg, but the ball ricochets there off the thigh pad"
"a slower ball on middle and leg, slogged away to long-on"
"hurried for pace again. A short delivery on the ribs, Pant misses this, and <strong>is struck on the midriff</strong>. Ouchy!"
"another short delivery, back of a length outside off. Pant can't connect with his attempt to pull to square leg"
"another one that strays down leg, wide. Just like Stokes' previous over"
"a slower ball, Pant picks the length and swats the ball over midwicket. That's just smashed."
"a slower ball outside off, tapped to point. Played in front of square."
"another legcutter, on off. Pushed to cover. Another dot."
"goes short, very short outside off. Iyer just slices a cut over backward point. Over the fielder and into the boundary for four."
"a low full toss on middle and leg, chipped away to long-on for a run."
"a yorker, around off, pushed back to the bowler"
"Archer errs, he bowled that full and straight. Pant got ably underneath the length of that and lofted that cleanly over long-on for six. Superb hit."
"back of a length outside off, 134 kph, guided down to third man for one"
"short, 126 kph. Pant hurries to get inside the line and help that along to the fine leg boundary. Just inside the boundary."
"a slower ball on middle, slogged away towards deep square leg, one more"
"it's another offcutter, just too predictable. Iyer drills that shot straight, over the umpire's head. Stokes runs around from long-on, running to his left."
"a slower delivery again outside off, slashed to deep point"
"another cutter outside off, 117 kph, hit away to long-on for one"
"flat and straight, worked away into the gap at midwicket. But Stokes races to the ball to prevent two, from long-on"
"he's picked that and deposited it into the stands over midwicket! It's full around off, Iyer stays low and T20s that away over midwicket. A heave and a slog."
"well bowled, slower and wider outside off. Iyer drags a sweep to deep midwicket for one"
"it's too short from Gowtham, on middle and leg. Smashed into the gap at square leg for four."
"that's very well played. Flat on off, Pant switches his stance and paddles the scoop over short fine leg. A reverse-paddle scoop. What else, T20s?"
"flat and straight, around off. Defended"
"full on the pads, clipped away to square leg for two. The line is not very good."
"a slower delivery outside off, carved away towards Gopal at short third man. He gets around to his right and prevents the ball from going through"
"six more. That's some tripe from Dhawal. It's short down leg, all Pant needs is some bat. Even better if he gets a top edge, like this one. Way over fine leg for six."
"a wide yorker outside off, well executed. Just inside the tramline"
tries another wide yorker but goes very wrong. Wide
"another wide yorker attempted, another wide."
he tries it again and concedes another wide. The wide yorker is well away from the tramline! Aargh.
and now he bowls a low full toss that is wide. Pant drills the drive through cover. Smashed past the fielder.
"140 kph, it's full and wide. Pant absolutely hammers his drive to cover. The ball goes right through the fielder's legs for four. 20 runs off that over, better overs will go for more."
"a slower delivery, 117 kph, worked away to deep square leg for one"
"absolutely pummeled through cover! Full and wide outside off, Pant smashes that past the fielder at cover again. Great timing too"
"a slower delivery outside off, slogged away to long-on. That's also <b>Pant's fifty, off just 23 balls</b>"
"a low full toss around off, worked down to fine leg for one."
"full and straight, a bottom-handed whip through long-on for two. Archer runs around to his right and parries the ball to long-off, with a dive."
"a slower ball and six more. It's slightly wide outside off, Pant stays in his crease and crashes an uppish drive over cover. Sensational timing from Pant."
"a slower ball outside off, chopped to third man. <b>That's Iyer's fourth fifty in five matches</b>"
"a slower offcutter around leg, Pant goes through the shot, but it takes the glove towards Buttler. He throws directly at the bowler's end, the ball ricochets away. Stokes runs around and lets the ball go through his legs. That's very sloppy"
"Iyer holes out! A slower delivery outside off, Iyer backs away and chips an uppish drive to long-off. He wanted to hit that straighter, but the cut on the offcutter took that away from the bat, which meant he could only slice the ball. Tripathi just about holds on."
"we often see a wicket fall after the time-out, but rarely a six! Offcutter outside off stump, but too wide. Pant winds up, and thumps it over cow corner"
"full and wide outside off, big stride forward but the drive's been mistimed"
"overpitched outside off, but the slower one does him in. Tried to slog it towards deep midwicket again, but this time it's a one-handed shot. Doesn't have the distance, and Stokes - at long on - settles under it"
"good length on off stump, and Maxwell taps it towards long on off the back foot"
"full on middle stump, and Shankar shuffles to the off side to flick towards cow corner. Maxwell wants two, and that's a well-timed run"
"<b>Shanked!</b> Back of a length on middle stump, and he backs away to flat-bat it over deep midwicket. Wonderful use of the crease's depth to earn that extra second"
"short and wide outside off, but Shankar tries to carve this over point. Slices it over slip instead, and that's another boundary"
"short on leg stump, and too high. Shankar doesn't even duck and that's flown over his helmet"
"full just outside off, and that's been lifted over the bowler's head. Man at long on though"
"yorker! On leg stump, and Maxwell does well to get his toes out of the way and block it"
"full on middle stump, and Shankar makes full use of the angle! Uses his wrists to whip it over fine leg"
"<b>Tripathi under it!</b> Full just outside off, and Shankar goes for another biggie. This time it's off the toe end of the bat and long off was manning the boundary. Seventeen off six in a innings run-rate of 11.69. An excellent cameo"
"full outside off, but wide enough to muscle it over cover. Not hit well but played in the gap. Short and Tripathi combine near wide long off to intercept"
"good length outside off, but stays a bit low. Tried to play the late cut, but missed it"
"slower ball, and full outside off. Plunkett shuffles across to the off side and clips it to Stokes at deep midwicket"
"full toss wide outside off, and Maxwell slaps this towards the off side. An excellent diving stop at point keeps it down to one"
"<b>17.01</b> Yorker on middle stump, and Maxwell can't get his boot out of the way. Crashes into his toes in front of leg stump and the umpire has no hesitation. Maxwell's reviews, but starts walking to the boundary. Does he think it's out? <b>Nope, it's raining.</b> The players walk off as the third umpire adjudicates. He's out!"
"good length just outside off, and spinning into Short. Flicked off his pads to midwicket for a quick single"
"good length on off, and he misses the leg-side whip. Hits his pad but the lbw appeal is turned down"
"good length on middle stump, and worked off his pads to deep midwicket. Man there though"
"good length on middle and leg, but Buttler comes dancing down the wicket and lift it over Nadeem!"
"full on middle and leg, but too easy for Buttler. Shuffles across to the off side, gets down on one knee, and slogs it over fine leg!"
"full on middle stump, and he tries to sweep it fine. Straight to the fielder inside the circle, but they scamper across for the single anyway"
"good length on off, and punched off the back foot to cover. The fielder fumbles, and that allows them to complete an easy run"
"full on off stump, and that's been <b>drilled!</b> Big stride forward and driven through the cover region. Beautiful"
"good length on middle stump, and tapped to midwicket. They want the quick single, and completed with ease"
"short on middle stump, and Buttler gets his head out of the ball's way. Nice carry through to Pant"
"short and wide outside leg stump. Buttler tries to pull but can't swat it anyway. No worries, it's a wide anyway"
"back of a length outside leg stump, but Buttler had backed away to the leg side just a bit too much. Cramped for room, and forced to tap it towards cover"
"back of a length on off stump, and Short pulls, but the ball goes under his bat and through to the keeper. The umpire raises his finger for the caught behind, but <b>Short reviews straightaway.</b> Replays show it came off his waist region"
"full on off stump, and it's in Buttler's arc. Small back lift but still hit over Short's head. Oof"
"<b>cheeky!</b> Good length on middle, but Buttler went running to the off side, and ramps it over the keeper's head. It goes all the way!"
"short and wide outside off, but he's done in by the slower ball. Tries to cut, but misses it completely. Avesh will feel lucky"
"back of a length outside off, and Buttler opens his stance to pull this over cow corner! Fast bat speed, and Buttler's shoulders do the rest. Avesh gone for 18 already"
"back of a length outside off, but this time he connects with the cut. Slapped over point and no one's in the deep"
"good length, but outside off stump. Punched to cover off the back foot, and they race across for a single. Buttler keeps strike"
"full outside off, and just the right length for Buttler to get under it. Picks the offcutter early, and thumps this inside out over cover"
"back of a length, but wide outside off. Buttler tries to pull, but can only drag his shot to square leg"
"short on leg stump, and Short checks his pull shot. It was the slower ball again, and he plays it to short fine leg"
"tough chance, but <b>dropped by Pant!</b> Good length outside leg stump because Buttler was shuffling across to the off side. Misses the pull, and the ball hits his gloves as it goes down the leg side. But just too wide of the keeper"
"good length, wide outside off. Slapped off the back foot to Shaw at cover, whose diving effort saves a boundary"
slower ball bouncer outside leg stump. Tries to back away and hit it but misses. The ball goes between him and the stumps
"<b>An 18-ball fifty!</b> The fastest fifty by a Rajasthan batsman EVER. It was a full toss outside off stump, and Buttler played the reverse sweep over third man's head"
"nearly bowled! Good length on middle, but Buttler misses the reverse sweep this time"

"good length outside off, and spinning into him. Punched to long on for a walking single"
"full and wide outside off. Flighted and driven to deep extra cover. Mistimed, though"
"arm ball on middle stump. It's the yorker this time, and Short squeezed it down the ground"
"<b>done by the googly!</b> Full outside off, and Buttler came dancing down the wicket. The ball zips straight through and Buttler's way out of his crease. Mishra held his length back just a bit"
"flighted outside off, and legspin away from his body. Drives it down the ground to long off to get off the mark"
"full outside leg stump, and he's down on one knee to sweep. Straight to short fine leg"
"good length just outside off, and Samson chips it past the non-striker to long on. Misfield by the bowler too, but they can't take another run"
"offcutter on leg stump, and Short mistimes the leg-side slog. Comes off the bat's inside half, and trickles down to deep backward square"
"good bowling! Good length outside off, but Plunkett's smart enough to take the pace off the ball. Samson's through his attempted pull way too early"
"full and wide outside off, but Samson manages to flat-bat it over Plunkett's head. Off the bat's toe end, and down to long on"
"<b>oh Short what are you doing here!</b> Back of a length wide outside leg stump, but Short had already backed away too much. Can't connect with the pull as the ball hits his thigh"
"shuffles across to the leg side, and Plunkett goes full outside leg too. Short clips it over midwicket, and finally releases some pressure"
"<b>Munro at cow corner!</b> And that's the Purple cap for Boult. Full on off stump, and Samson's leg-side whip is mistimed. In the air for ages as Munro comes running in. Takes a sharp catch with the floodlights disturbing his vision for certain"
"yorker on leg stump, and Short clips it off his toes to deep backward square"

"full on off, and Short's extravagant leg-side slog finds the inside edge! Past Pant's right unfortunately for Delhi"
"full on off stump, and Buttler's leg-side heave comes off the bat's inside half. Only to deep backward square though. <b>Team hundred too</b>"
"waist high full toss outside off, and Stokes thumps it towards the leg side. Straight down deep midwicket's throat, but Stokes thinks it could be a no ball. They're checking. It's gonna be close, but given!"
"good length on off stump, and Short gets his front foot out of the way to thump it over deep midwicket! Just a bit too short from Maxwell"
"full on leg stump, and Short puts on his dancing shoes! Meets it on the full and sends it over long on"
"full just outside off, and Short gets his front foot out of the way to smack it over long off"
"full on off stump, and the extravagant drive is sliced. In the air, and Avesh Khan at short third man does the rest"
"good length outside off, and Tripathi goes down on one knee to wide long on. They're going for the second run too, and just make it!"
"yorker just outside off, and that's been squeezed away to short third man. The fielder does well to adjust for the spin and stops it with one hand"
"slower ball! Good length outside off, and he's through his leg-side heave way too early. Through to the keeper on the bounce"
"back of a length on middle, and he's quick to swivel and pull! One-bounce four to the fine-leg boundary. Used his wrists to play it as fine as possible"
"appeal for lbw, and a chance for a run out as well! But not given lbw, so Plunkett <b>reviews.</b> It was full on off stump, and he tried to slog sweep towards the leg side. It had hit his front leg but would've gone down leg stump. The review's been lost."
"slower ball, but too wide outside off. Drills it over Plunkett's head but extraordinary from Maxwell at long on! Covers a lot of ground in the deep"
"back of a length outside off, but Gowtham's pull goes over short third man! Sliced, really, and that's a useful four runs"
"<b>thumps this pull over deep midwicket!</b> Short on off, but he's a tall man. Stays on the back full and sends this over the man in the deep. <b>Rajasthan need 15 off six</b>"

"full just outside off, and Gowtham gets his front foot out of the way to lift it over cover. Two men in the deep though"

"<b>run out at the non-striker's end!</b> Full and wide outside off again, and Tripathi can't muscle this over cover either. Gowtham's quick to get to the other end, but Tripathi's too slow. <b>Rajasthan need 10 off two balls</b>"
"<b>Rajasthan need six off the last ball!</b> This was full on leg stump, and Gowtham lifted it to long on. Iyer prepares himself at long on, but he can't hold on to the catch. Goes to the boundary on the bounce"
