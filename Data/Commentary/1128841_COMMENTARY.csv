"<b>Ramps it fine!</b> Full outside off, shuffles across to the off side and paddles over the keeper. Fine leg was too square"
"short on off stump, McClenaghan tries the reverse paddle this time, but can't connect. Awkward bounce for the keeper, and he misses the collection. Allows them to steal the run"
"full on off stump, tries to flick towards square leg but misses. Hits his back leg, and dribbles away to the leg side. The keeper chases behind it, but McClenaghan could be in trouble! Nope, he's safe. The fielder from midwicket took the bails off, but the big New Zealander was in"
"good length on middle stump, manages to shovel it to point. The fielder has a shy at the stumps but misses. No one backing up, and Sohail comes back for the second run"
"<b>smacked over Usman!</b> Stands tall and pitches this full ball's length very early. Big swing, and he misses the yorker. The low full toss comes off the bat's sweet spot"
"<b>you beauty, Sohail Akhtar!</b> Full on off stump, and he gets his front foot out of the way. Just the perfect length for the long handle, and it's been thumped over long off. <b>Smoked!</b>"
"short ball on middle stump, tries to pull but misses because of the slower ball. McClenaghan is backing up and he's scampered across to the other side, but the keeper gets the direct hit. They're taking the second run - off the overthrow - but replays show that the batsman was short! Dot ball, and Sohail's off strike. <b>Four off two now</b>"
"full on off stump, smacked to cover for a single. <b>They need three off the final ball to win. Two for a super over</b>"
"<b>is that a six?! Nope, that's taken at long on! But wait, he's overstepped!</b> Karachi's celebrations need to wait. It was in the slot to be punished, and Sohail lifts this over the non-striker and taken at long on. Karachi are celebrating, but, but, but, but, Usman has conceded a front-foot no ball! You can't write a script for this! <b>Free hit now</b>, but they're also checking if the batsmen took a single before the catch was taken. If they complete the run then Lahore will need 1 off 1. If he was out before the run was taken, then Lahore need 2 off 1. The umpires are still conferring. OK, its official: no run off the bat there. <b>Lahore need two off one.</b> Plus, a free hit. They can only be run out off the last ball."
"<b>super over!</b> Unbelievable scenes. Confusion everywhere. Full toss low on middle stump, mistimed to the leg side and they're off for the run. Usman collects, and runs them out at the striker's end as they try to sneak a second.
<b>McCullum and Lahore want clarification</b>. He's talking to the umpire, presumably about the run off the previous delivery. The commentators say that 'McCullum thought that they needed one off the final ball.' There's still a lot of confusion, but sanity prevails eventually. It'll be a super over. Phew."
