"short now and lashed through square, gets it away with some power and picks up four"

"wrong line from Broad, too straight, and too easy to tuck off the hip to backward square"
"another extravagant leave, bat finishing horizontal like some samurai sword flourish. It's just plain odd to be frank, but by God it's effective!"

"fully forward, dabbed to cover"
"banged in short, it's a top-edged pull but it's been <B>dropped</B> by Stoneman at deep backward square! That's a terrible miss, had to make some ground, but his hands were like concrete when the ball thudded into them..."

"bowled 'im, <b>Smith plays on!</b> THIS IS NOT A DRILL!! Overton has his maiden Test wicket and it's a <i>yuge</i> one... England's plan to bore Smith out bears fruit, attempting to block yet another length ball outside off, it maybe nibbled back a touch, there was a gap between bat and pad, and the ball sneaked through to nudge Smudge's timbers"
pitched up and steered into the covers for a quick single
"touch too straight, Handscomb clips off his legs but finds the fielder"
"length ball, comes across his stumps"
"short of a length, at the body and helped around the corner"
"round the wicket to Marsh, unleashes a bumper that sails through over the batsman's head"
"Woakes plugs away on a good length, prodded away"
Handscomb hangs back and defends
fired in full and straight... he's a <i>whisker</i> away from being lbw but manages to skim away at the very last moment and gets four to fine leg. Played it well

"touch shorter, left alone in the channel"
"pitched up, gets him pushing forwards, hits the inside edge and runs behind square for one"

back of a length and tapped defensively to leg
"Woakes goes over the wicket to the southpaw, pitched up and prodded into the covers"

over the wicket this time
"banged in short, and Marsh latches onto this one magnificently. Into position early, rolls the wrists, clean through midwicket"
"cut firmly, but straight to point. A pair of loose deliveries towards the end of a fine effort from Overton"
speared down the leg side with a cluster of close fielder and that was technically a <B>chance</B> though Stoneman at short leg would have needed the hands of a ninja. And we've already established that's not the case
clubbed into the off side

"banged in short, Marsh ducks"
"tight line from round the wicket, clipped to short leg"
worked off the hip to square leg
another over negotiated
"round the wicket, and that's off-line, sliding past the leg stump, almost on the full. An old-school loosener"
"better line and length, round the wicket and keeping Marsh honest"
"flicked supremely off the pads, that went like Ravi's tracer bullet, but that's also a supreme attempt to save the boundary from Overton at square leg. Slid full-length but his forearm was touching the rope as he hauled it back in"
tighter line
"banged in short, Marsh ducks"
"sweetly struck, right in the arc, and lambasted back whence it came with a vertical bat and lovely timing. Intercepted on the rope"
"good length to launch his spell, pushed compactly to cover to bring up the 200"
"width, and cracked firmly through third man. Top shot, right in his slot. He's so far back on his stumps, that anything short is too short"

"well bowled, fuller and floatier, and threatening the edge of a tightly honed defensive technique"
"a bit too loose this time, on the toes and flicked fine"

through to the keeper
"good leave outside off stump, excellent judgement"
"a round-house leave, keeping the bat out of harm's way, as if passing it over a flooded ravine"
forward and blocked
"good leave once again, Anderson keeps tempting in that channel"
"gosh, what happened there? Looked for all the world as though he'd patted up to a straight one, but I think that deflected off a half-committed bat. Anderson looks suitably non-plussed, but then he usually does, the big grumpus"
"outside off, no stroke offered"
"nibble dibble! This one just bites the surface and seams back into Handscomb's pads. Going over, but something to ponder..."
"leaning forward, a half-cocked defensive push to short leg"
"another nibbler, climbing past the off stump on a tight line. Good ball, good defensive judgement"
"targetting the stumps this time, and Handscomb makes sure he gets bat in front of his twitchy pads"

very full and defended outside off stump
"big swing on this occasion, but from outside off and heading wider"
"big, big movement with the new ball, but Marsh lines it up and leaves it well"
"the inswinger to the left-hander this time. Clever bowling, but negotiated with aplomb. And a cheeky single to square leg too"
"outside off, too wide to throw a bat at that one"
"good effort to finish from Anderson, a big booming inswinger, but it does too much and whizzes down the leg side, to be clipped to square leg"
"back of a length, kisses the surfaces and skips through as Handscomb sits back and plays inside it"
"nip-backer from Broad, touch short and it raps the thigh, caught on the crease but high"
"pitched up, whirring in like an angry wasp off the pitch - <b>and that's bang in front!</b> England strike in the first over of the <del>morning</del> afternoon, Broad on the money and Handscomb once again nailed lbw deep in his crease... Perfect ball to a batsman trying to restart, hit on the back knee in front of off. Handscomb wisely decides not to review"
pitched up and worked through midwicket off the inside half of the bat to get going
"ooh, juicy stuff, superb length and he draws Marsh out, bowling from round the wicket and then shaping it away"
"touch short and sliding down the leg side. Good first over from Broad, though"
"length and swerving away, takes the outside edge but Paine manages to squirt this through gully for a couple"
"half-tracker down the leg side, not particularly edifying from Anderson, slugged to fine leg for four now. Paine bringing the pain"
"touch short, defended on off stump"
"length ball, comes across and lines it up"
"Anderson gets this in the right area, short of a length and spitting as Paine moves across and then jerks out of the way"
"fired in and then holding its line, Paine taps it down square off the outer half of the bat"
"good pace, 136kph on off stump, Marsh comes across and blocks"

length outside off and nipping away a fraction as the batsman leaves
"full and straight, drifting on to the pads and Marsh skelps it firmly through midwicket for his first boundary of the day"
"lovely delivery from Anderson, seaming the ball away as Paine feels for it, maybe just a fraction short"
"short and thumped! Sweetly struck, rocking back after an initial move forward and he gets four over midwicket with a business-like whack"
"on a length, starting quite wide and then moving further away"
angled in and defended on off
"targeting the stumps, Paine covers it solidly in defence"
"pitched up but this is a wide half-volley and Paine thrashes it over gully, he's getting stuck into Jimmy right now!"
"overpitched by Broad now, swung early but Marsh was forward and gets over it, sending the ball screaming away square of the wicket for four more"
"good length, 139kph on off stump, dabbed down softly in front of point and they hurry through"
"nicely bowled, good length and holding its line, beats the bat"
"shorter, angled in and rising to hit the thigh pad as Paine works across the line"

"length, already the pink ball becoming harder to shift sideways, Paine gets on to the front foot and carefully pushes into a gap at cover for one"
"pitched up and Paine continues to play his shots, driven down the ground, briefly in the air but wide of the bowler in his follow through and it skitters away for another boundary"
"back of a length, quite wide and left alone"
"banged in and Paine was walking across, takes the blow on the backside"
"fuller, defended in front of the stumps"
"hammers the middle of the pitch, extra grunt in Overton's bouncer, 133kph and it flies over the ducking Paine"
good length on off and Paine shows it a straight bat
"over the wicket, hitting a length and pushing it across the lefty, who leaves"
"Anderson still a touch short, no need to play at it"
"fuller, this comes back, raps him on the knee roll - <b>and given!</b> Marsh reviews but this looks hopeful, it landed on the stumps and straightened... but Hawk-Eye has it bouncing over the stumps! Brilliant review and <b>Marsh survives!</b> Marsh was well forward and that ball seemed to leap off a full length. More frustration for Anderson"
back of a length in the corridor and left alone
"short again, flying through outside off as Marsh drops his hands"
goes fuller and straighter but this time he gets back behind it in defence
"length in the channel, medium pace with a touch of outswing, nothing doing"

"pitched up on off, Marsh pushes a drive short of mid-off and judges a scampered single well"
in the channel and lets this go
"beats the bat on the inside and <b>up goes the finger again!</b> Paine immediately reviews and height could be an issue again... Yes, it struck him on the back leg, actually on the thigh pad, definitely clearing the poles"
"another huge lbw appeal... but Gaffaney isn't giving this one! England look distraught, Root considers the review - but it's a good job they didn't, as there was a thick chunk of bat on it! Crikey"
"sliding in with the arm, Paine pushes at it and thick-edges one to leg"
"good length outside off, left alone"
"smacked on the pads again! Overton likes it, Aleem Dar not interested... Think that was high, too. Spanked on the thigh again, clearing leg stump according to ball-tracking"
angled in and dabbed down the leg side
comes across to defend a fullish ball on off
"back of a length, climbing briskly as Paine works it away to leg for a couple"
too straight and again flicked off the hips for a single to fine leg
"short of a length, a couple of feet outside off, no stroke"
"ooh, that's a beaut, full and then jagging past Paine's groping push forward, like a man feeling for a light switch in the dark"
"goes back and across and steers the ball down towards gully, who dives to cut it off"
"length on the stumps, worked towards mid-on, Broad reacts quickly to prevent the single"
"lovely nut again, maybe could have been a touch fuller, shaping away past the bat"
"back of a length and tapped down to the leg side, Anderson hares after it but they make it through safely"
"bumper from Overton, clears Paine as he thinks better of pulling, YJB can only get the tips on it and Ben Foakes, on as a sub, can't quite prevent four byes - and that's the Aussie 250, too"

shortish outside off and Paine leaves again
slapped into the covers to start Moeen's day
"a touch too short, and cut in front of point"
"over the wicket, and far too short from Moeen, so much time to climb into a pull. Deep midwicket intercepts"
"that's a better length, drawing Marsh forward and playing around his front pad"
half an advance to block back down the pitch
"<B>edged, and short of slip!</B> That's the length, drawing the left-hander forward but turning away. Nudged outside off, but dying short of Root"

"driven to cover, Moeen half-stops, stretching to his right"

"looped up, defended down the track"
"fully forward, Marsh presents a full face as well. None shall pass, like Gandalf. Or David de Gea"
"short and wide, and crashed gleefully over point! England can feel their hopes of a sub-400 total slipping away with every run now"
"bouncer, Paine ducks"
leaning back as Overton aims short once again
"short again. A definite tactic developing in this over, similar to Jake Ball (remember him?) to Smith at Brisbane"

"on the back foot, looking to be aggressive, but keeps it measured with a stabbed block to the off side"
down the leg side
"beaten outside off, a bit of a flaccid waft as Overton finds some lift off the deck"
a sharp single to point! Starc was not ready to respond and Stoneman's shy <B>misses the stumps by a whisker</B>. He'd have been out by two feet!

"shorter and wider, steered into the off side"
pushed firmly to point off the back foot
"down the leg side, swept with ungainly effect. off the back of the glove it would appear, but perfectly safe. No one on the 45 so a long chase for slip"
driven off the back foot to the off side
"tossed up, and squeezes off an inside edge, through backward square. A decent delivery, but Australia march on"
"beaten and is that a chance? I think so, outside off, seemed to graze the edge but Bairstow couldn't gather. EDIT: Snicko is inconclusive, to be fair. He'd have got away with it"
pushed back down the pitch
forward and pushed to point
"outside off, left alone"
"a bit more round-arm from Root this time, fired into the pads"
leaning forward and confidently smothered on the front foot
"round the wicket, sliding on to the pads, Marsh clips it away square and runs two to bring up his second fifty in as many innings. Been a doughty knock"
gets across his stumps to defend
"on the pads again, 130kph from Broad, easing into his work after the break, clipped square for one more"
"speared in to the body, Starc defends and gets a thick inside edge on to his pad that loops to leg... Broad lopes after it and then fires a throw at the non-striker's end, where Marsh was well in, hitting the stumps and gifting Australia a couple more as it deflects away"
"line and length, defended coming forwards"
"banged in, Starc pulls but <b>the ball dollies up to the leg side</b> and Anderson takes a simple running catch coming in from mid-on! Broad does it again in the first over after resuming play - just the (re)start England needed"

"chin music, feisty bouncer from Broad, just wide enough that Cummins has time to move out the way"

"raps the pads, England appeal... and then Root <b>reviews</b> Chris Gaffaney's not-out call; but although there was no bat and it looked good on line, the ball was shown to have pitched outside leg stump. So England lose one of their two reviews"

this time Marsh waltzes down and Matildas a single through mid-on to keep the strike
"short ball, into the body and Marsh swats it away to deep backward square leg"
"pitched up and driven, not out of the meat and it dribbles towards mid-off"
"length ball, tapped into the off side"
"short outside off and Cummins has a waft, going for the back cut again, past the top edge and through to YJB"
"bangs in the bumper, Cummins ducks it"
shortish outside off and dabbed down towards point
tossed up and defended on the front foot
drops a touch short and Marsh stays back to punch this down the ground to long-on for one more
"over the wicket, spinning in from outside off, Cummins keeps it down in defence"
pushed through and tapped into the covers
"slower delivery, wider and Cummins pushes for it and mistimes to mid-off"
"flighted, gives Cummins room to clear the front leg and swipe down the ground, fetched past mid-on and it scuttles away for four more"
defended from the crease
"short, spanked for four more, Marsh swivelling on a pull and it beats the man on the fence again"
"nicely played, slightly wrong-footed by some seam movement but he guides it down between slip and gully for a few more"
"pitched up and chipped, in the air but it <b>clears Overton in his follow through</b>, runs down the ground for another three to bring up the Australia 350"
"round the wicket, 128kph in the channel, left alone"
"pitched up and this nibbles back a smidge, does Marsh as he pushes forward"
"round the wicket, looped onto a good length, and blocked"
"too short, hoisted high and expansively down to Broad on the midwicket rope, who jogs round to gather"
"solidly onto the front foot, and blocked"
"probing line from Moeen, but Marsh won't be hurried, leaning onto the front foot again"
"shorter this time, whipped to short midwicket off the back foot"
"leg-sided, swept, very fine. Marsh marches on"
"good line to the left-hander who shoulders arms as the ball jags back off the seam. A polite enquiry, but clearly going over"
"more nip from a good length, wriggles through the defences to strike the back pad"
"on the hip, and clipped to leg"
"outside off, through to the keeper with slightly sluggish carry"
"angled into the right-hander, squirted down through the cordon"
"solidly drawn onto the front foot. Probing from Woakes, but it's all pretty comfortable for the Aussies"
"tossed up outside off, and left alone"
"tighter line, defended out to point"
striding onto the front foot to block
defended on the back foot
"a tentative poke to a better-length ball, worked into the leg side off an inside edge, but it's enough to rotate the strike"
forward and defended
"cramped for room on leg stump, tucked off the hip"
"bouncer, Cummins limboes effectively to get out of harm's way"
"a crashing cut! That is supreme, Woakes serves up a short, wide offering, and gets utterly lambasted through the covers!"
"better line, targetting the top of off, but back of a length. Oodles of time to line it up and block"
"a judicious leave outside off, he's a very organised player"
stabbed into the leg side again
"back of a length, whipped firmly through midwicket"
solidly onto the front foot
"too short, that's a rank leg-stump long hop, and Cummins belts it behind square, sending Stoneman under the lid scurrying for cover"
forward and pushed down the track
nudged off the legs
solidly onto the back foot to defend
"line and length, but a distinct lack of menace as Marsh stretches onto the front foot"
squeezed to cover off the front foot
"outside off stump, and another leave"
"too short, too wide, too easy. Marsh lays bat on ball to guide a facile four through third man, and Australia march on"
"wide again, but a sharper delivery, no contact on an attempted slash"
"better ball, tight to off stump and climbing sharply"
reaching forward to block
"on the pads, flicked square"
"that is terrific! Making room, striding forward, launching his hands through the line, and easing a one-bounce four over the bowler's head"
down the leg side
pushed back down the pitch
"flicked off the pads, was there bat on that? I think not, as Stoneman can't gather at short leg either way"
"full length, attacking off stump, blocked to the off side"
an easy leave for Marsh as Woakes pulls his length back
"another leave, but a much better ball, as this one bends back late to pass excruciatingly close to off stump"
forward and blocked on the front foot. It's powderpuff from England at present
"drilled into the covers, picks the gap in the inner ring but not the outer circle"
left alone as Woakes fires it out wider
crashed hard to cover. Lovely strike for no run
"short and leg-sided, clipped on its way"
"on the toes, clipped to the leg-side"
solidly into line
pushed diligently into the covers
swung into the leg side as Moeen drops short. He'll keep the strike
"outside off, and through to the keeper"
a calm leave to a tight line outside off
"angled bat, another smart single to third man as Marsh moves into the 90s"
forward to block
"shorter, doesn't get up much, Cummins lines up a limbo cut, but can't make contact"
tucked into the leg side. Such easy pickings. Australia are not breaking sweat at present
spanked high and effectively through the leg side! That's symptomatic of Moeen's lack of turn. Cummins trusted himself to heave across the line with impunity
"forward to drive, into line once again"
"round the wicket, clipped urgently to the leg side"
"crunched! Too wide from Moeen, Marsh used his feet, and his confidence, to pound him majestically through the covers"
another flicked single to the leg-side. He's closing in...
"biff! Does Cummins sense the chance for some quick kills before a late onslaught with the ball? This is utterly clobbered off a good length, travels fast and flat, dipping just inside the rope. England are getting a schooling in this session"
"outside off, left alone"
"short and wide. Smashed square. If Marsh is tightening up internally with his hundred looming, he isn't showing a jot of nerves up front"
banged in short. No stroke offered
"on the hips, nudged square"
"short, and pulled supremely through square leg. Off comes the lid, and that is Marsh's century!"
"bouncer, avoided with a flinch"
"short, ducked"
"on the pads, flicked fine"
"wide line, an under-edged cut to Overton's slower ball"
"round the wicket, angled into the stumps. Blocked again"
"another slower ball, and a loopier full length this time! Marsh doesn't pick it at all and all but drags it onto his stumps. Cunning"
firmly punched to cover
short and left alone
"chopped down to third man, very cramped for room on the short ball, but somehow gets over his shot. Every closer to a richly deserved fifty"
"on the back foot, poked out to point"
flicked behind square for another single
"spliced and <B>dropped</B> in the gully! Deary me, it's all going wrong for England, a sharp lifter from Woakes, Marsh can't get on top of it, Cook appeared to reach the ball low to his left, but Vince, diving to his right, from a wider gully, punched it out of his hand!"
"bouncer, ducked"
pitched up from round the wicket and pushed down the ground for one
"dug in, good bouncer, Cummins flaps it... <b>straight down the throat of third man!</b> England get yet <i>another</i> post-breakthrough, third wicket of the innings for Overton. The short stuff working (sort of)"
"short and a touch wide, sliced away through backward point for a couple"
comes across and pushes into the off side
"width again, Marsh slashes this over slip, healthy top edge and it runs down to third man for four"
"good length, defended into the off side, leaving Lyon strike for the next over"
"banged in short, Lyon attempts to give it the heave ho to leg, ends up wearing the ball on his shoulder"
"banged in short again and Lyon swishes at it, not far from gloving through to the keeper"
"short ball, Lyon tries to swing himself off his feet again, fails to connect"
"banged in, another filthy yahoo from Lyon. He's not much interested in getting into line"
"bumper, soaring over the flailing Lyon's horizontal bat"
"pitched up to finish, not accurate enough and it's whupped through the covers... but there's a man out there and they decline the single"
"touch short outside off and cross-batted over the covers, this time they do run one"
"tries the bouncer straight away, this time Lyon connects... and it goes aaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllll the waaaaaaaaaayyyyyyy! Top-edged for six, well beyond the catcher down at fine leg"
"more short stuff, swing and a miss this time"
"short, Lyon backs away and fails to connect again"
"another filthy smear, top-edged over the keeper - couple more there! YJB hurtled after it but was never in the races for a catch"
"over the wicket, full and wide and this time he chops a couple through the covers. Needless to say, the crowd are <i>loving</i> this"
Broad manages to get one through wide of the stumps
"banged in, Marsh knows what to do with the short ball, crumped forcefully through midwicket and it beats the man in the deep for another salt-flavoured boundary"
"goes full, moral victory for the bowler but four more runs to Marsh, squeezed out down to fine leg"
"hammered straight! One-day batting now, Marsh channels Maximus Decimus Meridius and unleashes hell, a catapult barrage to a length ball, sailing beyond the rope"
"switches over the wicket, full and wide and plopped into the covers"
"dug out and they scamper through as Broad throws down the stumps - <b>and there's the declaration</b>, Smith calls them in!"
"tears in, 145kph straight away and hurled down short and a foot wide of off stump, Cook phlegmatically adjusts his tie clip and leaves"
"back of a length, 144kph at the body, shovelled away through square leg, that's a single to get off the mark"
"puts it on a length, Stoneman gets on to the front foot and blocks short of extra cover, they get through as Warner pounces on it and unleashes a throw"
"touch back of a length, this is 146kph/90mph but Cook judges the line and shoulders arms as it whizzes through past off stump"
"full, approaching 150kph, Starc turning up the heat early, nicely played with a punched drive but mid-on scoots across to prevent any runs"
"on the stumps, maybe looking for the yorker but not quite full enough, dug out to the leg side - 150.5kph to finish off a natty first over from Australia's strike bowler"
"starts full and wide of the stumps, Stoneman again is on the move to chop a single in front of square"
"touch back of a length, 139kph over the stumps, Cook again tucks one through square leg"
"ooh, tempting line, a pair of lacy undies in the corridor, Stoneman has a brief flirt with it but survives"
"good length in the channel, lets this one go"
"overpitched, 142kph, Stoneman is into his work, well forward to punch past mid-off, won't run all the way though"
"ripping ball to finish the over, very tentative footwork from Cook, flashing past the outside edge"
"swing for Starc, takes the leading edge as Stoneman gets squared up, <b>but it flies high and wide of backward point</b>, worth four in the end"
"length ball, Stoneman remains calm and lets this go"
"ooh-wee, that's a fiendish ball, 146kph and pitched up, shaping late as Stoneman attempts to drive, beaten like a kipper!"
full and straight and Stoneman manages to squeeze a single into the on side
"dug in short, 146kph and Cook swats a pull on the bounce to square leg"
"pitched up, full and looking for away swing but Cook covers the line and drops his bat on it"
"rapped on the pads, Hazlewood likes it, imploring for lbw... but I think that pitched outside leg"
"pitched up in the channel, shaping back in, superb line but Stoneman judges it well and leaves"
"fourth stump, hinting at coming back but not enough to make him play"
"goes for the yorker, 144kph as Stoneman jams down on it... and it's taken a chunk out of the toe of the bat! Brutal"
"in the channel, lets this one go again"
"length, on the pads and again Hazlewood goes up, Aleem Dar not interested - pitched well outside leg this time"
"full outside off, Cook is well forward to greet this one"
"superb ball, full in the channel and shaping away as Cook reaches for it and is beaten"
comes across and blunts the swing this time
"goes a touch too straight, 146kph but Cook uses that to his advantage and flicks three through midwicket"
touch back of a length on middle and off and Stoneman gets in behind it
"full length, Stoneman clips slightly uppishly to the leg side, it lands short of midwicket and then slips through him to give away the single"
"pitched up but this is a touch wayward and Cook rams it off his pads through square, beats the sweeper and thuds into the ropes"
"full again, no sense that Australia are going to waste this new-ball swing... Cook stuns it with the middle of his bat"
pitched up on the pads and again Cook squirts a run through midwicket with a trademark nurdle. He's into double-figures for the first time this series
"fullish, not so much swing for Hazlewood, defended on off stump"
"short, width for him to free the arms, he cracks a cut in the air, backward point thought he was in the game but it <i>shot</i> past him almost before he could leap and rattled to the fence"
"back of a length and there's room for Stoneman to tuck in on the cut again, chopped past point and they run two"
"fullish length, drifting into the pads and worked to midwicket"
"short ball, down the leg side and Paine can't quite hold it - Stoneman wanted a run but Cook wasn't moving"
zipping through in the channel outside off
"pitched up, 147kph and Cook shows it a broad blade in defence"
"dug in, Cook rides the bouncer well, pulled with control for one to deep square leg"
"yorker from Starc, screeches into the pads - <b>and Gaffaney gives it</b>, after some thought! Stoneman <b>reviews</b>, it was a touch leg side but he was a long was back in the crease - and Hawk-Eye shows it smashing leg stump flush on! That's gone, the DRS isn't coming to Engand's rescue. Starc rips out the first!"
"Hazlewood thunders in now, defended on off stump"
"pitched up, comes across and blocks"
"in the channel outside off stump, Cook lets this one go"
"length down the leg side, Cook fiddles at it and Paine appeals for the catch behind - flicked the pad"
"pitched up a foot or so outside off, left alone as he comes across"
"good pace and bounce, Cook is able to leave on length, though, as it flies over the stumps"

"full outside off, angled across the right-hander from over the wicket, left alone"
"zinged down, swerving away as Vince presses forwards, testing line and it beats the bat before thumping into the gloves"
"shortish, 145kph and tapped down square of the wicket"
"pitched up, quite wide of the stumps and there's no need for him to play"
"full on the pads and Vince misses out, connects well but sends it straight to square leg on the bounce"
"woof, that's a snorter to begin with, did it flick the edge? Australia certainly thought so but not enough to try and overturn Aleem Dar's not-out decision... Yep, good call, brushed the back pad"
"good length outside off, wide enough for Cook to lean out and usher it through without alarm"
"touch short of a length, 137kph and defended on the back foot"
"in the channel, shaping back a touch but no stroke"

touch short outside off and Vince starts with a neat punch through the covers for a couple to get off the mark
"angled in straighter, worked off the pads"
"length, 136kph and met solidly coming forward to block on off stump"
"<b>edged and gone!</b> Regulation nick off, Vince's resistance wilts to his fourth ball of the day! There was no need to play at this, really - back of a length and rising in the channel, for some reason Vince felt compelled to try and force it away, but only succeeded in tickling through to the keeper. Loose and goosed"
"Hazlewood probes away outside off, good length and springing through to Paine as Root leaves"
"fullish, tight on off stump, Root defends on the front foot"
"pitched up on off, some shape in as Cook defends"
rising in the channel outside off and left alone
"pitched up, 138kph on middle and leg, Cook whisks it away through midwicket for a couple, his first runs of the morning"
nudged into the covers and they scuttle through
"pitched up, 140kph and Root meets it coming forwards, checked towards mid-on"
"full and straight, they're targeting Root's front pad already, he gets bat on it but not entirely convincingly, slightly overbalancing as he plays across the line"
"pitched up, that's too straight and in Cook's leg-glance comfort zone, he eases a couple more off his pads"
"length, in the channel, not much in the way of seam movement and left alone"
"perfect line and length, 139kph and Cook has a rare moment of indecision, comes forward and then thinks about leaving and ends up deflecting it down towards gully"
"pitched up and this is a more authoritative stroke, on to the front foot and oiling a cover drive into the green acres, Warner hurtles after it and keeps them to two"
Cook gets into line and prods to the off side
"bouncer from Hazlewood, he takes on the pull... and just manages to clear square leg! Not completely in control, the short ball getting ball getting big on Cook as it did in the second innings at the Gabba, but he gets a couple more"
"sliding into the pads and Root doesn't miss out this time, whipped through midwicket for two"
"touch short, outside off and tapped down square"
"on the stumps, searching for Kryptonite, taken smartly off the front pad with another wristy clip and they run hard for three"
"angled across, back of a length and left alone"
"dug in, 142kph and going away from Cook, he was shaping to pull again but decided the line wasn't in his favour and dropped the hands"
"length, 141kph a fraction outside off, Cook nonchalantly taps to the leg side and they saunter through"
"round the wicket to Cook, sliding down the leg side, flick and a miss"
"good length outside off stump, not coming in enough to make Cook play at it"
"oof, nearly suckered him this time, pitched up and nibbling off the pitch, beats Cook's attempted expansive drive. That's perhaps why he doesn't attempt expansive drives very often"
"back into leaving mode, shuffles across and watches it past"
fired in and tucked to the on side
"pitched up, 142kph on middle and off, tapped towards mid-on - good over from Hazlewood, a maiden"
"full, 141kph from Cummins, driven without timing towards mid-off"
"back of a length and guided down to third man, nicely played from the crease, using the pace and picks up four"
"full in the channel, Root goes hard... <b>and slices to third slip!</b> What a moment, England's captain gone! Cummins is stoked, Australia are in their element, a second wicket of the morning and it might be the nail in England's chances. Short and then full and Root wasn't in synch, thick-edging an ambitious drive"
"round the wicket, good length outside off and left alone"
climbing to hit the outside edge - <b>but it falls short of slip!</b> More ominous signs for England
"touch short, wide of the stumps and Malan is able to let it go"
pushed into the body and Cook works one away
"teasing line, rising outside off, Malan holds his bat inside it"
"good pace and carry, 142kph a few inches outside off stump, left again"

"coming back in the channel, not enough to make Cook play"
pitched up and blocked solidly coming forwards
fullish outside off and Cook steps out to block the path
"touch shorter, 146kph and on fifth/sixth stump, no need to play"
"whoosh, that's a false stroke, pace and bounce as the ball straightens a smidge off the pitch, Cook feeling for it unsuccessfully"
goes straighter with his line and Cook uses that to his advantage to tuck one more off his body and retain the strike
"Lyon creeps in and floats up a cherry bomb, there's some turn as Cook opens the face and prods square in defence"
"flighted, this grips even more and takes the edge, played softly though and it runs behind square for a couple"

"good length, 135kph to start off with, Malan comes across to defend on off"
"short of a length, poked into the off side on the back foot"
"good length, veering in and striking the pads, Australia go up - <b>and Dar gives it after an age!</b> Malan is very quick to <b>review</b>, think this hit on the thigh pad to height must be an issue; yes, replays show it was high on the back leg, ball-tracking has it going over and <b>the decision is overturned</b>: Malan survives"

back of a length on off and defended from the crease

"on the stumps and turned to the leg side, this time he does get off strike"
"full and straight, worked away through midwicket"
"short ball outside off, Malan has a bit of a whoosh and fails to connect, Starc lets him know what he thinks of it"

"on the hip, tucked calmly behind square as Malan hops inside the line"
"short and firmly pulled to deep midwicket. Cook is looking composed in this innings, which is more than can be said for England in general"
"well, there we go, composure can go hang! Cook props onto the front foot, with two close catchers on the off side. Lyon tweaks one off his edge, and slip gobbles the offering with glee! A tame end to a doughty knock, and now the wheels are truly coming off England's innings!"
"yikes, start as you mean to go on, Mo! A huge slash outside off, and a loud noise of some sort. Bat on the keeper's gloves? The ball eluded the edge, just"

"advancing to meet the pitch of the ball once more, blocked back to the bowler"
"yowser! That explodes off the pitch, takes the shoulder of the bat and rips off Paine's elbow and over the slips! But the danger isn't over yet, as Malan calls the single and Moeen has to scamper to make his ground! Technically, that's a <B>drop</B>, and a run-out chance"

nudged into the leg side
"sliding onto the pads this time, and that's a tremendous wallop from Moeen, sighting it early and smashing his sweep hard through square leg"
"wider outside off, and Moeen has his dander up. Another belligerent slog through the leg side. Good intent. Those are England's first boundaries for 15 overs!"
"another bouncing bomb outside off stump, it jags back viciously from just back of a length, flicks the inside edge and sails through to Paine behind the stumps! Malan has to go this time, and England's Ashes are in a smouldering heap!"

"through to the keeper with a flashy, flat-footed drive. Careful now!"

"fuller length, outside off, a firm punch into the covers"
"crikey! Bairstow's determination to drive is so nearly his downfall! Perfect length from Cummins, nibbling off the deck, and beating a firm-footed waft by a matter of nanometres"
"good aggressive follow-up, a well-directed bouncer, just to keep Jonny honest. But he's got a good head on those shoulders..."
leaning forward to defend down the pitch
"a wristy nurdle from a fuller-length delivery, tucked out to midwicket"
"on the back foot, defended on the up, into the leg side"
turning down the leg side
"dancing feet from Bairstow, trying to create an angle, punched out to point"
"'bowled Gaz'... another attacking tweaker, on a middle and leg line,  Bairstow punches back to the bowler off the back foot"
tapped to the leg side
fully forward and drilled to short cover. A good compact drive for no runs
worked into the gap
"extra pace, extra nip, that's a cracking delivery. Hits the seam, explodes past another urgent push from Bairstow. His edge is living dangerously"
"that's better from Bairstow! Fuller, straighter, driven through long-off. A confident stride, head over the ball, biffed with intent"
"beaten again. This a cracking duel, as Cummins finds that no-man's length once again, to leave Bairstow hanging outside off"
good use of the feet as Moeen biffs a drive to mid-off
"tight line and length, threatening to turn back into the stumps as Bairstow drives off the back foot"
Bairstow returns the strike to his partner
sharp turn! Moeen is lured by that one as it tweaks past his edge
"outside off, good lines, no stroke this time"
"striding forward, tucked to mid-on"
"driven through the covers! That's the length that Bairstow's been waiting for, head over the ball, clean through the ring"
"looking for the drive again, but not quite there this time, looked like a cutter, as it popped off the face of the bat"
"on the back foot, tapped down into the crease"
"outside off, through to the keeper on a wafer-tight line"
"banged in short, no stroke offered"
"outside off, through to the keeper once again"
punched out through point
"up on the toes once more, pushed to cover"
"tossed up, dips outside off, Bairstow chisels a single past the outstretched hands of the bowler"
forward and tucked into the leg side
tucked to the leg side
"big turn outside off, a well-judged leave from Moeen, and a groan of appreciation from the keeper"
"edged, and well snaffled on the bounce at third slip by Bancroft! Threatening"
"a touch straight, Bairstow accepts the pad-side offering and nicks the single"
"on the back foot, blocked down into the crease"
"well driven as Cummins over-pitches, outside off and firmly guided down the ground"
"outside off, no stroke offered"
"tucked into the leg side, and that will be tea"
"round the wicket to Moeen, who leans out and dinks a drive through the covers for one"
"over the wicket now, tossed up and pushed into the covers"
"shorter, goes back and nudges away to leg"
"dragged down a little short and spinning to leg, the sweep is on but Bairstow doesn't quite get hold of it"
goes back and works a straight ball through the leg side
flatter outside off and Moeen pats it to cover off the back foot
"round the wicket, full in the channel, nothing doing (yet)"
"fired in straighter, 139kph on middle, calmly clipped towards midwicket"
"very full and wide, Bairstow isn't quite alert to the possibility of spanking the full toss and misses with a drive"
"dug in, 140 kays, hops back into line and blocks"
"slung down, climbing rapidly and homing in from wide of the wicket, not close enough to make him play"
"touch short of a length again, 140kph a foot outside off and YJB ignores it"
"dances down, bit of a woolly woof from Moeen, thickish outside edge as drives over cover but it lands safely"
"flight and dip, it's chipped back in the air, waaaaaaaaayyyy to the left of the bowler... <b>only for Lyon to pluck a one-handed screamer!</b> Holy smokes! That's not nice, Garry, it's <i>sensational</i>! Slightly loose from Moeen, done by the ball dropping on him, but the connection was firm and it brought out the Superman in Lyon as he soared to his left and grabbed it with the surety that characterises everything Australia do right now"
"over the wicket now, tossed up and defended watchfully"
comes across and pushes the ball away
"spinning in from outside off, Woakes nudges it down"
"uses the feet, comes down and covers the line to push a single into the covers and get off the mark"
short and rising as Woakes stays deep and gets in behind it to defend
"another bumper, kept out phlegmatically"
"snorting bouncer, a real perfume ball - smell that - as Woakes wobbles on the back foot and manages not to get anything on it"
"short, not rising quite as high and this is defended from the crease"
"banged in and banged out of the middle, Woakes nails a pull behind the man at deep square and picks up four - although I'm fairly certain he had his eyes closed"
"ooh, good riposte, square him up with a lifter that goes away and takes the edge but flies short of gully"
"Lyon into an easy rhythm, as ever, defended coming forwards"
"gives it some air, YJB props forward and gets a thickish inside edge for one"
"tossed up outside off, lets this one go through to the keeper"
shouts of 'catch it!' as the ball grips and hits the edge before popping off the pad... but it's well short of the leg-side catcher
"tentative movements forward, deflected down towards short leg with the turn"
"flighted outside the line of off, comes forward and taps it away"
"short and rising over the stumps, Bairstow gets into line and repels it"
"back of a length, too straight, no reverse as yet for Starc, clipped through square leg to the sweeper"
"over the wicket to Woakes, slanted across him as the batsman hangs back"
"through him, fiendish line and the extra bounce as the ball leaves Woakes has him poking at thin air"
"done him again, short enough to leave but there's not much room for clear thinking in these circumstances as Woakes flirts with it and the ball shoots through"
"hops back in the crease and jabs to the off side, picks up a single"
"floated up full on off, Woakes blocks"
"gives it some air, defended stoutly coming forwards"
"nicely flighted and this bounces up to hit Woakes on the body as he played back, off the inside edge in fact, but landing at his feet rather than in the eager paws of a catching fielder"
tossed up on the stumps and worked away to leg
Bairstow goes back and flicks another single through backward square
"good length, turning in a fraction and defended on off"
"pitched up and driven in the air, Starc sticks out a hand... <b>and juggles the rebound to complete the catch!</b> Everything they touch turns to green-and-gold today! Bairstow departs now, staring at the heavens as England slide into Ashes hell. He struck the ball well but Starc reacted brilliantly, parrying it with his right hand and then turning to grasp it behind him"
"steaming bouncer to welcome him, climbing over the head of the new man"
"over the wicket, length on the body and fended through square leg for his first Test run"
"fierce, seaming away off a length, Woakes swishes airily at it and is beaten"
"hammers a length, 144kph on off stump, gets across to defend this one"
"fuller, Woakes presses forward and drives back to the bowler"
"pushed through, slightly leg side as Overton goes back on leg stump"
floated up and pushed gently into the off side
"tossed up, on the stumps and dinked down the ground to long-on"
"full and flighted, blocked coming forwards"
"Woakes comes forward but is suckered by the ball going on, a thick edge runs wide of the slips and they run well for three"
full on the stumps and turned to the leg side
"Starc bringing the heat, 145kph on a length, rebuffed into the off side"
"banged in short, aiming for the rib cage, Woakes manages to get across and throws his hands up to avoid damage"
shuffles across and manages to stab a single through the covers
"short and rising towards the body, 144kph as Overton jabs it away, <i>just</i> past Shaun Marsh at short leg!"
"rapid bouncer, horrible for the batsman to deal with, Woakes leaps for his life and manages to block it safely down in front of his feet"
short and flung wide this time and Woakes responds with a meaty swipe through cover point to pick up four - and take England past 150 in the process. Small victories
"back of a length, straightening a touch as Overton prods it away from the crease"
"steepling bouncer, hard for a tall man like Overton to get out of the way of... but he manages to"
"short, peppering the body, this nips back inside the bat and hits him on the thigh pad"
"short and wide and slapped through backward point, kept the ball down and there's no one out there to prevent four"
"oof, a genuine throat ball, Overton coming across and he has to take evasive action"
"banged in, 141kph and it's another beast of a ball to deal with, Overton manages to ride the bounce and drop it to earth"
short and Woakes rides it to steer one away square of the wicket
"banged in, rising like the Kraken from the deep, Overton fends it in front of short leg, where Bancroft snaffles it and then underarms on to the stumps - but the bat was grounded"
"short ball, swung away powerfully down towards fine leg, Hazlewood has to run around to his left but does brilliantly to reel the ball in one handed as it bounced beyond the rope, dragging it back to prevent four"
Woakes jumps back and across to defend
"bumper, slightly leg side, Woakes hops on the spot and jabs it away between the two close catchers"
"short ball (natch), Woakes pulls with something approaching confidence, between the two men in the deep but Hazlewood again does well to prevent a boundary"
"over the wicket, short and rising but again well dealt with"
"oh, nicely played, Overton makes sure to get forward and meets a length ball with a spiffy square drive that zips to the rope"
"short of a length outside the line of off stump, prodded down towards cover"
"yeow, 141kph and homing in on the bonce, punched down into the ground in front of short leg - still playing them pretty well"
"more chin music - or, more accurately, top-of-the-block music - flying through a matter of millimetres from Overton's helmet as he jumps and ducks at the same time"
short and at the body but shovelled away behind square for a single
"banged in short, down the leg side as Overton pulls and misses"
"very short, more of a danger to airplanes flying over Adelaide, called wide on height"
COverton shuffles across and flicks a single off his hip to get off strike
"thud, thud, thud - that's the sound of <del>England</del> the middle of the pitch taking a beating. Woakes ducks"
short again and Woakes takes the bottom hand off as he steers it away to leg
"yikes, <b>spooned over short leg!</b> Cummins goes over the wicket, bangs in a cobra of a bumper, it homes in on Woakes who somehow manages to get it up and over the man in close"
fired in at the body and tapped away
"outside off, back of a length, punched to cover"
flipped off the hip ... in the air .... but short of deep backward square. A calculated risk. Sort of
"fired into the pads, tucked round the corner"
angled defence into the off side
"attacking the ribs once again, Woakes is living dangerously with that fenced defence to leg"
"much fuller, and that was the one that Woakes was waiting for, a calm punch to mid-on, and this is now <B>the best partnership of the innings</B>. Sound the *fightback-starts-here* klaxon!"
"tight line, back of a length, blocked into the off side"
"propping forward, angled through point, useful accumulation"
"another well-directed bouncer, but Overton won't be drawn"
tentatively forward to defend
"back of a length once more, punched out to the off side"
"short and sharp, but Overton is equal to the task, dropping the ball at his feet like Obama dropping the mic. Without anything resembling the context of a job done, of course"
"width and walloped! Calypso-style, to boot, down on one knee, flashing the blade, and clean through point. Top boshing"
"up on the toes, tucked to leg. The patient continues to have a pulse"
"uncomfortably forward, poking a back-of-a-length ball back to the bowler"
"flipped up and off the toes, to midwicket"
"on the hips, flipped round the corner, more runs to the cause. Australia might need a slight rethink of their tactics here. This pair haven't enjoyed the short stuff, but they are enduring"
"fuller and straighter, worked to the leg side for another useful single"
"looks like it! Round the wicket, targetting the blockhole, but well enough dug out this time, out through midwicket"
blocked back down the pitch from a fuller length again
"round the wicket, solidly blocked on middle stump. Starc swoops in his followthrough"
"back of a length, and that's a solid punch through the gap in the covers. A sensible stand brewing between these two"
"short, sharp, spliced, safe. Woakes was looking to punch that through point but it kept getting bigger on him. No matter, it's a boundary and the 50 stand"
"full and threatening, angled in from round the wicket. Well dug out"
"tossed up from over the wicket, worked to the leg side"
"slightly shorter, flicked firmly round the corner"
"up on the toes, punched back to the bowler"
"extra flight and bite outside off, Woakes pokes forward with caution, pad and bat together to guard against the spin"
nudged off the back foot to short leg
looped up and defended once again
forward and blocked
forward and cautiously blocked
"banged in short, and Overton turns turtle"
"outside off, left alone (just about) as the ball nibbles off the seam"
"short, and leg-sided. A bit of a wasted delivery"
"that's an absolute pearler. Left-arm line from over the wicket, pitching on off, drawing the stroke, holding its line, and somehow failing to snick the edge through to the keeper. Can't do much with those"
"over the wicket, appreciable turn and a bit of a flat-footed back-foot block from Woakes, who isn't keen on over-committing"
flipped to leg with an urgent whirlwind of the arms
patted back down the pitch
"plant the front dog and heave-ho! Overton is bored of circumspection, and spanks a handsome slog-sweep through midwicket!"
"nudged round the front pad, another single"
"looped up, dips late, flicked down to mid-on"
nurdled into the leg side
"full-length outswinger, that's a dangerous delivery, but well watched all the way, and pushed out to cover"
"attacking the top of off from over the wicket, blocked firmly"
defended on the back foot again
"back of a length, a touch too wide, nipping unthreateningly past the edge"
"fuller length, wide line, safe enough to put bat on ball with a firm push. Deep point gathers and wings in a rather wild shy. It's all England at the moment!"
forward and blocked
"head over the ball, pushed to the bowler"
"another firm drive, but Lyon pounces in his followthrough"
"big turn, Lyon is up for an optimistic lbw appeal. That would have missed a third set"
tapped to leg from a full length
"better line and length, attacking the front pad from round the wicket. Blocked back down the line of the ball"
"round the wicket, worked with confidence into the leg side"
another nudged single to leg
"round the wicket, attacking the base of the off stump, but solidly dug out"
"oh, that is a terrible way to end a battling innings. A fraction short, Woakes is in no position for the pull, and a filthy top-edge plops straight up and straight back down into Starc's grateful hands!"
"up on the toes, jabbed to the off side"
attacking the rib-cage from round the wicket. Broad hops into line to defend
"banged in short, and Overton ducks"
"wow, that exploded from a good length, fizzed past Overton's nose as he just about kept his bat out of harm's way"
"short again, Overton flinches to let the ball sail over his head"
"line and length, solid one-handed block outside off"
"short and wide, slashed over third man. Useful runs, as England inch ever closer to resolving any argument about the follow-on"
"up on the toes, punched out to cover"
"round the wicket, beats the edge as Overton pokes forward with his feet stuck in clay"
"fuller length, squeezed out to cover"
"angled into the pads, tucked to the leg side"
"leaping across the crease, deflected fine off the thigh pad. More valuable runs"
"short and sharp, leaping past the edge as Broad drops his hands well"
"flicked into the leg side, to end another session of isolated competitiveness, but mostly remorseless Australian dominance"
"round the wicket, tossed up and spinning through outside off"
Broad presses foward and pushes into the covers
drifting in with the arm and worked around the corner to get off strike
"tossed up on middle and leg, pushed away"
"flighted, Overton plays positively, gets the front dog down the pitch and blaps four back past the bowler"
floated up a touch leg side and Overton lets it spin through behind his legs
"round the wicket, dug in short and Broad sways out of the way"
"rib-tickler from Cummins, he's turning his back on it and wears the blow"
"short ball, taken by the leaping Bancroft at short leg... was there any bat on it? Superb catch diving to his left, but it was off the body"
stays back and manages to squirt one away to deep backward square
"over the wicket to Overton, fullish outside off, gets him feeling for it but the thick edge runs low and wide of slip for one to third man"
"more bumper action, Broad is on the dodgems and again manages to jab one safely away between short leg and leg gully"
tossed up from round the wicket and blocked
Broad props forward to defend
"pushed through on the stumps, nudged away"
"turn and bounce, <b>takes the edge!</b> Broad knew but Gaffaney's finger went up to make sure - Lyon does it again, good ball to any batsman, let alone a tailender keen to hang back; just kissed the edge as he closed the face and Paine followed it well with the gloves"
"tossed up and there's spin again, past the edge as Anderson tries to force it off the back foot"
"flighted on off stump, blocked shuffling forwards"
"fiery bouncer to start with, Overton crouches out of the way"
stays back in the crease and gets it into the covers but they won't get a run despite Overton being interested
"pitched up and he tries to flay through the covers, manages to pick out mid-off"
"full and straight, plinked towards mid-on"
"short ball, Overton is forward and then crouching as he tries to hook-cum-sweep and fails to connect"
banged in short and Overton doesn't bother to take it on
"tossed up and Anderson is hit on the front leg trying to sweep - given! He <b>reviews</b>, which he might as well, hoping it's missing leg. But he hopes in vain, Hawk-Eye showing it to be smacking leg stump in the mush"
"touch back of a length, decking away as Bancroft drops into the crease and leaves"
"definitely some movement for Anderson, but again it's short enough to ignore"
"length around fourth stump, patted down into the off side"
"that's better length, shaping as Bancroft begins to think about a leg clip, the leading edge bobbles back to the bowler"
"in the channel, 130kph and left alone"
"pitched up and straightening a touch but Bancroft plays it smartly with low hands and an open face, guiding the ball to the boundary through backward point"
"pitched up, curling away... and it's signalled as a wide, to Broad's disgust"
"fullish and a couple of feet outside off, again holding its line and left alone by Warner"
"continues to go full in the channel, 133kph, no stroke"
"fired in straighter, 138kph on middle and off as Warner comes across and blocks"
"full on middle, it's angled in and then begins to curve as the batsman covers it and defends down the track"
"pitched up, flashes past the bat as Warner pushes without foot movement and Bairstow goes up... Broad says he couldn't hear anything but Root is keen and decides to <b>review</b>. Was there a thin edge? Well, neither Hot Spot nor Snicko thinks so, the decision stands, England's review is lost and the crowd gently gurgles in delight"
"in the channel, Warner goes back to leaving them be"
"full and swinging, Jimmy finds his groove but <b>the outside edge is beyond the reach of Bairstow!</b> He made a good diving effort but it bounced short of slip and Anderson practises his frown"
"oh, got him this time! Another juicy in-and-out burger, perfect new-ball delivery and Bancroft again has a little feel for it, just a scrape of the outside edge through to Bairstow and this time there's no doubt about the result. England amongst 'em"
"hello boys! Booming inswinger straight up and it nearly fillets Khawaja first ball, pitching just outside off and jagging back, past the bat and missing off by a whisker"
"touch shorter, again hooping in to hit the batsman on the body"
"pushes this across now, length ball threatening to nip away on off, defended off the outer half of the bat"
"pitched up around off stump, Khawaja presses forward and blocks assertively"
"oof, that's a good ball, the lights are infusing this pink pill with magical qualities once again, zipping off a length past the edge as Warner pokes"
"touch shorter and in the channel, he ignores this one"
"Warner dances across the ring and lands a punch, just a singe into the covers"
"Broad hits a tricky length just outside off, 138kph and holding its line, into the gloves as Khawaja is beaten"
"full in the channel, tip-toes across and leaves confidently"
"full, too straight this time, neatly clipped off the pads for his first run through midwicket"
"extra bounce, seaming away as Khawaja comes across, judges it pretty well"
gets into line and taps down towards cover
"length, 135kph and hinting at away movement, covers the line and blocks to the off side"
"good length outside off, holding its line after pitching but Khawaja doesn't follow it"
"ooh, jaffa cakes for tea! A nippy, zippy away-decker, pitching on and then scissoring past the outside edge as Khawaja gropes down the wrong line"
"shorter, again swerving away, Khawaja is nearly drawn into following it"
pitched up from round the wicket and Warner gets into line
"fullish, around off stump, not so much lavish movement for Broad and it's blocked again"
pitched up but quite wide and he's happy to let this goes
"jeepers, that's a sweet nut, you'd do well to get anything on one of those! Zinging in and straightening <i>just</i> enough, Warner prods and misses"
makes a bit of room for himself and steers a single
"fired in on a length, nips to take the edge but he keeps it down and it flies wide of the slips for four, much to Broad's chagrin"
"short and rising, that looked to surprise Warner a little, he drops the hands"
comes across and defends a back-of-a-length ball
"gets it up towards the blockhole, swerving late as Warner brings the bat down, an inside edge saves him from a more concerted lbw appeal"
strays down the leg side
"back of a length, curving away from Warner after hitting the seam, he just about has time to adjust and get his bat out of the way"
"length ball, a touch straight and nudged away"
"drops short, angling in to the body and Khawaja flips a couple past square leg"
"fired in over the stumps, Uzzie is moving across and it deflects behind square off his thigh pad for a leg bye"
"full length wide of the stumps, no interest from Warner"
"tempting length and big away swing for Broad, lures Warner into a drive - and this time Broad thinks there's an edge! Bairstow and Root know otherwise, a shake of the head sends Broad back to his mark. They'll not waste another one"
climbing through off a length as Warner moves across and leaves
"on to the front foot, shoulders arms again"
"Anderson continues to bustle in, pushed across the bows, no stroke"
"length ball on fourth stump, 133kph and not coming back, judged well and left"
"fuller, gets him playing this time, nibbles the edge but Khawaja keeps it down, on the bounce to gully"
short of a length and down the leg side
"on the stumps, Khawaja waits for it and taps to the on side"
"full and hurtling back in like a dervish from wide of off stump, but it was slightly off target and Khawaja is able to leave again"
nice shape on the ball as Broad probes in the channel but again Warner is comfortable in leaving
"full and on the pads, bit of a gimme and Warner chips it in the air, not all that far from mid-on but it runs away safely for a few"
"pushed through wide of the stumps, 138kph but no stroke demanded again"
"better line, full length and beginning to fade away as Khawaja gets across and pokes to cover"
"woof, beaten again, a teasing line from Broad but again it misses the edge... maybe still a smidgen short"
full on the stumps and nudged away to the leg side for a single
"oh, too good again, perfect length on middle-and-leg then jerking away from Khawaja, daylight between bat and ball but it flicked the back pad, eliciting an appeal from behind the stumps"
full on the pads and he tickles this away for one
"angled across, not close enough to make Warner commit"
speared in and swinging but it's leg side and Warner is able to help it on its way past fine leg for his first boundary
"that's the line, curling in but not quite full enough to defeat Warner, who punches back to the bowler"
"sidling through in the channel outside off, lets this one through"
"round the wicket, 125kph to start with and defended coming forwards"
pitched up and nibbling away as Khawaja reaches out and manages to control a thick edge between the slips for four
goes a little straighter and Uzzie works to leg
"digs in the short ball, 131kph but he rides the bounce and defends"
"easy-paced stuff, on the stumps and pushed towards mid-on"
Overton goes short again and Khawaja picks up his second boundary of the over with a crisp pull through square
"full and booming away towards the slips, wide enough to leave"
"puts it on a length in the channel, again Warner watches it through"
"round the wicket, pitched up and beginning to swing away, stabbed down towards backward point"
"back of a length, 135kph, jabbed down into the off side"
"full and swinging away in the channel, left alone again"
"pitched up, still quite wide and Warner doesn't need to follow it"
"bit of a loosener, short and wide at 128kph but Khawaja finds point with his cut shot"
"tighter to the stumps, 133kph and decent carry outside off but he's able to leave on length"
"angled across from over the wicket, not a great line and it drifts away further"
"touch short, seaming in appreciably, flies through at waist height as Khawaja shoulders arms"
"back of a length, 136kph and he's struck on the body attempting to leave again"
slides on to the legs and clipped for one behind square
"an extravagant out-jagger of a delivery, back of a length though, and easily left"
"fired down the leg-side, a scrambled stop from Bairstow"
"good ball, nipping back from outside off and cramping Warner's style, just as he was lining up the cut. Blocked in the end"
"full length, angled in, squirted to point"
"angled in from round the wicket, Warner is in no hurry to extend Australia's lead. Oodles of time left to do that tomorrow"
"on the legs as Anderson goes over the wicket this time, nudged down the leg side"
"crushing drive into the covers, but straight to the man"
"up on the toes, punched out to point"
nurdled into the leg side
"good leave, as Woakes fires one across the left-hander's bows, very tight to the top of off"
"left once again, good line, good leave"
still nothing doing outside off stump
"outside off, jagging off the seam but too wide to tempt a shot"
"a solid line and length, but Khawaja is unmoved"
"round the wicket, looking to angle away from the left-hander"
sitting in on a tight line but it's stalemate at the moment
blocked into the off side
more nip off the seam this time as Khawaja wears this on the thumb
"big nipper from Woakes, flirting past the edge like a pair of fluttering eyelashes"
"back of a length, patted down into the crease"
stabbed back down the pitch
tapped out to point
"fuller length, right under the eyeline as Warner drives into the covers"
another over negotiated
"very full, fair too wide from Jimmy"
"outside off, nipping away, easily ignored by Warner"
tucked to leg
"huge appeal, and Anderson may have broken through! Up goes the finger, but Khawaja has <B>reviewed</B>, after a long pause for thought, it must be added, so no chance he nicked it. The ball straightened on off stump, beat the edge, and was <B>clipping off stump!</B> Off he goes. Anderson gets reward for his perseverance, but it's hard to claim it's a lifeline"
"round the wicket, attacking the stumps from the outset. Jags late and Smith has to defend in haste"
solidly on the spot. Impressive welcome to the crease from Anderson
"outside off, through to the keeper with no stroke offered"
through to the keeper again
"on the toes, clipped to midwicket"
defended again on a full length
"edged and <strong>straight to second slip!</strong> Now then, is this a glimmer of a chance for England? Perfect line, nipping sharply off the seam, careering into the splice and straight into the bread-basket"
"<strong>edged but safe!</strong> Outside off, finds a thin nick  but bounces in front of Root in the cordon. Things Are Happening"
"round the wicket, <strong>full length, and gone!</strong> Smith is <strong>reviewing </strong>but this is surely plumb... maybe just outside leg if anything, but it'll be umpire's call, you suspect. Smith simply played round a straight one. <B>It pitched a millimetre outside leg!</B> Wow. What a moment in this Test, and this series. That simply could not have been closer"
"outside off, and through to the keeper"
"uncomfortably onto the front foot, and fenced away with a tangle of limbs"
"whipped off the toes! It's a boundary, but it's also a bit of a chancy counter-attack to a full and swinging delivery. This is a battle and a half!"
"a <I>huge</I> cutter from Anderson, pitching leg, jagging like a legbreak. Defended with everything behind the line"
back over the wicket and Smith gratefully clips a leg-stump delivery through backward square
nibbling off the seam and through to the keeper
"slower ball, wicket to wicket. Defended"
"angled defence out into the gully, off the back foot"
"onto the front foot, driven firmly into the gap in the covers"
"line and length, blocked back whence it came"
an elaborate leave as Woakes fires out out wide
"outside off, a sighter, no stroke needed"
through to the keeper once again
"this one nibbles a touch from back of a length, through to the keeper once more, but Handscomb threatened to play at that one"
"bends back into the right-hander from back of a length. Well bowled, but well blocked"
"wider line, left alone"

"immediately edged, down through the cordon! Tough times..."
beats the edge with a bit of zing off the deck. Testing times!

"back of a length, nipping away off the pitch as Handscomb hangs back"
"short and rearing, there's bite in this, <b>flies off the shoulder of the bat to slip!</b> But Handscomb reviews straight away, he looks pretty confident... and replays quickly show it came off <i>his</i> shoulder rather than the bat. No glove on it either, so that will be <b>decision overturned</b>, good review from Handscomb"
"fired into the pitch a lot straighter, 133kph and bending to clip the leading edge, turned him round again"
"pitched up and targeting the stumps, again Handscomb starts to get front on as he closes the bat face and a low leading edge scoots to cover-point"

"dug in again, climbing towards the top of the bonce, he jerks out of the way"
"goes for the stumps, not quite full enough for the yorker... and Lyon continues to go merrily about his way, backing off to slap four through point"
"ooh, past the edge! Broad puts it on a good length, beats Lyon as he swishes from the crease"
"on the stumps, where's this gone...?! Swirling leading edge as he shovels to leg but it clears two men in the covers and he'll survive some more"
"full and driven, now Handscomb is in the runs, nicely steered through the covers although Broad gamely gives chase to prevent four"
"backing away, chipped in the air <b>and taken at mid-off!</b> The GOAT has been tethered... the adrenaline from that knock to the head probably didn't help, trying to heave over the off side. England get rid of the nightwatchman"
"touch short on the leg side, worked for one"
banged in short as Handscomb creeps underneath it
"French cricket from Handscomb, front on as he gets across on off stump and thick-edges a push through point for two"

"gottim! Handscomb's been on the fritz and the fuse finally blows, another stock-still lunge at he ball and <b>Malan snaffles a superb catch low at third slip!</b> That was about as uncomfortable as watching a hedgehog try to cross the M25"
"in the channel, holding its line and left alone"
"comes across on off, again the ball is slightly wide and there's no need to play"
Marsh comes across to a fullish ball and defends quietly. He's the key man now

"plays back, manages to keep on top of the edge, well grabbed by diving gully on the bounce"

"top-edged pull, and <B>that's a brilliant take from Overton!</B> That was swirling as it fizzed down to fine leg, but he committed early, despite the presence of square leg in his eyeline, and dived forward well to grab low to the ground. Another excellent display of ticker from the debutant, who's had a quietly impressive allround game"

through to the keeper once more

short and jabbed out to point
smacked out to deep cover

"pitched up, 142kph a foot or so wide of the stumps, no stroke"
good length and decking away as Stoneman edges across and leaves it alone
"boing! That's a crackerjack ball, extravagant movement as it swings and darts away, quite a big gap between bat and ball as he pushes forward"
"beaten again, although he might have <i>just</i> held his bat inside the line as it curved away outside off"
"tight on off, 140kph and coming in off the pitch this time, blocked firmly into the off side"
"pitched up and Stoneman has a little flirt, it looked full enough to drive but he wasn't far enough forward and ends up being beaten again"
"fired in straight and <b>smashing the pads</b>, Hazlewood bellows an appeal! Was it missing leg? Was it high...? Australia mull the review for a long time, but in the end decide not to... Looked very close, and the change of margins on ball-tracking would have made that worth going to DRS, for me"
touch short and tucked down into the off side
"good length, Cook gets forward on off stump"
in the channel outside off and Cook is happy to leave
"touch back of a length, tapped down into the covers"

"<b>three in a row!</b> Stoneman cashes in, wayward from Starc again and this is merrily belted off the pads"

"and he'll not be in a better mood after this, full on the pads once more and it isn't swinging, Stoneman guides it away for three more to the deep midwicket fence"
"pitched up and driven, mid-off comes across to prevent any more on the Stoneman ledger"
"in the channel, he moves across and is comfortable in leaving"
"good length, 139kph but not coming back in enough to make Stoneman play"

"dug in but this is a half-tracker, 141kph but sitting up nicely to be hammered on the pull through square leg for his first four"
"wide of the stumps, back of a length and fading away as Cook leaves"
"short again, Starc seems to be searching for the right length, a la England in the first innings, wide and ignored"
"slightly back of a length, 144kph and left alone in the channel"
pitched up and this nearly causes mischief as Cook closes the face a touch and gets a leading edge
"on the legs, Stoneman waits for it and guides a single behind square - thought about a second but Cook isn't the quickest between the sticks these days"
"hitting the middle of the pitch but again the ball doesn't get up that high and Cook rasps a pull to the midwicket fence, beyond the dive of Cummins"
"length on the stumps, calmly nudged to the on side"
"more runs, pitched up and taking the outside edge as Stoneman presses forward, softly played, perhaps opening the face a touch and it skitters past the slips to the boundary"
"full and tailing in, 142kph, driven but it comes off the inside half of the bat"
"full again, there's no swing at the moment and Stoneman just smacks through the line, beats mid-on and it trundles all the way for four more!"
"round the wicket, this stays very low as Cummins attacks the stumps, just gets his bat down on it"
"angled in straight, a good-length ball turned to the leg side"
"in the channel, that's where he caused issues in the first innings, 136kph and left alone"
"fuller, brings Cook forward, pushed to mid-on off the inside of the bat"
"slightly short, good carry through outside off, no need to play though"
Cook creeps across and taps down square on the off side
"flighted, comes across on off stump and blocks"
"pushed through, slightly wide and Stoneman steers it behind backward point for a couple"
defended on the front foot to cover
drops a touch short and Stoneman goes back to slash a cut but picks out the fielder
"uses the feet, gets to the pitch and flicks to midwicket"
"flatter, sliding in and defended on the stumps"
"ooh, that's a good line, over the wicket now and very close to off stump as Cook shoulders arms"

"on the pads, Cook likes it there and nurdles a single through square"
"flighted on the stumps, worked away to the leg side"
"ooh, a ripper! Beats the bat as Cook gropes forward outside off, <b>Paine then whips off the bails and think this might be another good'un</b>, so they'll go upstairs to the third umpire... No, not this time, Cook had his toe grounded, #Wobblyline regardless"
comes across and pats it away
"oh, skidding on as Cook sweeps, into the front pad... not given! And again Australia elect not to review, looked close but maybe sliding a touch leg side?"
yowee! Now this one spits off a length past the outside edge as Cook hangs back!
touch short to finish but Cook doesn't get any reward for a rasping cut shot that finds backward point

"136kph on a length, Stoneman comes across and defends this time"
"still a touch short, lets it fly through"
"dug in and rising over middle and off, defended towards point"
"angled in from round the wicket, impressive bounce but again he's able to shoulder arms"
"short, Stoneman takes the chance to free his arms, slapped past gully and it races away, in the air for a stretch but he struck it well and picks up a sixth boundary"
floated up by Lyon and defended on middle and off as Cook comes forward
"flatter, goes back and across and taps the ball down square"
"gives this some air, Cook works across the line, shouts of 'catch!' as it squirms past short leg, there's a moment's hesitation before he scurries away for a single and the safety of the non-striker's end"
tossed up and tapped back to the on side
"dip and drift, straightening on off, defended"

"into the stumps, good length and worked away through the leg side"
"going on with the arm, Stoneman defends in front of the stumps"

"ooh, so close! Outside off, a flat-footed waft, and under-edged past the off stump!"
defended on the back foot into the leg side

"solidly across the stumps, and pushed to the on-side"
"swept, and <B>doesn't carry to backward square leg!</B> Top-edged, but Hazlewood was slow in setting off, and the half-chance was missed"

"stretching down the line of the pitch, and blocked"
punched on the up to cover
forward and defended into the off side
"big appeal, and here comes a <B>review</B>. Beats the bat as it slides into the pad, but is it heading down leg? Looks less convincing than the Hazlewood appeal, but no! <strong>It's pinning leg stump!</strong> Smith has made the right call this time, and England's rock has been detonated!"
"leg stump, extra bounce into the thigh/midriff. With oodles of close catchers in attendance. Australia have a sniff now"

dangling the carrot outside off stump. Vince shoulders arms once more
"squared up on leg stump, and blocked"

forward and head over the ball to block
defended to cover
nice shape from Starc
"slides into the pad, still hints of swing with the slightly aging ball"

"on the pads, flicked to fine leg"
"solidly onto the front foot, and blocked back down the pitch"

rising delivery on a middle-and-off line. Root squeezes a push into the leg side

"short and that's a proper bouncer! Zeroing in from a tight line, but Vince hauled his neck out of harm's way, watching the ball all the way. Proper cricket!"
"there's the drive! But fair play to Vince, he picked his ball immaculately - a fraction over-pitched, swinging under his eyeline, and pumped with confidence through the covers. Well played"
"outside off, swinging away, through to the keeper"
probing away on a tight line to the right-hander
props forward to block to cover with a loud 'no!'
short and Root sways inside the line. Cramped for room by the left-arm line

"propping forward, immaculate length"
"no way through, as three men lurk round the bat"
cautiously pushed out to cover

"open-faced poke out to point, tough going out there now"
"on the back foot, pushed to cover"
comfortably driven out to deep cover. One ball of the session to go

flatter on the stumps and defended from the crease
"flighted, nudged away on leg stump"
"tossed up, slightly leg side again and Vince this time works one behind square for a single"
pushed through on the off stump and Root pinches one with a dab into the covers followed by a Scrappy Doo scramble
"short, rising outside off, Root fences and gets an edge, the ball flew wide of third slip and I think he just opened the face to keep it down, picks up four"
"full and straight, 141kph and whipped off the pads, couple more through midwicket, Root already ticking"
slightly full of a length and shaping in as Vince presses forward with a thou-shalt-not-pass forward defensive
"angled across on the full, 142kph but he gets across well and splats a drive through cover, well chased down in front of the rope by Warner but they pick up three more"
"length ball, veering away like a pink comet in the channel, no stroke"
Root moves across and flicks off his hips for another run to finish a productive over
"flighted, outside off and gripping a touch as Root attempts to drive and it clips the inside edge"
"skips forward to a full ball and prods one into the covers, rotating the strike again"
"flatter, defended on the back foot in front of off stump"
"tossed up, Vince drops deep in the crease and blocks again"
"quicker and straighter and Vince nearly steers it to leg slip, just gets a tickle and it runs fine for one"
"floated up full on leg stump, Root looks busy and clips one more through midwicket"
"pitched up, Root eases on to the front foot and plays a high-elbow drive, sends it straight to mid-off"
"slanted across, testing length, he's neither back nor forward but manages to prod it away"
"full on off, 141kph and drilled through the covers coming forward for two more, into the 20s now"
"dug in, the ball going away outside off but Root manages to control the pull and gets one to deep square"
"pitched up, encouraging the drive again and Vince accedes, sends it low to point"
"good line, 142kph an inch or two outside off, Vince judges it well and shoulders arms"
"spinning in, cries of 'catch!' as the ball hits the inside edge but falls to earth"
tries to come down but only manages to squirt the ball to mid-on
"ooh, excitement around the bat, don't think it carried to Warner at leg slip... Came off the thigh pad, too"
"plays back on leg stump and this time he does get some bat on it, an low edge squeezed past Warner as he went in the other direction"
Vince plays a solid-looking forward defensive
tossed up on the stumps and worked away
left alone in the channel as he moves across
"short and rising outside off, Root dabs it down and they sprint one, despite Warner swooping in from cover"
short and sliding across towards the slips as Vince weaves out of the way
"touch short, steered down towards gully with an angled bat"
"139kph on a length, comes across and plays the line well, defended"
"pitched up <b>and nicked off!</b> Vince is a goner... A familiar tale of briefly attractive (or should that be attractively brief) accumulation, before a loose stroke gives it away. This Australia attack don't need gifts, but they'll gladly accept them"
"tossed up and spinning in, worked down to the leg side"
on the stumps and tapped away
"comes across and keeps the ball out, to grunts of interest around the bat"
"floated up on middle and off, Root shows it a straight bat"
shuffles down and clips one off his toes through the midwicket area
"ooh, starts well to another lefty, fizzing through into the gloves as Malan pokes off the back foot. Survives"
"pinged for four! Cummins round the wicket, full outside off and crunched through the covers coming gracefully forwards, lovely stuff"
on the stumps and worked away
"pitched up and driven, Cummins grabs it in his left paw"
comes across and taps the ball away
"fullish, entices the drive again, Root isn't quite in line and an inside edge pops short into the leg side"
"oof, ripsnorting bumper to finish the over! Root does a marionette dance but manages to get out of the way"
pushed through outside off and Malan swats it away through point off the back foot
"sliding down the leg side, Paine appeals for a catch behind but Lyon isn't interested"
"leg-stump line, playing back and jabbed down short of the catching me"
tossed up and worked to leg
"drops short, Root latches on and swings a firm pull away to deep square leg, into the gap for four - and that's the England 100 up"
"plays no shot on the back foot, this doesn't spin as much, hits the pad - <b>and given out!</b> Root quickly <b>goes to the DRS</b>, though, as height looked a question... and sure enough, Hawk-Eye has it going over the stumps! Root gets the benefit of the review system this time, to the delight of a small-but-barmy section of the crowd!"
"in the channel outside off, Malan comes across"
"closer to the off stump, Malan lines this one up and defends"
"oh, past the bat, drawing him forward and then nipping it away, but nothing on it"
comes across to defend on off stump
"probing line, 142kph and Malan can't get forward to it, manages to jab the ball away square"
"fired in straight, this is testing stuff but Malan gets it away to the leg side"
"floated up on the stumps, Root comes across and taps it away"
"drags this down, leg side and paddled away for a single to deep backward square"
"straightening outside off, Malan judges it well and leaves"
"floated full, bit of drift in and worked to leg"
"gives it some air, spinning sharply away on off stump, again he goes back and leaves - well judged"
uses the feet and pushes into a gap in the covers for one
"short and rising in the corridor outside off stump, Malan leans back out of the way"
"banged in, too short and Malan can again move across to shoulder arms"
"Cummins is very disciplined in exploring this channel outside off, wide enough to leave though"
"speared in on off now, 144kph but blocked towards point"
gets into line on off and again defends down square
"fuller, 142kph and worked into the leg side - maiden over, Cummins keeping the pressure on"
"Root releases the shackles with a sweep, gets well forward and rolls the wrists, flashed to deep square leg"
"comes forward and looks for one into the covers, not there"
"tossed up on off, some turn but Root plays it softly and blocks"
on to the front foot and tapped down again
"floated up, Root gets a good stride and shows it the bat face"
pushed through a little flatter and Root drops on to off stump to defend
short in the channel and Malan is happy to let these go wherever he can
comes across and dabs the ball down square
"shortish, climbing through to Paine as he goes back and across and shoulders his piece"
"full and drifting on to the pads, Malan glances through backward square for a single to get off strike"
"defended into the ground, for a moment there's a danger of it rebounding towards the stumps and Root whirls bodily to guard his wicket"
"wow, this explodes off a length, straight through Root and Paine leaps for a magnificent catch to his left... Did Root get an inside edge on this? Australia think so and <b>review</b> but the evidence suggests it just flicked the top of the pad flap. They check for lbw as well but it's going well over off stump, so they <b>lose a review</b>, too"
"trundles through and puts it in the channel, no stroke"
"nip-backer, slamming into the pads, is Malan gone now? Dar shakes his head but again Australia decide to <b>review</b>, the height is the question once more - and <b>Hawk-Eye says it's missing!</b> Hit above the knee roll and bouncing over middle, despite Malan being quite far back"
comes across and this time gets bat on it in defence
"touch short, around off stump, patted down square"
"plugging away outside off, maybe setting up for another inswinger, left alone"
full on the pads and whipped away but midwicket is there to cut it off
"pitched up, good pace but Root chops down on it"
"good length, rising sharply outside off stump, left alone"
"targets the front pad, they got him out twice like this at the Gabba, Root brings his bat down on it"
moves across on off and leaves a good-length delivery
"around off stump, 141kph, defended with an open face towards backward point"
tight lines and again met with a front-foot block into the covers by Root
comes across to a length ball outside off
Hazlewood fires it in straight and Malan clamps down on it in defence
"sliding on to the pads, turned around the corner - maybe off the pad - and it runs fine to the boundary"
"pitched up and driven coming forwards, taken on the bounce at mid-off - causing half of the (possibly squiffy) crowd to cheer for a catch"
"good throat ball from Hazlewood, 138kph but Malan plays it well, swaying back out of the way"
full but straying on to the pads and it's clipped through square for one more
"pitched up and given a royal spanking through cover, lovely flowing drive from Malan, undoing his top button and allowing a bit of chest hair to show"
"yeow, smashed on the wrist! Dug in, nasty short ball, it's coming at Malan all the way and he can't get out of the line, ends up wearing the blow... Maybe the glove took the impact but he seems okay"
"back of a length, defended down from back on off stump"
"touch short and defended down off the inside edge, short leg sweeps up"
"angled across in the corridor, left alone"
"gah, that's a Street Fighter uppercut of a delivery! Flying at the face, 141kph and <i>somehow</i> Malan manages to get his gloves up and ride it! Well bowled and well played - just a shrug and a look, stoic stuff"
"length in the channel, 135kph and ignored"
"overpitched on middle and leg, easy pickings for most right-handers and it's pinged away through square leg for four"
"goes full and straight again but this is off line, 139kph but he just uses the pace on the ball and eases it to the rope"
"fullish length outside off, draws Root into the drive but he sends it to cover point"
touch short and defended on the back foot
banged in short and Root rocks on to his haunches
"oh, lovely bowling, that's zinged away as Malan begins to follow it, maybe just short enough to give him time to adjust"
"back of a length, 144kph as Cummins brings the heat, stabbed down towards backward point"
"dug in, Malan hops across and jams the ball into his body, deflects away safely in front of the wicket"
"length ball, sliding across in the channel outside off, no stroke"
"short ball, rising like steam, only 136kph but it was going away from Malan who elected at the last moment to pull out of a cross-batted swipe"
banged in short and he pre-emptively ducks the challenge this time
"round the wicket, looped onto a good length"
"not a whole lot of a shot going on here, but beats the keeper without flicking the pad. Effective"
"<B>dropped!</B> Perfect from Lyon, turn, bounce, thick outside edge, low to Smith's right at slip, but he can't cling on!"
fully into line to defend
"shorter, slapped urgently to point, but can't get the angle into the shot"
"blocked once more, as another probing but luckless over comes to an end"
"up on the toes, stabbed with a straight bat to point"
"full toss, swinging into the pads. A rare freebie for Malan who flicks through the leg side"
plugging away from over the wicket
"back of a length, Root hops across his stumps to defend"
"back cut, and that's a lovely strike to bring up Root's fifty - his second of the series, and potentially even more crucial than his first was threatening to be."
"on the back foot, defended down into the crease"
forward and defended into the off side
"outside off, turning sharply, Malan looks to glide through third man"
"cut hard, wide line. Aggressive intent"
"outside off, turning sharply, <strong>takes the inside-edge </strong>and pops up, just out of the reach of Bancroft, who made great ground at short leg but couldn't get there!"
squared up on the walk as Malan defends
"sharp intent from Malan, advancing to the pitch, and stealing a well-judged single to a deep-set mid-on. A few more singles would help England's - and Root's - cause"
opens the face and slashes handsomely through backward point!
"yikes, <B>inside-edge</B> and that eludes the top of the bails and the wicketkeeper! So close, so lucky! But they all count!"
"more solidly into line, on the back foot, punched to point"
"flicked out to deep midwicket, more runs to the cause"
glided out to backward point
"short, pulled, <i>nailed!</i> Bissects the two men at square leg perfectly, so perfectly in fact that they clash together at the ball zips through, like the heavily closing doors of the London Overground. Mind the gap!"
"sharp spin again, but Root works with the turn and nudges behind square"
"round the wicket, and that's a confident manipulation, down on one knee to sweep behind square. England are in a zone at the moment, and Australia are feeling the pinch for the first time this evening"
tucked to the leg side
"cracked hard off the back foot, but straight to backward point"
"good areas Garry. Leg-stump line, straightening on pitching and blocked"
"advancing to the pitch, but Lyon saw him coming and hauled back his length. Defended in the end but the intent is plain!"
solidly into line to defend
"round the wicket, angled into off stump, met with a solid straight bat"
"attacking line from round the wicket, Root tightens up in defence"
driven into the off side
defended into the gully. Root working with the angle
solid drive to mid-off. England are brawling into the sunset!
"back of a length, and that deflects in a completely weird direction through gully. Off the toe-end maybe? Not entirely in control..."
tapped to leg
worked back down the pitch
"arm-ball from Lyon, huge appeal but <B>Australia have no reviews!</B> That beat Malan on the back leg, but there's no recourse either way, and the Barmy Army are giving it plenty. It was <B>Umpire's Call!</B>"
pushed to cover
worked around the corner. Too many scenes!
sprayed down the leg-side
"up on the toes, poked down to third man"
right behind the line to defend
"very full length, in the blockhole, drilled back to the bowler"
"square driven, lots of intent, good fielding from Lyon at deep point"
"full length from over the wicket, patted back to the bowler"
"round the wicket, speared in a touch flatter, flicked to leg"
"solidly onto the front foot, and pushed to cover"
"back of a length, pulled with resolve out to deep midwicket"
"outside off, cut firmly to deep cover"
"hits the pads! But clearly pitched outside leg this time, as Root elects to leave well alone. Looked alarming, but no danger that time"
tickled fine
"good delivery, tight to off stump, angling in, targetting that perceived weakness of Root's to the lbw. But he's equal to it this time"
he's got it going! Cummins zips this one in late from outside off. Root gives himself a talking-to after clipping a touch flightily across the line...
"this is a tight over from Cummins, on and around off stump. Root needs to be watchful"
"crashed through the covers! In the air for a while, but eludes short cover - in fact, that was technically a <B>drop!</B> So close to the bat though"
"huge appeal, but there's an inside edge on that one! Cummins is making the ball talk and Root is living dangerously in this over"
driven hard into the covers again! Root survives a very probing over. And the requirement dips once more...
"on the pads, tucked behind square."
"outside off, a rare sighter, as Malan leaves alone with unusual lack of drama"
"tighter line, lifting off the deck, poked out to point"
"outside off, tapped to gully"
left alone outside off
opens the face to glide another nurdle to gully.
"outside off, that's a good delivery, zipping off the deck through to the keeper. Root flirts as it goes by, but avoids committing"
left alone with a raise of the bat and a hop across the crease for good measure
"through to the keeper once more. Root is drawing the sting in this over, as Cummins slips to a back-of-a-length approach"
"fierce from Cummins! Root has no choice but to ride the bounce and glove that into the leg side. He kept it down well, but a reminder of the enduring threat in these juicy conditions"
"round the wicket, and <B>bowled</B>! Tremendous from Cummins, holds its line to ping back the top of off, straight through Malan's defences, and look at the reaction! Australia are utterly pumped, they've prised an opening, any opening, and now there's a tough 20 minutes for a new batsman."
"<B>attempted yorker!</B> Welcome to the crease. Inswinging at 90mph, and tapped back whence it came. Don't breathe just yet!"
driven hard to cover
"full and attacking from Hazlewood, pushing Root back onto the stumps"
"banged in short, that's a tremendous delivery and Root sways out of the way"
tickled into the gap to rotate the strike
solidly into line on off stump
"good delivery, tailing into the stumps, and watchfully blocked on off stump"
"attacking the top of off, tapped out to cover"
"tight line and length, no way through"
"perfect from Cummins, wider on the crease, angled into the stumps, beats the edge of bat and stumps! So close!"
"solidly forward, blocked into the off side"
"<strong>yorker! </strong>Zeroes in on Woakes' toe, and somehow skews off the toe of the bat, and away past gully! That is incredibly good, and incredibly well played!"
"on the legs, clipped through the leg side, and England have given themselves a fighting chance!"
"fullish, around off stump and Woakes presses forward to defend calmly"
"zipping through, perfect line delivery, is that caught behind... <b>yes, given!</b> Woakes looks very doubtful and quickly <b>reviews</b>, it's close to the edge, no deviation... and no Hot Spot. But Snicko picks up a thin sound! The Barmy Army cheers quickly fall silent, as they realise this isn't going to be overturned. What a start for Australia, a wicket off the second ball!"
"over the wicket, good length around off, Moeen defends"
"ooh, that's teasing, in the channel and Moeen tries to withdraw his bat, deflects it down towards slip"
"back of a length, 139kph and Moeen covers the line, dabs down square"
"touch back of a length, good pace and carry but it's wide enough for Moeen to ignore"
"round the wicket, speared in on off stump and defended down into the track"
"some shape for the old ball here, 142kph and fading away from Root as he comes across and leaves"
"ooh, leading edge, lands short of point! Pitched up and holding its line, Root nearly getting into trouble trying to close the face"
"full and angled in, blocked towards mid-off"
"pitched up, 141kph a foot or two outside off, Root shoulders arms"
"pitched up, that's the line but Root watches it closely and bunts into the off side - another maiden"
"short outside off, 140kph and met with the face of the bat on the back foot"
"length, gets him driving, Moeen drives and thick-edges through the leg side for one... first run of the day and England are halfway there (and living on a prayer, yodel the Barmy Army in the stands)"
"touch short in the channel, rising sharply as Root gets his gear out of the way"
"shortish, 139kph as the ball begins to drift in a touch, punched down into the off side in circumspect fashion"
"length and holding its line, another beauty of a ball <b>and Root is gone!</b> Is that the game...? He was slightly late on it and the pink just scratched the cue end, Australia knew, Aleem Dar knew and Root must have done, too. Hazlewood has picked up this game and smashed it on a rock!"
"climbing through outside off, 148kph, serious heat on this as he throws up the hands"
"over the wicket to Moeen, in the channel and defended coming forwards"
"Moeen moves across and has a bit of a swish, clipped through the leg side for one"
"round the wicket, fullish and driven without timing coming forwards"
"boshed through the covers, first boundary of the afternoon! Committed stroke from YJB, leaning into a crisp drive"
"back of a length, 143kph and defended on the back foot around off stump"
"fired in on the stumps, he covers any reverse and pushes towards cover"
slanted across in the channel outside off stump and left well alone
"tighter to the stumps, back of a length and defended to the on side"
"excellent line, that is less charitable than your average bailiff, Moeen shoulders arms"
"short and prodded square from back in the crease, point is slightly deep but they won't chance it"
"short of a length and driven off the back foot, in the air for a bit but it bobbles safely to the fielder... Hazlewood throws his hands up and hides a smile"
"pitched up and encouraging the drive, struck to mid-off without much timing"
"pushed across Bairstow's bows from over the wicket, he leaves it be"
"probing away, Starc just keeping this tight for now, but there's always menace... left again"
"pitched up, 141kph and draws the drive, picks out cover"
"rearing off a length, crashes into the outside edge - <b>but falls short of the slips!</b> It scoots away for four, too"
"fired in straight, pushed back down the track"
"touch short, 136kph and swatted through the covers off the back foot, there's a sweeper out and they trot the single"
"nippy, this comes in at YJB, who chops down on it late"
"angled in towards the stums, worked to the leg side"
"length ball on middle stump, blocked back towards the bowler"
"yowch, that's a stinger on the hip for Bairstow, jagging in at him as he stabs hurriedly at the ball and is beaten on the inside"
"pitched up and crunched into the off side, extra cover snaffles it on the bounce"
"short outside off and Bairstow cuts behind square, they're kept to one by good work in the field by Lyon"
"good pace, back of a length outside off as YJB draws his bat inside the line"
comes across and leaves a slightly short ball in the channel
"ooh, that's a ripper, back of a length and seaming, swinging late as Bairstow is beaten on the back foot"
"fuller, presses on to the front foot and pushes to cover"
"short on the stumps, 139kph and Bairstow works it away to midwicket"
"comes across and turns a back-of-a-length ball into the leg side - good start from Cummins, maiden over, keeping the boot down"
"round the wicket, tossed up and straightening outside off, defended"
"pushed through, bit of grip as Moeen leans out and taps it away"
spinning off a length as Moeen goes back and blocks
"beaten past the outside edge, ragging through as Moeen tries to get forward, into the gloves (but this time the back foot is grounded behind the line as Paine removes the bails)"
"flighted, goes back and punches into the covers"
"tossed up, Moeen goes to sweep and is hit on the front pad... <b>Up goes the finger!</b> Australia are cock-a-hoop but Moeen delays their gratification by <b>reviewing</b>; this is going to be close but the margins are in Lyon's favour here. Sure enough, it's <i>just</i> in line (umpire's call) and <i>just</i> clipping the top of off (umpire's call) - and England are truly in the soup!"
short and turned off the body into the leg side
"short outside off, Bairstow has a slash and fails to connect"
"length on the pads, 140kph and whipped away to deep square leg"
"targeting the stumps, Overton thrusts his front leg forwards and blocks doughtily"
steered down into the off side
shortish and chopped down towards cover point from the crease
touch short and pulled away off the back foot for another single
"flighted, straightening on the stumps, Overton defends"
floated up on off stump and blocked coming forward again
goes back on the stumps and flicks a single through square leg to get off the mark
"pushed through outside off, Bairstow raps a cut to the man set back at cover"
gets this into a gap coming forwards and they get a couple
jaffa from Cummins! Pitched up at 141kph and then high-kicking past the outside edge as Overton reaches for it
gets across and presses forward to defend
pitched up and pushed along the carpet to mid-on
"digs in the bouncer, rapid but rising well over the crouching Overton"
"good length, 141kph on the speed gun and <b>edged for four!</b> The ball didn't quite carry, third slip was diving across but wasn't able to get a hand to it"
"banged in short and Overton misjudges the ball, wears it fully on the chest! He's down on his knees and looks in some pain here"
tucked off the pads to the leg side
leaning forward to defend
"head right over the ball, sniffing the leather"
pushed cautiously forward to defend once again
"sharp turn from outside off, but Overton rides the bounce well to dump the ball on the leg side"
over the wicket and pressed back down the pitch. Comfortably played
"on the back foot, squared up by extra lift"
rare width and firmly cracked to the point boundary's edge. Bairstow wanted two but slipped on turning. He's so quick that he'd have easily made it
"edged, but a controlled edge. Gully gathers on the bounce"
"edged and <B>dropped!</B> A low edge to third slip, it carried comfortably, but Bancroft snatched at it, it hit the heels of his hands and into the turf. He's actually at a sort of kamikaze silly slip, with a lid on as well, a good two metres closer than the rest of the cordon"
"banged in short, and Overton ducks"
"outside off, and through to the keeper with a loose poke"
tucked into the leg side. The 200 is up!
stretching forward to defend once more
"outside off, threatening to turn, met with a firm block on the front foot"
"turning from outside off, Overton hangs on the back foot to tuck it to leg"
"faster and flatter, again Overton favours the back foot as he defends with the spin"
stretching forward this time. Solid
a confident front-foot punch down to long-off. And good decisive running from Overton to turn back for two
"outside off, cracked firmly on the up and into the covers"
sharp through the air
defended high on the bat as Cummins' extra pace comes to the party
"edged again, but <B>bounces short of gully!</B> Cummins' extra pace lured Overton into a rather rash waft, attempting to steer the ball down, but it was a catching-practice sort of shot"
"firmly blocked, right behind the line"
"flipped off the hip, leg slip is lurking, as 'catch it!' is the cry. But no bat this time"
"leaning forward, firmly driven, meeting the flight well"
"chiselled into the leg side, another single chipped off the target"
"tweaked into the pads, turned to the leg side"
"tossed up, and flicked firmly down the ground, past Lyon's right hand and gathered at long-on"
"on the pads, worked square to chalk off another over. Only 70-odd left to see out the draw!"
"tapped to cover, an instant run, and Warner gathers quickly but the shy deflects off Overton's bat as he makes his ground!"
"banged in short, through to the keeper"
"width, and steered into the off side with a waft of willow"
outside off
"on the back foot, and defended back down the pitch"
"bouncer, and ducked"
"first ball inswinger, thuds into the pad, <strong>and Starc strikes!</strong> Wow, who needs a sighter? Just perfect line and curling length from over the wicket. Overton had no answer as he propped forward hopefully but merely made his pad into target practice. England's challenge is all but cooked!"
"beaten outside off stump, another outswinger but curls past the edge"
steps across the stumps to flick high and hopefully over the leg side
"full and threatening, with late in-dip. Bairstow keeps his head over the ball to guide a defensive push back down the pitch"
"driven down the ground, a rare and well snaffled boundary. Nothing wrong with the delivery, just solid connection on the front foot"
"banged in short, and left well alone"
"<strong>late swing from a full length,</strong> squeezed off the inside edge into the pads, and so nearly wriggles onto the stumps!"
"down the leg side, beats everything with late swing. A rare bonus to England's faltering cause!"
"on the legs, clipped sweetly into space at deep midwicket. Runs are flowing!"
"flicked off the legs, in the air for a while, but safe enough"
"a big booming outswinger. Bairstow has a mow, and well, why shouldn't he? But that misses everything"
"inswinger, good change from Hazlewood, but the ball is off-line. A rare feast of English runs in that over"
"such a full length, and Broad somehow gets the thinnest splinter of the corner of his toe-end to save his pads from a brutally comprehensive lbw!"
"on the pads again, slightly shorter this time. Broad hops onto the back foot, always anticipating the bouncer, and flicks the ball fine"
on the back foot once more. Blocked with a bunny hop down into the crease
"full, fast and straight, but Broad's inelegant hopping is just about keeping it out in this over. It's French cricket, essentially. A vertical bat, right back on the stumps, blocking for his life. His heel finished about 4cm from the stumps on that occasion as the ball squirted through gully"
"back and across once more. Hang in there, Broady"
"outside off, full length, a thin edge, a low catch to the keeper. A valiant but sorry stay from a batsman who is a shadow of his former self"
through to the keeper with good lift and hostility
"angled into the stumps, and blocked to the off side"
"tailing in from outside off, Bairstow block-drives back to the bowler"
"nibble off the seam, beats the outside edge. Well bowled again"
spanked through the covers. Hazlewood overpitches and Bairstow gives it some welly. Not dead yet!
"short and outside off, Bairstow swats inelegantly through the leg side. A bit top-edged, but the ball lands safely between the in- and out-fielders. That'll do"
"utterly <I>smoked</i> through the covers! Where was Jonny when England still had a hope? He's got to move up the order at Perth, surely"
"and that is the end of that! Tighter line, back of a length, cramped for room, and inside-edged into middle stump!"
