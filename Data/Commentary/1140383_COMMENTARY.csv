"launched! Samarawickrama plants the front foot and flays through the line, bit of a slice but it sails up and away over point for four!"
"back-to-back boundaries, Samarawickrama tucking in to Curran's medium-pace... Too full on off stump, 130kph/80mph stuff and it's drilled through the covers"

"angled in on the stumps, 130kph/80mph and flicked to midwicket, where it is stopped smartly"
"goes aerial and into a gap, flicked up and away over backward square leg, there's a man fine but he won't get round... Sri Lanka's 10th four of the day!"
"on the stumps, punched away"

"past the outside edge, teasing line from Wood and it just fades away as Dickwella pushes forward"
comes across and dabs it down into the covers

and now the conventional sweep to fine leg. Smart batting from these two
<strong>b-e-a-utiful!</strong> Down the track and flicks this majestically over cow corner. Sri Lanka setting a party atmosphere here in Colombo
outside off and beautifully timed down to Rashid at third man for an easy couple
nicely worked down to Rash once more. Nice rotation of the strike from these two
"this one stops in the pitch a bit, Sadeera waits on it and guides it to deep point"
"half an appeal, but Dickwella has inside-edged the pantaloons off of this. A bit of extra pace from Curran there"

nice full length from Rashid. Defended back solidly as a rock
"flight, and a bit of a skew out to deep cover. More fine running and Rashid isn't best pleased"
"full first up, and crisply crunched out to cover"
too much on the pads and that's tickled fine to fine leg. Wood cuts it off
"on the pads once more, and milked to square leg"
quick single! Stokes had the chance of a run out as Sadeera decides it's time to dance on the rodeo. <strong>He would have been out by a country mile!</strong>
"nice full ball. Defended solidly, and Dickwella's not in the mood in the slightest for a scampered single"
<strong>100 up</strong> as Plunkett strays down leg and it's a wide. The crowd are loving this opening display
more nice working out to fine leg
<strong>50 for Dickwella</strong>. A simple nudge to square leg. There looks a whole lot of relief in that celebration
"a full toss bunted to cover, and parried to long off"

short and that turns miles. Sadeera does well to munchkin that out to deep cover
"swept hard, but Moeen's the boundary rider at fine leg, so just a single"
"length delivery outside off, Sadeera pushes it out to deep cover"
Sadeera joins in the bat raising brigade. <strong>His maiden 50</strong>. What a moment for any cricketer. Sri lanka will be delighted with this start
"interesting! Dickwella's all smiles now, but not short he meant to plonk it there. Flicked to mid-wicket, but it looked more of a scoop. Had just enough to get it to deep mid-wicket"
"is this an exhibition match?! Another odd shot from Dickwella, let's call it unconventional, as he scoops this round the corner while fully standing to fine leg"
"more textbook this time, as it's guided out to cover as Plunkett offers width"
"plenty of wrists there from Sadeera, as he looks to crash this through the covers, but more of a skew to deep point"
"slower full toss, and that's a single to end another very, very productive over for the hosts"
waits for this and plays a late sweep to fine leg
""

worked out to cover. Plenty of singles being milked here

"tossed up full on off stump, pushed back to the bowler"
"googly now, Dickwella drops back and defends into the off side"
"another flighted wrong'un, spinning from leg to off as Dickwella closes the face, gets a low leading edge"
"what's occurring here then? The umpires are taking another look at this... The off bail has been removed, but England aren't entirely sure how. Let's see, turn for Moeen, beats the bat as Samarawickrama goes back and plays across the line, <b>clips the top of off stump</b> and then rebounds off Buttler's gloves into the timbers again! The first contact was enough to dislodge the bail, though, so that's going to be out, bowled!"

"spin, down the leg side as Dickwella reverse-sweeps, Buttler whips off the bails... Dickwella just about managed to keep his back foot behind the line, as he collapsed to his knees. Not sure why that wasn't a wide"

Chandimal gets down on one knee and paddles the ball from over the wicket to fine leg for one
"full on the stumps, poked into the midwicket area again, just a single"
"grip and bounce, hits the front pad and balloons up - Buttler takes the catch coming around in front of the stumps, and umpire Palliyaguruge gives it! However, Dickwella <b>reviews</b> straight away, knowing he didn't get any glove on the delivery; yes, sure enough, Paul Reiffel says this should be overturned, after checking for the lbw as well. Good review"
"another legbreak straightening on the pads, turned to leg"
"googly from Rashid, Dickwella whirls his hands through a reverse sweep... and fails to connect, but that foxes Buttler, who misses it entirely and the ball runs away to the rope!"

"on the stumps, tucked to leg"
"<b>dropped!</b> An ugly hoick from Chandimal, goes almost straight up - but <b>Curran makes a hash of it at wide mid-on</b> and the captain survives! Complete misjudgement, hit the fingers as he set himself, down into the turf"

driven back to the bowler and Moeen throws himself to his left to stop the ball
"tossed up and swept, gets it away for one through square leg"

"gottim, a misbegotten hack and <b>the top edge loops gently to backward point!</b> Dickwella goes, and that's the wicket England will have wanted. Falls five short of a hundred, and he has to trudge disconsolately off the field"

"tossed up straighter, again Chandimal plays with the spin through the leg side"

"short of a length, 136kph/85mph, punched back down the ground"
"full toss, Mendis latches on, <b>humps it well back over long-on!</b> Another attempted slower ball from Stokes, but it came out wrong and he knew it... Mendis did the biz, pounding it gleefully down the ground"
"shorter, zips through outside off as he throws the hands"
"banged in short, far too short, and a wild thrashing uppercut through the gap at backward point. Under pressure straightaway ..."
"curls onto the pads, nudged through midwicket, easy pickings"
"round the wicket, a looping slower ball, slammed violently into the covers and Root intercepts well with one hand, but seems to be <B>jogging off for treatment</b>. That's a bad sign ..."

"flogged on the up through the covers! Wide line from Stokes, and gathered in the deep by Wood, who gives away an extra run with his lack of urgency. Stokes is grumpy"
fenced into the off side
"forced onto the back foot, and <B>trouble here!</b> Mendis was ball-watching, the two batsmen had time to shake hands in the middle as they prevaricate, but England's shy is well wide of Buttler's gloves. Stokes once again loses his rag with his fielders"
"another single, another show of frustration from Stokes who beats short midwicket to the ball and flings it away in fury. The schoolkids in the ground emit a collective 'oooh!'"
"round the wicket, defended to the off side"
"<strong>swivel-pull over midwicket!</strong> This is old-school Sri Lanka galloping! Free-flowing, runs everywhere, too short from Curran and too little pace to trouble the batsman"
"fenced into the off side, back of a length"

"hoisted over the leg side, lots of intent from Sri Lanka, and with wickets in hand too"

boshed off the back foot with a bit of a calypso flourish
"wild and woolly, fleeing down the leg side. Buttler does well to intercept"

"pushed into the leg side, much fuller length"
"wide line, back of a length, slotted past point, who makes a pretty limp attempt at an interception. Denly on the rope, however, does a far better job"
"banged in short, high on the bat, <strong>Plunkett's extra bounce has forced the error at last!</strong> Stokes at deep midwicket steadies himself well and that's a vital moment against a rampant opponent"

"on the back foot, and defended to the leg side"
"wider line, squeezed to backward point where Moeen just about intercepts"

"slower-ball bouncer, hopped over a flailing cut shot"
"flicked uppishly, back down the track, wide of the bowler in his followthrough"
"back of a length, picks the legbreak and places it expertly into the gap at midwicket"
nudged to the leg side again to bring up the <b>300</b>
"<B>there's the breakthrough!</b> Absolutely as the captain ordered, Rashid tossed it up, it dipped invitingly on a good length, Shanaka climbed into a roundhouse mow over the leg side, Roy cleared his team-mates out of harm's way and swallowed the top edge at deep midwicket"

forward and defended into the covers

"worked to the leg side, more bite in this ball"
"googly, flat and fast, clipped back to the bowler"
"<B>tossed up and walloped!</b> Picks the legbreak, hits with the spin, and despite two men back on the rope, that clears them by a distance!"
"googly to finish, a good riposte, but Sri Lanka have had the better of the leggie today"
"guided to third man, opens the face"
"short and sharp, well directed as Perera ducks"
"<strong>short and that's hurried him!</strong> Climbs into the pull and top-edges into no-man's land at backward square. Close, but no cigar"
"wide yorker, that's a good nut with a split field. Chandimal can't make contact"
"tighter line for the slower ball, tapped to midwicket and that's fine running as Stokes' shy comes in from the deep"
"hits the tram-lines, and that's a very tight wide!"
"another swish, but this one is definitely out of Chandimal's reach"
"low full toss, crunched to backward point. Gets away with it"
"short and through to the keeper, another cunning slower ball hopping past an ambitious pull"
crashed on the up into the leg side
"another slower ball, well played from Curran, nailed his length, lured Chandimal into a biff through the leg side, but there was no pace to play with and Roy steadied himself well"
"flogged out to deep midwicket and <strong>Curran's on a hat-trick!</strong> Hard to quibble with the intent, but the timing of that wicket is terrible for Sri Lanka's prospects. Curran holds his nerve with the slower ball once again, tempting the cross-batted mow and getting his rewards from back of a length"
"forced onto the back foot by a fuller length. No hat-trick, but three dots in a row are every bit as welcome"
"rolls the fingers once more, outside off, nudged to third man. Two runs off that over. Tremendous work"

opens the face and glides another single to third man
"another slower ball, tapped to the leg side, <B>confusion from the batsmen</b> but Curran can't gather as they scamper back to their respective creases"

"back of a length, very tight line, dabbed with a cross-bat, down to third man"
"swung lustily into the leg side, but not quite there for the shot"
"<strong>flogged through the covers!</strong> A length ball, allowing Dananjaya time to retreat to leg and belt it through the gap. Valuable runs"
"on the pads, and whipped to deep backward square"
"swung into the leg side, a fumble at square leg to gift the 350"
"keeps it tight on the pads, worked to the on side. One over to go as Sri Lanka target something formidable"
"slower ball, bowled into the deck, and pulled uneasily to wide long-on"
"dancing at the crease, Curran bowls it very wide outside off stump, and gets away with it because of the batsman's manoeuvres. Curran hurts his finger as he retrieves the ball, but he's fine"
"open-faced drive out to deep cover, more cunning variations to disrupt the batsman's flow"
"slower ball again, hits it very high on the bat ... the fielders circle at deep midwicket, but the <b>ball plops over their heads for six!</b> Top tonking"
"short, wide, slapped, <B>dropped!</b> Moeen Ali at cover, and that's a shocker! Toe-ended, and should have been swallowed. England have been lax in the field"
"<B>and that's an appropriate way to finish a fine Sri Lanka performance!</b> Flogs the length ball high over long-on, and de Silva strides off with his first job very much done"
"ooh, that's a jaffa to begin with, straightening to zip past Roy's outside edge and then practically shave off stump on its way through to the keeper!"
"good length, steered square on the off side"
"tight lines, this is tapped down in front of point"
"too straight this time, though, and Roy gets England up and running with a business-like clip off his pads"
"fired in, big appeal for lbw as Roy is beaten playing across the line... High and a touch leg side?"
"cleaned him up! <b>Rajitha yorks Roy</b>, the ball smacking into off stump... The new ball just wobbled a touch, Roy brought his bat down on the wrong line, and it skipped past to clatter the timber"
"shortish outside off, chopped into the ground towards point"
"gottim, finds the outside edge, <b>superb diving catch at slip!</b> The Sri Lanka players are running around going crazy! Chameera now strikes with his second ball, excellent line and a touch of away movement, Hales is caught on the crease and then caught by first slip, Mendis leaping to his left"
"length ball, straight line and worked into the leg side"
"ANOTHER!! Buttler walks down... <b>and steers an outside edge to the keeper!</b> Chameera dragged his length down as the batsman advanced, again there was some nip away and Buttler walked into the trap, feathering through to Dickwella. This could get messy"
"length in the channel, threatens to come back but Stokes watches it through"
"pushed a little too far across this time, signalled wide"
"shortish, Stokes opens up the face and dabs the ball through backward point and get off the mark"

solidly forward
"<B>a flat-footed swat, toe-ended to short cover</b>. Moeen's battling effort is over, the DLS par score leaps from 190 to 223, and England's faint hopes are even fainter.

"fired into the pitch, steered towards point"
"flat, non-turning offbreak, Stokes slaps it away to the man on the ring again"

"pushed through, outside off and prodded away on the back foot"
"tossed up, Stokes goes downtown... <b>but picks out long-on!</b> England's last hope holes out and it really is a question of when rather than if. Just didn't get the connection he needed, Thisara steadied himself a few yards in from the rope and swallowed the catch"

"banged in short, Curran crouches underneath"
""
"full on the stumps, pushed down the ground and <b>there's a direct hit at the non-striker's end</b>, but Plunkett had his bat grounded"
"that's plumb, Plunkett is unable to pick the googly and here comes the rain too! Dananjaya bowled a short googly there and Plunkett stayed back in the crease to let the ball turn before he could cut it, but it turned in a fair bit and hit him right in front, on the right thigh. Plunkett reviews it, for some reason, and ball-tracking shows he has to go back. There was no way Plunkett would get the review going his way. But hello, it's raining heavily by the time the replays confirm that and <b>Aleem Dar is running off the field with his finger raised</b>"
