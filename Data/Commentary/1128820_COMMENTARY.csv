"a shortish and wide delivery to begin, punched to cover from the back foot"
"too straight this time, on middle and leg, nudged away to square leg. A couple of sighters for Sanga"
"flat and quick again, pushed away towards midwicket, who dives to his right, the ball bounces awkwardly and past for one"
"full, quick, straight, blocked by Shehzad"
"flat and quick, all deliveries with the same trajectory, 103 kph, nudged to midwicket"
a controlled flick. Sangakkara comes charging and chips the ball over midwicket for a couple. Tidy start for both sides
"goes wide of the crease, full and wide, punched away towards extra cover."
"a full delivery that swings back in after pitching, driven away towards mid-on"
"drags the pull. Not the best place to hit the ball but it's vacant so the shot was always on. It's short and wide, the cut would have been the easier shot, but no man at midwicket means Shehzad pulls through that region for four"
"good single, on a length around off, a good delivery, patted towards extra cover for a run"
"too short again, on a length, on middle and leg. Sangakkara pulls away through midwicket. Not the greatest timing so just two"
"comes charging and nails the lofted drive over cover for six. Fantastic timing. Knew the off side was open, the field was in, so he made use of that with the right shot selection."
"starts with a wide, on a length but well down leg"
"another dragged pull for four. It's short, angling away outside off. Shehzad controls the pull, plays it down, slow enough for Shehzad to nail his timing too. Easily done"
"five runs! Digs this in, too short, it lobs over Shehzad and the keeper, who can only get fingertips on it"
"good comeback, on a length around off, tapped towards point for a tight single"
"<strong>almost chops on!</strong> Back of a length outside off, the ball angles back. Sangakkara opens the bat face too much, offers just half the bat to the ball, it takes the inside edge towards short fine leg"
"back of a length on middle and leg, flicked away easily to deep square leg for one"
"another good single, back of a length outside off, 140 kph, just pushed away with soft hands towards cover for one"
"good end, a fullish delivery around off, inside-edged towards square leg for one"
"flat outside off, Shehzad goes back and punches to long-on from the back foot."
"slow offbreak on middle and leg, the ball skews off the outside half to point"
"Sangakkara gives himself plenty of room before the ball was delivered, allowing Narine time to follow him, inside-edged to short fine leg"
"slightly short, around middle, Shehzad pulls over midwicket for a couple. Not great timing again"
"the carrom ball, on leg, hits the pad after beating the inside edge"
"overpitched on middle and leg, clipped away to McCullum at midwicket for nothing"
"full and straight, hit back with the full face of the bat towards Mustafizur, who gets down and fields in his follow-through"
"that's poor keeping from Umar Akmal. Short and wide outside off, quick. Beats Sangakkara's cut and flies through Akmal's gloves. That's four byes, wasted runs for Lahore"
"a length delivery around off, tapped to point for a single. Another good run, they're doing this very nicely"
"127 kph, a full delivery on middle and leg, punched to mid-on, who runs to his left to cut it off"
"that's the shot Sangakkara missed earlier in the over. Short, wide, plenty of width. Sangakkara gets underneath the length and cuts the ball over backward point. Lands just inside, fantastic timing"
"and again, this time it was the offcutter, which threw off Sangakkara's timing. Short and wide, cut towards cover point on the bounce"
"full outside off, Shehzad tries to force it through cover but can't get any timing on his drive"
"short and wide, the carrom ball, moves away and outside the tramline"
"lovely hit. Tossed up, the carrom ball again. Shehzad just times the cover drive with exceptional timing through cover."
"drags the length back on the carrom ball, full outside off, pushed away towards cover"
"too straight, full, nudged to deep square leg"
"95 kph, Sangakkara gives himself plenty of room and cuts to point"
"shortish outside off, a half-batted forceful punch to long-off for one"
"on the pads, the legbreak, nudged into the gap at square leg for a single. Shehzad wanted two, it isn't available"
"flat and wide outside off, cut to point, flatter trajectory"
"overpitched on leg, nudged to deep midwicket"
"another legbreak, pitches outside off, the ball hits the inside edge and then onto the front pad"
"flat and straight, Sangakkara uses the width of the crease again, gives himself room and slashes a cut to the sweeper cover"
"too short but a tidy over from Yasir, short down leg, pulled to deep backward square leg"
"a slower delivery around off, pushed to long-off with the full face"
"<strong>shot of the day</strong>. That's just quality. Back of a length on middle and leg, Sangakkara wanted to pull but realised there was a deep square leg, so what he did to avoid that fielder was swivel into the shot, flick his wrists at point of contact and hit that discernibly finer, through backward square leg. That's a man with years of experience"
"too full, too straight, Sangakkara picks himself through midwicket. This is a step-up from U-19 cricket for sure."
"good riposte. The bouncer, with enough oomph to force Sangakkara to duck underneath"
"too straight again, nudged to midwicket for a tight single"
"a length delivery that angles away, beats the prod of Shehzad"
"lovely batting, makes room again, gets something full, in his arc, and he lofts the ball over cover with ease. All class"
"a low full toss, paddled fine to short fine leg, on the bounce to the fielder"
"93 kph, the wide legbreak, slashed to deep point"
"the slog sweep this time, flight around off. Sangakkara stays low and mis-times his slog sweep"
"flight around middle and leg, Shehzad comes down and inside-halves the ball into his body"
"short and wide outside off, carved away towards backward point, the fielder dives to his right to prevent the ball from going through"
"well played, too short, too wide, too flat. Easy pickings for Shehzad as he cuts into the gap between point and third man"
"slower through the air, outside off, dabbed towards point"
"charges down, gets to the pitch and nails his drive through long-on. Fierce power. Good use of the feet, execution"
"short around off, nudged into the gap at midwicket for a couple more. Soft hands, terrific batting"
"comes down again, but too early. Raza shortens the length on off, Shehzad waits for the ball before punching to long-off"
"quick around off, shovelled to deep midwicket, into the gap again for a couple more"
"back of a length down leg, Shehzad is hurried through his pull. A big appeal from Akmal as he collects, forcing McCullum to go to the third umpire, a review. A loud noise as the ball passes bat, confirmed by UltraEdge, <strong>so a good review from Lahore</strong>. That is one way to go, a strangle down the leg side."
"a nice slower delivery, straight, driven to mid-off"
"125 kph, another quick offbreak, on middle, hit back to the bowler"
"and again, 130 kph, a quick cutter on on off, all Maqsood can do is hit it back"
"this is the quicker one, but drifts down leg. All Maqssod needs is a bit of bat, and he finds it. A thick inside edge down to the fine leg boundary"
"a short one, but drifts down leg. Not called a wide by the umpire."
"lots of flight, pitches on leg? Or just outside leg? Sangakkara misses a sweep, and is struck on the pad. It had to be pitching in line and not spinning down leg."
driven to long-on with a straighter bat
"Maqsood's stuttering innings ends early. He did not read that, it was the quick googly. Maqsood ran down to the pitch, but the wily Yasir shortens the length, creates a big gap between bat and pad. The ball finds that gap and then has a free path to hit off stump."
"some flight outside off, sliced to point. A throw to the bowler's end results in an overthrow. Another throw from long-on hits the stumps at the bowler's end"
"quicker through the air, around off, hit back to the bowler"
"flight outside off, driven to long-off for a single"
"short and wide from Narine, slashed down to short third man"
"another carrom ball, outside off, cut down to short third man, who runs around to his left to stop the ball"
"full and wide outside off, keeps a touch low, badly-timed into the off side"
"a slow offbreak, Sangakkara is through his sweep too early, hits the pad as he misses the sweep."
another offbreak around off is stroked neatly to deep cover for one
"full outside off, nudged to deep square leg"
"lovely shot from Malik. Sees flight, he comes rushing down and drills a lofted drive with immense power over cover. A smile from Yasir, knew he was done in there"
"slower through the air outside off, carved with the open face through point for a couple. Two very experienced players showing it all"
"full on middle and leg, hit back to the bowler"
"he comes down again, but gets too close to the ball, preventing from from getting underneath the ball, skews the ball to long-on for one"
"full on middle and leg, pushed down to long-on"
"flight outside off, sliced off the open half to deep point for a single."
"full and wide to start from Yamin, a languid drive to the sweeper cover for a run"
"cracked for four! Back of a length down leg, Sangakkara backs away, gets a ball in his hitting arc and nails the pull over midwicket"
"excellently bowled, Sangakkara gives himself room again, the bowler follows him again, but this is very full, it goes in between Sangakkara's legs"
"knows exactly what's coming. All his experience in play. Knows it's going to be full, so he backs away, then shuffles back into line and paddle-scoops the ball over fine leg"
"more poor keeping from Akmal, he's having a shocker. A slower ball down leg, Sangakkara misses a scoop, the ball bounces in front of Akmal and goes past. Should have been five wides, not four."
"he does it again, using the pace, another slower ball down leg, Sangakkara gets inside the line and helps the ball over short fine leg. Too easy"
"quick, flat outside off, chopped down to short third man"
"a short flat delivery around off, pulled away to deep midwicket for a single"
"flat again, quick down leg, helped along down to deep backward square leg"
"slow down leg, slog-swept away to deep square leg for a single"
"Malik comes down, doesn't get to the pitch but goes through with the shot anyway. Gets enough power and elevation behind that for it to clear long-off with ease"
"Malik backs away, the bowler follows him, punched to deep cover for one"
"a slower cutter outside off, Malik opens the bat face and cuts down to third man"
"in the slot and heaved away for six. Sanga on fire. In the arc, down leg, Sangakkara clears his front leg and T20s it away over midwicket"
"a slower ball around middle and leg, pulled to long-on for a single"
"Akmal recovers in time, or does he? A wide yorker outside off creeps underneath Malik's bat. Akmal fumbles, and Sangakkara is aware of the opportunity to steal a bye. <strong>A direct hit at the batsman's end</strong>, but Sangakkara makes his ground, juuust"
"a short delivery this time, the change in length has worked. A bouncer down leg hurries Sangakkara through his pull, all he manages is a pull into the hands of long-on. Could not get any timing behind that"
"a slower delivery outside off, caressed to deep cover for a run"
"into the gap and four, short and wide, Malik watches the ball onto the bat and then opens the bat face to carve the ball through point"
"the change in length and pace does no favours for Narine. It's tossed up on leg, Malik gets underneath the length, stays low and slog-sweeps the ball without much hassle over midwicket"
"flat outside off, under-edged towards short third man. The fielder runs in and hurls in a direct hit at the batsman's end to find Pollard short. Yasir Shah the fielder. If you can find big-stride Pollard short, there was no run there. Yasir the fielder. 0 off 0 for Pollard."
"a slower delivery outside off, carved to backward point for a run"
"another direct hit would have had another wicket. Flat and wide outside off, hit towards short third man for a single. If Yasir had hit the stumps, Bravo was gone"
"in the slot and outtta here. Bravo wins the Trinidad and Tobago battle. Flat down leg, Bravo gets underneath the length and slogs the ball away over square leg for six."
"a slower ball down leg, punched to long-on for one"
"a bouncer on leg, hurries Bravo is late on his pull"
"a full, wide delivery outside off. Bravo, looking to go over mid-off, can't quite get underneath that. Powers it to mid-off"
"an offcutter on middle, Bravo hits it straight, slices it more than hits, with bad timing, a couple"
"shortish and wide outside off, Bravo misses a cut. A vital dot"
"another dot, good finish from Mustafizur. A low full toss down leg, swerves in the air, beats the bat and the leg stump"
"a nice slower ball to start, Malik is through his swing too early, times it so badly it doesn't clear the 30-yard circle. Two, as long-on runs in"
"wow, that's awesome batting. The wide yorker again, Malik opens the bat face and carves the ball past point for four. All quality, all class"
"a slower delivery on leg, swung away into no-man's land again. No man behind square on the leg side, the ball plonks near the boundary"
"a good yorker down leg, clipped to square leg. Not much Malik could do about that one"
"run-out is Malik on 48! Another good bouncer down leg, Bravo can't make contact, so Malik calls him through. Akmal picks up cleanly and under-arms the ball to the stumps at the batsman's end with Malik nowhere close."
"a good yorker to finish from Afridi, nudged away to deep square leg to finish the innings."
"and Lahore are on the board, thanks to a wide down the leg side"
"back of a length, the line cramping Zaman for room. He works it through square leg"
forces him back with his length and Narine can only punch it towards cover
"pitches it up, gives the left-hander room and Narine gleefully smacks it through extra cover. Stand and deliver"
"mistimes a push to mid-off as Tanvir pitches it in the batsman's half again, where Narine likes it"
"launches it down the ground and the ball plops in front of Junaid Khan, who has come running to his right from long-on"
slower ball - good idea - but it slips down the leg side. Sanga though insists that it had tickled the pad
"back of a length and outside off, prime and ready to be cut over the top, but Narine misses out"
"tap and run to the right of the bowler, and it takes a while for a seven-footer to get down on his followthrough"
"backs away to swat the short ball into the leg side, but it comes onto him too quickly and as a result he skews it to cover"
guides the short and wide delivery to deep third man
"looks for the yorker, aiming for leg stump, and even with Narine making loads of room, he has absolutely no leverage to work with"
<b>inside edge</b> as he goes to pull a banged-in delivery on leg stump. The ball goes down to the keeper
"<b>dropped</b> as Irfan sticks out his left hand and the ball bounces off towards mid-on. Just a bit too far away for it to stick. Tough. Narine's purpose is apparent. He is there just to throw his bat, and he's doing it with great abandon every time the ball is pitched up"
good change of pace and Narine is fooled as he looks for a big hit down the ground again
"bouncer, at top pace, Narine tries to pull and is comfortably beaten"
"gets it past cover's left, but mid-off gathers it well enough. Narine's cut shot to a short ball yields fewer runs than he would have hoped"
picks up the slower ball and deposits it beyond the square leg boundary. Easy put away with the length being short and the line on leg stump
good timing again on the pull from Narine. Seems to be getting used to these slower balls from Tanvir
"full and tailing into leg stump, Narine looks to flick it away, but mis-hits to square leg"
"carves it over point. Good plans from Narine, backing away from the tall fast bowler and exploiting his ability to get extra bounce"
"full toss, outside off, slaps it to the point boundary. Narine in boss mode"
backs away again and even though the ball is angled into his body he is able to scythe it over point
the ball zips through between the bat and pad as Irfan goes for the yorker on leg stump
taken at third man. He sees a short and wide delivery and he takes it on - as his job as pinch hitter demands he does - but the extra bounce helps the ball secure a top edge
"full and outside off, spears it to cover point"
"goes for the yorker on leg stump, Zaman digs it out"
speeds down the track - he's off balance when he makes contact with the ball outside off - and yet the ball disappears over long-on. India felt the brunt of many of these shots in the Champions Trophy final. Outstanding hit!
walks across.... then jumps back... and finally ends up cutting a back of a length ball off his stumps to point
uses the angle across the right-hander and beats him on the cut shot
"hares down the pitch for a wild swat at the bowll and is emphatically beaten. Only Sanga appeals for a caught behind. And after he says 'I thought I heard something' Malik seems to want a review. Oh wait, he's changed his mind."
"back of a length on off stump, McCullum can only block it"
"shortish on middle and leg, clips it through midwicket"
"beautiful work at third man again! Tanvir is down there, backpedalling to the rope, standing virtually on top of it as he takes the coolest catch to dismiss the opposition captain. Baz does well, trying to ramp a short ball on middle over the boundary. Just doesn't get enough on it"
blocks a good length ball into the covers
"full and outside off, tries to smash it down the ground and ends up missing completely"
"stands tall to cut the short and wide delivery, but it goes straight to point"
"back of a length on off stump, defends and that's the end of the Powerplay"
lifts the full delivery from around the wicket out to the right of long-off.
"pushes it into the pads, Zaman nudges it behind square leg"
tucks the length ball through square leg
"hurtles down the pitch and mauls a length ball over long-on. Vicious power, which he sets up by making room as well"
"over the wicket now and a much slower delivery, pitching on leg stump, and turning sharply to induce a top edge as Zaman sweeps"
goes for the cut with the ball angling across him but is beaten
"lovely placement, waiting that little bit extra to cut the shortish delivery outside off between third man and point inside the circle"
"googly, pitching way outside off, and spinning further. Zaman tries his utmost to catch up with it. But no."
"tosses it up on off stump, Zaman guides it to short third man"
goes straight up and lands well short of Tanvir running in off the midwicket boundary. Akmal hares down the pitch. He doesn't get close enough to the ball. He has no choice but to slog. And he's lucky to survive
"how is that even possible?!? For the longest time, he is trying to make room outside leg. Tahir spots that and tosses the ball full and wide outside off. Zaman is in the middle of losing balance but he throws his arms at the ball and times it with other-worldly power for a six over cover point"
drives to long-off
jumps down the pitch and drills his on-drive straight at Zaman
tries to pull a short ball that comes onto him a little quicker than he expects. Mis-hit through midwicket
swats a short ball on middle out to deep square leg. Fearsome hit
"that's gone straight up, Tanvir running back from mid-off puts in a big effort, but he really has no chance. Good on him to stop the boundary though. Akmal isn't caring about looking pretty. That down the track heave was straight out of gully cricket"
launches it over deep square leg. He certainly loves the opportunity to get under these short balls. Uninhibited pull shot again.
length this time - and it offers width for the hard-hitting batsman to use eyes-closed. Slog sweeps the thing out to deep midwicket
pulls the slower short ball away to deep square leg
tosses it up well wide of off stump and Akmal's eagerness to feel bat on ball ruins the chance for his team to get a wide
works it through to where mid-on might have been. But the man is positioned on the boundary so Tahir has to do his own fielding.
"slog sweep into the crowd! Second-tier beware! This is the googly, but it pitches in the slog, spins away, meaning it only gives him extra room to hit across the line"
pushes to long-off. Zaman has faced only one dot in his 18-ball innings so far
googly goes awfully wrong - pitches in Tahir's own half of the pitch and Akmal pummels it straight of midwicket. That's the fifty partnership
knocks it down to the right of the bowler
back of a length with no pace on it. Zaman reaches out and cuts to point
shapes to scoop the ball and Pollard one-ups that by bowling full and wide outside off
smacks a slower short ball to extra cover
slips down leg as he looks to go full and cramp Akmal
mows the length ball on off stump out to deep midwicket
full toss - and odd as it seems - considering he has timed the ball from the worst positions at the crease - he mis-hits it to mid-off.
"squeezes it out to fine leg, takes a single, and then the overthrow gives him a two more. Tahir the culprit"
comes down the pitch and slogs blindly. Irfan beats him with both pace and bounce
top-edges the slog and it sails away to the third man boundary
powers a back of a length ball out to deep midwicket
"goes short, cramps Zaman, who does well to get out of the way. That ball was coming for his head"
"'catch it', is the cry as Zaman walks across and sets up for the scoop. He doesn't get anywhere near enough bat on it, and is lucky the ball falls short of Sanga, diving to his right"
"back of a length and outside off, beats Akmal's late cut"
"slower ball outside off, Zaman slices it to deep point"
"tries to force the short and wide delivery to the point boundary, but with Pollard putting so little pace on the ball, it isn't easy"
"taken at long-on! There is plenty of power in the shot, but he picks the fielder out to perfection. Length ball, in the slot to disappear out of the ground. Just that it doesn't and Pollard is plenty pleased with that. Pulls out an imaginary notebook, scribbles something on it, tears the piece of paper and throws it away"
sends it out to sweeper cover
"superb strike! He nails the cut, and to do that against a slower ball, to put so much power on the shot that the fielder in the deep is made redundant, is special"
"back of a length and outside off, chops it to point"
"back of a length on off stump, he works it through midwicket"
"low full toss outside off, bunts it down to long-off"
opens the face and runs the back of a length delivery to short third man
"full on middle and leg, he nudges it behind square leg"
"full on middle and leg, turns it to the right of long-on for a couple"
"short and wide outside off, smashes it to point"
"full and outside off, Akhtar smears it over extra cover. He has to reach so far away from his body to make connection. But that doesn't pull down his power"
that's epic! He shimmies inside the line of the back of a length ball and simply flicks it away over long leg. Gives the West Indian bowler a good look at the one-legged whip on the leg side
"shortish and outside off, chops it to point"
"smacks it to the right of deep point! Akhtar is taking this game away from Multan, and in fine style too. Even Pollar's slower balls aren't helping him escape this hiding"
"yorker outside off, Akhtar spears it to the sweeper cover"
"that's an outrageous catch by Shehzad! And Pollard runs right up to him and lifts him clean off his feet! The bowler does his bit to throw the set batsman off guard, pitching the ball up, but taking all the pace off and slanting it wide as well. That means if Zaman goes after it, he will more than likely mistime the shot. And he does. It skews off the outside edge. it seems like it will drop short of Shehzad racing up from the sweeper cover boundary, but he puts in a last-gasp dive and comes up with the ball clutched in both hands. Lets out a primal roar as well, throwing his head back. This is a game-changing moment"
"caaatch, they cry, but it goes just past cover's outstretched hand. Tanvir is the man there, a little slow to move, and Delport, having been fooled by the googly, looking to play it through midwicket and ending up popping out a leading edge, survives"
"<b>flipper</b>! Tahir is a big gun in T20s and he shows it, taking out the big-hitting Akhtar with simply a straight ball aimed at the top of off stump. The batsman sets up to cut, believing it to be a legbreak that would spin away from him. By the time he wises up, his stumps are gone"
"low full toss on off stump, Yamin flicks it through midwicket"
"quicker, flatter on middle and leg. He flicks it through midwicket"
short and wide - but the extra pace on the ball helps defeat the cut shot
plays back to a very very full ball. Also plays right across the line. And all that means his stumps are sitting ducks. All Tahir has to do is line it up just right
"goes full, goes straight, and Delport drills it to long-off"
goes for the bouncer and Yasir fends it away safely enough
"top-edge, settles safely in the keeper's hands, and Lahore are collapsing badly. Good thinking from Junaid to go for the bouncer again. It ends up too quick, and it rises too high for the lower-order batsman to deal with"
that's the kindest treatment given to a leg-stump full toss in the history of cricket. Addresses it to deep midwicket where Shehzad doesn't even have to move.
<b>hat-trick! Junaid Khan has a hat-trick!</b> The crowd goes wild. The great Wasim Akram is on his feet. And the batsman is walking off having pulled a short ball straight to short midwicket
"full and outside off, he pokes and misses"
"slogs wildly, gets beaten by the googly, Sanga knocks over the stumps. Is the batsman safe? Yep. There's just enough of Shaheen Afridi's boot behind the line"
slaps it straight to cover and Multan win their second game in a row!
