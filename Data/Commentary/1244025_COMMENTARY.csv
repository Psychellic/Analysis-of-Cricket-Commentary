"length, and he works this towards short midwicket"
"down the wicket, and a <strong>stumping opportunity missed</strong>! Nearly yorks himself by going down the pitch, and it squeezes down between bat, leg stump, and the left leg of the keeper.

"length, presses forward to defend. Given leg before as it beats the bat. <strong>They go for the review</strong>. I think the impact might have been just marginal. Nayeem was pushing forward to defend, but got beaten by just a bit of extra spin on it. It was also hurried in a touch quicker. Cornwall was absolutely convinced, though, judging by the volume of his appeal. There's no bat on this, and impact is inline. But the ball is bouncing over the stumps!"
defends with a little forward press

"length, driven to cover"
"<strong>Nayeem pays for playing back to the spinner!</strong> Bonnger gets one to pitch around leg stump, and Nayeem plays back to it. Inside edge, and then perhaps just a bit of his pad, and then through to the stumps. He watches on in disbelief, before dragging himself away. Bonner celebrates his first Test wicket. Importantly, West Indies put an end to a partnership that began as a mild irritation, but has probably now shut one half of the door on them!"
"fullish, down leg stump, and left alone"
"length, and he plays it off the back foot"

defends with an open face towards point
"length, and he goes back and cuts this away past backward point. <strong>He does love his cuts and late cuts</strong>, doesn't he?"

"length, stretches forward to defend one around off"
"paddle swept away, and immediately <strong>revels in his achievement</strong>! Goes back for the second, and then takes his helmet off to acknowledge the cheers of his teammates. Gets down on his knees to perform the sajdah and kiss the pitch. Sensational stuff from Mehidy. He has ridden his luck, on occasion, but this has been superb counterpunching from no.8"

"length, worked away with the turn towards short mid-wicket"
"down the wicket, and <strong>holed out to long on</strong>! Cornwall tosses this up around off and middle, and he has a big swipe at it, after stepping down the track. Probably wants to go straight, but it skews off the inner part of the bat, and carries all the way to the man just by the rope. Healthy cheers as he walks off"

<b>a big appeal for lbw</b> and Bangladesh go for the review. Was a length ball outside off that kept coming in with the angle. Campbell looked to flick it around his front pad and misses. Not bat involved and it would have gone on to hit middle and leg. West Indies lose their first wicket
"Another big appeal for lbw and given. A length ball angling in once again, Moseley plants his front foot forward and is cramped as he looks to push at it. West Indies go for the review and it shows there's <b>a big inside edge</b>"

fuller delivery at the stumps and Moseley once again has got himself in a tangle as the ball comes in with the angle. <b>An appeal for lbw but denied</b>. Mominul is checking with the wicketkeeper and decides to go for the review. There is a bit of a murmur on the UltraEdge as the ball passes the bat and that's enough for the third umpire to make a decision. Bangladesh lose a review
<b>a searing yorker and this time it's been given lbw</b>. The batsman goes for the review straightaway. Moseley was late to get his bat down and the ball hit the shoe almost on the full and it would have crashed into middle and leg. Mustafizur gets his second on a pitch that had hardly offered anything for the seamers till tea

"<strong>gobbled up at slip!</strong> What a start this is for Bangladesh. Taijul puts it on a sixpence around off, and Bonner stretches forward to defend. It spins enough to catch the outside edge and flies to the left of Najmul Hossain Shanto at first slip, who holds on. Taijul lets out a whoop!"
