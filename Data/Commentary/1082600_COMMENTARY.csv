"touch short outside off, Dhawan cuts straight to point"
gets the inner half of the bat as he shapes to drive
"shortens his length as Dhawan advances, flatter in trajectory and so he bunts it back down the pitch"
steps out and then defends with the bat close to the pad
"backs away and cuts again, Hardik moves swiftly to his right to cut that  off. Saved three runs. Excellent anticipation"
"thumped to the off side, Buttler misfields at cover to concede a run. That hit his left thigh."
"angles a length ball across, Warner punches to cover as they scamper a quick single"
"scoring opportunity missed. Waist-high full toss begging to be swung away into the leg side field, Dhawan punches it straight to cover point"
"yorker-length outside off, this tailed in just a wee bit, squeezed to the off side"
"slips in a yorker-length delivery on middle and leg again, turned wide of midwicket"
"back of length outside off, uses the pace to punch straight to backward point"
"hit high on the thigh pad as he's hurried into an attempted whip to square leg, they take a run off the deflection"
"too short, Warner rocks back and lofts this over cover. Slow turn to so he could adjust"
"and again off the backfoot. Too short, Warner uses the depth of the crease to loft this inside-out. Almost carried all the way"
"drifting in from wide of the crease, length much fuller as well, Warner defends from the crease to cover"
sweeps and misses. Looked to fetch this from way outside off and played too early. The backfoot was briefly outside the crease but he managed to drag is back in just as the bails came off.
"rocks back and cuts but straight to Pandya. Lucky to get away this time, is Bhajji"
"slider that skids back in and straightens, Warner defends. This one kept a touch low as well"
flayed on the up but straight to Krunal at point. Hint of width on that this time
"this is a crunching cover drive. Just an extension of his forward defence, raced away past cover. Buttler pulls it back in"
"looks to slap one across the line but beaten by the length and width. Bumrah is taking the ball away, and it's always tough to play against the line with that angle"
"too full for him to attempt a pull, through him. Parthiv dives to his left to effect a super stop."
whips a length ball to deep backward square leg
"steps out and smashes the length ball back down the pitch, Bumrah puts his leg out to stop it on his followthrough"
"finding the gap with precision. Touch short, this is a off-cutter as well which Warner waits on before directing it between short third man and point. Beautiful timing."
"slower and fuller outside off, reaches out to toe-end the drive to cover"
drifting into the pads and he's tucked that cutely into the fine leg boundary. Too easy
"slower delivery on middle and leg, tucks it straight to short fine leg"
"shot out of frustration. Slower and fuller on middle, he thumps it on the bounce to mid-on"
"looks to drill that  over cover, the bat face turned in his hand as he made contact with the full delivery, straight to mid-off"
slogged across the line to deep square. Didn't get it anywhere near the middle
"right into the blockhole, gets this to dip in as well, Dhawan squeezes it wide of cover as they scamper a run"
"hurried into the defence of that away-going length ball that holds its line to cramp him for room, bunted to Bumrah"
"too quick is Warner. Chanced a single by dabbing it to point, the throw from Rana at the bowler's end wasn't far from the stumps but he'd comfortably made it by then"
"looked to heave across the line, changed his shot to turn it to the leg side gently in the end"
"beautiful timing. Hint of width from Bumrah, Warner waits and then opens the bat face late to glide this between point and third man"
"looks to go over long-on but toe-ends it, on the bounce to the boundary rider"
"into the pads and he's whipped it into the deep square leg boundary. Pressure was building on him, this should give him some breathing space although a lot more needs to be done. This wasn't where he wanted to hit it but he'll take it"
"better length, much fuller outside off, left alone"
"that's a Dhawan special. Length ball on middle, and he brings those powerful wrists to the fore, whipped over midwicket and it sails here. Still bat meeting the ball,  bottom hand generating the power, all very good this time"
"too full and just outside off, looks to squeeze this behind point but misses"
that's Gangulyesque from Dhawan. Sashays down the pitch and flat-bats the length ball into the cover boundary
"bangs a length ball on middle and leg, tucked to short fine. Got it on the top part of the bat"
guides an away-going length delivery to point
"<b> dropped! </b> he's lost control of the ball on the dive but the ball bounced up and got stuck into his left elbow as he completed the dive. But there is some doubt here.This was struck really firmly by Dhawan, Krunal did well to move initially to his left and then dish in the dive. As he completed the catch, you couldn't quite see the ball. He thinks he's taken it but there was one point where he was completely covering the ball, which means the cameras couldn't quick pick if the ball hit the turf at that instant. No conclusive evidence."
swing and a miss. Looked to slap this over cover
"gets on top of the bounce and bunts it to Rana, who dives to his left to pull off a one-handed stop at point"
"floats a length ball on middle, this one nips back in a touch, Dhawan is half-forward as he defends"
backs away and cracks the length ball straight to point
"too much width outside off, this one's hit hard to Harbhajan at deep point"
"slower and fuller outside off, he gently dabs it towards point for a quick single"
looked to back away and go over cover but played too early. McClenaghan did well to roll his fingers over the ball. Change in pace helped the bowler there
"boundary after seven deliveries for Warner, and a welcome one at that. Too full on the pads, squeezed to deep backward square where Rana does well to hare around the ropes. Having done all the hard work, he dives full length but over the ball. Rohit isn't pleased"
"cracking shot. Too much width, much slower in pace. Sitting up nicely for Warner who gives it a proper whack into the point boundary"
how lucky is Dhawan? Looks to walk across to flick it behind square but the ball deflects off a thick inside edge as he swings. Parthiv dives to his left but can't get a glove
"looks to upper cut it over third man, but is done in by the bounce"
punches a length ball wide of cover for a quick single
"stunning! Third man missing, and so Warner backs away to make room and then uses the bowler's pace to glide that into the square third man boundary. Did well to get under it and let his bat do the rest"
"looks to whip it square, ball deflects off the pad to short fine leg"
"fires this full and wide, flirting with the wide line, umpire thinks it's just wide of that mark. Dhawan tried his best to reach it but couldn't"
"looks to swing this across the line but can't get under that full delivery angling away, squeezed back to Hardik"
"ridiculous. Boom! Warner changes his grip quickly, positions himself as a right-hander and then powerfully muscles the sweep over the third man boundary. Sensational stuff. Harbhajan fired it in so there was pace for him to work with too"
"slows this down considerably, Warner looks to play a reverse-sweep but ends up getting into an awkward tangle, looks to pull but top-edges. Parthiv runs swiftly to his left till about short point or so and then dives full length to complete a stunner. Harbhajan is pumped. Exploring his limits there, was Parthiv. Will be tough to top that tonight"
"drifting into middle and leg, punched to deep midwicket"
"looks to turn this to midwicket, gets a leading edge, falls short of cover"
steps out and bunts an indrifter to long-on
"fires a length ball into middle and leg, tucked to deep square"
"floats this full outside off, Dhawan jams his bat down to squeeze it to deep cover"
"angles a full ball on off stump, driven firmly to cover"
"flayed into the point boundary. Too short, enough width and 'Hurricane' Hooda gleefully accepts that. Brave move to send him in at No. 3"
"floats this into middle and leg, flicked to deep backward square leg"
swung across the line into the gap at wide long-on where Pollard comes around to cut that off
"slapped into the wide long-off region, on the bounce to the fielder. There was width, Dhawan picked the bones out of that but couldn't find the gap"
"pushes it across outside off, flat-bats it to point"
"short of a length, sliding down leg, misses the attempted tuck of Hooda"
comes down the track to this length ball and whips it out to deep midwicket
"high full toss, fires it quicker, Dhawan looks to pull but it is too quick for him and he drags it away. He was down the track but still a no ball"
"gets down to slog it but does not make good connection, drags it away to deep midwicket. Stays in the air and lands in front of the fielder"
goes hard at a slog sweep and gets an inside edge to deep fine leg
"is that a missed chance? Looped across outside off, good length, Dhawan tries to slog and drags it towards long-on. Pollard gets around it but just backs away at the very end and the ball drops in front of him"
turned away to midwicket for one
"flat, outside off, it's the top-spinner from Harbhajan. Hooda gets down to slog. But he does not find the middle of the bat at all. Seemed awry from the moment he made contact, off the bottom part of the bat and skies it. It goes quite some distance in the air but can't clear Pollard at long-on"
fine shot from Dhawan. Skips down the track and lofts it with the turn over covers. On a length and makes sure to give himself the room to free his arms and clears the in-field with ease
"sliding on the pads, tries to tuck and wears it on the pad as the ball runs away to short fine leg"
"good length, defended off the front foot with bat close to pad"
"short of a length, stays in the crease and whips it away to midwicket"
"good length, tries to drop it into the off side and take off for a single. Goes a couple of steps forward but he has played it too close and chopped it into the pitch. Parthiv darts forward and Yuvraj has to cancel the run"
"looked like a caught-behind for a moment. Off-cutter, outside off. Dhawan was looking to scoop it fine and gets down. But the bowler adjusts his line and takes it away from him. Dhawan walks across and makes an awkward attempt at ramping it but wears it on the pad as the ball goes to the keeper"
comes down the track and drags it off the inside part of the bat to midwicket
"shortish, pulls it behind square. Slight fumble by Nitish Rana at deep square leg but Yuvraj is not ready for the second run"
"full, outside off, gets an inside edge on the drive and gets it away to long-on"
"bowled off a full toss. Tries to heave it away but is early into the shot. Misses and the ball, angling in, crashes into leg-stump"
can you ask for a better delivery that a full toss first up? This is right in the slot but Cutting trusts his timing even though there was a temptation to muscle it. Caressed between cover and mid-off
"bottom-edge, well-stopped by Parthiv. Looked to ease that behind point but was cramped for room"
"floats this length ball well out of Yuvraj's reach outside off, rightly called wide."
width and put away. Buttler at square third man did all the hard work in getting to the ball but bobbled it with the slide. Rohit is fuming
Yuvraj tries to send this short of length delivery over midwicket but sees Hardik flatten his middle stump. Looked to pull but smashed it back on with a thick inside edge. That is Hardik Pandya's first wicket against Sunrisers in the IPL.
"ripper of a bouncer that whizzes over Ojha's helmet. Was angling down, little too steep. Rightly called wide"
turns the length ball to short midwicket to get off the mark
looks to get inside the line of that short delivery and then help it over but misses
walks across the stumps and works the incoming delivery to square leg
"right in the slot, boom! Too full, overpitches marginally and Cutting gets underneath the length and clobbers this over the bowler's head"
"carves this over cover. Misses his length marginally again, Cutting is down on one knee as he opens his wrists late to get the elevation. What power. Wow"
"looks for a wild slog but was deceived by the change in pace, thick inside edge onto the pad, they get a run off the deflection"
"full and tailing into middle and leg, works it with the angle to the man coming in from deep midwicket. Hardik little slow to get off the block"
"yorker-length on off stump, works it across the line to midwicket"
"fires a wide delivery outside off, anticipated Cutting's movements and floated this well out of the batsman's reach"
"length ball outside off, cut away to deep point"
slower ball gone horribly wrong. Not only is it a full toss but at waist height. Cutting had enough room to swing this into the extra cover boundary
muscles a flat hit across the line to wide long-on
"angles a low full toss into the pads, worked to long-on"
"that's a Bumrah special. Ripper of a yorker that would do the man with mop hair absolutely proud. Full and dead straight on middle, this was delivered from wide of the crease too, and it beat Cutting's attempted squeeze to hit the base of middle. Top stuff"
"slower and fuller on middle and leg, worked to midwicket. First runs for Vijay Shankar in SRH colours"
"another yorker right into middle, Ojha just about manages to get underneath that"
"leading edge and taken at point. Vijay is completely deceived by the change in pace, tried to flick the full ball but the ball dipped on him to take the edge. As simple as they come at backward point. Don't think Vijay Shankar had faced him before."
shuffles across and turns the low full toss on leg stump to fine leg
"chipped over Malinga's outstretched hands on his followthrough, once again turned the bat face early to get a leading edge"
looks to swing this to deep backward square but the low full toss dipped on him and beat the swing to hit him on the pad. Impact outside leg
"another slower delivery, works it from outside off towards the man coming in from deep midwicket. Excellent running"
"right into the blockhole on middle and leg, squeezed to square leg"
looks to swing this over long-on but could only manage to toe-end the slog to Pollard who takes a dolly at the boundary. An air of nonchalance as he goes about taking easy catches like these at the boundary. Seemed to have enough time to have  cup of tea before he took that
backs away and squeezes a full delivery on off to mid-off
"fires this full on middle from wide of the crease, hit hard to mid-off as they scamper a single"
"swung across the line but didn't get to the pitch whatsoever, top-edged the slog as Bumrah ran to his left to take an easy catch. Slower deliveries are the ones fetching wickets here in the slog overs."
flicks a full toss on middle towards deep midwicket
"another full toss on middle from wide of the crease, swung towards long-on who comes haring in to cut that off"
"full, shaping away from the left-hander late, left alone"
"full, outside off, pushed off the front foot to mid-off for a quick single. Mumbai are away"
"full, outside off, not much feet from Buttler as he defends into the off side"
beautifully bowled. Gets it to nip away from a length. Buttler is forced to prod at it and gets beaten
shot. Wristy from Buttler. Bhuvneshwar gets his line slightly wrong and sprays it on leg. Buttler is quick to grab the opportunity. Nice balance as he clips it away through midwicket
"<b>appeal for leg before, not given</b>. Buttler was looking to slap it away. But the ball skids into him, cramps him for room. Given as leg-bye. Height could have been the issue there"
angled across just outside off. Buttler feebly pokes outside off and gets an inside edge that misses the stumps and runs away to fine leg
"short of a length, waits for it and gets on top of the bounce before opening the face of his bat and running it down to third man for one"
"slightly back of a length, holding its line outside off. Gives Parthiv enough room as he crisply punches off the backfoot through covers. Still head and superb timing"
"and this time it is coming into him on a fullish length, Parthiv clips it off the pads through midwicket"
invites him to poke at one outside off. Some width on offer and Parthiv tries to run it down by opening the face of his bat. Doesn't make an effort to get close to it and is beaten
"<b>outside edge for four</b>. Needed a slip there. Good, testing line from Nehra, tempting the batsman to go after him in the corridor. Parthiv slashes at this time and gets a healthy edge that shoots through the cordon"
"superb placement. Did not move his feet an inch but makes fantastic contact as he opens up. Short of a length and width on offer, punches between cover and point"
"full, angling in on the pads at pace. 140 clicks from Bhuvneshwar. Buttler tries to clip it away but gets rapped on the pad. May gave got an inside edge there"
"beautifully bowled! Good length ball at 135 clicks, superb seam position, shapes away late off the pitch to beat the outside edge of Buttler"
"length, angling in, clipped away towards mid-on who is slightly back and they take him on for a quick single. Rashid does not pick it up cleanly"
"too full, clipped off the pads to deep midwicket"
"short of a length, angled across, waits for it and opens the face of his bat to stab it to point"
slower ball from Nehra does Buttler in. Short of a length and Buttler comes charging down. Tries to whip it away with a flat bat but it does not bounce as much. And Buttler is through with the shot. Does not pick the drop in pace - 118 kph from Nehra - and loses his stumps. Nehra sends a flying kiss Buttler's way to bid him goodbye
"short of good length, waits for it and watchfully defends into the off side"
"short of good length, angled across outside off and how is that for elegance. Punches it firmly off the backfoot and splits the covers region. But Warner gives it a good chase, darts back and slides forward to pull it back in front of the boundary"
"strong wrists. Flicks it uppishly from outside off, keeps it in the air but not a problem as it goes comfortably to the left of and over mid-on"
"short ball, responds with a pull but the bounce gets too big on him and he misses"
"short of a length, gets up around the waist height, Parthiv pulls it away to deep backward square leg"
"length, works it against the turn in front of mid-on for one"
"skidding on, just around off, finds the inside edge of Parthiv as he looks to defend"
backs away to manufacture room and slaps hard to covers
"pitched up on middle and off, pushed down to mid-on who is slightly deep for one"
"and he gets another big batsman out. He is making a habit out of this. Googly, on a length, not picked by Rohit at all. It's pitching outside off and comes into Rohit who comes forward and plays for the legbreak, ball beats inside edge and raps him on the pads and that looked plumb"
"good length, tucked with the turn behind square on the leg side"
"that was an unbelievable shot. Shortish, angling in to him on leg, gets the head away and just shovels it over deep fine leg. Uses the pace on that delivery and so good is the contact it goes all the way"
""
"short of good length, outside off, opens the face of his bat and runs it down to third man for one"
"shortish, wide outside off, cuts it late enough to beat point diving to his right. There is a deep backward square leg and he runs across but cannot get to it in time. <b>2000 runs for Parthiv in the IPL</b>"
"oh, shot! Shot of the night. Short ball, on the fourth-stump channel, Parthiv arches back and plays an uppercut to dispatch it to third man"
"overcompensates with the line and length. Takes it into the batsman and bowls it too full, clipped and clipped extremely hard, uppishly through fine leg"
comes forward to meet the pitch and defends into the off side
"full, pushed across outside off, comes forward and drives to long-off"
"length, spinning into him, whipped away towards mid-on and Rashid runs across on the follow-through to cut it off"
"pitched up outside off, gets down and lays into a sweep, fetches it from outside off, deep midwicket cuts it off"

"shotish, but not close enough to cut, gets cramped for room and chops it towards point"
"full, on the pads, turned away to deep backward square leg for one"
"good length, angled across just around off, not giving him room, waits for it and opens the bat face late to run it down to third man"
"short of a length, not much turn, so takes the liberty to whip it against it to long-on"
"short, backs away and slaps but ends up dragging it down to long-off"
"full toss, pushed down to long-on"
"Bhuvneshwar takes a smart catch in front of the straight boundary. Good length, sliding in on middle, Parthiv tries to go down the ground but only chips it. Bhuvneshwar runs across and gets down to his right to pluck it"
"full, on off, pushed back to the bowler"
"length, in the slot for Rana and he has thumped this. Not much turn and he gets down and slogs it powerfully over deep midwicket"
"sliding in on leg, clipped away to midwicket"
"gives it a lot of air and bowls it full outside off, driven crisply off the front foot to mid-off"
"flighted on leg, clipped away to midwicket. Two fielders converging and they take them on to come charging back for the second"
"slightly short and a lot of width, cut hard but can't beat point who dives forward and gets a hand to it"
"flat, short of good length, not much turn, opens the bat face and steers it away to backward point"
comes forward to play for the turn but it is sliding into him and he wears it on the pad and the ball goes towards short fine leg
"short of good length, angled across on off, Pollard stands tall and punches it firmly back to the bowler"
"short ball, sitting up nicely for Pollard who swivels around and pulls to deep square leg"
"good length, on off, chops it hard into the pitch"
"short, wide, slapped away to deep point for one"
"bowls it too full outside off, it's a low full toss, in fact. Pollard opens the face of his bat late and chops it into the turf as the ball goes to third man"
"short of a length, width on offer outside off. Opens up his shoulders and slaps it, gets it well over the outstretched hands of the leaping point fielder"
"full, legcutter, on the pads, clipped to midwicket"
"full at 134kph on off and middle, pushed along the ground to mid-off"
chipped in the air and drops short of the fielder running in from deep midwicket. Tries to go through the off side but done in by the lack of pace and skews it off the inside part of the bat
"flicked an flicked hard. Just how powerful are those wrists of Pollard. Full, just clipped off the pads, doesn't even try to hit it hard but such is the power, goes clean over deep midwicket"
"back of a length, another cutter, at 118 kph, outside off, drops it in front of extra cover and sets off for a rapid single"

"drifting on the pads, Pollard tries to tuck and wears it on the pad"
"good length, angles it across but not giving him the room to free his arms, knocks it to point with a half-angled bat"
pulled and straight to square leg. Shortish and sitting up nicely for Pollard. He swivels around but does not get it as fine as he would have liked. Simplest of catches for Dhawan

"full, outside off, pushed crisply off the front foot to long-off for a single"
"pitched up on middle, googly, knocked to the left of the bowler"

"length, on the pads, tucked with the turn and Rashid darts across and dives to stop it off his own bowling"
"was that because of the dew? Seems like it has slipped out of his hand. Full toss, Krunal swats it away over deep midwicket. First boundary off Rashid"
"short of a length, punched back to the left of the bowler. Rashid runs across and fires a throw. Lost his cool there and sent it in the direction of the batsman. Krunal ducks and they get the overthrow. Gets showered by boos from the crowd"
"short of a length, outside off, cut to point"
"full toss, slips out of the hand, comes on below waist height, punched to long-on"
"that's a clean strike. Overpitched, outside off, Krunal walks across to meet the pitch and thumps it over long-on. Good swing and follow-through. Crowd finds its voice again"

"too full, outside off, carved uppishly over covers. Krunal Pandya doing it for Mumbai here"
looks to run it down to third man and makes no contact
"has that come off the glove? Short ball from Cutting again, does not give room this time. Coming on leg stump channel and not giving him the room to pull. But pandya tries to shovel it and gets a glove as the ball goes to fine leg"
tries to go big over the leg side with a pull but gets cramped for room and ends up dragging it down to long-off
full toss ends Krunal Pandya's burst. It comes on at around thigh height and he looks to swing it over deep midwicket. Gets it off the high part of the bat and Ben Cutting latches on to it in the deep
"very full, squeezed out between mid-on and midwicket. Hardik wants a second but Rana denies him the run and rightly so"
"short of a length, outside off, defended with an open face of the bat to backward point"
"fullish length, outside off, drops it in front of point for an easy single"
"full, change of pace, rolls his fingers over the seam and bowls it slow. But too wide and it is carved over extra cover"
"and Rana falls with Mumbai on the brink. Short of a length, he was looking to back away and sticks his bat out. But the ball moves away from him and hits the top part of the off-stump. The bail comes off and nearly hits the keeper's face as it flies back"
"on the pads, tucked away to deep midwicket for one"
"full and on the pads again, clipped away to midwicket. Deep midwicket runs in and they take him on for the second. Better throw and Harbhajan was gone. He was struggling on the second run. They all have a laugh at Harbhajan's running at the Mumbai dug out"
"full, angled across, Harbhajan pushes it out to covers and it is a packed off-side field with everyone inside the circle"
"on a length, on leg stump, Harbhajan nudges it away to square leg for a single and that is the game"
