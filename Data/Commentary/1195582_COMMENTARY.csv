"<b>he's been run out!</b> A low full toss at leg stump, sweetly clipped through square leg...the return is very good, right over the stumps, and he might be on the line here. Yep, he's short. That's a bit careless. He picked his fielder, Jhye Richardson, who bowls the ball in but he got that back very well"

"full outside off, driven from the bottom of the bat"
"full toss outside off, driven wide of the sweeper but Wells is quick around the rope"

"full and straight, swung to short fine leg"
"gets underneath a full ball outside off and sends it skimming towards long-on, Salt commits for the catch but doesn't reach him and he does really well to prevent the boundary"
"<B>great catch from Salt, a bit of Jordan about that!</b> What a way to seal the deal. Was drilled very firmly towards wide long-on, Salt sprinted to his right - doesn't quite get as airborne as Jordan did - and does superbly to cling on"
"full toss at off stump, heaved to deep square leg"
"short of a length slower ball, swing and a miss"
"full outside off, that's a mighty powerful drive to deep cover but it doesn't matter"
