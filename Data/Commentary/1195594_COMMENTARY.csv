"<b>past the outside edge.</b> Short of a length, just outside off, some shape away. Has a feeler and misses"
<b>there's a sound.</b> Is there an edge? Length ball with shape away outside off again. Harper jumps into the leg side and has a heave. That climbs past his bat and the keeper and slip look convinced. Half an appeal from Steyn.

length and swung away. Defended from the crease
length and curving away in the corridor. Nudged to third man off the outside half

"slashed brutally. Short of a length in the corridor, makes room and times this square cut to perfection"

"length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"short and rising at off stump. Doesn't look to keep that hook down, but he's hit it high and it just plonks into the outfield, a considerable way in from the square leg boundary"

offcutter at a length on middle. Flicked well in front of deep square to steal two

"<b>lovely work by Ben Dunk at long-on!</b> Googly dropped short at middle stump, pulled flat to long-on's left. Dunk sprints to his left, leaps up to catch it reverse cup, takes one and then another to balance. He has one more step to go before he's over the boundary - and at this point, he summons all his core strength, springing up from his knees, and lobs it backhanded for Coulter-Nile at deep midwicket to complete the catch. Those kettlebell swings have worked"
"length at middle stump, pushed towards long-on"
<b>appeal for stumping.</b> Length ball pushed wide outside off. Makes him reach out on the front foot and beats him. His back leg was briefly in the air.

"short of a length on off, opens the face and runs it to backward point"
"<b>run out at the non-striker's.</b> Legcutter at a length on off stump. Has a big slog at that and is beaten. Doesn't want the run, probably for the best. Steyn gathers the throw and waits and teases before gently taking one bail off"
"beaten again. Another slow short ball, just outside off. Through the pull shot early once more"
"<b>caught behind.</b> A quicker short one this time, a nice Test match length in the corridor. Looks for the pull again but that's too quick for him. Takes the edge and it's an easy catch for Handscomb"

"oh that's elegant. Short of a length across him, gets his weight on the front leg but punches without a big stride. On the up, between the two point fielders"
"not as elegant this time, but same result. Short and pushed across him. Backs into the leg side and has a big slash at it. Thick outside edge to Boyce's right at third man. He makes the ground but tumbles and that trickles into the boundary padding as he tries to recover"
"mistimed, but good enough. Short of a length and getting big at an off stump line. He lifts it on the up from about waist height, straight over the bowler. Comes off the high part of the bat but it's a safe area to pick in the Powerplay"
"short at the ribs, tucked to short fine's right off the back foot"
"length on middle stump, flicked to fine leg"
"<b>punched past the bowler.</b> Length on off stump, doesn't bother with the feet. That slides on nicely and it whistles past the bowler's head"
