"bowled 'im, Smuts plays on! Touch of swing for Willey, hits the seam and does enough to clip the inside edge on to his boot before bobbling gently into the timbers and dislodging the leg bail. Smuts trudges off as Willey celebrates an immediate breakthrough"
...which is swung down the leg side for a wide
"shorter length, worked down square on the back foot"
"back of a length, angled across at 81mph and Hendricks stabs a drive through the covers for three"
"pitched up, again some late swing but AB clips it casual as you like through midwicket, there's a sweeper out there to prevent a boundary"
"length on the stumps, pushed along the carpet to mid-on"
"fullish, 134kph/82mph around off stump, driven without timing towards mid-off"
"dug in short, Hendricks pulls - straight to midwicket! Wood also strikes with his first ball! It looked a good, positive shot but the connection was high up the bat, maybe beaten for pace a touch, and it looped at a nice height to the man on the edge of the circle, who took it comfortably above his head"
"short of a length, angled across outside off and glided to third man"
"that's a cracking shot, back of a length, 88mph outside off, de Villiers leaps across and hammers a square drive for four"
"good wheels from Wood, this is clocked at 91mph as AB taps it down on the back foot"
"touch short, nipping back in over the stumps, worked to leg from deep in the crease for a couple"
"pitched up and de Villiers turns the heat back on the bowler again, making room to fairly blast this through the covers. Scorched!"
"wow, that's six, driven over long-off on the move! This was played with a lovely straight bat, he made his intentions clear early and just hit clean through the line, went all the way"

"angled across from over the wicket, Miller steers another single through backward point"
"slower ball from Jordan, de Villiers comes down and swings cross-batted, gets a bottom edge into the turf and the bowler fields"
"short of a length, cramped for room and he plays across the line, off thigh pad and glove, I think, but it lands short of Jordan"
"another slower ball, no cut on it, just a wide floater that de Villiers throws the bat at, failing to connect"
"another slower ball but this time he spots it, steadies himself... and chips over mid-off, nicely controlled and it skips away for four"
"gone, another first-baller, edged to the keeper! Wood's pace was too much for Miller there, he was hopping around like a cat on Tennessee Williams' roof (which is notoriously warm), it nipped in and he decided to bring the bat down late, only succeeding in toe-ending it through to Buttler"
"ooh, that's a beast! Behardien has to fend away a throat ball first up, that reared like an angry llama"
"short again, coming back in at 88mph, this time he gets a little more comfortably in behind it"
"dug in, Behardien swings for his life, shovels a pull into the leg side for one"
"pitched up, 90mph and punched firmly but straight to mid-off"
"de Villiers starts to move down as Wood drops short, this sizzles through at 91mph, shoulder height but the batsman was not taking it on"

"dug in short and de Villiers pulls, there's a man to sweep it up at deep square leg"
"back of a length in the channel outside off, Behardien swats it through point for one"

"flat delivery outside off, de Villiers twocks it through point"
"floated up on off, Behardien comes forward and clips one more to long-off"
"tosses up the legbreak, and there's a shout for lbw straight away, Behardien hit on the pads playing back... Just outside leg?"
"pushes through the googly this time, prods at it defensively"
"gives this some air, there's turn away from the batsman as he slashes at it, gets a thick outside edge fine of short third man and picks up four"
tossed up a touch straighter and worked into a gap
"flighted, outside off, Crane delivers his stock ball quite quickly, de Villiers steers through the covers"
"another googly to finish, jammed into the ground and he fields off his own bowling - decent first over in international cricket from the 20-year-old"
tossed up and pushed through mid-off for another single
"tight lines from Dawson, prodded back to the bowler"
"flat outside off, Behardien opens up his body shape to hit squarer for one"
"lobbed up, de Villiers tries to hit inside-out this time, gets under it and nearly carries to extra cover! Pretty much hit the fingertips and the ground at the same time"
and this nearly carries back to Dawson! Mistimed on the drive and it bounces <i>just</i>  in front of the bowler diving to his left
"pushed through quicker, beats the outside edge as de Villiers goes back... Another good over"
"tossed up and worked into the leg side, Billings' fleet feet and fast arm keep them to one"
"flighted outside off stump, de Villiers strokes through the covers"
"tossed up and whipped away into the leg side, this is better placed and Billings can't prevent two"
"very full, dips just in time, Behardien forces it through mid-off"
"floats up the wrong'un, de Villiers waits for it, unmoving on leg stump, bottom-hands a drive down the ground to long-on"
"skips in and pushes through the legbreak, Behardien is a little late on it but manages to swat a single behind square"
"nudged off the pads, that's gone straight to short fine leg, could be in trouble with a direct hit... but misses! De Villiers was diving but out of the frame"
"floated up wide of the stumps, smacked through the covers for a couple in front of the sweeper"
"fired in straight, tapped away"
"dragged down a little, de Villiers rocks back to swing one to deep midwicket"
flat on the stumps and wheeled square for one
"tossed up on the stumps, de Villiers strokes one more to long-on"

"flat delivery wide of the stumps, cut behind deep point for a couple"
tossed up and punched back to the bowler
"fired in outside leg stump as de Villiers tries to make room, he ends up heaving towards the leg side, gets a big bottom edge for one"
skips down and swings a single out to deep midwicket
"pushed through on off stump, de Villiers swipes it out to deep extra cover for one more"
"good length, straightening on off, Behardien plinks it into the off side"
"pushed through on off stump, tapped towards cover"
"goes back, heaves across the line, big top edge... has he got AB as a maiden wicket? No! Just clears Roy running back towards mid-off"
"fired through, grips a touch and Behardien can't get it away"
drops back and steers int a gap in the covers
"flighted, this drifts and whirs and dips in late, ending up right in the blockhole as de Villiers drops his bat on it like a portcullis slamming down at the last moment"
"finishes with a full toss and de Villiers doesn't miss out, bullying a pull through midwicket and beating the man in the deep - first boundary in six overs, though nevertheless it's been an impressive spell from Crane"
"touch back of a length, nurdled into a gap square on the leg side of two"
"good length, on the stumps, worked back down the track"
"short ball, Behardien pulls, bit of a top edge and it sails towards deep backward square leg... but <b>Crane misjudges it</b>, the ball clears him and then bounces for four! He was in a patch of shade and may have had trouble picking it up, but not the best bit of fielding from the debutant"
"slower ball, maybe a Willey wobbler, out the front of the hand, swings in late past the advancing Behardien, maybe gets a touch on it, Buttler does well to prevent it running for four"
"pitched up, taking the pace off again, swung into the leg side"
"full and straight, 82mph and Behardien clips a single through square leg"

"back of a length outside off, swiped through the covers off the back foot"
"back of a length, wellied through the covers hanging deep in the crease"
"short ball and this is completely mistimed, de Villiers looking a little perplexed as he plinks the ball to long-on on the bounce... Has someone smuggled some Kryptonite out there?"
"ooh, that's tucked him up, fast and bouncy and Behardien takes it in the ribs"
"dug in short, top-edged on the pull, out towards Crane again... but it doesn't carry and he has to spread-eagle himself to stop it bouncing past"
"oh, there's the magic, de Villiers is in business, leaping across outside off and playing a slog-sweep to a fast bowler that sails majestically over fine leg for a maximum to bring up fifty (at just over a run a ball)"
"slugs this down the ground, hit malevolently but goes to long-on on the bounce"
"oh, that's well bowled, bluffs de Villiers, who had stepped outside leg, Jordan goes full and wide but well inside the tramlines"
"pitched up, squeezes the yorker out through backward square leg"
"pitched up in the channel, 87mph and dug out for one through cover point"
"on the stumps, worked through mid-on, again only singles on offer"

"pitched up and slapped down the ground, bounces in front of the diving Roy at mid-off, who does well to prevent it running away for more than one"

"banged in, maybe taking the pace off, top-edged towards deep square leg but again it doesn't carry"
"fired in, squeezes one away into the leg side"
"ripping short ball to finish, de Villiers swings hard but can't get bat on it as he backs outside leg stump - so Wood is bowled out, a touch expensive by the standards of the day but a couple of important wickets"
"low full toss to start with, wide of the stumps and thumped through the covers"
"shimmies across, taken on the full... and blootered into the crowd at deep square leg! Extraordinary from de Villiers, that's the sort of kamikaze slog-sweep only he can pull off with ease"
"steps away, smashed back to the bowler without timing"
"fullish, outside off, scooped towards long-on and they scamper back for two"
"fired in wide of the stumps, de Villiers swats a single through the covers"
"full, not quite a yorker, 88mph outside off and driven straight to deep extra cover - only a single there, so SA restricted to 142 for 3, an odd sort of innings, really"
round the wicket and slides into an uncertain forward poke. Hits the pad but going down
Roy skips down to meet the ball with a calm clip through midwicket to open his account
"onto the front foot, staying leg-side in a bid to unleash the drive. Not this time"
"a back-foot punch, firmly to cover"
"on the back foot again, on the pads, worked square"
"squeezed into the leg side again, four singles to launch the chase"
"banged in short, Hales ducks"
"short again, but this time Hales is waiting. Pivots his full body-weight through a lusty pull, two bounces through midwicket. And he's off!"
"solidly struck, back down the line of the ball this time"
driven firmly into the covers again. He's making good contact
"dancing at the crease this time, and dabbed to gully"
"glided into the covers, a good full length but watched onto the bat"
"strikes the pad, deflects behind square"
worked off the legs
"slammed into the crowd behind square! There's the Roy who's been missing all this time. Down on one knee, swept high and mighty, and a fine crowd catch too"
slightly loses his shape as he attempts something murderous back past the bowler
hustled through a bit quicker this time
"holds this one back, and dabbed back to the bowler"
"inside-out, a slap over the inner ring. Gets away with it through sheer brute force, but a bit of a welly if truth be told"
"on the hips, that's just free runs, I'm afraid. Tight on leg stump, swinging into the pads, and deflecting past a sprawling keeper"
oh that's huge. A hulking great golf swing of a booming drive. Plundered over long-on
"short, Roy lets the ball fly almost past his head before patting it on its way, a top-edge flies clear, and this is becoming a leaky over"
"wristy and magnificent. Oh Jason Roy, where have you been? Nothing especially wrong with the cross-seamer on leg stump, angling across. But Roy just places it through the gap at wide mid-on"
"inside-out this time. Pure control and timing, waiting for the ball to arrive, and deflected with an open face, off the tippy-toes and through the covers. This is an exhibition over"
tucked to leg to keep the strike. He's back!
"reverse sweep, and plumb! Well, maybe he thought he was having too much of a good time. Roy dons the hair-shirt, and returns to self-flagellation as he picks the wrong ball for improvisation. Full and straight, and up goes the finger"
"outside off, dabbed down to gully"
"outside off, and chopped hard through backward point. You can't give width to Jonny"
"back of a length, hauled behind square with a swivel-pull"
"back of a length, tucked to square leg"
"short, and sharp, Bairstow drops his wrists and lets the ball fly through"
full toss. That could have gone anywhere. Instead it's slapped down to gully
"panned through deep midwicket! Cleared the front dog, swung his levers across the line. Wallop"
"rocks onto the back foot for another firm connection, but only as far as cover"
driven on the up to mid-on
"rolls the wrists, pushed to cover"
worked to the off side. a decent recovery from that early smoking
"on the back foot, tapped to mid-on"
"outside off, chopped out to deep point"
"on the pads, picks the single"
an energetic pull into the leg side.
"outside off, attempted cut through the covers but it's through to the keeper"
tapped back to the bowler
"swept hard to the sweeper, aptly enough, on the midwicket fence"
wristily poked to mid-on
"hello, goodbye. Down on one knee, a greedy swipe through the line, and a gleeful followthrough that screams: 'nailed it'."
"nicely timed once again, this time through the covers"
"looped up, and patted to the onside"
"decent length, stabbed down the ground, beating the diving short midwicket"
"good delivery, slides into the pads, but always outside leg"
tight to leg stump once again
cut languidly through point
"tonked. Big stride down the track, big swing through the line, dumped over the bowler's head"
nudges the gap
"on the pads, whipped into the leg side"
worked off the pads towards backward square leg
"down the leg side, a good one-handed take"
"on the toes, clipped out to deep midwicket"
Hales hops back into his crease to chisel more runs into the leg side. It's been a diet of leg-sided ... ordinariness this over
"better ball, hits the seam and leaps for the splice, but a canny stolen single as the ball drops down into the crease"
"too short, that's just a pie to be honest. Took the pace off, and it ended up sitting up and begging to be spanked with lots of bottom hand, up and through third man"
"short again and slathered out to deep midwicket. If England were a barbecue, they'd be cooking"
tighter line
"striding onto the front foot, and poked back to the bowler"
"reverse sweep, and that is some properly village fielding on the square leg rope. The ball was easing up, and should have been easily gathered. Instead the fielder just dived over the ball"
tapped down the ground
"down the track, Smuts adjusts his length, and concedes the single to a measured push to long-on"
"on the pads, tapped to square leg"
hammered into the leg side once more. England are coasting home now
cut to third man
"shimmies across the crease, and slapped over backward square. Too short, and too slow. So much time to adjust and dispatch with a disdainful pull"
tucked to leg
"on the back foot, tapped back to the bowler"
"outside off, chopped hard to point where Parnell gathers with an energetic dive"
"crushed through the covers, and a valiant diving attempt to intercept the ball at deep extra. Got a hand to the ball, but could only parry it to the rope, ten yards further round"
ironic cheers as the ball is successfully gathered this time
drilled into the covers once more
tidy wicket-to-wicket delivery. Blocked
"high, too high, and <B>dropped!</B> Oh, that's terrible. Hales was right underneath the ball, and so too was the fielder at long on, but he buttered the ball straight through his fingers and over the rope"
"no mistake this time from Hales! This one goes where the first was intended, 20 rows back over long-on!"
"on the pads, whipped square, and Bairstow shows no ill-effects as he sprints back for two"
"good delivery, tweaking from middle and off, and defended"
"loose, not very loose, but Bairstow banjaxes that one through the covers, to bring up a rocket-speed fifty!"
a huge wipe across the line and for once there's no connection. Even the keeper is startled as the ball burrows through his gloves
"lofted drive, down to wide long off"
skids through a touch this time. But the game is long gone
"dinked over the wicketkeeper's head, that's stunning batting. A decent bouncer, angling into the batsman, who leans out of line and dabs it to the fence. Scores level!"
"short, and through to the keeper. That's called as one for the over, but it's not a wide. Good ball"
"tip and run, into the off side, a quick glance at Hales, who is on his way, and there it is. England have utterly shellacked South Africa in the first of three T20s!"
