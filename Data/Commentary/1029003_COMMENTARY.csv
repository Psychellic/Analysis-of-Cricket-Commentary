"pitched up, looking for some early swing, Roy is on to the front foot to defend"
"short of a length, Joyce hops behind the line and works into square leg"
"this one goes straight on in the channel, Roy drawn into playing away from his body but he manages to hold his hands inside the line"
"spanked, that's gone back where it came from at a rate of knots! Touch too full from Murtagh and Roy creams a straight drive for the first runs of the day"
pitched up and driven without timing towards mid-on
"fullish, around off stump, met on the front foot - a solid start from Murtagh, on his Middlesex manor"
"hits the pitch hard, just back of a length, Hales gets across to block"
"this is wayward, sprayed well down the leg side, Niall O'Brien has to scamper across to his left to prevent any more extras"
"full and straight and crunched back through mid-on, beats the dive of the fielder and that's a boundary to get going for Hales, too"
"length ball, outside the line of off and shaping back in late as Hales shoulders arms"
"fullish in the channel, Hales drops his bat down on it"
"yoink, this gets big on Hales, only 82mph from Chase but he got in just the right area to rattle the batsman, forced back and fending the ball down past this stumps"
"pitched up and Hales isn't slow to get forward, smoked through cover point with a flowing bat for another emphatic four"
"tight lines around fourth stump, Roy comes across and defends"
"angled in a touch straighter and Roy dabs it down into the on side, they hustle through for one"
"length ball, late 70s mph from Murtagh, comes back in and Hales pushes it back to the bowler"
lets this one go in the channel
"ooh, nicely bowled, 78mph and sliding in with the seam acting as a rudder, then straightening off the pitch to beat the outside edge"
"length ball on off, Hales chops down on it"
touch short on the stumps and again Roy shows soft hands to tap one down into the leg side
"pitched up and Hales once again gets well forward to flay through the covers, those long arms telescoping out in front to dispatch Chase for another four"
"full and tailing in, whipped off the pads away through midwicket and they come back for three"
"middle and off, 80mph and Roy shows it a straight bat in defence"
"length around the line of off stump, blocked into the covers"
"sliding in with the arm, 82mph and pushed back down the ground towards mid-on. Roy starting watchfully today, after his cheap dismissal at Bristol"
"touch back of a length, Hales tucks it down into the vacant midwicket area for one"
"fuller, pushed up the slope by Murtagh, Roy is on the front foot and clips another single to deep midwicket"
"Hales makes an early move across on off but Murtagh holds his nerve, keeps it on a length in the channel, no stroke"
"shorter ball, 76mph rising up outside off, blocked into the off side"
"back of a length, maybe holding its line fractionally, tapped towards point from the crease"
75mph but tight lines from Dial M and Hales defends
"pitched up and pushed back down the ground, just timing rather than power and mid-off slides to cut it off and prevent one"
fired down the leg side
good length on the stumps and Roy gets across to block
"touch short and a little quicker, 84mph from Chase and Roy is hit on the thigh padding playing from the crease"
"lovely stroke, not a bad ball but Roy draws himself up and stuns a drive at the top of the bounce, which races away through the covers for four"
"on the stumps, tucked down into the leg side"
"back of a length, slightly too straight and Roy clips a single off his hip to fine leg"
"slightly back of a length, Hales waits in the crease and flips it through midwicket for two"
"some nibble for Murtagh, gets the ball to come back in and clip the inside edge as Hales props forward, the ball deflects on to the pad and balloons up... but there's no short leg in and it lands safely"
"good length around off, 77mph and prodded towards mid-on"
short outside off and Hales forces one through backward point off the outside edge
"diligent stuff from Murtagh, plugging away around off stump, Roy defends"
on the stumps and tapped down to the leg side
"now Hales opens up the shoulders and gives it some tap, short ball from Chase but not the pace to trouble the batsman on a slow-ish surface, hoicked up and away over midwicket, couple of bounces to the fence"
"good length, comes and dabs it down watchfully"
"short outside off and bludgeoned through midwicket again, Hales showcasing his power with a malevolent pull for four more"
"length, nipping back a fraction, gets an inside edge to the leg side"
"well bowled, locates some juice in the pitch, 81mph but it springs up to hit the splice as Hales tries to come forwards"
"good length on the stumps, 84mph and nudged into the leg side"
"shortish outside off, Roy opens the face and gets a couple fine of third man, who has to scramble round to cut it off"
straighter line and pushed back towards mid-on
"length in the channel, Roy presses out and taps into the covers"
"Murtagh is nagging away like a project manager on deadline, defended on off again"
"touch fuller, this gets Roy driving but he can't get it past mid-off"
"ooh, sneaked one through him! This was a flick of something as the ball came back past the inside edge and into O'Brien's gloves - but it was pad, I think"
"slides down the leg side and Hales gets a tickle on it, bounces through to the diving NOB"
"pitched up and Hales swats it back towards the bowler, KOB then aims a shy at the stumps... but doesn't let got of the ball"
"length around off stump, 74mph and prodded into the covers"
bit of width this time and Hales carves one through backward point to rotate the strike
"touch short outside off stump, Roy still finding his range, punched to mid-off"
"shuffles across and drives on the up, again sends it along the greensward to the man at mid-off - so at the end of the initial Powerplay, England are a relatively sedate 45 for 0. Ireland won't be too displeased with that"
"pitched up slightly wide of the stumps and lashed square, without moving the feet... but point snaps it up"
"wibbly wobbly, in and out, past the edge as Hales feels for it"
"touch overpitched and clumped back down the ground, beats mid-off and runs away - only the second boundary Murtagh has conceded"
"bowled him, Murtagh strikes! Ireland have their wicket, and it's just reward for some forensic probing from the Middlesex old stager on his home ground... It was on a perfect length, nipping back up the slope, Hales was really in no-man's land trying to drive and the ball snaked between bat and pad to hit middle and leg. That's a bingo!"
"full in the channel, 78mph and met with a textbook cover drive, extra cover fields"
"another nipbacker, thuds into the front pad, up goes the appeal... Reiffel shakes his head! Think that was outside the line of off, and replays show there was a chunk of bat involved, too"
"oh, pinged! Just a touch overpitched by KOB and Roy leans into a regal push-drive that skedaddles away straight back past the stumps"
"ooh, beats the bat this time! That's the length for these conditions, gets it to duck past Roy's angled bat"
slightly short and straight and worked off the body for one
"close again, this time a leading edge falling short of cover... Root feeling for it out in front of his body as O'Brien again got it to straighten"
comes across and defends into the covers
touch too full and straight and Root gets off the mark with a flick through backward point
"fullish, 82mph and tailing in around off stump, Root blocks on the move"
"pitched up and driven, not a half-volley by any means but Root lasers it square with minimal fuss and it beats backward point, third man has no chance of cutting it off"
"fullish in the channel, pushed through cover point for a single"
"full and nailed on the drive - straight to extra cover! Roy falls, wasn't to the pitch and although he flashed hard, it basically went straight into Stirling's hands as he put them up instinctively in front of his face. McCarthy bellows in delight and England have lost both openers"
digs the ball in short straight away and Morgan fends it slightly awkwardly through backward square leg for one to get off the mark
"another spritely bumper, lifting towards the neck and Root does well to swipe it behind square for a couple"
"angled across outside Morgan's off stump, he's happy to watch it through"
"length ball, 72mph around off, gets into line and defends"
"KOB goes round the wicket now, pops it on a length, Morgan blocks coming forwards"
"chipped, all the way! Pitching wedge from Morgan, skipping out and swinging down the ground, didn't sound like it came out of the middle but it drops beyond the boundary rope in front of the pavilion at long-off for England's first six of the day"
"draws his length back a touch, dropped into the covers for a quick single"
"short of a length outside off, punched to cover off the back foot"
"nicely bowled, in the corridor of befuddlement, Morgan leaves it be"
"tighter to the off stump, slightly back of a length, defended"
"digs this one in halfway down, Morgan swivels and pats a single through square leg on the pull"
"full in the channel and Root launches himself into a square drive, not timed and point scoops it up"
touch full again and this time Root steers the ball in front of point to the sweeper
short on the hips and Morgan nudges another single
"back of a length outside off, Morgan stays on top of the bounce and spears a drive through point for couple"
"shortish, outside off, gets a bottom edge trying to cut"
"goes fuller, in the slot to drive, Morgan sends it along the carpet to mid-off"
"KOB over the wicket now, 72mph on a length outside off, slapped through cover point from the crease"
slightly full outside off and Root punches authoritatively through point for one more
"cutely done and that's another boundary to the England captain, dropping back outside off and angling the bat to glide four to third man"
"round the wicket, full and straight, pushed back to the bowler"
"fuller, uses his bottom hand and flicks it through midwicket. Nicely played"
"a shorter delivery, Root uses his crease by moving back and whips through the leg side...once again, the second can't be prevented"
"that's a drag down, but it only costs a single as Balbirnie makes an excellent sliding stop on the midwicket boundary to intercept Root's pull"
"short again, outside off to Morgan, worked down to long-on"
"that's a better length, fuller, Root comes onto the front and drives back to Dockrell"
"good length outside off, driven to the cover sweeper"

"fuller, at the stumps, defended to the leg side"
"on the pads, worked through square leg"
"that's a good length, full at off stump, hint of movement back into Root, defended to mid-off"
chopped to backward point
"touch fuller, brings him forward, drives through the off side to the sweeper"
eases forward and drives down the ground to long-off
"that's the captain's second six...latches onto a short ball, rocks back and pulls it high and handsome over deep midwicket"
"back on a full length outside off, defended"
whipped from outside off down to long-on
"on the stumps, defended to the bowler...79mph"
"fuller, at off stump, Morgan drives with a closed face and squeezes it wide of mid-on"
"back of a length at off stump, 82mph, defended towards point"
gets across the stumps and takes this from around off to midwicket
"a shorter delivery, outside off, Root gets on top of the bounce and square drives wide of point...the sweeper, Wilson, makes good ground"
"tries to adjust the line, gets too straight, deflects off the pads wide of the keeper towards long leg"
"full outside leg stump, Root gets over the top of a sweep and sends it scooting away to fine leg...fifty stand between England's two captains"
now he's on the back foot to a shorter delivery and punches to deep cover
"short outside off, Morgan waits for it and pushes to long-on...Dockrell hasn't quite been able to get his length"
"back in the crease, works off the pads through midwicket"
"more good use of the crease, he's back on leg stump which opens up the off and he drives to deep cover"

"full again, outside off, driven back to the bowler"
"round the wicket, short of a length outside off, driven square through point"

"touch fuller, at off stump, defended with an open face to point"

gets forward and plays a strong bottom-handed drive down to long-on
"he plays back, exposes all his stumps, drives through the covers"
uses his feet then clips off his pads to deep midwicket

"full at off stump, driven to the left of mid-off"
"short outside off, cracked off the back foot through the covers"
"short of a length, defended off the back foot"
throws his hands through a square cut this time but picks out backward point
"and now he's beaten, aiming to play square again, ball didn't quite bounce as he expected...played over the top of it"

"full and straight, whipped to deep midwicket"
"short outside off, placed wide of deep cover this time which allows a second"
flicks a straight delivery to square leg
"full outside off, driven down the ground"
"short outside off, driven behind square but the sweeper can get round the boundary"
"full outside off, Morgan misses his drive and has to make sure he doesn't overbalance out of his crease"
dabbed to the right of short third man
"round the wicket, dragged down short, Root whips it off the back foot to deep midwicket"
shuffles back in the crease and nudges round the corner on the leg side
"brings out some invention, plays a deft reverse dab that almost went straight over O'Brien's head and runs away to the third man rope"
"more conventionally back in the crease, driven to the covers where Stirling makes a good save"
"angled into the left hander from round the wicket, flicked to deep square"
flicks a straight delivery to midwicket
"fuller, pushed to mid-on"
"good stuff, full and straight, can only push it back to the bowler"
tries to manufacture some width but can only pick out point
"ah, spoils the over...short and wide, Root square drives it powerfully through point. O'Brien just turns and takes his sweater from the umpire"
full and punched down to long-on
flicked to deep midwicket
"short outside off stump, finds point"
"full, he comes forward and drives to the cover sweeper"
nudged off the pads to deep midwicket and Root wins the race to fifty...off 57 balls
taken from outside off into square leg and there's Morgan's fifty as well - 49 balls for the skipper
"full at the stumps, pushed to cover"
"back of a length, driven to long-on"
"full and straight, eased to long-on"
"a slower ball, a yorker, takes the toe end of Morgan's bat"

angled to short third man
"full from round the wicket, clipped to midwicket"
"outside off this time, a 64-mph slower ball, driven sweetly but straight to cover"

opens the face and runs a length ball to third man

worked down to long-on
"this nearly gets under his bat! Was short, Morgan went back for the pull, the ball didn't bounce and it takes a bottom edge"
flicked into the deep
"threads this through the off side, tossed wider outside off, and he sends it between cover and mid-off having advanced down the pitch"
and now this is short and hammered through the leg side as he rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket
tucked off his body to long leg
"back of a length, swivels on another pull and it whistles to deep square leg"
"straighter from round the wicket, punched to midwicket"
"fuller, angles in, pushed to cover"
"uses his feet, gives himself room to go through the off side but mistimes his shot and it dribbles to cover"
"back of a length, nudged to long-on...good over from McCarthy"
"width outside off, cut to deep cover"
"that's lovely placement from Root, he moved fractionally to leg stump to give himself some room and then back cuts wide of backward point"
"full on the pads, flicked to deep square leg"
pushed to the bowler
"he's had enough of tapping it around and lofts a full ball over mid-off...came off near the bottom of the bat, more comfortably went over the fielder"
"back-to-back boundaries, a short ball outside off which sits up...Morgan rolls his wrists to keep it down and deep midwicket can't get across"
shortish outside off and steered through backward point for a couple
"on the stumps, tailing and Root this time clips through midwicket for another brace"
stays back in the crease and taps one back past the bowler to long-on
"dug in short and it gets up quite high, above shoulder height and Morgan has to leap to tennis swat a single through square leg"
"length ball, moves across on off to tap the ball away"
"touch short, Root swivels and scoops it out towards deep square leg on the bounce - and that's the England 200 up. Root and Morgan continuing to match each other stride for stride"
"big shout for lbw, that looked close... Tim Robinson not interested! Chase was on target first up, seeming to tail in late, no inside edge but may have been sneaking down"
"skips out and launches the ball... straight to mid-off! Root departs trying to lift the tempo, solid connection on the shot but didn't get enough elevation and he ended up drilling it to the man on the edge of the ring"
"short of a length outside off, YJB shows it a straight bat"
"fuller, gets across on off and drives, Chase fields by his boots in his follow through"
"dug in, 80mph and tucked off the body down towards midwicket"
"short of a length and worked down square of midwicket for a single - just one off the over, and a breakthrough for Chase to end England's 140-run third-wicket stand"
"comes across and stabs the ball into the coverfs on the top of the bounce, they thought about one but it's good fielding from Stirling"

short of a length and tucked towards square leg from the crease
pitched up and nudged fine of mid-on for one
"length ball, angled across the left-hander, who drives off the toe of the bat and Murtagh fields"

"sliding down the leg side, dangerous with the keeper up"
"round the wicket, offcutter punched to cover from the crease"
"wicket-to-wicket, comes across and defends"
"length, a touch wide but again Morgan can't get it through pushing square"
"drops back and cuts at a slightly shorter ball, squeezed behind point and Morgan immediately wants two"
"full, slightly floaty in the channel, bunted through the covers coming forwards"
"length ball sliding on to the pads, 73mph and Bairstow whips it through backward square, legs pumping as he comes back for two"
"strikes first ball, Morgan dinking to extra cover! The change works and again McCarthy gets a wicket in his first over... Like Root, Morgan was looking to get on with things, he made a bit of room but this was well bowled, a cutter giving him less pace to work with and he sliced it to the right of Joyce, who plunged forward to hold a good catch"
"comes walking down the wicket straight away, worked down into the leg side"
"back of a length from McCarthy, again Billings tucks to the on side and midwicket fields"
"full and wide of the stumps, another slower ball, Billings jams down and squirts it to point"
"in the channel, steps out and punches a single through cover to get off the mark"
short and there's room for Bairstow to swing the arms through a clunky chop to deep point
flighted but drifting down the leg side as Bairstow aims a punishing sweep
"tossed up and straightening, this time hitting the pad as YJB sweeps over the top of it, he has a guilty look as he stays down looking at the umpire, Tim Robinson, but he's not giving it and they run the leg bye. Maybe just outside off?"
"Billings is hit on the pads as Dockrell slides the ball on, that was definitely heading down"
fired in on the stumps and Billings nudges one down the ground
"Dockrell is attacking the stumps here, Bairstow wafts at it and gets a thick inside edge"
angled in on the pads and clipped in front of deep midwicket for a couple
"flighted, on leg stump, this time YJB connects with the sweep but it skims to backward square leg on the bounce and there's no run - good return from Dockrell, England just stuttering a touch after the loss of two set batsmen"
"good length, coming back in up the slope, hits Billings on the thigh as he tries to come down"
"woof, that's a corking shot, not overly full but Billings makes room and rifles a crisp drive past extra cover for his first boundary"
"angled in on the stumps, worked back down the ground through mid-on"
"touch short, 80mph outside off, tapped towards point"
"short and wide, begging to be hit... but Bairstow spanks it straight to backward point"
full in the slot and clumped down the ground for one more
floated up full on the stumps and YJB again sends his sweep to backward square leg
uses his feet this time but the ball skids on and hits the pads as he flicks across the line
"tossed up and clipped square from back in the crease, head down and charging back for two"
"pushed through flat on off, again he goes back and steers behind square on the off side from in front of the stumps"
skips down the pitch... but Billings holes out! Wasn't quite the full-blooded mow that shot required to land it in the pavilion - more of a bottom-handed flip that he was looking to hit squarer - and KOB takes a smart running catch to continue Ireland's resurgence
on the stumps and nurdled for a single to leg
"shortish and blocked down into the covers, they steal the single"
"length ball, worked away through the leg side for one"
on the stumps and tapped down
slightest bit of width and Rashid opens the face to glide the ball very fine and beat third man for four
length ball in the channel and Rashid steers this one wider for a single
"another boundary, welcome runs for England, bit of width on offer and YJB glides it behind backward point for four more"
tossed up on the stumps and flicked around the corner to short fine leg
"powerful wrists from Bairstow, again he takes advantage of a slightly wide line and cracks a cut to the boundary"
angled in and worked off the pads for one
"tossed up on middle and leg, Rashid closes the face and flicks one more"
"flighted, outside the line of off, punched through the covers on the back foot"
Rashid nudges another single into a leg-side gap to bring up the 250 for England
"full outside off, Rashid jabs down on it and picks up a couple through point"
"full and straight and flicked nonchalantly through backward square leg, wristy magnificence and it bisects two men on the rope for four more"
"slower ball, Rashid runs this down to third man"
"goes full, not quite the yorker, Bairstow clubs it back past the bowler but long-on cuts it off"
"slower ball in the channel, Bairstow squeezes it through cover point"
"pitched up and Rashid scoops high over the infield towards deep extra cover, placed it safely and they get back for two"
"short ball, over the stumps, stays back and paddles a pull through backward square"
"length ball in the channel, beats the bat as Rashid hangs back and fiddles at it"
"full outside off, Rashid's strong bottom hand comes through as he punches one through point"
"full and sliding on to the pads at 83mph, Bairstow flicks across the line and misses but they run the leg bye towards gully"
"well bowled, deceives him with a slower ball, something of a legcutter and Rashid plays over it"
"dug in and clattered over midwicket on the pull, good connection but there's protection out there and they have to settle for a couple, Rashid somewhat unnecessarily throwing himself for the line in advance of the throw arriving"
"on the stumps, big swing from Bairstow, heaves over midwicket, just a single"
"wicket-to-wicket, whipped across the line for one more"
"full and wide and Bairstow throws the hands, slices the ball up into the air behind point but it lands safely and they get a couple"
"slower ball, full and squeezed out through the covers, again they run hard for the second"
"another cutter from Murtagh, one hand off the bat from YJB as he slugs to leg, seemed to have been defeated in the air but it pings out of the middle and beats the valiant dive of deep midwicket on the rope"
length outside off and Bairstow swipes at it and gets a bottom edge through to the keeper on the bounce
"keeper up to the stumps, slower ball outside off, Rashid punches it through cover point to the sweeper"
"fractionally overpitched and blasted through the covers, a brutal swing from Bairstow and that four brings up the fifty stand from just 33 balls"
"goes back and heaves into the leg side, will this clear deep midwicket... not quite! Dockrell leaps to take the catch just in front of the rope but he can't prevent himself tumbling out of bounds and there is no one nearby to finish it off after he tosses the ball back in. Super effort, though, and saved three runs"
"full on the stumps and Rashid whips it away through midwicket, there's a decent sliding effort to stop four... but the TV umpire adjudges the fielder had his foot touching the boundary"
"high elbow, full follow through, Rashid larrups four more through the covers! And they said he was too high in the order!"
"takes the pace off outside off, Rashid attempts a sort of mistimed pancake flip and lands it short of backward point as they scamper one"
"fullish, bunted through mid-off coming forwards"
"slower ball, aiming for the tramlines, the bowler is a bit unlucky here - although it would have been close to a wide if Bairstow had missed - a thick bottom edge sending the ball wide of NOB for four, bringing up a 38-ball fifty for YJB"
"well bowled, fires in the wide yorker this time and Bairstow fails to connect"
wallop! Touch full on the stumps and YJB belts him back over long-on for a juicy maximum
"full pace in the channel, looks to flay over cover but fails to connect this time"
in the stands again! Just a shimmy on to off stump and he takes a full delivery and heaves it over deep square leg. This is turning into a fair old knock from YJB
"length ball on off, heaved over midwicket and they comes back for two"
"comes forward, this is a flat-batted swat from Rashid but he manages to clear mid-on and they ball scuttles away for four more"
"short and paddled to leg, kisses the top edge - and O'Brien snaffles it! Think that might have been a slower-ball bouncer and it does for Rashid, but not after a lickety-split 39 from 25 to dash Ireland's hopes of keeping the target below 300"
full and dug out back down the ground for one to long-off
"length ball, this is like giving Bairstow range-hitting practice and he shows what he can do with a murderous heave over wide long-on"
finishes with another boundary! Goes for the blockhole but Bairstow insouciantly sends it skittering away through square leg with a flick of the wrists. Phew!

"terrific shot, drives on the up through a length delivery and sends it through the covers"
"hammered! Willey goes shorter and straight, Stirling isn't messing around and crunches it through midwicket"

"fuller, straighter, worked into square leg"
"better ball, good length at off stump, defended"
"ends the over much better than he started, full at off stump, played to covers"
"straight, 90mph, defended"
"another cracking drive, onto the front foot and drills it through the covers with a punchy shot"
"and again! The challenge is being laid down. Wood goes fuller, Stirling sends it speeding wide of mid-off. Top-notch timing"
"pulls the length back a touch, defended to the covers...91mph"
"a short ball, 88mph, he goes for the pull and gets taken on the hip, the ball rebounds to backward point"
nudges a straight delivery to the left of mid-on for a scampered run
"and there's some swing...that will perk him up. Just back of a length, nibbles away to beat Joyce's flat-foot poke"
"full outside off, nice shape away from the left hander, left alone"
"back of a length, takes a thick inside edge to the leg side"
"comes round the wicket, full, angling in at off stump, defended a little awkwardly...cramping him for room"

"round the wicket, back of a length at 88mph, Porterfield works a single into the leg side"
"stuck on the crease, struck on the pads... given! Looked a touch leg side but Balbirne elects not to review it, so Plunkett picks up a wicket and Ireland are now three down. He was quite a way back and that is probably what convinced Paul Reiffel"

this time he connects with a pull out to deep square
