"gets a good stride forward to defend, the ball curves back in late to roll back to the bowler off the inside edge"
"appeal for lbw, may have been struck a tad too high as it curved in from middle. Possibly saved by an inside edge too. Dhoni wasn't too convinced, Shardul went up immediately. In the end, they don't bother going for a review. <b> Replays suggest no inside edge, ball would've hit leg </b>"

driven to mid off for a quick single
"angles one across, Dhawan isn't fully committed forward, manages to get this behind point"
"he's hit this straight to backward point, good catch because the ball was travelling. This was bowled full, it swung away late from the fourth stump and Hales only managed to slice this. Got this off the bottom, the bat face turned in his hands. Got the impression he was looking to hit it too hard. Chahar's impressive run in the IPL continues. Back from injury and among the wickets immediately."
"beaten! Late movement from length, looked to steer behind point. Late on the stroke"

"too much width outside off, smeared into the gap at sweeper cover, Willey does the mopping up"

"right into the blockhole, squeezed wide of cover"
steps out and punches this on the up to long off
"oh, dear. He's scooped this straight to short fine. Dhawan tries to be too cute, gives away his intentions much before Bravo delivered, so he bowls a cutter at length on middle. No pace to work with and he hits it straight to Harbhajan even as <strong>thick rain clouds gather over the MCA Stadium </strong> from the east. They look ominous too."
"sensational catch from Bravo. He has removed two set batsmen in two balls. Full and wide from Thakur, Williamson drives with an open face, over short third man, but from deep point Bravo runs to his left, goes about 20 metres, and takes this low to his left with both hands"
"short of a length, outside off, punched to deep cover for one"
driven to long-on for another single. CSK breathing easy momentarily
"short of a length again, driven to deep cover for another single"

"wide down the leg side, Bravo trying to go behind him but going too far with the angle"
"shuffles too far across, Bravo pings him right in front with a full ball. He has kept CSK into the game with two wickets and a catch now. Oh hang on. This is interesting. Seemed like a review in hope than in conviction but the ball is shown to be missing the leg stump by the ball projection. This ball didn't have much to travel but the tech ology shows Hooda is not out"

"knuckle ball, and Pnadey is out. He had to go really. Saw a length ball, looked to deposit it into the stands, but ended up getting too under it skied it to long-off. CSK doing well in the last two-three overs"
"full and fast, beats his drive, but it is too wide and called"
and another wide. Going for those wide yorkers
"Hooda moves across to another full and wide ball, and strikes it clean over long-off. This one is not executed well either. The two previous ones were too wide, this one too close to Hooda"

"on a length, gets away with just a single as Shakib manages to hit this only as far as point"
"full, just outside off, Shakib drives it to long-off to hand it over to Hooda"
"down the wicket, expecting the slower one. Bravo slips in the quicker one, and follows him too. A cramped-up Hooda gets just the single to long-on"
"not great bowling. On a length, on the pads, with square leg and fine leg inside the circle. Shakib plays the pick-up over square leg"
"yorker, under his bat, hits his pad. Might just have pitched outside leg. This is a bluff because he has three fielders in the circle behind square on the off side. Shakib is expecting something outside off but gets a straight yorker"
"and now the one outside off. Slower ball, offcutter, beats Shakib's attempt to cut it"
"full and straight, stock pace, mis-hit tolong-on, gives Hooda enough time to come back for the second"
"floats this full on off, Watson punches this into the cover region to get off the mark with a couple"

"poor. Slower ball gone wrong, slides this down leg, Watson nonchalantly gets down on one knee and sweeps him over the fine leg boundary"
"short, and this is even bigger. Muscled over deep midwicket! This is Watson unleashed. Sandeep can't afford to bowl that length, he needs to be much, much fuller."

"back of a length on off, cramps Rayudu for room. He dares to pull and ends up splicing it over midwicket for four"
"short and outside off, Rayudu clears his front leg and skies a pull. Hales moves in as opposed to hanging at the edge of the boundary. Rayudu clears Hales and lifts the ball into Sunrisers' dug out"
