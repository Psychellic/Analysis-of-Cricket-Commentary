dragged down short but it's another dot as Watson pulls to square leg without much timing
"back of a length at the stumps, worked backward of square as he closes the face"
"short of a length, he heaves across the line, the bat twists in his hand and he mistimes towards midwicket"
"<b>hammered down the ground</b> as du Plessis gets his boundary away. Took a skip down the pitch, gave himself a touch of room, and drove on the up straight of mid-off"
walked down the pitch again and <b>threads the gap</b> square through the off side as he drives a back-of-a-length delivery. That's very well done
"goes full, a yorker, and it's an excellent delivery which du Plessis jabs down on with the toe end"

"gets the yorker in, all Watson can do is drive it into the off side...pressure building on Watto"
"short of a length, he goes for the pull from a crouched position, comes off the splice but falls short of deep midwicket. Kings XI probably won't mind he's kept the strike"

"length ball at off stump, 134kph, dabbed to backward point with an open face"
"a short delivery, pace off, outside off stump, dragged into the leg side without any timing...took an age to reach him"
"<B>dropped, and nearly an injury!</b> A short-of-a-length delivery is hammered straight back at the bowler, Curran can't get his hands to it and it smacks into his shoulder. Luckily avoided the face. He takes a moment to compose himself but seems okay"
"full and straight, can't get it through the field and nails his drive too well as it reaches mid-off too quickly for a single"

"full at the stumps, clipped along the ground to deep midwicket"

"short outside off, he waits on the back foot and drives to deep cover"
"round the wicket, back of a length, Raina leans back to leg and drives to long-off"

"speared very wide outside off, he'll need to bowl that again"

"over the wicket, back of a length outside off, forced into midwicket and a good piece of fielding prevents the run"
