"round the wicket, very full, very straight, patted to the off side"
"just a hint of turn from a restrictive leg-stump line, clipped square"
"a shuffle to the leg-side from Gunathilaka, opening up his arms, but can't get the flat, quick dart away"
"fired across the left-hander, lovely angle to beat the outside edge"
"<B>whoops!</B> That wasn't quite the accuracy we've come to expect. Way down the leg side, turning even further to beat the keeper, and just about clawed in with a scramble at fine leg"
"tight line once more, defended on the back foot"
flicked to the leg side to get off the mark. A probing over
"a touch of width, and <B>clobbered through point!</B> The extra pace comes onto the bat so sweetly, and Fernando didn't miss out there!"
"tapped with firm timing into the covers, and gathered with a slide"
"cracked down the ground with a roll of the wrists, and a bit of a limp attempt to shy at the stumps from mid-off. Flew so wide of the cut strip..."
"<B>quality biffing!</B> Makes room outside leg, hits cleanly through the line, on the up, whistling to the long-off rope!"
"tighter line, met with a high-elbowed defensive drive, looking to be forceful but staying watchful"
"bashed firmly into the covers, excitement in the crowd as short cover fumbles, but that wasn't a catch. Made decent ground to intercept"
"Imad again, round the wicket, targetting the top of off with minimal room to free the arms. Patted to the off side"
"well bowled, wicket-to-wicket line from round the wicket, drawing a respectful forward defence"
"nudged to the covers, a sharp gather and shy hits the stumps, but good decisive calling from Gunathilaka ensures there's no danger"
"<B>genuine edge, but there's no slip!</B> Driven hard off the back foot, a fat edge eludes Sarfaraz - who had no chance -  and flies to the boundary"
"a bit more flight, pressed into the gap"
"tip and run to the on-side, another well-judged single. Sri Lanka are hustling well, in spite of a tight start from Imad"
"banged in short, a cheeky open-faced jab down to third man to pick off the single"
"short and leg-sided, that's a wasteful bouncer"
"<B>huge appeal but that's fizzed off the pad flap to the rope!</B> Gunathilaka was rocking into a pull, the line was very straight, but was probably zipping over the top of the stumps..."
"attempted scoop, can't connect, but the leg-side line earns the extra run anyway"
"<B>smoked to the rope!</B> He read that short ball to perfection, was feinting to leg before the ball was released, and battered it on the up through point to deepen Hasnain's difficulties..."
"<strong>this is a practical lesson and a half! </strong>Hasnain comes round the wicket, but ends up feeding another sweet drive, the angle into the stumps being met by a measured and powerful punch through long-off"
"short, slightly leg-sided ... but umpire Dar shows mercy"
flinched down to third man. The end of a very leaky first over from the energetic but erratic Hasnain
"outside off, tight lines, doesn't reach Gunathilaka quite when he expects it, as a loose drive flaps into the covers"
"rising into the hip, jabbed to the leg side off the back foot"
"yorker... perfectly well bowled, right into the blockhole, but that's exceptional angling from the batsman, jamming the bat down with an open face, and <strong>poaching a four through third man!</strong>"
"tapped to the off side, the runs keep clattering along"
"slower ball, rising into the thigh as Amir asks an exploratory question. The fifty comes up with a scampered single to point"
"<B>edged, but inches short of Sarfaraz!</B> He made superb ground, low to his right, but the ball just died on him. Good delivery, jagging late and scraping the outside edge of a befuddled bat... but Fernando survives!"
"<B>swept, gloriously through backward square!</B> Down on one knee, picks his gap to perfection"
"<B>flogged with disdain high over midwicket!</B> A half-tracker from Shadab, and he's in all sorts of bother already"
"clipped firmly to the leg side, the runs keep haemorrhaging"
"<B>crumbs, how has he survived that!</B> Shadab grips one on off stump, and it beats leg by the slenderest of whiskers!"
<B>belted on the sweep once more!</B> This is carnage...  backward square is the target once more
"faster and flatter, thumps the pad, and that's the end of the Powerplay. A powerful one at that!"
"tight lines, dabbed to the off side, and that's superb opportunistic running. Fernando more than happy to trust the rampant Gunathilaka with the calling and the scoring!"
"on the back foot, clobbered once more, but doesn't quite connect on the drive to short cover"
clipped off the toes out through midwicket
"on the back foot, nudged off the pads and another single to the cause. 12 off 12 ... quite the support role from Fernando"
"opens the face and pokes to point, looking to go rather finer, I sense, but can't get this one away. A rare dot!"
"width once more, but deep point is well placed to sweep up another bludgeoning back-foot drive"
"tucked off the legs, another single"
"on the back foot, tighter line from Shadab, punched to short cover"
"well bowled, just the beginnings of pressure in this over as Shadab finds his length with a touch of turn"
"leaning forward, tight lines again, clipped to midwicket for another dot"
"<B>spoke too soon, bowled too short!</B> Gunathilaka leans back with glee, batters the length high and mightily over midwicket, and up comes a rampant half-century!"
"flicks to the on-side, another single to keep the strike"
"round the wicket, dipping into the toes, clipped to the on-side"
"pushed onto the back foot, high-elbowed punch to mid-on"
"elegantly driven down to long-off, striding to the pitch with confidence"
"sweet timing, but a fine one-handed pouch at short cover to intercept"
"frustration for Fernando as he rocks back to slap hard down the ground, but can't get past the bowler"
"worked around the front pad, the single will have to suffice for Fernando, who keeps the strike. A fine over in tough circumstances, and he's just tightened things up a touch"
"battered hard into the covers, opening his stance a touch to create an angle, but can't beat the field"
"<strong>skids through low</strong>, but that's pitched outside leg as it crashes into the shin!"
"bottom-handed clobber out to deep point, seizing on the extra hang-time in that delivery... and they rush back for the second. Gunathilaka has to fling himself for the crease to be sure..."
"<B>up goes the finger!</B> But Gunathilaka <B>reviews</B>. He looked less than impressed at the initial call, and it may have pitched on and around leg stump as Gunathilaka unfurled the sweep and missed. It is <B>clipping leg on umpire's call!</B> The verdict stands!"
"keeps a touch low, but kept out with a front-foot poke"
"head over the ball, watchful in defence as he gets the measure of the conditions"
"short, and frankly rubbish... a sluggish long-hop down the leg side, and <strong>swivel-pulled through backward square!</strong>"
"<strong>that's streets better!</strong> Tighter line, thumps the pad as Fernando misses a sweep, and <B>Sarfaraz reviews!</B> It struck him low on the bended knee, and might have been heading for leg stump? We'll soon see ... <B>nope, it's clipping!</B> On we go."
"back of a length, soft-handed defence into the covers"
"well bowled! Round the wicket, bites the deck, leaps past the edge of a tentative poke"
"<strong>arm-ball, thumps the pad,</strong> but sliding down leg! Rajapaksa is not feeling it yet ..."
"width, and a chance to carve his first runs in international cricket, through backward point. That'll help him settle"
"can't get this one away, as Pakistan continue to regroup"
"flashed into the off side, off the back foot. A single will suffice"
"<B>down on one knee, and that's more like it!</B> Swept with power, and lots of bottom hand, lining up the angle round the wicket, and hitting with the turn, over midwicket!"
"tip and run to backward point, and the runs are suddenly back!"
"flicked off the legs to the on-side, and up comes the 100. They are on course for a biggie"
"whoops, gives himself too much room, and can't reach with a cut through point"
"a gallop to the pitch, but still can't quite get there, a drag to the leg side ensues"
"makes room for the flick over the shoulder, exposing the stumps, and <B>picking it off exquisitely! </B> Clean through fine leg"
tapped to the covers
"a massive heave-ho ... nowhere near the ball as it bit and turned with a change of pace, just back of a length"
flicked off the legs for another single
"flogged to point, can't beat the fielder"
"cracked with intent but not a lot of timing, out to deep midwicket"
"on the back foot, hitting the bat hard from round the wicket, and a sharp single to the off side ... very sharp in fact, as the ensuing shy raps him on the elbow as he makes his ground at the non-striker's end!"
"<strong>a high full-toss, and Fernando muffs his slog!</strong> So badly timed, in fact, he has time to rush back for the second, albeit with a desperate dive"
"short, and slow, pulled inelegantly to the leg side"
"on the back foot again, sharp pace and tight lines, poked to the off side"
"a touch of width, <strong>a wild slap through third man! </strong> They all count, a fat spiralling leading edge, and it travels too fast for the fielder to cut it off!"
"outside off, can't connect with a woolly swipe to nothing"
"firmly pumped down the ground, meeting Amir on a good length with a straight-lined waft of the bat"
"short, and pulled firmly to deep midwicket. Another good connection, if not perfectly placed"
"a bottom-handed flog to mid-off, and <B>Shadab's shy is pinpoint!</B> Fernando set off for an instinctive single, but was never at the races as the ball reached the fielder too quickly, and the fielder reached the stumps with equal speed! A decent innings, never really got up to full speed. But he's given his side the platform to have a real go now"
"<B>pulled with power and placement!</B> Picked the length early and hit with the angle, round the corner and past the despairing deep backward square"
"picked up well once more, a slower ball, clobbered uppishly to deep midwicket"
"stabbed to short cover, and Sarfaraz is livid that there was a run available there. Sri Lanka remain sparky between the wickets"
"<B>oof, that's utterly pummelled over long-off!</B> Slower ball, in the slot, Rajapaksa cleared the front leg and mowed through the line with shoulders rotating sweetly through the stroke"
"back of a length, chopped down to third man, this is an impressive first bow from the new boy"
"too short, and pulled to deep midwicket"
"short, and well bowled, within the limits according to the square leg umpire... hmm ... not so sure, but it'll do!"
"<B>perfect yorker!</B> It was going to take a special delivery to end an increasingly special innings, round the wicket, roaring into the toes, and up goes the finger as Rajapaksa fails to get his bat down in time. Still, he's made a fine first impression"
"very full length, firmly pumped back down the track, half a hand to take the pace off"
"aiming for the yorker once more, stabbed to cover, a direct hit would have been very close indeed!"
"a wild swipe across the line, a steepling top-edge ... but <B>short of third man!</B>"
"<B>that's one of those sixes that you call on sound alone!</B> Banjaxed out of the blockhole, high and raucous into the night sky, and over the cow corner rope!"
"<B>and so's that!</B> Faheem drags his length back, and the skipper latches onto it with disdain! Rocking back, pulled off the front foot, high into the midwicket stands!"
"full length but a change of pace, Shanaka angles his bat into a defensive steer and picks off the single to third man"
"well bowled, ghosting past the outside edge, flirting with the tramlines as the ball bends away from the right-hander"
"charging to the pitch, Amir saw him coming and cramped him for room, thumping his pads and settling for the leg-bye"
"dabbed to the off side, keeping the senior man on strike as much as possible"
"down on one knee, looking to paddle over the head of short fine leg, but he can't get enough bat on this one"
"<strong>huge appeal for caught behind </strong>after an extraordinary passage of play! Pakistan <B>review</B> after a game of cat and mouse from batsman and bowler, Jayasuriya was back on his stumps, legs splayed and torso presented to the bowler like a really bad attempt to play French cricket. He tried to flick the ball over his shoulder, but there's no spike on Snicko. Not out!"
"right up to the blockhole, you can't get those ones away. Well bowled from Amir"
"<B>smashed out to deep long-on, but he's not got hold of this!</B> A flog through the line once more, and there's a collision as Umar Akmal lines up the catch! He's clung on in the end, but that could have been very nasty indeed... instead it's a timely wicket!"
"cramped for room from round the wicket, and <B>it's two wickets in two balls!</B> A flaccid flapped slog into the covers, comes off the splice and lobs to Shehzad ... suddenly 180 seems a long way away!"
"outside off, and through to the keeper ..."
"opens the face, pushed to the off side"
"flicked off the toes, to deep midwicket"
"<strong>flapped up and over mid-off!</strong> That was improbably well timed, as de Silva rocked back, punched with oodles of bottom hand back through the line, and picked off a vital boundary!"
"crashed hard through point, hitting with the angle across the right-hander"
"fine leg is up, as Amir aims full, tempting the batsman to improvise. He can't get the shot away"
"<strong>clangs the visor!</strong> No concerns from the batsman, as Amir speared in a bouncer that followed the batsman's attempt to swing into a pull"
"solid connection on the drill to deep cover, but Amir's bowling to his field well here"
"yorker, well bowled, right up to the toes, and forced out to the leg side with a bottom-handed wipe"
"yorker once more, that is a superb final over, as Pakistan regroup well to keep Sri Lanka to 165 for 5."
"...and he finds some swing right away. Full and swerving away outside off, no shot"
"back of a length and holds its line outside off, punched up to extra-cover"
"short, wide, cracked away in front of square on the off side for four. Babar reaches out for the ball and cuts it strongly between point and covers"
"back of a length and straight, tucked straight to short fine leg"
"dipping full-toss outside off, Babar waits for it to arrive and picks it away through the vacant spaces at midwicket. Sandakan runs across to his left and boots the ball into play. <strong>Snazzy footwork in the outfield from Sandakan</strong>"
"good length and nibbling away outside off, ignored by the comeback man Shehzad"
"on a length and outside off, run away to point"
"shorter and outside off, Babar is early into his back-foot punch <strong>winds up chipping it over point</strong>"
"back of a length and holds its line outside off, tapped down to mid-off off the front foot"
"Babar! Babar! Babar! Just short of a good length and just a shade outside off, Babar steps across, punches it on the up to the right of mid-on. Shot of the night for me"
"<strong>there's the riposte from Pradeep</strong>! Good length, angling in and straightening away outside off, Babar looks to drive on the up, but Pradeep finds some extra bounce and movement to foil Babar's plans. Nicked off to Banuka the debutant"
"<strong>Umar Akmal bags a golden duck on return</strong>! This looks plumb, and Umar knows it, as he drags himself off the field. Full and angling in, swinging in towards middle, Umar plays all around his front pad and Pradeep traps him. Sri Lanka have separated Umar and Shehzad so very quickly"
"<strong>another lbw appeal, this time from Rajitha</strong>. Not given out by Dar. SL choose to challenge the on-field not-out decision. Good length, slanting in from over the wicket, hits the back thigh, height could be an issue. Ultra Edge confirms that there was no bat involved. And the tracker returns umpire's call. Shehzad just about survives"
"back of a length and angling into the hips, deflected only as far as short fine leg"
"good length and on a fourth-stump line, Sarfaraz plays it back to the bowler"
"tip and run to the covers. Well done, Pakistan"
"shortish and outside off, jabbed away to point"
Shehzad leans back to a length ball outside off and toe-ends it to the covers
"shortish and outside off, flapped to mid-on. Hat-trick averted"
"back of a length and outside off, Sarfaraz rides the bounce and chops it away to deep point"
back of a length and angling into a back-foot punch to the right of mid-on
Sarfaraz taps a length ball in front of mid-on and calls his partner through for a swift single
"short and shoved down the leg side, away from the reach of the batsman's pull, wide called"
"shortish and outside off, Shehzad throws his bat at ball and splices it to the covers"
"think this is the slower ball, on middle, Sarfaraz keeps it out and closes out the over"
"he draws a leading edge, three fielders converge, but the ball drops into no-man's land on the off side. Slower cutter from Udana, Shehzad aims for the leg side and skews it over the off-side infield in the end"
"Chopped on. <strong>Low-key returns for both Umar and Shehzad</strong>. Shortish and outside off from over the stumps, Shehzad, picked ahead of Fakhar, camps on the back foot. This is neither a punch or a cut. He plays a shot that's somewhere in between and drags a thick inside edge back onto the stumps"
"back of a length and outside off, crisply punched on the up to extra-cover"
"shorter and outside off, crunched to extra-cover once again"
"overpitched and just a shade outside off, nicely driven through the line but straight to the man at mid-off"
"crunched again, this time in the gap. On a length and outside off, Ahmed reaches out for the ball and belts it away to the left of extra-cover. All hands, and wrists in that shot"
"lobbed up on off, driven down to long-on"
"skids on outside off, forced off the back foot to the left of cover"
"flighted and outside off, Sarfaraz swings for the hills, and sends an inside edge to square leg"
"mighty full on off, Sarfaraz can't get underneath the length, stabbed to mid-on"
"looks like a googly, slides back in, Sarfaraz goes on the back foot, taps to cover, and races across to the other end. A direct hit at the striker's end could have had Ahmed"
"slider on middle, 93ks, stabbed off the back foot to square leg."
"flatter and shorter on middle, hauled to long-on off the back foot"
"sliding across off from over the wicket, <strong>fizzes past the outside edge</strong>"
"short stock ball on off stump, Sarfaraz goes on the back foot and drags the ball to long-on"
"<strong>wrong'un, breaks away outside off</strong>, chopped off the back foot through cover-point region"
"dragged down outside off, smeared down to long-on, although not off the middle of the bat"
"stock ball, full and breaks back in, nurdled away to the leg side past the right of the bowler for one"
"full on middle, skewed to long-on off the inside half"
"tossed on middle, the captain manufactures swinging room and goes inside-out over extra-cover"
"flighted and turns away a wee bit outside off, eased through the line to long-off"
"skids towards off stump, whisked away to cover off the front foot for one"
"Sarfraz stretches out, gets outside the line of the stumps, and misses the sweep, weathering the lbw shout from Hasaranga"
"dirty long-hop on middle, begs on its knees to be put away. Iftikhar  obliges and pings it away to the midwicket boundary with a back-foot pull"
"pushed through on middle, tipped to short cover. They take on the fielder's arm for a single. Shanaka throws it to Sandakan, but the bowler wasn't ready to gather the throw.<strong> A run-out chance goes abegging</strong>"
"short on middle, heaved away to the leg side for one"
down the track and driven down to long-on
"fuller and outside off, driven through the line to long-off"
Sarfraz stretches out to meet a full-toss and sweep it just wide of short fine leg. The fielder slides and gets a hand to the ball
"long-hop on middle, Sandakan gets away with that, pulled to deep midwicket"
picked off the pads to long leg
"full and angling into the leg stump, off the pads and rolls behind square on the leg side"

"slower ball, full and plunges on Sarfaraz, he adjusts and taps it to long-on"
"fullish on off, punched on the up to mid-off"
"short at the hips, diverted away through square leg for a brace"
"full and flighted outside off, swept flat and hard to deep midwicket"
"ooooh, what's this? Sandakan aims for the slider and almost lands it on the adjacent pitch. Off-side wide"
"floated up outside off, drilled to short extra cover, bursts through the hands of the fielder"
"<strong>pitches outside leg</strong> and then straightens to thump the pad, not given lbw. <strong>Shanaka calls for a review</strong>."
"darted into the pads, glanced away to square leg for a scampered single"
"<strong>pitches outside leg once again</strong>, dips and hits the pad, beating the batsman on the sweep"
"looped up on middle, Sarfaraz breaks free with an inside-out loft over extra-cover. He makes room and lifts it over the infield"
"dipping full-toss from over the wicket, the batsman does not connect with a sweep and is hit outside leg. <strong>Back-of-the-hand variation from Udana</strong>"
"dug in short and outside off, patted through cover-point"
"<strong>Awful mix-up between the wickets</strong>: sort of encapsulates the chase from Pakistan. Near yorker on off stump, jammed away to mid-off's left. Sarfaraz takes off in search of a quick single, but Iftikhar isn't interested. Both batsman are hustling towards the crease at the striker's end. The throw is to the non-striker's end and Udana flips the bails off. Sarfaraz comes first in this little dash at the striker's end, Iftikhar has to exit"
"short and outside off, slapped away to deep third man"
"back of a length and angling across off, punched to the right of deep third man"
jabbed away to sweeper cover for a single

"wrong'un, short and turns away outside off, chopped to extra-cover"
"Asif ventures down the track, but is nowhere close to the pitch and chips a leading edge to the left of the bowler. Another googly from Sandakan"
dragged from off or just a shade outside to deep square leg
"flighted on middle, reverse-swept only as far as Danushka diving to his right at slip"
"flighted and full on off, driven down to long-off"
"tossed on middle, Asif goes for a mighty slog-sweep and only inside-edges it towards short fine leg"
"bowled'em. Sarfaraz has been put out of his misery. This was coming, wasn't it? He marches down the track, goes for a big heave-ho, and does not make any contact. Hasranga nails the stumps with a straighter one"
punched through the covers
"short and breaks away outside off, punched to point off the back foot"
"short and skids on middle, forced down to long-on off the back foot"
"fuller and just a shade outside off, whipped through the midwicket region"

"slower ball outside off, this full-toss is hauled away to deep midwicket"
"full-toss on leg stump, miscued to square leg and throw is to the non-striker's end. Hits his bat and rolls away to the deep"

"off-stump yorker, dug out"

"slider from Hasaranga, beats the reverse-sweep, hits the pad, and wanders away. Not given out lbw. It looks very tight, but SL have exhausted their review"
"liberally tossed up on off stump, Asif Ali aims to launch it downtown. He does not get hold of it though and winds up slicing it in the air. Danushka, SL's first-innings hero, runs across to his left and grabs the catch"

"shorter and on off, stabbed back to the bowler"
"short and breaks away outside off, swished down to long-off"

"length ball on off, Ashraf wants to slog this out of the Gadaffi Stadium, instead he splices it back to the bowler"
"full on off, driven with an open face to sweeper cover"
"full-toss on the pads, picked up and hit into the lap of Danushka at deep square leg. <strong>Ashraf adds to Pakistan's collapse</strong>. The umpires check for a possible front-foot no-ball, but Pradeep is okay on that count as well. Ashraf has to keep going"
"short and outside off, Shadab swings hard and almost drags it back onto his own stumps"
"pretty full on middle, Shadab sizes it up and scoops it with the bottom hand over mid-off. Some belated cheer for the Lahore fans"
"Amir moves away outside leg, Udana follows him, jabbed into the off side"
"wide yorker, squeezed back to Udana"
"Shadab holes out to Avishka at deep midwicket. Slower short ball outside off, Shadab, having shuffled across off, slogs this <strong>back-of-the-hand variation</strong> to the outfielder"
That is that! <b>A second-string SL side tramples the No.1 T20I team</b>. Udana sews up an emphatic win for the visitors. Amir makes some swinging room and mis-hits another slower ball into the lap of long-off
