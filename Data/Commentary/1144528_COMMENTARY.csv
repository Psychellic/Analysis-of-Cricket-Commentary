"<B>huge appeal from the outset!</B> tailing into the pads, Guptill plays across the line, and this has straightened late! India think for an eternity and <B>review!</B> Is it hitting in line? There's definitely no bat involved ... but it is <B>missing leg stump!</B> Wow..."
"bat on ball this time, tailing in once again but met with a solid block, head over the ball"
"stretching forward to drive more confidently this time, into the covers."
more uncomfortable nip into the pads! Guptill can't line this one up as it flicks off the pad flap and into in the cordon
"<B>good wheels from Bhuvi!</B> Lovely shape through the air, hitting a perfectly presented seam and nipping past the edge... there's pace and movement in this wicket..."

"clonked into the covers, half-forward on an off-stump line, lovely restrictive lines"
"solid line and length, hooping towards the off-stump and blocked with the full face of the bat. Back-to-back maidens!"

"<B>beauty from Bumrah!</B> 140kph lifter, outside off, angling in all the time, climbing off the seam and past an upraised bat, so close to off stump"
"leaning half-forward, so little to work with as Guptill places bat on ball once more"
"<B>edged and gone!</B> Bumrah's cobra-like zip off a tight off-stump line, snags the outside edge of a back-foot flinch, and <B>that's a tremendous take from Kohli at second slip!</B> Utterly flying, and he clings on with a shimmy to his left, high in front of his face"
"<B>welcome to the crease!</B> Fast and fierce, climbing outside off, and left alone with an awkward half-shoulder of the arms"
"wider, and thrashed hard to point, but there's no way through there"
"angled bat, how many times does Williamson use that stroke to alleviate pressure? Waiting for the ball to arrive under his nose, opens the face, and though point does well to intercept with a dive, there's a single to get him off the mark"

"shaping across the left-hander, back of a length, nudged to mid-on"
"propping forward, a dead-batted push into the off side, and that's excellent running to snaffle a non-existent single"

"Another over of insistent accuracy comes to an end, as Nicholls presses another committed block into the covers"

"easing forward, biding his time, feeling the ball on the middle of the bat"
"stabbed hard on the up, out to point, and <strong>Jadeja pounces brilliantly,</strong> low to his left to cut off a probable boundary"
"sure enough, Williamson immediately responds by leaving a ball that he might previously had nurdled, in the channel outside off, back of a length"
"leaning onto the front foot, not entirely middled as cover intercepts another cautious push"
"<B>pulled, but not remotely timed!</B> Not especially short, but Nicholls feels obliged to have a go, a shoulder-of-the-bat lob out to no-man's-land at short square leg"
"outside off, shaping into the right-hander, Williamson hangs back in the crease to dab with an open face to third man"
"<B>edged, but short of the leaping second slip!</B> Might, in fairness, have zipped past the inside edge and come off the inner thigh, which would explain the lack of pace into the cordon. But another buzz-saw of a delivery nonetheless!"
flicked into the gap at square leg
"<B>zinger from Bumrah!</B> That one <I>explodes</I> off the seam, away from the left-hander, and swings late too, from around the wicket, there's just no way to play that!"
"<B>top riposte!</B> Finally, some intent from New Zealand! Slightly fuller from Bumrah, and Nicholls leans forward with a full and committed face, and drills his drive through the covers. A first boundary of the innings after eight overs"
"back of a length, tight line on off stump, half driven back down the pitch as Williamson is momentarily caught in two minds"
"too straight and <B>what a beautifully timed drive!</B> High elbow, clean through the line, and that one gets a police escort as mid-on tracks back but can't do anything but keep pace with the ball as it thuds to the rope"
poked into the off side
"attacking the stumps, a bit of nip back into the pads. Nudged to the leg side from deep in the crease"
"firm in defence, into the off side"
"Hardik swoops round in the covers with a threatening effective pick-up, but that's a well-judged single"

"poking solidly onto the front foot, back down the pitch"
"a touch more width, clobbered with intent but not a lot of power into the gap in the covers"
"firmly into the covers, a good initial run, and it <B>buys an overthrow</B> as a hasty shy spins wide of the stumps and the fielder. New Zealand, all of a sudden, are up and running in this innings"

"short, sharp and <B>beats a hurried pull!</B> Angled across the left-hander, who can't line it up"

"off-stump dart, Williamson plays so very late, dabbing to the right of Rohit at slip"

"dabbed into the off side, stretching forward"
a prod to short cover and this time there's a single
"<B>pumped over the leg side with stiff forearms!</B> Williamson seizes on the width, picking his gap superbly to dump a slog-sweep through the vacant deep midwicket"

"hits the deck harder this time, Neesham is up on his toes to defend"
"finds the gap with a slap through the leg side, still very slim pickings for New Zealand"

"open face once more, another nurdled single to the off side"

"whipped off the toes, a very full-length lbw candidate of a delivery as CDG walked across his stumps for the flick. Nine off Pandya's last over, but he's bowled a canny spell"
"<B>there she goes!</B> That was clean and flat, hard over cow corner! Six from the moment it was picked up from outside off, down on one knee, and Taylor's battling fifty comes up in style! His fiftieth fifty, in addition to 20 hundreds. Tidy..."
"flicked in front of square on the leg side, and finds the gap well"

"walks across the stumps on the sweep, but that's very full and straight, thumps the pad, <strong>and up goes the finger!</strong> Taylor rolls the dice on the <strong>review</strong>... no bat on glove involved ... but the <B>impact is outside off!</B> Wow... big moment... Taylor was already walking!"
"very wide, a toe-ended club into the covers, where Chahal makes good ground with a tumbling intercept"
"tight line on off stump, driven firmly to mid-off to <strong>bring up the 200 ...</strong>"
"<B>suckered by the slower ball!</B> Deceived through the air, his arms were already fully cocked for a massive wipe through the line, so instead he leans back for a cramped dink through third man, but merely feathers an edge to Dhoni. Poor shot, key breakthrough. He had the levers to do damage in the final five"
"tapped to mid-on, and another single to get off the mark"

another (less dramatic) single this time ...tucked to square leg
"flicked off the toes, Latham looks for the second but it's not on. Still, those bonus runs make it more than a run a ball in that over ..."

"a hint of width on a good length, cracked firmly out to deep point, good reassuring connection to open the account for the morning"
"<B>tremendous ball</B> ... wide yorker, Latham tries to run it down to third man but misses"
"swinging gently into the toes on a yorker length, should be just the single to backward square, but Karthik's throw is weak and <B>Latham sprints back for two</B>"
"tapped to the off-side, and another sharp single, running for everything now. A good positive start... but a boundary would be a bonus"
"excellent from Taylor, whipped from a full length past the close fielders in the ring, and the leg-side sweepers have to make a lot of ground to gather. Back they come for another couple."
"full-toss to start, but Latham can't capitalise, flicked to wide mid-on for the single. He'll be disappointed to miss out on a rare loose ball. Tight line to off stump though, which cramped his intentions"
"<strong>another full toss! </strong> He's striving for the yorker but can't nail it this time either. Taylor eases into line, flicks into the gap at midwicket, and back they jog for another two"
"hauled round the corner with an ambitious mow across the line. Backward square gathers, as Taylor doesn't quite pick the slower ball"
"<B>reverses the stance for the ramp to fine leg!</B> Sizing up the anticipated yorker, and getting good bat on it too, gathered inside the rope"
"clipped firmly through square leg, this is good intent from New Zealand, who have looked the livelier of the two teams this morning"
"tight line, slower ball ... clipped to midwicket ... and <B>it's a direct hit!</B> India know they've got their man ... Jadeja's shy is pinpoint, and Taylor is walking before the decision is given. He was turning for the second, an automatic call, and a correct one too, but it took a moment of brilliance in the field to end a fighting innings"
"<B>absolutely belted out through midwicket, and a sensational take from Jadeja!</B> Latham seized on the length, sizing up the agenda-setting six, but Jaddu tracked back, leapt high, plucked it in two hands, and kept his balance inside the rope to make it two wickets in two balls, and both the set men!"
"pushed onto the back foot, poked into the off side"
"short and wide, clobbered out to point, but straight to the sweeper, and a chastened New Zealand settle for the single this time"
"<B>first boundary of the morning!</B> A poor ball from Bhuvi, too much width across the left-hander, and a slower ball too. Santner thrives on sitting back in his crease, and was well placed to smoke it through the covers off the back foot"
"short ball, swatted in front of square with an energetic flurry of limbs"
"<B>crashed mightily into the leg side ... but not mighty enough!</B> Too much elevation on the stroke, not enough length to the longest part of the ground, and Kohli, 20 metres in, swallows the catch ... two wickets in the over, and now it's all down to Santner as he's joined by the tail"
"another full-toss, but on a wide line. Santner is livid with himself for failing to get that away. Boult on strike as mid-on intercepts a slog"
"short and sharp, Boult swings into a wild pull but the ball isn't there anymore"
"attacking the body, swung lustily across the line ... decent connection out to midwicket and <B>Boult wants the second... and gets it</B>.. why not... every run counts"
"length delivery, angled into a firm biff to mid-off. Another single and Santner has the controls..."
"gives himself room, slashes a firm drive, very straight of mid-off, who does well with a committed half-stop on a stretching dive. Back they come for the second though..."
"a swing across the line, an outside edge to short third man... and New Zealand finish on 239 for 8... it's something ..."
"nice and full, swings back in towards off stump, tipped to the right of short cover and left of mid-off. Excellent running from Rohit and Rahul"
"Boult drags his length back, gets it to bend back in once again, picked off the hips through square leg off the back foot"
"banged in shorter and angling across off, Rahul hops and diffuses it to cover"
"good length, swings back in once again, but not sharp movement, Rahul falls over the flick. Off the pad and rolls away in the direction of cover"
"fuller than a good length, angling away from off, swinging away further. Rahul watches it through to Latham"
"good length and attacking the stumps, hint of inswing again for Boult, Rahul covers for the movement and whisks it away to short midwicket"
"good length, angling in towards off, straightening a touch, Rohit defends with an open face, running the ball towards point"
"back of a length and angling into the hips of Rohit, who is standing outside the crease. Glanced off the pads fine of long leg"
"<strong>What a cracker from Matt Henry</strong>. Rohit gone in the second over. Fuller than a good length, angling in towards off stump, straightening away so very late. The tight line teases Rohit into feeling for the ball with his feet rooted to the crease. Rohit has a tendency to fiddle with such balls early in his innings. The first couple of balls simply came in with the angle, but this one curved away. He is squared up and can only feather is behind to Latham"
"bit wider of the crease, angling in full, nips away late to catch the outside edge once again, but this does not carry to slips - two in place"
"back of a length and outside off, Kohli rides the bounce and deflects it past the slips to third man"
"on a length and holds its line outside off, Rahul deploys a solid stride and pats it to cover"
"Boult goes full and hangs it up outside off - finishes wider than a set of stumps outside off - <strong>Kohli is drawn to it like a magnet</strong>, chasing a big drive and missing"
"full again, around off stump, closer to the body, tapped to the covers"
"fullish and slanted in on middle, Kohli checks his flick and lobs it in the air... but to the right of a sparawling Guptill at short midwicket"
"<b>Boult belts out an appeal for lbw, umpire Illingworth raises his finger</b>. Boult flashes a big grin... but wait Kohli has reviewed this. Full again, starts on leg stump and swings back in towards middle. Kohli stretches  across and plays around his front pad. Pinged on the front pad just above the knee-roll. This looks close, and the tracker returns umpire's call on leg stump. Game on like Donkey Kong"
"full and slanting in on middle, Pant defends towards mid-on"
"good length and angling in on middle, spliced into the covers"
"<strong>Rahul nicks off too</strong>. Latham, you beauty, he throws himself to his right and grabs it with both hands in front of Taylor at first slip. Good length, angling in from over the wicket and bending away outside off. Rahul would have been better off had he left it alone. He is caught between leaving and playing. In the end, he does a bit of both and tickles it behind"

"good length, angling across off, swinging back in late against the angle, but Karthik shoulders arms"

"lifter on middle, Karthik rises with it and pats it down onto the pitch"

"on a length and running away outside of with the angle, Karthik presses forward and glides it towards point"
"fuller and angling across off, Karthik stretches out and slices it away between the three-man slip cordon and backward point for four. <strong>He gets off the mark off his 21st ball</strong>"

"back of a length and at the body, Pant shuffles across and works the ball away to short midwicket"
"on a length and angling away outside off, <strong>clattered on the up through the covers</strong>. Driven emphatically by Pant. Just like that two boundaries in four balls"

"good length and slanting in towards off, Karthik jumps across off and blocks it back to the bowler"
"shorter and just a shade outside off, Karthik camps back and fends it off"
"<strong>Carved away in the air...and Neesham pulls off a zinger of a catch</strong> at backward point. He throws himself to his left, the ball dies on him, but he still completes the one-hander and is mobbed by his team-mates. He watched the 2015 World Cup semi-final at the Eden Park grass banks. Here he is pulling off a screaming catch. Bona fide contender for the catch of the tournament. Pitched up and outside off, Karthik drives in the air. Then it's time to #UnleashtheNeesh"

"back of a length on off, punched back to Henry"

"de Grandhomme's lines are proving a touch easy to pick off at the moment, wicket-to-wicket this time, and gently tapped off the legs to mid-on"
fenced leg-side once more. This is proving a productive over in the grander circumstances of India's grind
"round the wicket this time, not a bad idea, closing off the angles to the left-hander, but another nudge down to third man. A productive over for India, as Neesham it seems is given the nod to warm up"

"on a length and slanting away outside off, punched to extra-cover and Jadeja retains strike"
"full on the stumps, shovelled away through midwicket"
"slower bouncer just a shade outside off, <strong>does not carry to Taylor at short fine leg</strong>. Jadeja has a loose flap at it and gets away"
"slower offcutter, short and moves away outside off, Jadeja allows the ball to come on, guides to short third man. Dhoni sends Jadeja back"
"Santner runs in, attacks the catch, but the ball lands in front of him. <b>Is it Jadeja day?</b> Slower ball outside off, tugged across the line, does not carry to Santner. Neesham is furious"
"slower bouncer outside off, Jadeja rides the bounce, rolls his wrists, and pulls to deep square leg"
"full and hung up wide outside off, past the tramline, left alone. Off-side wide. Neesham is aiming for the wide yorker, but this is just too wide"
"shorter and outside off, Dhoni leans back and cuts it away, <strong>Taylor swoops to his right from backward point</strong> and intercepts the ball"
"<strong>off-stump yorker, 145ks,</strong> stabbed out to cover. Top bowling from Ferguson"
"pitched up and outside off, shovelled away with the bottom wrist to the right of sweeper cover. They take on Santner's arm for the double. These two will take on anybody on the second"
"shorter and outside off, Dhoni gets on top of the bounce and forces it away to the left of cover"
"<b>Shot, Sir Jadeja</b>. He clears his front leg, this is on a length on leg stump. Right in Jadeja's wheelhouse. He creates swinging room and launches the slower ball over mid-off inside the circle. Manufactures pace for himself and pumps it for six. Rohit roars in the dressing room. Flat and hard"
"full-toss on middle and leg, clipped to Santner at deep midwicket. Just a single"
"banged in short and outside off, <strong>147ks</strong>, Dhoni simply lets it go. <strong>He's waiting for Boult now</strong>"
"dug in short and outside off from over the wicket, pulled away to wide long-on. They get the double once again"
"off-stump yorker, well bowled, Boult. Squirted away to deep midwicket. He keeps Jadeja to a single"
"back of a length and angling across off, Dhoni leans back and jabs away to the left of Williamson at extra-cover.<strong> Hundred stand off 97 balls</strong>. The two men get together and tap gloves"
"dinked away fine of short third man for four. Cutter from Boult, Jadeja stands at it and gets an outside edge for four. <strong>Sure, looks like it is Jadeja's day</strong>"
"slower short ball outside off, Jadeja waits for it to arrive, then tugs it away to deep square leg"
"lifter, slower variation on middle, half-paddled and half-pulled square of short fine leg"
"back of a length and outside off, glided away square of backward point for one"
"back of a length and slanting away outside off, bounces over Jadeja's cut. Dot"
"shorter and wider than set of stumps outside off, asks Jadeja to reach out. He scythes it straight to backward point"
"back of a length on middle, Dhoni sits back and ticks a single to square leg. He's taking it down to the wire for sure"
"shorter and outside off, looks like an offcutter, angled out to backward point"
"just short of a good length and outside off, coolly bunted to the covers and Dhoni will keep strike. Just five singles off that over from Henry"
"<b>Santner throws himself to his right from deep midwicket</b> and stops this club from Dhoni. Outstanding work in the outfield. Hip-high short ball on middle, swatted away off the back foot"
"mighty full and outside off, stabbed down to long-off for just one"
"pinpoint yorker on middle, jabbed down to long-on. Dhoni won't risk the second. No risks until the last over?"
"slower ball on the leg stump, glanced away through square leg for one"
"It's a skier. Who would you want settling under it with a spot in the final on the line? <strong>Of course, it's Williamson.</strong> On a length and outside off, in the slot to be put away, but Boult gives no pace, rolling his fingers across it. Jadeja gets more height as opposed to distance and Williamson grabs it nonchalantly at long-off"
"slower short ball on middle stump, pulled away. <strong>Southee, the sub, dives to his left</strong> at deep midwicket and cuts it off"
"<b> Whoa, it's 2011 all over again. Flashes of MS Dhoni v Thisara Perera</b>. Banged in short and wide outside off, Dhoni leaps off his feet, goes airborne and scythes a six over backward point. Bam. The hands are still fast. Can the great finisher do it once again?"
"full on the stumps, not a yorker, patted back to the bowler"
"<strong>Guptill, you legend. He runs out another legend</strong>. Rocket direct hit to dismiss Dhoni. Is that that? Dhoni walks back.... for the last time? Gone for 50 off 72 balls. Ferguson goes wide of the crease and bangs a bouncer on middle, tucks him up for room. Dhoni can only flap it away behind square. He chances a second, stretches, and comes up short. Just short. Short by an inch. Guptill tears in, picks up the ball, and nails the stumps with surgical precision. What a moment in the game"
"full-toss outside off, jabbed to the covers"
"back of a length on middle, whipped out to deep midwicket"
"121ks slower dipper from Lockie Ferguson. Suckers Bhuvneshwar and bowls him. Floated in, looks like a back-of-the-hand variation, beats the outside edge and makes a mess of Bhuvneshwar's stumps"
"full and floated down the leg side, tickled away fine of short fine leg. Poor ball first-up"
"back of a length and moves away, slower legcutter, Chahal swings for the hills and edges it but does not carry to Latham behind the stumps"
"<strong>Neesham closes out the game for New Zealand and puts them in the final</strong>. Shortish, another legcutter variation from Neesham. Chahal wants to swing this into the other Old Trafford, but he can only snick it behind. He was given out, Chahal went for the review, but he's gone. India are gone"
