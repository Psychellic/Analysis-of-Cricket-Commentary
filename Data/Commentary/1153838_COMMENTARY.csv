"outstanding from Henry Nicholls! What anticipation. Lakmal runs out of patience as he looks to pull a short ball angling away, but something stops him from doing so fully. But by then its too late so the ball lobs into the leg side. Now, Nicholls starts to take off from short leg as he turns back, but isn't helped by the fact that he is looking upwards to track the trajectory with the helmet on his head. So he now trusts his agility and speed to get him close to the ball. He sprints, gets close to the ball and as it comes down, he puts out a full-length dive to reach it. As he completed the catch, he also ensured the impact of his elbows of the turf wouldn't allow the ball to bobble out. Stunning catch"
