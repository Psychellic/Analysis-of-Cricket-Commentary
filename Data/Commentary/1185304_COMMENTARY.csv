"<strong>leg-side strangle, welcome back Jimmy!</strong> What a filthy way to resume your Test career! Anderson's first ball in Test cricket for five months, a leg-side lollipop half-tracker, no lateral movement whatsover, but Elgar walks inside the line, tries to flick it through backward square, and merely feathers an edge through to the keeper!"
"better line and length to the right hander, full length, late nip away from the upraised bat"
"tight line on the stumps, an angled bat, edged down through the cordon as Anderson finds more shape off the seam, but that's well enough played, going down all the way"
"awkward wobble on a light middle-and-leg line, turned through backward square"
"that's a probing line from Anderson, bending towards off on a full length, demanding respect and a straight bat"
"shoulders arms, through to the keeper"
"full and swinging into the toes, clipped with a flourish behind square"
"<B>gorgeous timing!</B> Just leaning on the full length, pure timing to the fore as the ball hurtles through long-on, so tight to the non-striker's stumps"
"back of a length, rising onto the toes and dabbed out to the off side"
"<B>well bowled!</B> That's Broad's area, a bit of unease around the splice, as Broad gets one to kick from just back of a length and induces a flicker outside off"

"nip from back of a length, awkwardly jabbed into the off side"

jags back into the body as Hamza closes the face on the back foot
"very full, hint of away swing, well left with a big stride on the front foot. Confident judgement"

"outside off, a bouncing bomb, nipping off the deck through to the keeper"
through to the keeper once more
"a touch of width, shaping away on a full length. Markram computes that one in an instant and thinks, 'yep, I'll have some of that!' A wristy wallop, all along the deck!"
"<B>two boundaries in two balls!</B> Out comes the kitchen sink again, as Anderson drags his length back but serves up too much width. A freebie slash over the cordon, looked like it went close to second slip, but the intent took it clear. Good percentage play"
"shaping to cut, ending up driving with violent intent off the back foot as Anderson jags one back into the stroke. Connects well, combination of a good eye and good intent, through the covers"

Another leg-side strangle, albeit this one is a chip to midwicket rather than a feather to the keeper... back of a length, straightening a touch, and just never quite arriving as Markram shaped for a flick through the leg side, and ended up lobbing a low waft to the stooping Bairstow"

"<B>outside off, takes the edge, Broad's in business!</B> That dismissal was set up by the previous ball, just a fraction wider, Faf moved across to cover the line, and paid the price as the ball kissed through to Root once more. All of a sudden, England are swarming"

"edged, but did it carry to slip? Stokes was unsure, <b>the soft signal is not out</b>...

"<b>that's cleverer from Curran!</B> A carbon-copy of the van der Dussen dismissal, opened up by the inswinger, then left dangling outside off by the one that bursts straight across the bows. Another very comfortable take from Root, and once again, SA falter when seemingly well set"
"<b>pounced at midwicket and so nearly a run-out!</B> An insta-call from Vern, as he clipped sweetly off his toes, but that was a supreme one-handed gather at full stretch from, I think, Bairstow. The shy would have been out, but just wide as he rushed to regain his balance"
"round the wicket, very full, punched back down the track"
"leading edge into the covers as this one pops from a good length, Lovely proud seam and extra zip"
"uncomfortably shovelled out to the leg side, just a suspicion of extra wheels from Archer there"
"outside off, and through to the keeper"
tapped to the off side
"rising into the torso, Vern stands his ground and drops the ball at his feet, with short leg lurking"
pressed to mid-off
nudged down to fine leg to bring up the 200
fully into line behind the ball
"<B>drilled through the covers!</B> That's what Philander can do, proper cricketer, solid footwork, good eye, excellent shot selection"
tight in defence as Curran attacks the stumps from round the wicket
"<B>another hopeful appeal from Curran!</b> Shaping in on a leg-stump line, and nails the pad, but England aren't going to make the same mistake again. Missing leg"
beats the outside edge as QDK leans into a cut and misses out... Archer grins ruefully. Another near-miss
fenced into the leg side and a scampered single as the ball balloons off his thigh
rides the bounce and taps a single to backward point
"sharp pace on a tight line, de Kock hops back and across to defend"
"good wheels now from Archer, a sharp lifter at 143kph. de Kock leans back again, looking to use the pace and lift, but can't make contact"
"waiting on the back foot, tapped to square leg for the single"
"full length, wobbling away on an off-stump line, Curran sticks out a hand to intercept a front-foot punch back down the track"
"back and across, flicked to the on-side"
"width, and that one is deemed too wide"
dangling the bat in defence on the front foot. Blocked
tucked into the leg-side
"banged in short, de Kock wants a piece of that, but the ball gets big on his pull and under-edges down into the crease, rather close to the off stump as it happens..."
"firmly onto the front foot again, a good cat-and-mouse contest between two combative cricketers"
"banged in short, outside off, climbing through to the keeper"
"rising on the back foot, pushed to the off side, gathered on one knee at point"
"attempted back-foot steer against the wide one, but an inside-edge bounces down through to the keeper"
short and sharp. Ducked
"lifting off the deck from a full length, and a very tight line. Good leave"
"solidly onto the front foot, fending away the full length"
"more good shape on a tight off-stump line, de Kock closes the face on a clip through the on side"
"short, not outrageously so, and pulled hard through the leg side, but there's a sweeper in position."
"wide line, through to the keeper"
"spears in the yorker from round the wicket, and excellently dug out"
"fully forward, and punched to the off side"
full length into the pads
"wide line, on a very full length from round the wicket. De Kock thinks about dabbing in the direction of those gullies, but wisely thinks better of it"
"tighter angle in towards the stumps, and blocked to the on-side"
"clonked into the leg side, not sure where he was aiming, but it wasn't there..."
"full length, dipping into the toes, and tucked to midwicket"
through to the keeper
"squeezed down to fine leg, not quite where intended, a fat inside edge past the stumps"
"<B>sloshed on the up!</B> Which is a bit like a slash, but with more Christmas spirit. Wide and swinging outside off, and a big fat dollop of bottom hand takes the ball sailing over backward point"
"straighter blade, firmly pressed back down the line of the ball"
pitches outside leg as Broad appeals hopefully for the lbw. Not even close
"fuller length, shaping into the stumps, and de Kock meets it with a supremely confident punch through the line, Anderson at wide mid-on gathers"
fenced onto the on side
"leg-sided, worked off the pads for the single. England are floundering a little for ideas at the moment"
"crunched through point, never shy to climb into width"
<B>this one spits from a good length!</B> Crunches the bicep as it climbs on Big Vern. Intriguing...
"undeterred, firmly forward to counter his next ball"
pushed out to point
"one hand comes off the bat as Vern holds his stance, fending off another awkward nip-backer outside off"
"flashed on the up, takes the edge, past second slip. Unlucky for Anderson who asked some awkward questions in that over"
"outside off, through to the keeper"

"flopped into the off side, lazily wafting through the line"
"solid in defence, QDK keeps on trucking"
"jagging back in off the seam, into the leg side"
"<strong>slapped hard through the line!</strong> All too easy for de Kock, a full delivery, plonked onto a perfect driveable length. No second invite required"
poked out to the off side
whipped off the toes to deep backward square
"through to the keeper on a wide line, keeps a touch low. There's been evidence of two pace in this surface today"

"clipped on the up, out to the leg side"
shoulders arms with a flourish outside off
too wide to bother with that one
"wicket to wicket line, respectful defence"

"pitched up from round the wicket, met with a solid front-foot push"
pitched up and stroked through the covers for one to the sweeper
"short ball, jagging in at Philander who drops back and plays it well"
"touch short and straightening in the channel outside off, left alone"
"shortish on off stump, defended down into the off side"

"tossed up on the stumps, tapped back down the pitch"
"flighted, nice and slow, Philander wants to mow this down the ground but sends it along the floor, Denly gets a hand on it"
"tossed up, outside off and spinning a touch as Philander presses out to defend"
"this bounces a bit more, fended down to the leg side"
"gives it some and again Big Vern frees the arms, but miscues towards midwicket"
"fullish length, shaping away a touch as de Kock presses out to block square"
length on the stumps and worked away through the leg side
"seductive line from Anderson, a honey trap for the batsman, who tries to cop a feel and nearly ends up paying for it"
"back of a length, Philander gets bat on this, slightly outside-edgey as he punches off the back foot but it runs away through gully for four"
"kicking from a length, 131kph and left alone in the channel"
slightly short outside off stump and again Philander hangs back to watch it through
tossed up and swatted down the ground
"floated full outside off, Philander clouts another big-swinging drive along the carpet to long-off"
"pushed through, spinning a touch on off stump, defended"
presses out and taps this back to the bowler
"pushed through, this bounces a bit more on de Kock as he attempted to nudge off his pads"
"flighted, drifting outside off stump, de Kock punches to cover who makes a diving stop"
"full length from over the wicket, defended back down the track"
"pitched up and straightening a touch, 129kph/80mph and blocked coming forwards again"
"length delivery, over the top of off and tapped down into the off side"
"ooh, <b>where's that gone...?</b> Dug in short and Philander ducked, the bat was vertical, though, and he got away with deflecting it off the back down towards fine leg. Could have gone anywhere"
"gottim! <b>Curran gets a nibble</b>, de Kock won't be getting his cheese! Perfect length and just enough movement with the old ball, drew him out and feathered an edge through to the keeper. Top knock from de Kock, but Big Sam tolls with his fourth wicket of the day"
"pitched up, goes for the inswinging yorker, Maharaj manages to dig it out towards fine leg"
"length outside off, seaming away as the batsman hangs back"
"full outside off, driven without much timing and cut off at extra cover"
"short ball, 140kph/87mph and wide of the stumps, no stroke"

"good length around middle and off, Vern defends"
"touch fuller outside off, Philander reaches for it and punches uppishly through the covers for one"
"swinging in viciously, rapped on the pads - <b>given!</b> But there's an immediate <b>review</b> from Maharaj. Inside edge a possibility? Yep, looks like it, clearly chopping the ball into his front pad, so Curran is going to get his five-for chalked off. For now"
"similar line, 132kph/81mph and coming back insistently, like a seagull swooping for your chips, Maharaj manages to gets behind this and block into the off side"
full and straight and clipped off the pads for one
"slightly short of a length, 134kph and veering away from the right-hander as Philander hangs back and shoulders arms"

"finds his line, finds the edge, <b>and Archer finds something from the day!</b> Scooped up low by Stokes and Maharaj will hang around, but the soft signal from the umpires is out. Stuck on the crease and fenced towards second slip, where Stokes grabs it just above the turf. No celebration from Archer, but reward after a wayward outing"
pitched up and stabbed towards point coming forwards
"touch short, room for Philander to fling his bat and chop through the covers"
"over the wicket, pitched up at 135kph/83mph and pushed square on the off side"

"slips in the yorker, 138kph and on the money, but he does well to get his bat down"
"straightens in the channel, clips the outside edge, <b>but flies between slip and gully for four!</b> Squared up nicely but went straight through third slip (although it might not have carried)"

"full outside off, 138kph/86mph and Philander prods at it, comes off the inside half of the bat towards midwicket"
"goes a fraction wide on the crease and spears the ball in, jabbed to the on side"
"length ball, 131kph and sliding down leg"
"<b>through him!</b> Scrambled seam and it wobbles back past the inside edge, a real ghost of a delivery - nothing on it whatsoever"
"pitched up and <b>belted to the cover fence!</b> Big Vern stand-and-delivers four more, by way of a riposte"
"slung down in the channel, left alone"
"bowling over the wicket, hits a good length but the line is slightly wide, no stroke"
"pitched up and Rabada reaches for it, plays a controlled deflection through gully and he picks up four"
"shorter, snaking back in at 132kph/82mph as Rabada jabs down in defence"
"tight lines, jumping to hit the splice, blocked again"
"full outside off, invites the drive... and Rabada accepts, <b>boshing four more through the covers!</b> Sweetly struck and Broad could only get fingertips on it diving to his right at mid-off, took some pace off but not enough to prevent it reaching the rope"
"sliding in with the arm, Philander deflects it behind square on the leg side"
"flung down very wide of the stumps... too wide for Chris Gaffaney's liking, though Broad seems keen to entertain a discussion on the topic"
"pitched up, 139kph/87mph and shaping away, inside the tramlines this time"
fired in straighter and blocked from the crease
"oh, <b>bowled' im!</b> Broad sneaks one through the left-hander's forward defensive to pulverise the off bail. That'll pep England up on their way into the changing rooms. Third wicket of a hard old slog for Broad"
"short and wide to start off, bouncer for the cameras and Nortje ignores it"
"length, holding its line outside off, no stroke offered"
"over the wicket, goes full outside off, Philander punches into the turf towards mid-off"
"pitched up, swinging on off stump, 128kph/79mph and this is steered in front of point for one"
"length ball, nipping away in the channel as Nortje stays back"
"full in the channel, tempts a wild woof from the No. 11, beats the bat by some distance"
"length ball, 134kph/83mph and zipping through, ignored this time"
"round the wicket, pitched up at 138kph/86mph and met with a solid forward defensive"
"short of a length, not all that much width but Philander mashes a cut into the ground and over gully for four"
"length on off, checked into the covers and Philander wants two to keep the strike... Nortje looks momentarily in trouble but the throw to Broad is poor and they get back"
"nibbler in the corridor, <b>finds the edge!</b> That'll be that, then - although Philander belatedly decides to <b>review</b>, probably because they had one left, as much as anything. Clear spike on snickometer and that'll do for England and Broad, who matches Curran by finishing with identical figures of 4-58"
"pitched up, draws the drive, <b>has he nicked it?!</b> YES HE HAS!! For the second time in the match, we have a wicket from the first ball of the innings! Burns <b>reviews</b>, but it was a belated decision. Hang on, has he hit his front pad...? Yes, looks like it was pad, then a gap between ball and bat as it nipped away. So we are denied back-to-back platinum(?) ducks to start the respective first innings. Boo!"
"shortish and seaming away, lavish movement this time and Burns leaves well alone"
"speared towards the cordon again, called for the front foot"
"flung down full and straight at 144kph/89mph, Burns gets slightly tangled up but managed to squirt it away through gully for the first runs. Plus KG has overstepped again. All going on"
"back of a length, <b>145kph/90mph</b> and Burns takes this on the body"
"pitched up, tempting the drive and Burns chase after it again, booming drive but fails to connect"
banged in on a good length and tapped off the pads
"short, 142kph/88mph and rising towards the body, deflected <i>just</i> in front of short leg - but off the hip, I think"
"pitched up and seaming away seductively straight off, 129kph/80mph and Sibley lets it go"
"closer to the stumps, defended coming across"
"good length, just holding its line and snaking through outside off as Sibly shoulders arms"
"similar line, 125kph and shaping away as Sibley plonks his front foot down and leaves"
"ooh, <b>nearly nobbled by a nibbler!</b> Gets him pushing forward at this one, takes the outside edge... but it dies just in front of du Plessis at slip!"
"pitched up and decking away appreciably, left alone once again"
"fired down in the channel, this spits from a length as Burns stays back and drops the hands"
"woof, that's taken off! <b>Spiteful lifter in the corridor</b>, singes Burns outside edge as he commits to the forward defensive"
"dug in at 143kph/88mph, Burns is across and ducking out of the way"
"full, 145kph, swinging and then seaming to clip the bat... <b>but again it scoots low through backward point</b>, effectively a controlled edge for four"
"fullish, pushed into the covers coming forwards"
"back of a length,<b> 146kph/90mph</b> on the hip and Burns tucks it away fine for one"
"and Philander strikes! <b>Peach of a ball on off stump</b>, clips the bottom glove on its way through - and this time Burns doesn't wait for the umpire! That's Big Vern in his element, just a little somethin' somethin' from the surface and his wrist does the rest. That was almost Pythagorean in its mathematical precision"
"teasing length, slightly wide and curling away, Denly leaves it alone"
"ooh, nip-backer, <b>rattles the front pad this time</b>, but Denly had got some bat on it first. This is devilishly tough"
"fuller, sliding on to the pads and clipped in front of square, midwicket tidies up"
"seaming away outside off, Denly gets into line"
"touch back of a length, 129kph/80mph and Denly taps it down defensively from the crease"
"short ball, testing his reactions first up, 141kph/87mph and Sibley manages to punch to down safely on the leg side"
"length in the channel outside off, happy to leave those"
short but wanged down the leg side as Sibley crabs his way across the crease
"banged in back of a length, 145kp/90mph but then staying low through to the keeper"
"length, gets a touch straight, <b>Sibley middles a whip to the midwicket boundary!</b> Right in his wheelhouse"
"snorter, <b>rips him out fending off the back foot!</b> Not given by Paul Reiffel and du Plessis immediately signals for a review... but then Sibley walks! There's a moment of confusion as Denly seemingly suggests he wait for the DRS, but Reiffel then tells him to hop it, since he'd basically admitted he had hit it. And sure enough, snicko quickly reveals a faint tickle from the shoulder of the bat as Sibley mooches back to the dressing room"
lots of 'oohs' and 'aahs' around the bat as Denly defends on to his pads
comes across and defends on off stump
"<b>pinned on the front pad</b>, Philander likes it... Gaffaney shakes his head! No review this time, and I think that was just going over the top"
"in the channel, probing away as Denly comes across on off stump"
"length ball, 126kph/78mph and holding its line, no stroke once again"
"fiendish line, <b>nibbles past the inside edge!</b> Denly dragged out and beaten as he pushes at it defensively"
"back of a length, <b>147kph/91mph</b> in the channel, Root leaves it be"
"<b>another jaffa</b>, beats Root on the outside and misses off stump by half an inch! Hurled down like a javelin and then straightening at the last, misses everything!"
"dug in short now, <b>Root fends it away with his head turned!</b> Managed to get it fine, and picks up his first runs, but he didn't know too much about it"
"does him on the outside again! <b>Root is being shaken back and forth like a dog chew</b>, just can't get his bearings out there"
"pitched up in the channel and Root gets his feet moving, lets this one go"
"back of a length, over off stump and he lines this one up in defence"
"and then the change of pace, immaculate lines from Big Vern, just a hint of movement on off... Denly defends"
"length, 132kph/82mph and Denly shows it a straight bat"
"length, kicking up to hit the shoulder of the bat, edged wide of the diving third slip but he managed to keep it down"
"touch fuller, 128kph/79mph as Denly gets himself forward to meet it with a solid block"
"length in the channel, shaping in and then dancing away coquettishly, Denly shoulders arms"
"nipping away in the channel, Denly is across and leaves - another maiden, <b>Philander still to concede a run today</b>"
"that's better from Root, glides on to the front foot, <b>checked through the covers for four!</b>"
"drags his length back, Root lets it go outside off"
"thumped into the deck at 144kph/89mph and has Root hopping around the crease, smacks him a blow on the thigh"
"sizzling bumper, <b>poinged off the helmet and over the slips!</b> Root was not in the mood to take that on, tortoising his head out of the way and taking the blow right on the top of his lid. That'll necessitate a check from the physio"
"outside off, fourth-stump line, comfortably ignored"
"through to the keeper once more, lovely tight lines and sizzling pace. This is proper Test cricket"
leaning forward on that ever-stump-probing line. Blocked
"outside off this time, still tight enough to demand a decision. Denly decides to leave"
"full, swinging, fended away with every available splinter of bat... literally, as the ball inside-edges into the front pad"
"indecision on a full length once more, kicks off the turf as Denly belatedly elects to leave, and the ball bobbles down into the crease"
"aims a touch straighter this time, looks like the first run off the bat for Philander, but no, it's clipped the pad to backward square"
"leaning forward, blotted to point,<strong> Five maidens out of five!</strong>"
"back of a length, poked onto the leg side with a watchful hop into line"
"inswing on a full length, 87mph this time. And pushed to the on-side once more"
"<B>edged, and just eludes de Kock's wild dive!</B> The slips are so deep - a tribute to Rabada's pace - and hang on, that did <I>just</I> carry to van der Dussen, low at first slip! De Kock flung himself across his eyeline, did that distract him?"
fired down the leg side
"back outside off stump, Denly shoulders arms"
"fenced out to point, anxious times for England!"
"probing away, outside off, no stroke offered"
tucked off the pads to the on side
"good deck-hitting line outside off, hint of swing towards the cordon as Denly leaves alone"
"back of a length, wobble off the seam, this is a good follow-up to Philander. Very Colin de Grandhomme in method so far"
"hitting the seam once more, blocked with a hop into line on the back foot"
"<B>Inside-edge, and so close to the timbers!</B> Uneasy defence from Denly, and the ball wriggled through as he turned in horror ... close!"
<B>sharp start!</B> Rabada-esque pace and carry on a good length outside off. No respite in prospect!
fenced into the covers as Root leans forward to defend
up on the toes to dab an open-faced glide out to point
"<B>sizzling bouncer! </B> More sizzling for the keeper than the batsman to be fair, who takes off vertically to claw it back in"
"outside off, left alone"
"<B>more nasty lift, and a genuine splice through the cordon!</B> Root was committed as the ball got big on him on the back foot, and gully was so nearly in business as the ball fizzed past his diving left hand"
"pounding away on that perfect line and length outside off, tightening the tourniquet as Denly leaves"
a nudge of away movement off the seam as Denly leans forward to block on the front foot to cover
"soft-handed dab through point, picks off a pressure-relieving couple, the first off the bat from the Pavilion End"
worked to the on-side as Pretorius aims a touch fuller
"back of a length, tight lines once more, blocked to the on side"
"dangling the bat on an off-stump line, the end of another very tidy over of probing medium pace. Now then, back to the trial by brimstone at the other end"
"banged in short, but Root opens his face well to work the boundary through the cordon. Wasn't as controlled as his best pickpocketings, but effective enough"
"tight lines, nudged to the on side"
"full length, Root punches to mid-on off the back foot, but can't beat the fielder"
"wafted out to point, latching on a touch of width but can't beat the fielder"
"lifting off the deck, tight lines once more, Root hops into line, dabs the ball to the off side and picks off the quick single"
"big jag into the pads, a hopeful appeal from Nortje, but that was doing far too much. The movement will please him though. Are those cracks opening up?"
"full and straight, plopped on a good length and patted back up the pitch"
"very full once more, hint of outswing as Root clips to the on side"
"stretching onto the front foot, and pushed away"
"solidly into line once more, and blocked again"
"rising on the back foot, punched into the covers"
"jabbed down through third man, more pilfered runs with soft hands and good judgement. That's how Root rolls. Suddenly he's approaching the 20s and looking in"
"<B>lovely timing!</B> It was a poor ball from Nortje, rising into the hip as he lost his radar, but the speed with which that raced through square leg was a tribute to spot-on bat-work"
worked to the on-side
"wafted outside off stump<strong>, that's a loose stroke!</strong> Just a touch of width committing Denly to the stroke, but the ball got big on him as the bat whizzed through"
"<strong>much better stroke!</strong> Over-pitched, and pressed with firm intent through long-on, high elbow, sweet timing, perfect placement"
"very full, angled back into the stumps, pushed into the covers"
"<B>raps the pads as Nortje finds more jag off the seam!</B> But that looked to have done too much again, and there may have been a slice of inside-edge in the mix. Good pace and intent though"
"rising outside off stump, no stroke offered"
leaning forward into the off side
"another confident straight drive, meeting Pretorius's angles with snooker-cushion-style rebounds"
"a touch of wrist on that stroke from Denly, picking off the leg-stump line with more sweet timing through midwicket. Looking confident now"
"lifting outside off, Denly withdraws his bat with a flourish as the ball whizzes by"
"slightly wider line, more comfortably ignored"
"shaping onto the full length, pressed firmly into the covers"
"angling in on a full length, blocked to mid-on"
"<strong>sharp bouncer! </strong>146kph that time, as Root snaps his neck out of harm's way"
"flicked with intent off the toes as Nortje targets the blockhole, but square leg pounces well"
<B>another rapid bouncer!</B> Sailing over Root's shoulder and causing de Kock some problems as he claws the ball down
"creeping forward in defence, as Nortje aims fuller this time. Threatening over"
"round the wicket, leg-stump line with a touch of turn, solidly forward to defend"

"angled into the stumps, and blocked to the on-side"
"short and sharp, Denly ducks once more"
"hops onto the back foot, worked into space in front of square for another single"

"trundles in, hits a length on off at 130kph/80mph, Root jumps across and defends"
"nipping away, like an enthusiastic terrier at your heels, through to the keeper as Root holds his bat inside the line"
"ooh, tricky tricky, this draws a genuine play-and-miss from Root, staying very low on its way through to de Kock"
"makes the early moves down this time, 125kph/78mph and clipped neatly behind square on the leg side to rotate the strike - that's blotted Vern's copybook, too, <b>first runs conceded today</b>"
"length around off stump, Denly shows it a straight blade"
fullish and stroked towards extra cover coming forwards
"short and wide and Root cashes his chips, <b>slapped hard through point!</b> Rode the bounce and kept it down"
straighter line and jabbed into the leg side
"back of a length, Root defends from the crease"
"short outside off, 139kph/87mph and Root drops this behind square, wants one straight away... Denly might have been struggling but the throw missed its mark"

"pitched up, in the slot and <b>Denly times his drive through the covers</b> - played it well, though Rabada might not mind seeing the bat that far away from the eyeline"
"comes down again, attempted fiddle to third man... <b>tickled to the keeper!</b> SA are jubilant, Root punches his bat, he knows he got a scratch on it! Trying to be proactive, but walking down the pitch means <i>fractionally</i> less time to get everything in sync. Big Vern with the big wicket, yet again"

"back of a length, 140kph/87mph and stabbed from the crease towards backward point, well stopped by Maharaj diving low to his right"

"tight around off stump, 126kph and patted back towards extra cover"

pushed towards mid-on coming fowards
"pushed through outside off stump, Stokes comes out to defend"
"<b>humped on to the grass banks!</b> Stokes isn't going to let Maharaj settle, plants the front foot and mullers this leg side for six"

back and across to block to the on-side

"a loopy yorker length, Denly watches well enough and pokes to cover"
"<strong>Huge appeal for an inside-edge to the keeper!</strong> This is confident from South Africa, and they've <B>reviewed</B>. And sure enough there's a spike on Snicko! Denly has to go! Good line once more from Pretorius, he's found something in the deck on that good length outside off, and England's key stand has been broken"

full face of the bat in defence
clipped off the toes to the leg side
"driven on the up, a slight inside-edge to the leg-side once more, Bairstow still playing a touch outside the line of the ball and exposing a bit of a gate"
"<strong>... and straight through the gate it goes!</strong> Deary me ... Bairstow was caught flat-footed on the crease, wafting flaccidly as the ball maybe kept a touch low too. But his set-up had been inviting trouble all over ... and now it's all over!"
"head over the ball, pressed into the covers. That's how to defend the line of the ball."
opens the face for a glide to the off side
"<B>beautiful strike!</B> Pressing the weight into the stroke, hint of outswing on a fourth-stump line, and those spring-loaded wrists do the rest"

"solid in defence, back down the ground"
blocked with purpose into the off side
"switches to round the wicket, finds the edge as Stokes drives hard-handedly, away from his body, and <strong>Nortje bags the priceless scalp of Stokes!</strong> Wow, this match has flicked on a dime... England's wobbly middle order is very wobbly indeed! Discipline and perseverence from the wounded Buffaloes!"
"chiselled off the toes, and gathered at midwicket"

"stands tall on the back foot, and blocked back to the bowler"
firmly crunched into the covers
"head right over the ball in sturdy defence, gathered in the covers"

"opens the face for a glide into the cordon, soft hands to the fore"

"no stroke once more, good probing stuff, keeping a lid on it"
"round the wicket, pings in the bouncer, as Curran whistles into a roundhouse hook, and misses out"

"clipped on the up, through mid-on as Nortje aims a touch fuller"
"very full, nudged into the leg-side"

"goes a touch straighter, scuttling through as Curran brings down the bat in defence"
"bit of width, <b>swiped in front of point for four!</b> Timed that like a Swiss watchmaker, racing away through the covers"
"ooh, four more, but not where he was aiming... pitched up and nibbling a fraction as Curran pushed forward, <b>thick-edged past gully and away!</b> Vernon's into double-figures for runs conceded!"
"full length, punched back down the track"

"fired in straight, dug out to the on side"
"bosh! <b>Creamed through the covers on the up!</b> That was superbly played, though not without risk. England might be willing to take a few of those now"

"banged in short, Curran doesn't have to do much to get under it"
slightly back of a length and defended on off stump
"shortish and worked off the body - <b>brilliantly snaffled at short leg!</b> Curran connected well and sent it downwards, but Hamza was perfectly placed, stayed low and grabbed the ball is it dipped to his left! Rabada hasn't bowled all that well, but he has another"
"slips in the yorker, 140kph/87mph on off stump, Archer gets his bat down in time"
comes across and pushes into the off side
"pitched up in the channel, Buttler defends softly half forward"
"length, 126kph trundling through outside off as the batsman leaves"
"probing on a good length, <b>this one stays low!</b> Think Buttler ended up playing over the top of it"
"and now this one prances through, similar area of the pitch and Buttler stays back, holds his bat inside the line"
"length delivery, 129kph outside off and tapped into the covers"
"banged in, Archer is squared up and prodded towards point from the outer half of the bat"

"bouncy, jouncy, nippy - past the outside edge as Archer dangled his bat in the breeze"
fuller and met with a solid block into the covers
"digs in the bumper, 137kph/84mph and rearing awkwardly, Archer throws up his hands in front of his face, <b>takes a rap on the gloves!</b> But the balls falls safely with short leg watching on"
"<b>brilliance from de Kock!</b> Sharp bounce and a flying outside edge, swallowed with both hands by a vertical Quinton, who lands in front of first slip with a big smile on his face! There'll be no counterattack from Buttler as Philander saws off another England batsman. This is getting grisly"
"shortish on off stump from over the wicket, Broad pokes it away"

length ball outside off and Broad swipes it through the covers for a couple to get off the mark

worked off the body for a single
"round the wicket, banged in short of a length and Broad fences it towards point"
"throat ball, <b>jabbed straight to gully!</b> Doesn't even need the two-card trick today, short and nasty and Broad can only divert it tamely to the waiting Elgar, who'll be out there batting again very shortly"
"hits a length on middle and off, Anderson shows it a straight bat"
shifts his line slightly wider and beats Anderson's flaccid push
good length on off stump and Archer defends
"<b>filleted!</b> Philander hits the top of off stump and England have been shot out again! Archer playing the wrong line, though better batsmen have done the same. Superb, miserly figures of 4 for 16 from 14.2 overs for Big Vern, who's certain to leave SA wanting more. England have probably had their fill"
"hits the pitch, back of a length around middle and off stump, Markram shows it a straight bat"
"similar line, again he waits for it in the crease and defends"
"fuller, 135kph/83mph and Markram is forwards, punched along the ground to mid-on"
slightly wider line and he's able to free his arms for a controlled jab through the covers to get the SA innings up and running
"full and straight, struck on the pads - <b>given!</b> That looked pretty much stone dead, but Markram <b>reviews</b> after a brief chat with his partner. Yep, this is only going one way. Skidded into his front leg at shin height, and Hawk-Eye has it demolishing leg stump! So Anderson strikes in his first over once again"
"length ball, 137kph/85mph and nipping away a fraction as the batsman stays back and leaves"
"round the wicket, length delivery a foot or so outside off, Elgar stays back and leaves well alone"
"pitched up a bit closer to the stumps and Elgar has a fiddle, close to nicking off second ball!"
"back of a length, angled in but not close enough to make him play"
"shortish around off stump, 132kph and Elgar lines it up in defence"
"fuller, Elgar reaches for it, thick-edged but the ball flies low between slip and gully for four! Frustration for Broad, gets Elgar off the pair, too"
full of a length and prodded into the covers coming forward
"back of a length, clipped off the hip down to fine leg"
"again a touch short, 137kph/85mph and worked away off the body"

"good length outside off, 131kph/81mph and he lets this one go"
"<b>corking line from Broad</b>, moving <i>juuuusssst</i> enough away as Elgar plunges forward and is beaten past the outside edge"
"fired down in the channel, wide enough that he can leave it be"
"attacking the stumps this time, 136kph and arrowing in full as Elgar gets across and blocks"
"slightly too straight this time, but clipped straight to Bairstow at midwicket"
comes across on off stump and defends
"full length, 137kph/85mph around the line of off, Hamza prods it square"
slightly shorter and this is dabbed neatly into the covers for a single
"back of a length outside off, Elgar opens the face and runs it towards backward point"
"now he brings one back, struck on the knee roll and then Buttler takes the catch one-handed... England appeal, for lbw, I think. But there's no review, probably not straightening enough to overturn an on-field call"
"woosh, this takes off and seams away as Elgar feels for it in the channel. Still there, though"
"pitched up from over the wicket, Hamza squirts it towards point"
"slightly short outside off, 131kph/81mph and Hamza defends square on the off side"
full on the pads and worked away through square leg for one
"angled in, deflected off the pads, Broad goes up for lbw... but that was heading well down leg"
"short of a length around off stump, 132kph and Hamza defends"
comes across and stabs down into the covers
"floaty half-volley wide of the stumps, Elgar opens the face and <b>scoops the ball up and over point!</b> Deliberately steered into the wide open spaces"
"full and driven, <b>Elgar times this one through the covers!</b> Back-to-back boundaries to start the over"
"dug in short as the batsman comes across on off stump, shoulders arms"
"on the pads this time, 136kph/84mph and Elgar clips it behind square, <b>rattling to the fence for four more!</b> This will improve Anderson's mood no end"
"back of a length outside off, good carry through to the keeper as he gets his hands up and out of the way"
"fuller, 136kph in the channel, Elgar gets forward and leaves well alone"
"pitched up around off stump, Hamza plants the front foot and works to the leg side"
"fourth-stump line, stays back and shows it a straight bat"
"banged in on a length, Hamza blocks into the covers"
"sliding leg side, Hamza flicks at it... <b>another strangle down leg!</b> Reiffel gave it and Hamza didn't linger for long, must have felt a tickle as he attempted to glance off his pads. A gift for England, but they need all the help they can get"
"pitched up, 136kph/84mph and tempting the drive, du Plessis leaves"
"superb line, shaping back and then straightening past du Plessis' propped forward defensive"
"round the wicket, a loosener on a good length and <B>elegantly creamed through long-off!</B> Take that!"
"nip off the seam, inside edge, and a <B>soaring take from Buttler down the leg side!</B> Hello, we've got a game here! Extra oomph in that delivery from Archer, Elgar was committed by the angle back into the stumps, and had no answer as it took off. Buttler made good ground to his right to cling on in both mitts"
"banged in short, 141kph bouncer past the ribcage. Welcome to the contest, vdD!"
"rolls the fingers on a wider line outside off, and this dribbles through to the cordon, reaching Buttler on the second bounce"
"pace and carry this time outside off, as Faf shoulders arms"
"back of a length, wide line again, du Plessis won't be drawn out there"
"back of a length outside off, tapped to cover and Curran's shy thumps the stumps, but they are safely home"
"dead-batted defence under the eyeline, as Broad aims a touch fuller"
tucked to short midwicket as Broad pushes this one up to the pads
"left alone outside off once more, no interest there"
decent carry through to the keeper but that line isn't challenging the stumps. South Africa grateful to leave and breathe
"stump-threatening this time, tailing in towards off, and blocked in the blockhole, aptly enough"
nudged off the legs
"crunched through the covers, capitalising on a touch of width on a full length, and timed right to the edge of the rope"
"lift on a fuller length, poked down into the crease as Faf rises in defence"
"<B>battered through the covers, </B> Faf isn't faffing around here! Every blow extends England's fourth-innings requirement. He's racing to a defendable total"
"back and across, defended in front of the stumps"
"too short, too wide, and <B>smoked on the up through backward point!</B> Impeccable aggression from the skipper, he's sensed the need to counterattack, and is leading from the front!"
"back of a length, a touch of tail back into the right-hander, pressed past Broad at mid-off who has a long chase"
"on the back foot, nudged into the leg side"
"no chasing that one, pushed wider across the batsman"
"tight line and length, hint of swing back into the right-hander, and blocked"
"<B>pushed across the batsman, and a screamer at slip from Stokes!</B> The umpires are taking a look, but the soft signal is out. The same old trick from Curran, threatening to bend it in, but holding the angle... but no ... <B>it's bounced inches short!</B> But is there enough evidence to overturn? Surely... yep, on we go"
hops into line to block to the leg side
worked to the on-side
"fenced back down the track as Archer aims a touch straighter at Faf, taking on his timbers"
"better from Archer already, no width to du Plessis, who rises up on his toes to control the lifter from back of a length"
"fenced into the off side, rising into the stroke"
"<B>pounded dismissively onto the grass banks!</B> Brilliant from du Plessis, he's taking on Archer, challenging him to up his game, because he'll take him to the cleaners if he doesn't! Short, and not quite sharp enough!"
"93mph from Archer there ... more intent already as this one rises into du Plessis's back-foot glide, got big on him but he controlled it down through backward point"
"full and straight in defence, pressed back down the wicket"
"solid on the front foot, pushed back with the angle"
"a bottom-handed clonk of willow, Curran stops it in his followthrough"
"biffed with intent to mid-off, but can't pierce the field"
"attempted drive, inside-edged past the stumps, but never particularly dangerously"
"leaning forward to block once more, Curran getting a decent amount of lateral movement with his bustling approach just enough to force an honest response"
"full length, targetting the pads, clipped in front of square off the back foot"
"banged in short, but doesn't get up, and <B>van der Dussen rolls his wrists on a superb pull</B>, hauling the ball in front of square"
"banged in short again, and <B>this one is sharper!</B> Takes a top edge, but gets away with it, a spliced pull into no-man's land"
"<B>banged in short, and that's the big one!</B> Du Plessis's intent gets the better of him, or rather Archer does, as that was sharp, that was straight, and Curran at backward square was right in position to snaffle a curious pull. Faf was almost down on one knee by the time he made contact. His commitment to aggression gave him no option to bail out"
"thumped into the deck, and Archer has a word in his followthrough as van der Dussen ducks. A lot riding on the debutant now"
"<B>big appeal!</B> Will England review? A sharp lifter outside off, and a flinch at thin air ... Root thinks he heard a noise and wants to review, but Bairstow under the lid isn't so sure, nor is the catcher Buttler. The timer elapses, on we go"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"good line, and good leave, just outside off and tailing back in"
"<strong>snorter from Curran!</strong> He may not be quick, but his bouncer is accurate and really takes off from an awkward skiddy length. Nortje does well to drop his gloves as it rears by"
prodded to cover on the front foot
"round the wicket, and a bit of a loose one from Curran, a wild full toss outside off as he loses his radar"
"better line, tailing into the right hander, who pumps firmly back up the wicket for Curran to grab in his followthrough"
"banged in short, fired down the leg side as vdD barely bothers to break out of his stance"
outside off this time as Archer bends his back on the short ball again
"back of a length, lifting into the splice as vdD blocks to point"
"<B>sizzling lifter!</B> That's an absolute leather-sniffer, kicking savagely towards the upraised gloves, but superbly played as well, watched all the way before whipping the head out of line"
right behind the line once more to defend out to point
"<B>nibble, nibble!</B> A bit of away movement and vdD is temporarily lured into a flinch outside off"
"over the wicket, right up to the blockhole, cautiously poked back whence it came, a slightly open stance from Nortje, mindful of the inswinger"
"pushed across the right-hander, no shot offered this time"
"ploughing a furrow outside off, threatening the inswinger, but this one goes straight on"
"round the wicket now, and banged in short, Nortje flings himself to the deck to get out of harm's way"
"back and across, blocked on the line of leg stump"
"full length, just enough width to free the arms, as Nortje flashes an open-faced drive through third man! He's off the mark, and every run counts!"
"squared up on a fuller length, a 144kph stump-threatener"
"eased in front of square, finds the gap at short midwicket, and <B>there's no-one to cut that off!</B> Full length from Archer, and excellently negotiated from deep in the crease"
hopping across the crease and tucked off the hip to square leg
"banged in short again, chasing the tailender as he retreats to leg"
"well watched once again from Nortje, who retreats from another leg-stump lifter, but blocks it well enough"
"attempted slower ball from Archer, but this one <strong>slips out as a full-toss!</strong> It was the knuckleball and it didn't come off"
"cripes, he's tried it again, and it's slipped again ... and <B>the umpires are coming together!</B> Consecutive beamers are bad news, but I think the attempt at a slower ball was belatedly acknowledged by the umpires ... indeed, the <B>no-ball has been rescinded</B>. A stern talking-to, and on we go. Archer was aghast at the no-ball, he reckoned it had dipped enough and the umpires belatedly agreed"
short and into the hip
"fizzing through to the keeper, back of a length"
"banged in short again, tempting the hook with three men back. Not taking it on"
"outside off, lifting past the outside edge as vdD plays inside the line"
"wide line, tempting the cut, but not at this late stage of the day"
"back of a length, lifting into the hip, blocked into the leg side, and that is <B>stumps</B>"
"length ball outside off, nipping away a touch as Nortje shuffles into line and leaves"
"touch fuller, not coming back enough to make him play"
"length around off stump, Nortje shows it a straight bat"
"tight lines, 133kph/82mph and a hint of inswing as Nortje again props forward in defence"
"bit of zip off the deck this time, shortish and whistling through into Bairstow's gloves as the batsman leaves alone"
"fuller, draws a half-formed push from Nortje, who is beaten past the outside edge"

"shorter, rising in the channel and defended playing back"
"punched back, <b>Rabada throws out a hand in vain</b>... clatters into the stumps at the other end, just out of reach in the bowler's follow through! Would have been a screamer if he'd got to it"
"tossed up from round the wicket, Root is across to defend"
"flighted, Root is forward and pushes this down the ground to long-off"
"over the wicket to Stokes, defended softly coming forwards"
"spin here, turning appreciably past the inside edge as Stokes presses out... Struck on the back leg, but probably outside the line. Encouraging for the spinner, though"

"outswinger on a length, Root prods into the off side"
"fullish on fourth stump, Root is drawn forward and defends"

"beaten! Slightly full of a length, <strong>90mph/145kph</strong>, draws Stokes forward but it flies past his defensive push. Didn't know whether to go forward or back and ended up just dangling his bat in the line"
"length ball, nudged towards mid-on off the back foot"
"length ball, speared down the leg side. Nortje appeals, on his own, for a strangled catch, but I don't think Stokes was anywhere near it"

"length on off stump, nudged back towards the bowler"

"slightly fuller on fourth stump, Bairstow is drawn forward in defence"
"fullish on fourth stump, prodded defensively out to cover"

"back of a length ball on the pads, Root gets across and looks to work it out to long leg. He's <strong>struck on the pad</strong>, and it spills out towards short leg for a single, but is that lbw? Pretorius and Faf both liked it, but it looked a touch high, and perhaps sliding down leg too"

"length ball in the channel, nudged to point off the back foot"
"inswinger, length ball in the off stump channel, and it strikes Root on the pad. Pretorius <strong>goes up confidently</strong>, but Reiffel doesn't like it. Looked like it struck him outside the line, nipped back off the scrambled seam, and height might have been an issue too"

slightly short and this seams extravagantly away past Buttler's flashing blade
"oof, <b>takes this one on the hip</b>, a snorter that jags back at him from a length. Good luck with those"
pitched up straight and Buttler gets a leading edge into the covers as he strives to keep the ball out

"length ball, 141kph/88mph on off stump, Archer dabs it towards point"
banged in short and climbing through to the keeper as Archer ducks
"no, it's a lifter in the channel, <b>and Archer steers it to slip!</b> Good areas to a No. 9 and van der Dussen holds on to his first catch in Tests. Nortje has another, and the levee is about to break"
