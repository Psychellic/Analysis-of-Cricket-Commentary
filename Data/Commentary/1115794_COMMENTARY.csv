"looks to defend back down the pitch, gets a thick inside edge to short midwicket. Hint of inward movement this time for Gabriel"
"this is lovely. Just a touch too full, Raval leans into the drive and simply caresses this past extra cover. As a batsman, it is easy to go into your shell on such surfaces, but Raval saw an opportunity here and cashed in. Was in complete control of the stroke."
"once again, full length and slanting away. There is an open invitation to drive, which Raval doesn't accept as he leaves"
"sublime on-drive, too full and straight from Gabriel, Raval showed the full face of the bat to time this back past the bowler."

"slants a length ball across Latham, who lets it go"
"length around the off stump channel, Latham leaves again. This is closer to the 'uncomfortable' length for the batsman."
"another full delivery outside off, another leave. Once again, this was closer to the stumps. It's a safe option and will work as long as Roach doesn't bring the ball back in"
"thick inside edge down to fine leg. Pokes outside the line of this length ball angling away, could've so easily smashed this back onto his leg stump."
"all balance and class as he essays a terrific off-drive to beat mid-off. Just a gentle push forward, nice, high elbow as he comes down to time that away on the up."
"uppish but just wide of mid-off. This time he was through the drive a touch too early, there were shouts of catch. Didn't quite get to the pitch of the ball, but has luck on his side. Gabriel shouldn't mind that as a bowler."
"length delivery on middle, worked into the gap at midwicket"

"flicks the arm guard on the way through to the keeper. This is a short ball that is angled across Raval, but this is very close to off stump. Raval looks to sway out of the way and drops his wrists on the delivery. <b> Got big on him though </b>"

"looks to induce the edge on the drive by angling this full and across, but Latham is happy to leave. Again"

"squirts this to second slip, but ensured he <b> played this with soft hands. </b>"

"full and angling away, left alone."
"touch full and just outside off, close to that channel where a batsman doesn't want the ball to land, left alone this time"
"pulled, down to deep fine leg. This <b> flew past short square's outstretched hands </b> Shimron Hetmyer the fielder in question. What was noteworthy is he had his eyes trained on the ball at all times, and didn't look to take evasive action, which can be an instinctive reaction for someone that close"
"squeezed into the gap between point and gully. Pokes at this full length delivery, was hanging back in expectation of a short ball. No feet movement, just the hands to the ball as the bat face opens to race away off the thick outside edge."

"looks to drive on the up, bottom hand comes off the grip as the bat swivels in his hand, once again weight not transferring fully forward. Managed to get this away past short cover"

"fullish, angled well across the right-hander, punched firmly into the covers"

"back of a length, angled across outside off, defends back off the outer half of the bat"

shuffles back to one that comes into him and punches into the off side
"flighted and extremely full around off, carved out to the covers"
"fullish on off, presses forward and defends back to the bowler"

"very full ball, drilled back"
"short of a length on off, gets on top of the bounce and tucks it into the midwicket area"

"short of a length outside off, shuffles across and gets on top of the bounce to keep it down"
"length ball on middle and leg, defended back solidly"
Latham perishes to the short ball. This is what West Indies need to do. More of this: bang it in at pace and don't give the batsmen room. Shapes up for a pull but can't really free his arms. Ekes out a top-edge to the wicketkeeper
"starts out with a very full ball that holds its line outside off, left alone"
"length ball, straight as an arrow outside off, left alone"
"fullish, holding its line again, not bothered with"
"length ball, attacking his off-stump, bunted back to the bowler"

"length ball, a tad wider outside off, Williamson waits this time before opening the face to gully"
"fullish outside off, holds its line and Williamson bunts it with a dead straight bat"

"extremely full outside off, drops it down towards mid-off and sprints a single"
"fullish, offers some width outside off, Williamson stretches out and punches into the covers"
"not that sort of a line though. Not really making him reach out. Too close to his off-stump and too full. Williamson just gently caresses it down the ground, to the right of where mid-off would be"
"a low full toss outside off, punched down the ground"
"dipping wide yorker, Williamson jams the bat down and squeezes it out into the off side"
this is no good from Gabriel. Another rank full toss that is punched through long-on this time. They're allowing Williamson to settle in nicely now
make that another one. This one's lower through and Williamson gently pushes it straight down the ground for a single
fulish and angled just enough across Williamson to make him play but he isn't going to be tempted so easily
"on a length this time and wider still, not bothered with"
"fullish, angled across outside off, left alone"
"length ball, slanted across, still no stroke from Williamson"
now he finally plays one. And it takes a shorter length from the bowler to make that happen. Williamson punches it through the left of covers

In the past, he's had a tendency of being bogged down at times, not today. Authoritative and in complete control so far."

"short of good length, angling in on off, tucked to midwicket"
some excitement behind the stumps as Williamson gets hit on the pad. But the bowler does not bother making an appeal. Short of a length and curving in sharply. Would have headed down leg and the height was too much in any case

"short of a length, down the leg side and Williamson lets it go. Now he has overstepped. This is shoddy"

"some more short stuff, Taylor stays in the crease and turns it away to forward short leg"
"again, pushes Taylor back with a short ball and he nudges it away to short leg"
"short ball, Taylor barely has to duck. The height is considerable and there is a call for a no-ball from both the umpires. But it's for the bouncer, I suppose. Three of them this over"

"shortish on off, comfortably negotiated this time as he defends back"
"now there is an appeal for a caught-behind against Raval. This is another leg-sidish delivery. West Indies are convinced and ask for the review. Nope, off the pad. Clearly no bat involved there. The ball grazes the pad and that is the noise West Indies heard"

"short of a length, angled across further this time and the ball drifts wide outside off"
"oh, what a beauty! That's a brute of a delivery from Gabriel. Yet again Raval falls short of a hundred, but jeez, really gotta wonder if there's anything he could have done about this.

"short of good length on middle, bunted towards mid-on"
"short of a length, tucked to midwicket for a single"
"that's a rubbish line to bowl with three slips in place. Back of a length alright but on leg stump, all it does is give the batsman an easy tuck off the hips through midwicket for a brace"

some late movement again but this time it was wide of the batsman to begin with and he plays no stroke
"fuller outside off, now it comes into him a tad late as the ball is drilled back off the inside of the bat"
"ooh, needs to be careful about that. Middles his drive splendidly but the bowler would be interested as he reaches out to a delivery that jags away without getting close to it"
"and follows that up with a freebie. West Indies need to be consistent to keep the pressure on. Fuller ball on the pads, feeding him a single through midwicket"
good ball. On a length and angled across just enough to keep the batsman interested but Nicholls offers no stroke

"width and put away. This was short, wide and he flayed this into the gap behind point. Raced to the boundary. Taylor was struck on the crease because he was expecting possibly a short ball, but just used his hands and lash that away"
bunts this into the off side
defends this length delivery to mid-off
works this off his pads to long leg
"nice timing. Saw the width, leant into the half-volley and creamed this between cover and point"
"too short and he's smashed this to the point boundary at the rate of knots. Rose with the bounce and helped it away. Can't bowl there at 123kph. Need to be at least 20kph quicker, if not more."
"floats this full on off, defended back towards the bowler"
"excellent athleticism from Reifer. Nicholls squeezes this yorker length delivery back, but is wandering outside the crease when the bowler times his jump to stop. Reifer fires a direct hit at the striker's end, <b> Nicholls dives but would've been out with a direct hit. </b>"
"straightens from length on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"too close for the cut. Taylor got away with it in the previous over, not this time. Once again, no feet movement, also got cramped for room. This was banged in short so there's just that little bit of extra bounce for Roach. The healthy edge is pouched on the second attempt by Dowrich as West Indies continue to rise here in Hamilton even as the clouds gather."

"short ball towards the ribcage, Santner fends this to the leg side"
squeezes this yorker-length delivery to cover

"slants a length ball across Nicholls, who leaves"
"in the off stump channel, this is on the fuller side, left alone"
watched through to the keeper again
"saved by an inside edge. This is slanted full on the stumps, shapes to drive. Would've been very close had he not got some bat on it"
"looks to play a Jayasuriya-style whip off his hip, beaten for pace as the ball thuds into the thigh pad off an inside edge"
"floats this full and across the left-hander, who is happy to leave this time"

"full-length outside off, driven to mid-off"
"gets this to lift off the deck from length outside off, left alone"
solid in defence. This is much fuller on middle from wide of the crease
"first Test wicket for Reifer and it is well deserved. Kept plugging away and has been rewarded for his accuracy. Gets this length ball to nip back in off the seam to beat Nicholls' tentative forward push. He's hit on the knee roll. The only reason why the batsman would've reviewed that was to check if it may have been a tad too high, but ball tracking confirms that would've hit middle and leg as it comes back to Rod Tucker's as <b> umpire's call. </b> Big moment. His head was well outside the line of the ball as he tried to defend that"
"bunts this to point, looks for a single but is sent back. The man there swooped in quickly. Good cricket from West Indies"
"nibbles away a length ball outside off, left alone"
"skiddy back of length delivery angling away, defended"

this full delivery veers in late as CDG squeezes this to mid-on
"excellent stop by Cummins, tumbling away to his left at mid-on to stop this subline on-drive"
"oversteps, Santner is hustled for pace as he looks to fend this to the leg side. Manages to hit this uppishly past the outstretched hands of short leg. Have to say Santner got himself into a tangle as he was cramped for room"
"ducks under this short ball, but the no-ball has been called for over-stepping again, and boy <b> it's a massive one </b>"

"back of length delivery angling away, defended with soft hands"
right besides the length as he defends this away-going delivery
"picks the length early and belts this pull over midwicket. Was sitting on the backfoot in anticipation of the short ball, although he got this a little high on the bat which meant he didn't time it as well as he would've liked"

shows the full face of the bat in defence of this length delivery
"change of pace, this is the slow offcutter, defended back down the pitch"

"full on middle and leg, comes forward and clips it out to midwicket"
advances down the ground to meet the pitch and gets underneath a drive to wide long-off
"<b>is that dropped?</b>. That should have been taken. Those are deceptively hard, mind you, but got to take those. De Grandhomme presses forward to a length ball that does not spin into him as much. Gets a feather of an outside edge that does not stick on to the keeper's gloves"
"length ball, cuts in off the seam to hit the high part of the front pad. Missing leg, the angle suggests"

"there's the aggression from Grandhomme. Advances down the ground and clips it. Picks the gap well through midwicket, hit well to the left of the man there"
this one's even better. The connection's better and so is the timing. Comes right down to meet the pitch and heaves it over deep midwicket
Chase tries to lure him with a generously-flighted fuller ball. Dips rapidly and de Grandhomme takes a long stride forward before carting him over extra cover
"length ball, shifts back and punches to the bowler"

"length ball, slanted across and de Grandhomme quietly lets it be"
"good length, shuffles across and defends towards mid-on"

presses forward and pushes out this fuller ball past point
"drives it with hard hands, this time it seems like he intended to hit it hard for a boundary. Finds the gap though cover and point"
shorter length this time and it it is defended to cover
now Santner comes down the track and launches one straight over. New Zealand getting some quick runs now

"length ball, stays in the crease and defends to mid-on"

"fires a length ball quicker through the air, punched to sweeper cover"
"good length ball, pitches outside leg and takes the inside edge of Santner's pad as he cops one on the pad"
"bowled him. Gabriel strikes immediately after the new ball is taken. Santner plays all over this one. It's a length ball, comes on straight enough and Santner plays haphazardly across the line to lose his middle stump. Crucial blow for West Indies. Gives them an opening back into this Test again"
"a bit of a waste of a delivery that one. Good pace, bounce and carry but too wide to make the batsman play"
that's a better delivery. Angles it in towards his off-stump from wide of the crease before the ball straightens and Blundell lets it go through
curves in sharply from a slightly short of a good length. Cuts in off the seam but a tremendous leave from Blundell who knows where his off-stump is
"short of good length, holds its line outside off, left alone"
gets on top of the bounce and punches this into the gap between cover and point
right back into the crease as he bunts this length delivery into the off side.
defends this incoming length delivery solidly
"didn't get hold of this pull, but gets away. This was a big, fat top edge as he looked to fetch this from way outside off. No one at deep square. The boundary is on the shorter side as well and the power of his forearms, even off a mishit, helps it to trickle into the ropes."
"too short and way outside off, left alone"
hangs back inside the crease and he keeps out this full length delivery.
"back of length delivery outside off, this nips away off the seam, left alone"
"short delivery down leg, he swivels back to pull but misses"
gets half a stride in as he defends this short of length delivery back down the pitch

"squared up, right shoulder facing the bowler as he bunts this awkwardly"
doesn't commit himself fully forward as he jabs this with hard hands
"some crafty footwork by Roach to run across to his right as he tries to kick the ball back onto the stumps at the striker's end, but de Grandhomme beats him to the single. Just a gentle little dab into the leg side by Blundell"
"timed superbly, but straight to mid-off"
excellent wrist work as he whips this from off stump to deep square
"right through his defence. This is full, fast and angles back in at length to skid through and beat de Grandhomme's feeble push as this sneaks through the gap between bat and pad after a thin inside edge to crash into the stumps."
right through. This full delivery swung away late to beat the outside edge through to the keeper
squeezes this full delivery into the midwicket region for a quick single
"walloped into the gap at extra cover. Not a half-volley but he's happy to plant forward and drive through the line, neatly executed in the end"
"angles back in, hits the deck and straightens. Blundell's judgment outside off is sound as he lets it go"
"shot of the session. Juicy half-volley on middle and leg and he thumped this down past mid-on. Too easy, quality batsmen won't miss out on such offerings."
"short ball, angled across Wagner who ducks under hurriedly"
"short of a length, looks for a tuck but the ball goes down the leg side and misses the bat"
"short of good length, slanted across outside off, Wagner gets on top of the bounce and drops it into the covers"
"nasty short ball, again Wagner has to hurriedly get out of the line"
"seems like Wagner is going to be in the firing line for the rest of today. Another short ball, he is managing pretty well, though"
now he deals with it even better. It's angled wider of him and he just arches back a little and drops the wrists
"short of good length, holding its line outside off, punches it into the covers"
squares him up with a back of a length delivery. Blundell plays it with really soft hands so the ball goes along the ground between third slip and gully
left alone in the channel outside off
"full and angling in on the pads, tries to flick but the ball drifts in too sharply to hit the pad"
"short ball, drops his wrists and sways out of the line"
"full and bang on middle, Blundell clips it with the angle to midwicket"
"short of length on middle, Wagner gets on top of the bounce and defends back down the pitch"
"gets this length ball to jag away off the deck, Wagner shoulders arms"
"<b> wow, this is simply stunning at gully. </b> This flew off the blade of the bat as Wagner looked to work this through the on side, but the ball swung away late to take a thick edge as Hope threw himself full stretch to his left to pull off a one-handed stunner. You wouldn't have been mistaken into looking towards the third man boundary because the ball had already passed him as he stretched to complete it. What a start for West Indies."
"short of length but way outside off, Southee lets it go"
sways out of the way of this short ball again
"hustles Southee for pace as he digs this one in towards his arm pit, awkwardly defended"
angles back in at length to hit him high on the thigh pad as Blundell looks to work this to the leg side. <b> Beaten for pace </b>
"short of length but sliding down leg, keeper collects. Poor line"
"back of length on off stump, solid in defence this time"
"in that driving length, just outside off, Blundell has a good look at it as he leaves."
"this is right out of the top drawer. Just a touch full, Blundell firmly in control of this straight drive as he eases this past mid-on."
"Chase at mid-on runs gingerly to his right and puts out an awkward dive to take the pace off this flick. This was a length ball angling in, neatly picked away there. What should've been dot ball is two."
"bunts this into the off side, Roach does well to hare to his left to fire a throw at the bowler's end, but doesn't collect the ball cleanly."
turns this length ball gently to the short midwicket region
mistimes this flat-batted pull to short midwicket
"tests him with a bouncer but this is way outside off, he ducks under it"
<strong>leading edge</strong> but this flies over Chase at point. Looked to work this length ball on off behind square
"full and slanting into the pads, clipped to deep square leg"
"looked to nonchalantly pull to over square leg, but this length ball kept angling back in to hit him on the grille of the helmet off a thin edge. In no visible discomfort."
"predictably, he follows up with another bouncer. Southee ducks"
"oversteps, the first of the day. Southee mistimes this pull to deep square. <b> This is another big no-ball. </b> Marginal no-balls understandable but Gabriel has a chronic issue, where he continues to overstep by a long, long way."
"another no-ball, another one for overstepping. Excellent delivery, though. Right into the blockhole on midwicket, squeezed past midwicket. <b> This is the 7th time he's overstepped in this game </b>"
right behind the line of this short of length delivery as he bunts this into the off side
works this full delivery straight to mid-on
hops back and across as he defends this incoming length ball gently
"gentle little dab into the leg side as they scamper a single. No more than a few yards wide of the bowler on his followthrough, but it's a lazy effort from Gabriel. Could've avoided the single had he been alert to the possibility."
gets half a stride in as he defends
"quality stroke. Terrific balance and timing as he hits this back past the bowler on the up. Just a gentle forward push but boy, did it race away off the bat or what"
"length outside off, left alone"
"excellent leave again, just gentle away-movement off the seam from length outside off"
right inside the crease as he bunts this to short cover for a quick single
"slapped away, but straight to deep midwicket"

"full and outside off from wide of the crease, left alone"
defends this incoming length delivery to the off side
"good length outside off, left alone"
"comes back in a long way from outside off, there's prodigious movement as Blundell leaves. Keeper had to move to his left very quickly to stop that"
there for the drive but Blundell is happy to leave
hops back and defends this length ball to the leg side. Got on top of the bounce nicely.
"wallops this pull, but all along the ground to deep midwicket"
shoulders arms to a full delivery that angles in and then straightens outside off
"takes him on with the pull, doesn't get hold of it. Lands between deep square and deep midwicket"
shapes to pull but this one cuts back in and shaves past the off stump. Through the stroke early
sways out of the way of this short ball
are they checking for a no-ball? Gabriel has picked his fourth with a beauty that jags back in a long way to roll back onto the stumps off the bottom edge. He hopped back to defend but this delivery kept a touch low. Blundell's played a handy knock.
"I have no idea how he's managed to keep out that yorker. This was honing in towards the base of middle and leg, Southee is across a long way as he keeps that out"
<b> in the air </b> but just short of gully. Looks to fend this steep bouncer but this keeps coming back in a long way to rap him on the glove. Raw pace
"backs away and steer this over the slips. It didn't matter to him, I'm sure, if this crashed into the stumps. He was just taking a chance and it came off."
"swings at this length ball, toe-ends this to mid-on"
"looked to deposit this over long-on, but was beaten for pace on this length ball"
"walked away leg side, the bowler followed him with the short ball, Southee somehow manufactured room and played a delicate little upper cut to clear the shortish third man boundary. That will frustrate any fast bowler"
works this full delivery angling into middle and leg to the leg side
"awkward bouncer, somehow manages to get some bat on it as he jumps back to defend"
"bouncer but this is way over Southee's head, moves out of the way"
makes room and gets a thick inside edge on the drive to mid-on
"walks across to work this to the leg side, Cummins angles this down leg. Through to the keeper"
"<b> crashed into Gabriel's shin </b> on his followthrough and he's in a lot of pain. This was a full delivery, Southee just backed away and walloped this back down the pitch."
"get big on him, this short ball, he swings and misses"
"gets it on the splice of the bat as he looks to pull in front of square, the man from deep midwicket had some distance to cover by which time they'd hared for the second"
"bouncer outside off and that has been dismissed. Into the trees, deep into the stands at deep square. Walloped this pull, hit it really hard."
"too full, belted down the ground, there's long-on this time. He nearly cleaned up Boult at the non-striker's end"
makes room and bunts this short of length delivery to gully
backs away and steers this length ball to deep point
unorthodox but very effective. Just backs away and flat-bats this over cover.
"too short, he backs away and slaps this over cover. This is getting frustrating from West Indies' point of view. The wicketkeeper runs all the way down to have a chat with the bowler."
"backs away, the bowler follows him with a short ball. Southee looks to help this over the slips but is beaten for pace."
tucks this short of length delivery on middle and leg to square leg
"looks to help this over fine leg, beaten for pace of this skiddy short of length delivery angling in"
"short ball on off, defended. He went across the stumps a long way"
"backs away and thrashes this length ball past point. Incredible hand-eye coordination. He was outside leg, looked like he was a long way but used his reach nicely to pick the gap"
"first backs away, then shuffles across outside off, Gabriel slants in a length ball down leg, can't get any bat on it"
flat-bats this over wide long-on. This is the most orthodox shot of the lot. This was too short but sitting up nicely as he made room and clobbered this.
"straight back over the bowler's head, one bounce into the ropes. This was too full, he got right underneath the delivery as he swung through the line"
slower length ball which Boult reads off the hand and defends
poor delivery. Short and wide and that has been cut fiercely off the backfoot through point
"flat and short of a length, cut off the backfoot to covers"
"short of good length again, spinning in, cut to covers again"
that's a big hit. Perhaps the biggest of the morning so far. Southee dares to go down the track and launches it from outside off despite the minimal turn over cow corner
"shortish, spinning in around off, shifts back and slaps it down to long-off"
wanted to go for the big slog but changes his mind at the last minute and instead comes up with an ugly push down the ground past the bowler
takes the backfoot away from the leg stump to give himself some room. Roach fires it up wide outside the off stump and Boult lets it go
"short ball, angling in and climbing into him, Boult sways out of the line"
"<bdropped</b>. Oh, dear! Nothing going West Indies' way. Roach tries to deceive Boult with a slower full ball and succeeds as Boult pushes it back with hard hands. Comes straight at Roach who lets the ball burst through the hands"
"short of a length, big swing and a miss outside off"
"length ball, comes into him at middle and leg, Southee picks up the lack of pace and waits before turning it away to deep backward square leg"
backs away again and then tries to get behind the line of a fullish length ball around off but gets beaten
"flatter delivery that drifts away, left alone well outside off"
"swipes hard at a wide delivery and it seems as though his backfoot has come off as he swings and misses. They go upstairs to check for the stumping. Oh, yes, he has dragged his backfoot out of the crease. But then he has slid it in well before the bails have come off"
"shortish, mistimes a pull and drags it down to long-on"
comes down initially but changes his mind very late and keeps his backfoot planted as he lets it go
"back of a length, Boult shufflrs across and keeps it down on the off side. Southee is very keen on a single but Boult nonchalantly asks him to wait"
left alone outside off
"dipping fuller ball, misses the bat as Southee looks to flick it out and hits the pad but it was drifting down leg"
"has that carried? Oh, yes, it has. Good, sharp catch as Roach makes up for the earlier lapse. Southee drags a short of a length delivery back with a flat bat towards Roach who gets down in time and tries to grab it with both hands. The ball just kind of sticks in his right hand"
"a bit of shape straightaway, fullish and nipping away outside off, left alone"
"squares him up a little here. Again pretty full, angling in on middle and straightening, finds the outside edge to third man"
"full and straightening around the off-stump line, pushed out to mid-off for a single"
"fullish, pushed across the off-stump of the left-hander and holding its line, Powell shoulders arms"
"extremely full outside off, bunted out from the crease"
"is that an inside edge? Yes, a clear one. That's a ripper from Southee. Now he gets one to move the other way. This is also a loose shot from Powell. He really shouldn't have been poking at that one. It's a length ball, pitches outside off and he hangs the bat out. But it moves inwards pretty late and gets an inside edge"
"short ball, well-directed bouncer and Brathwaite scampers under it"
"ooh, close. Short of a length, pitching on middle and leg and straightening, Brathwaite fends it off in front of short leg"
similar late movement into him from a short of a length. Now the ball misses the bat as he tries to tuck and goes to forward short leg off the pad instead
"good stuff. Length ball, straightens from middle and off, defended back"
"very full outside off, straightens sharply again and Brathwaite pushes it back to Boult who gathers it with his left hand and fires a throw to the stumps"
"short of a length, no straightening this time as it holds its line with the angle away from off, stabbed to gully"
"short ball, pitches outside leg, ducked under"
"fullish, nips away sharply and Hetmyer gets beaten as he fishes away from the body"
"full on the stumps, jabbed back at the bowler"
"short ball, gets a bit too big on him for Hetmyer to connect with a hook"
"length ball, straightening on middle, defended back"
beauty! A ripper to end the over. Holds its line as it nips across his off-stump and leaves him beaten as he sticks the bat out
walks across to a back of a length ball and defends to the right of the bowler with a closed bat face
"back of a length, around a fifth-stump channel, shuffles across and stabs it into the off side"
"fuller length, pushed across a long way and Brathwaite shuffles across before letting it go"

"back of a length, pushed across on middle and leg, straightens down the leg stump line and Hetmyer defends back"
"short ball, too high and too wide for the hook"
"an authoritative drive down the ground, a bit uppish but short of mid-off who runs across and slides"
"just back of a length, holds its line, Hetmyer confidently leaves as the ball passes from close to off stump"
turns a fuller ball away to deep backward square leg
"short of a length, fired down the leg side and Hetmyer lets it go"

"length ball in the corridor of uncertainty, lures Hetmyer forward and he gets beaten as the ball holds its line"
"similar length and in the same region, Hetmyer again pokes and gets narrowly beaten"
curves into him from a fullish length and he gets an inside edge to the pad
"very full and curving into the pads, clipped away to deep backward square leg. Boult sprints to his right but the ball gets past him despite his dive"

"full and angling in on off, driven out to the covers"

"athleticism and reflexes right out of the top drawer. Boult has pulled off the catch of New Zealand's summer so far. 'So what if you can't take it at slip? I'll do it myself.' This was a length ball that bounced just a touch more to take the top part of Hetmyer's bat. That's only part one. This lobbed back towards Boult, who was nowhere near the line of this delivery because his followthrough was taking him away. But the moment he saw the ball lobbed high, he quickly changed tracks and transferred momentum to his left before diving full length to his left to pluck that one-handed stunner. Wow, words can't do justice to this. Outstanding from Boult. A gentle smile to soak in the wicket. What a guy, what an entertainer."

"oh, what a scorcher! Tell you what, that was too good for even Williamson. An absolutely unplayable delivery. This, in fact, would be too good for anyone. He has managed to get past the oft-impregnable defences of the New Zealand captain. A flawless yorker that rips in from outside off. Williamson jams the bat down but nothing he can do about it.

Seems alright there but the umpire wants to have a zoomed in look. Remember that soft signal is out, so need substantial evidence to overturn.

"had him in a tangle with that bouncer. Initially looked to avoid this but the ball was dead straight on middle, he made the mistake of looking away as well, and this one thuds into his forearm. He's sure to have plenty of swelling there,  <b> the physio wasted no time in running out to attend to him. </b> He's in a lot of pain. That was bowled upwards of 140 clicks as well"
that's another poor shot. Wagner strikes in his first over on the fourth day. And it's another decently-set batsman who has got out here.

gets a good stride in as he defends
hops back into the crease and bunts this short of length delivery to the off side
"nips back in from length outside off, left alone"
"<strong>inswinging yorker that would've done Wasim Akram proud.</strong> Comes back in a long, long way from around the stumps, Chase somehow managed to dug that out. This as headed to the base of middle stump. Terrific stuff"
right towards the pitch of the ball as he confidently defends to cover
"squeezed into the gap behind point as he brings up <strong>a well-deserved half-century.</strong> Isn't all that animated, but he's shown some excellent temperament and composure. How long can he defy the bowling?"
"length on off from around the stumps, blocks"
"clips this to the fine leg boundary. Poor line, outside leg, from Boult. Picked away easily."

bunts this gently off the backfoot

pulled to deep midwicket. This was angling away but he was happy to take him on. Hit this all along the ground though
"shapes to pull but this gets big on him, does well to avoid it in the end. <strong>Caught in two minds </strong>"
"just wide of short leg's reach. Judging by the reaction of the fielders, there may have been an inside edge. This was a superb lifter. Replays show there was no bat"

chases a wide delivery outside off again and gets beaten
"short of a length, straightening around off, defended"
<b>brilliant catch at gully</b>. Williamson with a stunner. He just makes it seem so simple. Not prodigiously swinging or anything. Reifer just pays the price for going after a wide delivery and gets an outside edge. Williamson gets down to his left in a jiffy and sticks the left hand out to take a stunning catch
"length ball, angling in on off, defended"
no feet towards the ball as he just sticks the bat out and defends this in front of off
"full and tailing away, no shot offered outside off"
"fullish length, the back hand comes off as he punches it into the ground on the off side"

"a short ball down the leg side, moves across and pulls it away to deep fine leg. Not in great position or anything but manages enough meat on the shot"
tries the same shot again but this one's not as short. And he moved across too far away as well
"for the third time in a row, he attempts the same shot and again misses"
<b>Southee is excited about a caught-behind</b> but the umpire says not out. Kane Williamson reviews. Might as well use it up now. Extremely full outside the off-stump. He tries to squeeze it out without moving his feet.HotSpot shows nothing. That was bat hitting the ground. Nothing on snicko either. Clear daylight between bat and ball. Roach survives
"short ball, jumps up and across to defend into the off side"
"yorker on middle and leg, dug out"
"full but too wide outside off the off-stump and nipping away, left alone"
"yorker, jams the bat down and misses. The ball almost shaves off-stump. Misses by inches"

"short and slanted across, gets out of the way"
"back of a length, down the leg side, looks to tuck and misses"
"oh my god, backs away a mile down the leg side. Exposes all his stumps. If there was another set of stumps, he would have probably exposed the whole of that as well. Crashed through the covers"
moves away a long way down the leg side and the bowler drags his length back. Reaches out and makes no contact
"short, this time Wagner follows him expecting him to back away and he wears it on the stomach"
"dipping full toss on middle and leg, clipped to square leg"
"oh, is that against the run of play or what? Again backs away and hammers a shortish ball. Gets no room and whacks it off the toe end straight over"
"slower full ball on the stumps, clipped to square leg"
this is another big hit. Lot more control on this one than the last. Heaves a pull to a short ball over deep midwicket
<b>just over Raval at deep mid-on</b>. Moves away and slaps it over with a flat bat.
attempts his favoured walk-across-the-stumps-and-pull-over-fine-leg. Beaten
another appeal for caught-behind. He backed away and jammed the bat down into the ground. That must have been the noise
this is got to be frustrating for Southee. He's dishing out these yorkers and the batsmen are just jamming their bat down without any technique whatsoever and managing to make contact. This one's an inside edge off the toe-end through fine leg
now that's a clean strike. A length ball that he haves over deep midwicket. Bang off the middle and timed very well
"fullish and sliding on leg side, tries to tuck and gets an inside edge to fine leg"
<b>dropped</b>. Very tough chance. It went miles in the air and he had the sun in his eyes. Boult the fielder at long-off. Runs across to his left and sticks the left hand out but does not get under the line of the ball. Tries to heave over the leg side and skews it off the outer of the bat
"flat and quick on the stumps, defended"
"a similar shot and this time Boult takes it well. Tries to slog it big over deep midwicket and gets a leading edge. A thick one, off the outside of the bat and Boult just runs forward and settles under it. He seems unhappy, seems like he had the sun in his face again"
and that's the end of it. Santner finishes it off with a double-strike. A comprehensive win for New Zealand. A sliding length ball on middle and leg. Roach is playing the line but does not account for the turn as the ball rips away and takes out the stumps
