"<b>that's gone through Russell</b>! Shaw drove that straight and full delivery down the ground with a neat straight drive, Russell ran to his left form long-on, even bent to to get both his hands on it but it went right through him.

"reaches deep point after a bounce. Short and wide outside off, Ingram sent it flying to deep point"
"<b>oh he's gone for 99, would you believe it</b>. Ferguson was bowling one short delivery after another, this one angling in towards Shaw's head, he pulls, gets a top edge and Dinesh Karthik goes back a few steps towards short third man and takes the skier. Shaw is utterly disappointed with that, he would have been the youngest centurion in IPL"

waits for the ball to come to him from outside off and steers it late to third man
"flat and quick towards off, worked to leg for one"
"that was a run-out chance and Kuldeep has fluffed it! Ingram punched it through the covers and they came back for the second, the throw was accurate and reached Kuldeep with Vihari not there yet but he didn't collect the ball"
this one turns away from Ingram and beats the outside edge. He brings his back leg back just in time
"some width outside off, chipped down the ground for one"
"<strong>he has found the fielder in the deep</strong>, who else but Shubman Gill. What a match this has turned out to be all of a sudden. Short ball, pulled away and it went straight to deep midwicket off Vihari's bat"
"<B>IT IS A SUPER OVER</B>. Ingram went across a bit, Kuldeep pitched it on length just outside leg and Ingram swept it away, as Uthappa swooped in on the ball in the deep. Accurate throw, Ingram takes too much time to turn around for the second and he can't make it"
