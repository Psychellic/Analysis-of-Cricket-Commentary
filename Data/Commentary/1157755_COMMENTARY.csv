"loops it up onto off stump, Rayudu digs it out with a whirl of his wrists"

appeal for lbw from the keeper as Rayudu steps down the pitch and blocks outside the line of a skidder on middle stump.
"superbly driven again, this time through point! He's an amazing striker of spin bowling because his footwork is no-nonsense. Sees a tossed up ball, immediately goes down the pitch and picks the gap"
"another hop, skip and jump down the pitch for a whip through midwicket. Quick running gets them two"
"<b>beats him</b> and there's evidence that this pitch is made for the spinners. A lovely, good length delivery, with loads of revs pitches on middle stump and leaps past the outside edge"

"shimmies down the pitch to work the ball to mid-on. The amount of turn Bishoo's getting must be making India wary. That's why Rayudu is advancing every other ball, to smother it and make sure the legspinner doesn't get in rhythm"

"a gentle nudge, off the front foot, to the right of midwicket"

"draws him forward outside off, Kohli knows he isn't to the pitch of the ball, and that this is a slow pitch too. So he makes sure to simply block"
taps a flighted delivery outside off to long-on
quicker and flatter and has just enough room for Rayudu to indulge in a late cut. He finds the backward point fielder though
"soft hands as he goes back and blocks a good length ball on off stump. But as he does so, he opens the face and pinches a single to Holder at point"
lets the length ball turn into him from outside off and taps it through midwicket. <b>That's drinks</b>
"too flat, too straight, and too easy for Kohli. He's very good at waiting for these bad balls now. And he was always good at putting them away. Flicks it behind square leg, well to the right of the man in the deep"
loops it up on middle - the drift taking it into the right-hander and the subsequent turn looking for the outside edge - and that's why Kohli defends
"outstanding cricket - this time off the back foot. It's only a shade short, not even that wide. But Kohli makes the room himself and cracks it to the left of Hetmyer at point"
"<b>beats him with a jaffa</b>! There's only a feather's width between the ball and the outside edge as Kohli is drawn forward to block a shade outside the off stump. Credit for Bishoo for adjusting his line, but not compromising on a full length"

"too short, Rayudu leaps back and pulls to deep midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, Rayudu slices it to point"
shifts himself towards the off stump to handle the left-arm angle and then works it off his hips towards midwicket. Good bounce from the tall quick.

It's also century no. 30 at No. 3 - taking him past another bonafide legend - Ricky Ponting. His celebration was pretty cool too - pointed at his bat and made the hand-signal  for 'talking'. Bat doing the talking."
works it away through midwicket
nudges it gently to long-on
whips it over midwicket
"full and outside off, drives to cover"
"full and outside off, Jadeja wafts at it and gets a thick outside edge to deep third man. He seems to get a bit greedy after that, running back for a second run with Kohli yelling no. Lucky for India that he's ridiculously quick. Makes his ground easily"
pulls the short ball away over midwicket
"shortish and outside off, slices it to deep third man"
goes back and flicks a good length ball in all the acres of space on the leg side. Everyone's on the boundary so Jadeja pinches two by playing with soft hands
"shortish and outside off, slashes it to the sweeper cover"
"a shade short and Kohli is back in his crease, hammering it to long-on"
"full and outside off, drives to long-off"
hares out of his crease for a heave out to deep square leg
"good length on off stump, defends in front of point and picks up the single on offer"
taps the short of a length delivery outside off to point
"<b>gets past 1000 runs in 2018</b> - and it comes off a rip-roaring six straight down the ground. That, by the way, breaks another record - <b>fastest to aggregate 1000 in a calendar year - it's only taken him 11 innings</b>. Take a back seat, Hashim Amla circa 2010 and Kohli circa 2012 (15 innings)"
"comes down the track, the left-arm quick goes short and slow, Kohli responds with a pull, and the fielder at short fine leg mucks it up. Chandrapaul Hemraj the culprit"
"pitched-up and it's smashed over the top again, the ball sailing into the delirious crowd behind long-on. Kohli's bat isn't so much talking now as it's singing an Aria in C major. If that doesn't make sense, it's intentional, cause his batting doesn't make any sense"
"back of a length and outside off, steers it behind point"
"full and outside off, guides it to third man for a quick single, and once there's the overthrow, Kohli agrees to a second as well"
"<b>what a catch</b> - by the ball boy outside the boundary. He's the only one in play as soon as this ball became a half-volley outside off stump. Kohli leans into the drive, extends his hands, and there's timing to spare"
"even wide yorkers aren't working. The funny thing is, Kohli doesn't even look like he has the strength to stay standing, but somehow when the ball is delivered, he has the perfect counter ready. A squeeze to the third man boundary"
"full and outside off, drives smoothly to point"
"yorker a shade outside off, Jadeja jams an angled bat down to secure a single behind point"
"full toss outside off, Kohli places it to the left of long-off for a couple"
"pulverises this full toss though, again only extending the arms while playing a text-book cover drive and picking up a boundary. That's how you capitalise on the bowler's mistake. It doesn't take a lot of effort. Just clarity in the mind. <b>India go past 300, btw</b>"
inside edge as he goes swinging after a very full delivery on off stump. Single to long leg
lifts an overpitched delivery to long-off
"gets struck on the pad off a full toss and so instead of the boundary he was looking for, behind square leg, he'll have to settle for a single in the covers"
launches a back of a length delivery out to deep midwicket
"taken at long-on! And it's a steepler as well. Good work from Kieran Powell. He's on the boundary edge. He tracks it all the way, settles under it, and Jadeja perishes in pursuit of quick runs. Big heave against a slower ball outside off and that lack of pace does him in"
"full and outside off, Kohli steers it to point"
"full and outside off, drives it smoothly to long-off"
scoops a ball two feet wide of off stump and finds the boundary at fine leg. Yep. Physics don't apply to Kohli now.
"wide yorker, which Kohli slices to deep point and immediately looks for two. He's running on empty but he wants the strike back. He wants more runs. For himself and for India. Puts in the dive to beat the throw from the deep and stays there for a good three seconds, taking deep breaths, before he comes up and <b>celebrates 150</b>"
launches it over long-on! There's a fielder there but to Kohli he may as well be a hologram. Makes the ball soar over his outstretched right hand
"full and outside off, he slaps it over the covers"
beats him with a wide yorker and that's the end of the innings.
sweet sound off the middle of the bat as Powell flicks the short ball to mid-on.
targets the body and Hemraj is able to shuffle over to off stump and work it away to long leg
"more evidence of how batting against the new ball could be quite profitable. It comes onto the bat so well and Powell, knowing this, plays a neat little flick, concentrating solely on placing the ball past midwicket"
"good length on middle, Powell turns it to midwicket"
"bouncer on middle and leg, Powell goes for a pull but it just zips past him"
"good length on off stump, defends"
targets the stumps - that's his specialty - and Hemraj just about manages to whip it away behind square leg
"shortish and outside off, chops it to point"
"fuller delivery outside off, Powell presents the full face to it"
"back of a length, angling across the left-hander. Powell blocks to point"
drives on the up to cover
"yorker outside off, Powell is just a touch late to get his bat down"
opens the face as he gets forward to a short of a length ball outside off. Can't beat point though
leaves the good length ball outside off
full and swinging outside the off stump. Hemraj doesn't quite fancy it.
"pulls the short ball on leg stump down to long leg, with the front foot off the ground. Glorious!"
stays in line with a shortish delivery on off stump
picks up the length ball and hammers it over wide long-on. Outstanding strokeplay. Don't need to move the feet for that. Just keep the eye on the ball and swing that big ole bat
works a back of a length ball away past midwicket
they like this length India are bowling. Just short of a length. It's sitting up on the pitch to be tonked across the line. Four through midwicket
"<b>outside edge</b> zips past the diving Dhoni. Moves to his left, but the ball has a little too much pace on it, pitches just before it reaches him, flicks his webbing and then flies away"
"magnificent hitting! Powell looks outrageously good when he's just standing, and delivering. Gets up on his toes and pulls the short ball away with elegance to spare"
"full on off stump, blocks"
works the length ball off his pads to deep square leg
"outside edge as Powell is made to play with a straight bat whilst the ball is angled across him. That's his weakness - he looks tentative; drawn into playing away from his body. Still, India don't have any slips and the ball wanders out to short third man"
comes out of his crease to pull the short ball away. There's protection out at deep square leg now
"dabs the shortish delivery outside off, looking for a boundary to third man, but India have Kuldeep there, at a very very deep second slip position, specifically to stop the outside edge from yielding runs. Still gets West Indies one though, so it's entirely weird"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"slower delivery on and around leg stump, Hemraj flicks towards midwicket"
"pulls the short ball away to long leg - again that front leg rising up off the ground, adding extra oomph to the shot"
"he looks dodgy on the front foot - it moves after he plays the shot, and here that means his cover drive turns into an inside edge to mid-on"
"back of a length on off stump, nudges it to long-on"
"dismisses it to the long leg boundary, the ball straying onto his pads and his wrists accepting the gift with glee"
launched over point now. It's a full toss outside off and the left-hander can't believe his luck even as he reaches his bat out and angles it like a ramp
"good length on off stump, defends"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives to mid-off"
"taken at deep midwicket. Powell's good on the pull and he is forced to play that shot - Shami adjusting to the batsman stepping out of his crease and cramping the left-hander for room. Should Powell have gone through with an aggressive shot? The new ball is the best chance to score runs on this slow pitch so perhaps he can be given a little leeway. But at this level, and so early in the innings, you shouldn't be picking the deep fielders out. After all, in the first 10, there can be only two out there and if you're giving catching practice to them, then there's something seriously wrong"
"good length, outside off, leaves it alone"
"back of a length on off stump, defends, but only off the inside edge"
"<b>gorgeous shot</b> - he's off the ground, the ball is still getting big on him, but somehow Hope is able to flick it ever so sweetly to the backward square leg boundary. Would have clanged into the advertising triangles if not for Kuldeep diving to his right"
"good length on off stump, defends"
"oh, this is blockbuster batting. Hope is met with another decent delivery - on a good length outside off - but he treats it so cruelly, thumping it on the up and placing it beating Kohli on his left at mid-off"
"he's reaching away from his body, feet going nowhere, but despite all those flaws, he gets a boundary through a thick outside edge that beats Shami at short third man"
"smacks it straight down the ground - as if he's worried about how he's looking at the crease right now and wanted to show the world that he's much better. Short stride forward, extension of defence, fine timing"
"short ball on middle, Hemraj pulls to deep midwicket"
"<b>jaffa</b>! It hits the seam a shade outside off and straightens away from the angle. And poor Hope, playing for that angle, is comfortably beaten"
"good length on off stump, defends"
crunches it through the covers! Hope is playing shots that sound so sweet and look so good. Standing tall behind a back of a length delivery and using the vertical bat to great effect
whips it off his pads to deep midwicket
"shapes to pull the short ball outside off, but realises it's got too much height on it and so bails out"
allows the short ball to come to him and ever so gently redirects it to the third man boundary. Soft hands. Simple placement
stands up tall and punches it back to the bowler
"yanks one hand off his bat, perhaps to ensure the ball climbing high around the off stump, goes to ground as he drives into the covers"
"back of a length on off stump, drills it to cover"
"good length ball on middle, Hemraj goes back to block"
"<b>past the reach of Rohit at slip</b>. The loopy delivery. The width outside the off stump. All of it made Hemraj go after the ball and nearly pay the price. Jeez, that dip he gets... the way he sets batsmen into making mistakes..."
"<b>ripper</b>! And yet Kuldeep doesn't do any more than present a googly in line with the stumps. Everything else is on the batsman. Hemraj doesn't pick it. He plays for the ball turning away from him. And it's a lazy shot, the bat pushing away from the body, giving plenty of room for the ball to sneak through and shatter middle"
"tosses it up outside off, Samuels smears the half-volley through the covers."
"epic hit! And it's through the covers again - only this time he's hitting it on the up, and against the turn, but he backs himself to put all of those dangers aside. Sensational"
"tosses it up on the stumps, Samuels stretches forward to defend, if a little uncertainly. The change in line helps create doubt"
"starts with a full on, and he comes forward to defend"
"a bit of turn, and he squirts it towards points"
"fuller ball, turned to deep square leg"
"outside off on a length, and he opens the face of the bat to guide it psat point"
"gives himself some room, looking to smear it through the offside, but doesn't get hold of it"
punches off the back foot but straight to mid-on
<b>past the outside edge</b> slides it across the right-hander's tentative poke
"beats him again. Beaten on the drive and Dhoni whips off the bails, but the batsman hadn't moved out of the crease"
"fuller outside off, defended towards point"
"tossed up on the stumps, and he pats it down into the leg side"
"goes fuller, and he gets on it quickly, opening the face of the bat to steer it past backward point"
"<b>googly does him</b> Samuels is left with bat hanging well away from body, for Kuldeep to sneak through. The ball hit the top of the bails. The umpires weren't sure and needed to go upstairs - that might be a rare 'bowled' dismissal adjudicated by the third umpire."
"strays down the pads, and is turned round the corner for a single"
"length ball on the stumps, defended"
"dragged it down short, and outside off, allowing the batsman to rock back and slap it but can't get it past cover"
"<b>over the top for six</b>takes a big stride forward and still had to reach for the ball, but did it well enough to not only clear the in-field but go over the long-on fence"
"full ball, driven to cover"
"full on off, and defended towards mid-off"
"tossed up on off, he reaches across and drives it down to long-on"
tossed up on the stumps and he brings his bat down in time to pat it back to the bowler
"he picked the length early, rocked back to pull it to midwicket. Rayudu puts in the dive to save a certain boundary"
"googly, didn't pick it. Bottom-edges it into the ground and back to the bowler"
"tossed up again, but doesn't get the length quite spot on there. Too full and defended"
<b>draws the edge</b> but it falls well short of Rohit at slip. He dives and stops the ball
"tossed up on the stumps, comes forward and drives it to long-off"
"fuller outside off, he clips it to long-on"
"flatter on the stumps, punched to point"
"<b>thick edge flies to third man</b> that was fired in quicker, and cramped the batsman for room coming in. He shaped to cut but only got a thick edge"
<i>ye walla</i> says Dhoni to the one that is on a length and spins into the right-hander. Punched into the offside
overpitched on the stumps and driven to long-on
strong bottom hand and wrists allows him to whip this to midwicket where Rayudu slides and stops the ball
"tosses it up and ends as a full toss on the pads, but he can't clip it away. Only goes to short fine-leg"
"gets the length right, draws him forward and gets the edge, but it flies past Rohit at slip"
gets well forward and drives it to wide long-off with a straight bat
"<b>full toss deposited over midwicket</b> perhaps the dew is making it difficult to grip the ball, and the batsman doesn't let go of the free gift. Rocks back to hit it sweetly enough that it carries over the boundary"
"pulls off the back foot, but good work by midwicket, who dives and stops"
"flat on the stumps, he stays back and drives it to the man on the cover fence"
"drags it short, and he rocks back again to slap it to long-on"
"tossed up on off, and he comes forward to drive it to the man on the cover fence"
"floated up on the stumps, he whips it to deep midwicket. Early call for 'two' and they complete it comfortably in the end"
"flatter outside off, and defended into the off side"
"goes on the back foot again, to hit it towards long-on. Trying to field the ball, Jadeja gets into a tangle with the non-striker, but no harm done"
<b>spins past the bat</b> pitched on the stumps and turned appreciably to go past the outside edge
"oh he'll not be happy with that, Kuldeep. Another full toss and it's gone over the midwicket fence once again. Dhoni runs across to have a quick word with the bowler"
"better length, spinning away but pushed into the point region. They go through for a quick single, Shami misses his shy at the stumps at the non-striker's end"
goes on the backfoot to one outside off and taps it to midwicket
defends it back
goes well back again to a length ball on the stumps and defends with a straight bat.
"flat and quicker, he manages to keep it out. Dhoni likes  it"
"length ball on the stumps, defended back"
"given a bit more air, and fuller, he defends off hte inside edge"
"spotted the batsman trying to come down, and shortened his length. Pushed back to long-on"
"flat and quick outside off, chopped to point"
"fuller on the stumps, he comes forward to defend to the legside"
"flat on leg stump, not much turn. Swiped to midwicket"
"tossed up and beats his intended whip, crashes into the pads"
"stays back that time, to tuck it with the turn towards deep square leg"
"fuller, driven to mid-on off the back foot"
"tossed up, draws him forward and dips enough to hit his pad"
some turn for Chahal. On a length and defended back
"swings a short ball from outside off to long-on. The pace on it is such that Shami, rushign to his right, misfields, but has back up in the form of Dhawan"
makes room to crack a length ball on off stump into the covers
"breathtaking! It is true that the ball is a half-volley, and it allows him the freedom for a full swing of the arms. But sheesh. The power. The distance. The sheer brutality in dealing with a bad ball is on another level"
"good length ball outside off, he gets forward to defend"
allows the quicker ball to come to him and then clips it behind square leg
"tosses it up outside off, he drives to cover"
straying on his pads - or perhaps it's the legspinner being careful not to give the left-hander too much room. Hetmyer turns it to short fine leg
"flat and quick on leg stump, Hetmyer taps it to long-on"
"looks for the sweep shot, but suddenly the ball dips on him, and it is ready to clatter into middle stump when Hope manages to get an inside edge through to fine leg"
"presses forward to a tossed up delivery, drifting in through the air, and defends with bat in front of pad"
"on the pads, Hope clips it through square leg"
works the length ball outside leg stump to deep square leg
"round-arms it in at middle stump, Hope keeps it out"
"full delivery outside off, Hope picks the gap to the left of cover"
"bye-bye birdie! The moment the ball has a little air on it, he gets down on one knee and launches it anywhere between long-on and deep midwicket. Savage! Jadeja was bowling from round the wicket so he doesn't give the left-hander room to swing the arms. Doesn't work"
"back over the wicket with a shortish ball and outside off, clips it through to deep square leg"
"and at the other end, there is technical purity, with Hope playing cover drive after text-book cover drive. West Indies chugging along now"
"quicker delivery outside off, Hetmyer yanks his front leg back (to prevent lbw) and flicks around it"
reaches the pitch of the legbreak on leg stump and turns it to short midwicket
has to hurry into his shot as Chahal gets the ball to drift in and dip late. Hope saves himself some blushes with a straight drive
<b>beats him with a loopy legbreak</b> well outside off. Dhoni isn't able to collect it cleanly behind the stumps
he simply won't stop! <b>Back-to-back fifty-plus scores</b> for the 21-year old. And it comes off his favourite shot - the down the track slog over the leg side - and this time the ball ends up at deep square leg
"full on off stump, defends"
lines the ball up around the left-hander's off stump and that brings some signs of tentativeness from Hetmyer. As if he's not sure where it would pitch or which way it would turn...
"back of a length and outside off, Hope steers it to point"
"back of a length and outside off, Hope looks to cut it, but the ball keeps low and beats him"
dabs it down to third man
"back of a length on off stump, Hetmyer finds a single at midwicket"
"lovely bowling - at 143 kph, he lets rip a full-length delivery that skids off the pitch and has Hope set up for the lbw. But the batsman is set and he manages to connect with a flick to midwicket"
"<b>su-weeeeeet hit</b>. That cover drive's is coated in gooey chocolate, topped with whipped cream and cherries. They said Hope doesn't have the strike-rate for ODIs. Well, 80-odd doesn't seem too bad, and boy does he have the shots. This one is on the up and it's the result of the full face of the bat coming down in line with the ball"
muscles it to the midwicket boundary - and this time he doesn't even have to sweep. This is a straight bat hit and it's just as brutal
"rank long hop and Hetmyer gives it a free helping of air miles. India's mighty spinners are rattled. They don't know where to bowl to this 21-year old left-hander whom they only needed to blink at to get rid of in Test cricket. Here, in maroon, he's basically a younger Chris Gayle"
"3...2 ...1... lift off! The ball is on middle stump. It's flighted, which he likes. Shimmies down the pitch and launches it over long-off"
"takes all the pace off, and lines it up well outside off. Hetmyer presents the late cut, showing he has various sides to his batting"
"full on off stump, drives to the right of Jadeja at cover and sprints through"
"another late cut as Chahal wises up and bowls wide of off stump, and not allowing the length to go full"
"<b>gives him out lbw but Hope reviewed immediately</b> and the replays show why - there's a big inside edge so umpire Gould has to change his decision. Pretty decent ball though. It's the Umesh special really. Full, fast, nipping in a bit off the seam and catching the batsman deep in his crease, hurrying to play the ball, and as such playing across the line"
"good length and outside off, he taps and runs to point"
"back of a length and outside off, Hetmyer guides it through to the sweeper"
drives on the up and to the left of cover
keeps targeting the stumps - looking for lbw and bowled - but Hope is aware of that plan and he flicks the ball away to deep midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, dabs it to cover"
googly to start off as Hope stretches forward and blocks towards point. Not entirely sure he's picked it though
"full on middle, whips it to long-on"
"goes for the cut shot, top-edging it, and it nearly carries to point. The wristspinner getting a bit of extra bounce"
"much more smooth this time as he gets closer to the ball outside off and cuts it, rolling his wrists to keep the ball down"
"<b>googly again</b> and it beats Hope, who is looking to flick the ball to square leg and is beaten all ends up. The umpires are checking on the stumping. Hope did have his back leg up for half a second, but he plonks it back down before Dhoni takes the bail off."
"tosses it up on middle, Hope works it to long leg, this time with the turn"
"back of a length from round the wicket, targeting Hetmyer's body. He punches it down towards mid-off for a quick single"
defends a shortish delivery on off stump to point
"full on off stump, Hope defends well"
gets off his feet to get on top of the ball and hammers it to the sweeper - all that with a straight(ish) bat. Seriously good cricket from Hope as he brings up a <b>half-century</b>
"<b>mis-hits</b> the heave into the leg side, the short ball cramping him, taking enough of the outside half of the bat to beat mid-off running back"
"flays it to the long-off boundary. Boy, this guy has so much power. And there's some skill behind it too. He picks up the slower ball from round the wicket and launches it with a straight bat"
all along the ground! And the ease with which he pulls off this cover drive suggests he reads the googly too. Stays leg side of it and carves it through a heavily packed off-side field
"full toss outside off, drives t ocover"
"<b>outside edge</b> but there's no slip. This one is clearly the googly, pitching just in front of the batsman's reach, even though Hope does stretch forward. Lucky break for Hope"
"tossed up on leg stump, he flicks to short midwicket"
stands up tall against the short-pitched googly and punches to the right of cover
"very full on off stump, Hetmyer drives to the sweeper cover"
"starts with a bouncer, and it's smashed. spotted it and got in position, pulled it from in front of his face to the square leg fence"
"tries to deny him room by going wide of the stumps, but goes too wide outside off."
punched off the back foot. He read the length so quickly and got in position early. Just pushed at it almost and it raced away. Sweeper cover had to clean up
clipped to midwicket
"fuller on off, he comes forward and meets it with full face, sending it whirring to the man on the point fence."
"<b>clobbered</b> Stand and deliver from Hetmyer to go into the 90s. stayed in his crease and smashed it. Just over the head of mid-off, but he had no chance to catch it, the way it was travelling"
"late on the pull to this ball on leg, back of a length. It ballooned off the thigh pad to short fine leg, bouncing well in front of Kuldeep"
"turns from a length on the stumps, and he whips it to long-on's right"
"gives himself room, but only toe-ends the ball back to the bowler, who fumbles and allows a single"
he's giving himself some room so Chahal is bowling into the batsman. He clips it to midwicket
"length ball, turning from middle to outside off, and he taps it off the back foot to long on"
"<b>Hetmyer is distraught, Kohli is ecstatic</b> India needed this wicket badly, and a half-tracker gets them one. Hetmyer has hit plenty of those into cow corner, but somehow, he just top edges this one. The ball goes sky-high and settles into Kohli's hands at short cover, who ran in and had plenty of time to set himself up to catch it"
"full on the stumps, and turned to mid-on"
"back of a length on off, it didn't bounce much. tapped into the offside for a quick single"
<b>bouncer on target</b> Forces Powell to sway out of the way. That was homing in on his head
"goes full that time, but Powell is equal to it and not hanging on the back foot because of the bouncer. Transfers weight forward and punches past the bowler"
"goes short again, but this one doesn't rise as high. outside off, and goes under the bat as he attempts to pull"
"length on off, steered to point"
"short ball once again, this time he can swivel-pull it to deep square-leg"
"continues with his leg-stump attack line, the ball is turned around the corner for a single"

"on target again, and Rovman defends from the crease"
"on leg stump again, but he is able to turn it away to short fine-leg for a quick single"

"fuller on off, he stays back and clips it to mid-on and they get a quick single"
"<b>one bounce to Shikhar Dhawan at deep square leg</b> Got into position early and timed his pull very well, but luckily it fell just short of Dhawan"
"<b>Oh that's stunning</b> picked it up from outside off and just smashed it way into the stands at midwicket. classy shot, and super execution"
"goes short again, and this time Hope decides against the pull"
"<b>Pant gets a hand to it at long-on but crashes into the hoardings</b> tossed up on off, Rovman went for it and didn't get hold of it. Only the toe-end, but with such power that it carried past the boundary. Pant was at long-on and caught it, but stepped over the rope and hit the hoarding."
"struck on the pads, but that's going down leg. Half-hearted appeal. Drifted in, and beat his bat"
clipped off the front foot to square leg
"tossed up on the stumps, and driven with the full face of the bat to long-on"

"sharply turning ball, tucked away to deep square leg with the spin"
"given some air outside off, and it's tapped down to long-on."
"<b>googly does it again!</b> brilliance all around from India. Good captaincy to have a slip for Kuldeep, great bowling with a perfect googly that opened up Rovman - he had no clue which way the ball was turning - and he hung his bat out. Smart catch at slip. India are back in it."

"tossed up on legstump, and Hope steps forward to meet it on the half-volley. Drives it past midwicket"
"too full, ends up as a full toss that Holder pats down to long-off"

"not as full, Holder opens the face but steers straight to point."
"fired in on the stumps again, and Holder can only pat it to mid-on"
"not giving Holder room to free his arms, defended into the offside"

"<b>leading edge</b> with Hope closing the face, looking to flick the ball on middle to midwicket. Somehow finds a single through cover"
drifting into him again and Holder clips it behind square leg
"fine shot from Hope, keeping the front leg away so he can bring down a straight bat on the flighted ball on leg stump"
"back of a length and outside off, he hits it back to the bowler"
"full and tailing into the right-hander, Hope digs out the yorker"
"bouncer on middle and leg, he ducks beneath it"
"another yorker, looking for middle stump, Hope digs it out but the pressure is on. The crowd is loud. This won't be straightforward"
"aims for the blockhole again, but this time Hope stays beside it and drives behind point. Guy can bat."
"jams it into the blockhole again, Hope can only send it as far as point. Only two runs off an over which included four pin-point yorkers"
"looks for a slog sweep, but he toe-ends it and the ball goes nowhere"
goes back to block a good length googly outside off. Holder manages to pinch a single to extra cover
"skidder, which goes straight on with the arm, and Hope can only knock it back to the bowler"
"heaves it over wide long-on and with that one shot, he not only releases the pressure, he's also into the nineties. Fine batting under pressure"
steers it to the sweeper
"gets the legbreak to drift away from the right-hander, Holder defends a little away from the body, getting an inside edge onto his pad"
pulls the short ball out to deep square leg
"low full toss as he goes searching for the yorker, Holder drives to long-off"
spears the near-yorker into the gap past the right of point
"full on middle, Holder sends it scurrying through midwicket"
amazing hit! If ever anyone doubted the class of Shai Hope... He moves to 97 with an on the up cover drive that has left every jaw in Vizag on the floor
bangs it in and Hope pulls it to deep square leg
"sweeps it to long leg and he has it! Punches the air in triumph and then salutes the dressing room, with a big ole scowl on his face. Oh come on, after playing all those pretty shots, you look angry after scoring <b>a sensational hundred</b>?"
whips the flatter delivery on middle out to deep midwicket
"full and outside off, drives it to the left of point, where Kuldeep does well to create indecision between the two West Indian batsmen. Holder is more than halfway down for a singe, but Hope didn't know if he wanted the single. Eventually, he gets moving and beats the throw at the non-strikers'"
"full and outside off, Holder defends into the covers for a single"
works a tossed up ball on leg stump to backward square leg and they pinch the second run as well. This has been an excellent chase from West Indies. Never have they looked out of their depth
"full and outside off, he drives it hard at cover where Rayudu misfields"
"looks for the yorker, the ball tailing into off stump, Hope does well to dig it out"
"creams the drive to cover, with Umesh missing the yorker"
another fluent drive but Hope finds extra  cover again. That too off a full toss!
"the yorker ends up a full toss - on leg stump too - and with fine leg inside the circle, Hope only needs to get a little bat on it."
"full toss outside off this time, Hope dabs it to point"
"full on off stump, Hope drives into the covers and gets a single. That's West Indies' 300"
"goes for the cut, but the ball doesn't quite bounce as much as he figures. Bottom edge that goes nowhere"
"Holder's run-out! And Vizag roars! Poor stuff from West Indies, after staying so calm, they lose their captain over a silly mistake. Hope defends a legbreak on middle to cover and then takes a couple of steps out. Holder sees that and starts haring down the pitch only to look up at his partner suddenly standing still. Then he looks around and realises Rayudu already has the ball in his hand and underarms it through to the bowler to break the stumps"
"quicker and flatter on middle, Hope defends"
"tosses it up on leg stump, Hope pats it down to long-on"
"shapes for a scoop against a ball that could easily have been cut away. The premeditation means not only does he miss the ball, the dot-ball pressure keeps rising on West Indies"
sees a full delivery on middle and slogs to deep square leg
"slower short ball, which Nurse tries to pull, but he doesn't count on the change of pace. Mis-hit still gets WI one run"
swings hard at a full delivery on off stump and finds only a single at long-on. Claps all around the ground. They're feeling it.
"bangs it in and Nurse pulls, this time properly, to deep midwicket"
"full and wide - Hope doesn't expect it to be there, he's standing on leg stump, he's expecting a yorker in line with the stumps and as such he has to reach out, and in doing so he loses his shape entirely and inside edges the ball back to the bowler. Outstanding work from Shami"
"full toss on off stump, Hope launches it down the ground for a couple"
"full, slow and wide of off stump. Hope is again in the wrong position to deal with the ball. Toe-ends it back to the left of the bowler to pinch a single"
"sends in a stinging yorker on off stump, Hope jams the bat down and finds a single. Only a single"
"the reverse-swinging yorker turns into a full toss, which pings off the back leg and away to the third man boundary"
"yorker on leg stump, Nurse works it away to deep midwicket"
"caught at third man playing the scoop! Nurse does well - predicting this would be near the blockhole and would have enough pace for him to play a dinky shot like that. But it carries to deep third man, and Rayudu holds onto a high-pressure catch."
"low full toss, which Hope swings to deep midwicket. Two runs the result"
"<b>they tie it</b>! They tie it! West Indies have tied it! Hope carves a full delivery outside off to the point boundary, past the reach of Rayudu patrolling there."
