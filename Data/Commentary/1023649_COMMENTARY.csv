"beaten by a super outswinger. Shapes away from length on middle, the batsman's squared up as the ball whizzes past the outside edge. <b> 141 kph first up </b>"
"firm push back down the ground, Johnson bends down and stops it with his right hand"
"bangs one in short on middle and leg, Hughes ducks under that in anticipation of a wide, umpire reckons it wasn't one. Close"
beaten by the shape and bounce! Looks to punch off the back foot but is done in by the fizz. Too late on the stroke. Classic Johnson stuff this
"gets a thick edge that runs away down to third man, Sixers off the mark"
bunts one to point. Calls 'wait' immediately. Super first over from Mitch
"fire a full ball outside off, squeezed to cover. Crowd catch, they all go up"
"mix-up, Hughes couldn't stop and turn. Slipped over as his partner said no, the cover fielder fires a throw, but he's just in"
"steps out, gets to the pitch of the ball and boom! Lofted cleanly over mid-off. Super timing"
"fired full into the pads, worked to long-on"
whipped into the deep midwicket region as they jog a single
"huge roar resonates across the WACA! Steps out to clear mid-off, but got too close to the delivery and could only manage to hit it as far as mid-off. Simple catch. Bresnan didn't have to move an inch"
"short, wide and crash! Tracer bullet stuff. Lumb picks the length early and slaps that into the vacant point region. Didn't bother running. Johnson quickly turned his back on him"
"beaten for pace, hit on the thigh pad as he looked to nurdle it to the leg side. Maddinson senses an opportunity to pinch a leg-bye but nearly didn't make it as Johnson ran across and used his football skill to kick the ball at the striker's end. Would've been close had he hit"
"solidly behind the line of that full delivery on middle, blocked"
"shuffles across and flicks the full ball on middle towards deep fine leg, took a while to turn and was in trouble. The throw comes in on the bounce. Whiteman, who had a long way to go, collects the ball and breaks the bails. Maddinson was an inch behind the crease despite being full stretch. Terrible start this for the Sixers."
"rears up from length, Henriques gets on top of the bounce and steers it down to third man to get off the mark"
"way over the bowler's head, Paul Wilson reckonsTesting the bounce with the short ball outside off. Marginal call, at best. Mitch isn't happy"
"it goes from bad to worse for Sixers. Looks to smash the length ball over cover, but can only feather the edge to the keeper. Johnson knew it straightaway, the umpire took a while but that could have well been to see if the batsman walked off. Once he didn't, he merely completed the formalities by raising the finger. No real doubt there. Fiery start this for the Scorchers!"
works a length ball from off stump to midwicket
"pulled, but the top edge flies way over the third man ropes. The security man judges it to perfection. Genuine pace got him there, but it was a short boundary. Lucky runs but not something Sixers will mind as long as they keep coming"
"beaten by a ripper that nips away late from off stump, through to the keeper"
looks to turn it to the leg side but gets an inside edge back towards the pad
punched off the back foot to extra cover

"too full outside off, squeezed to mid-off"
"right into the blockhole, looks to drive but the ball swerves back in late to take a thick inside edge"
"looks to hoick that into the short midwicket boundary, but is deceived by face. Off-cutter this time at 126 clicks from Mitch. On the bounce to the keeper"
"firm push but Johnson puts his right hand out, almost reflex action, to stop that"
hops back and across to bunt that short ball back down towards Johnson
"poor ball, but is lucky to get away. On the pads, clipped towards Bresnan who cuts that off at fine leg"
"just eludes Whiteman. Looks to whip it away, the ball deflects off the pad towards third man. At first, it looked like he had got a thick inside edge"
"rides the bounce and controls the pull superbly, into the fine leg region. Excellent application"
"banged in short, this one nips back in from outside off, bunted off the back foot"
"on middle and leg, he looks to whip it leg side, but the ball thuds into his thigh pad and deflects to allow them an opportunity to cross over"
"looks to open the bat face late and steer it wide of the keeper, but is beaten by the bounce of the WACA surface"
"miscues a pull, but it lands short of the man coming in from short fine leg. Haddin looked to fetch it from outside off and was beaten by pace again"
"thumped over the bowler's head. Picks the length, stays inside the crease and lofts with a straight bat. Easily done"
pulled over midwicket. The agricultural heave but Ian Bell runs around 20 yards to his left from deep square and cuts that off. Full stretch and then puts his left arm out to cut that off. Saved couple of runs

punched down to long-on again
"width on offer, eased down to square third man"

steps out and drives it inside out into the gap at deep extra cover
"can't get to the pitch this time as he advances, stabs it to short cover"
"steps out again, can't get to the pitch but this time he goes through with the lofted hit. Effortless. Hitting through the line with ridiculous ease, carried all the way. Wow"
"this was slower through the air, Haddin took a couple of steps down the pitch, made room to free his arms and boom! Way over long-off. In total control even though he didn't get to the pitch of the ball. Are you available for the tour of India, mate?"
punched to sweeper cover
"tickled down leg. He's showing there is more to his batting than just power. Poor ball, length down leg and he rolled his wrists over that to get it fine. Lovely"
"pushed off the back foot to the man coming in from point, there's an overthrow at the bowler's end and Haddin scampers across. Henriques nearly ran two runs. Halfway down the pitch, then went back and then went across for the run with a full-length dive in the end"
chopped down to third man as they jog through
"full and straight on off stump from wide of the crease, firm push to long-off"
"into the blockhole, squeezed to mid-on, nearly a mid-pitch collision between Haddin and Tye"
"looks to force that off the back foot but is cramped for room, mistimed to cover"
punched off the back foot to deep cover
"clever, clever. Too short and wide, he opens the bat face to ramp that towards third man. Johnson was a second late to get off the blocks, but the ball kept going away from him. Excellent effort, though"
"the bouncer has done the trick. Poor shot selection this time from Haddin, who looks to fetch the pull from outside off, can only toe-end it to midwicket. Haddin reckons that should have been called a second bouncer for the over, which means it should have been a no-ball, but the umpire reckons that's fine. Haddin can't believe it and walks off shaking his head. Marginal call, at best again"

"bunted wide of point, third man comes around to cut that off"
"cramped for room, cuts the short ball straight to point"
"straight down the throat of third man. Silk looks to absolutely smash this to the point boundary but the ball flies off the edge. The pace has done him in again. Real trouble now after a brief revival. They're falling apart, and how. The crowd roars"
"similar shot, except this is hit with control and wide of third man. Botha had little more room as well and he controlled the cut well"
short and way over the batsman's head. Correct call. 'Booooooo' from the crowd
"eased down to third man, sensible"
"floats this full and outside off, squeezed to point"
"the length ball hurries onto him, dabbed to the leg side as they sneak a run. Johnson does well to run across and stop that, but can't prevent the run"
"looks to move to the leg side and glide it over the slips, but is cramped for room and is beaten"
"full and down leg side, flicks and misses. Abbott was a touch across the stumps. Could have tickled it fine had he stayed still"
"eased down to square third man, rocket throw from Richardson"
"late on the pull, gloves it down to fine leg"
"looks to back away and carve it over point, and misses.Shaves past off stump. What a spell, what a bowler. The crowd gives him a standing ovation as he collects the cap from the umpire and walks to his fielding position"
"defends, gets an inside edge to square leg"
"full and angled into off from wide of the crease, defended off the front foot"
"pulls but not in control, down to deep square"
"walks across to scoop it fine, Bresnan sees that and fires it wide outside off. He now looks to ramp it over slips but is beaten. Cleverly done by the bowler"

pulled straight to mid-on from outside off
ball gets big on him but he arches back and then angles it into the slip region. Just wide of the keeper.

pulled to deep midwicket this time

"on the pads, worked to long-on. Excellent over"

"slow turn, he gets forward and defends"
eased down the ground
"fired into middle and leg, the ball hurries onto Abbott who gets an inside edge onto this pad as he tries to work it to the leg side"
"holds up a fraction, lobs and then on the bounce to short third man"
"full toss outside off, Abbott goes down on one knee and swings across the line. Probably the shot was on but the timing was completely off. The ball dipped on him and he hit it off the toe end of the bat, Agar moved to his right, settled under the ball at long-on and then leapt up to complete the catch."
"edged, down to third man. Poor effort by Tye. Over-ran the ball, it looked like. Lazy effort. Failed to get down in time too. Sloppy"

"too short, he gets into position early and pulls him down to the long leg boundary"
worked from outside off towards midwicket as they scamper a quick single

"too early into the pull, misses"
"roars in joy! Ripper of a yorker, Dwarshuis is late on the attempted squeeze behind point. This was full, straight and too good for a lower order batsman. 'You miss, I hit' stuff."
chopped down to third man to get off the mark
"flicked into the short boundary at deep backward square leg. Full and sliding back in, swung cleanly. The breeze was in that direction as well. Super connection"
"another heave, this time from outside off, the ball flies off the top edge and the fine leg fielder comes around and makes a tough catch look easy. The leg-cutter has done the trick for Bresnan. Enterprising knock nonetheless"
"too full down leg, Lyon gets a tickle that beats the keeper and into the fine leg boundary"
"french cut this time, thick inside edge between bat and pad, down to fine leg"
"floats this full into leg from wide of the crease, he looked to swing leg side but was cramped for room, they steal a leg-bye off the deflection"
"walks across to flick, the bowler fires this down leg. Called wide by the umpire. Right call too"

"shapes to drive but plays outside the line of that outswinger, gets an inside edge onto the pad"

"too short, he gets on top of the bounce and cracks it to backward point"
"worked off his hip to square leg, of the mark"
biffs that across the line towards the short boundary at midwicket. Too short and he's walloped that. Cross-batted and he held his shape superbly.
thumped over mid-off. Too full and he brought his bat down powerfully to meet it with a straight bat. Solid
"another one! Too short on middle and leg, he swivels back and helps it using the pace, past square leg. Super timing"
"crunching cover drive. Class, classical. That will be a boundary on any ground. Not a half-volley but he planted his front foot forward and simply hit through the line. What timing."

nips back in to hit him high on the left pad as he looks to work it past midwicket

"mistimes a pull, under-edge to square leg. Looked to clobber that into the stands"

"drifting into middle and leg, looks to stab that to the leg side, the midwicket fielder swoops in and fires a throw at the batsman, who deflects it towards where third man would be. They don't run"
"magnificent! Once again didn't get to the pitch of the ball, but the confidence with which he struck that was astounding! Straight as a dye, got more elevation than distance it looked like, but still went 82 metres. Straight over the bowler's head. That's gone. New ball, please"
paddled round the corner to short fine as they scamper a single
"cracking shot! Uses his feet, frees his arms and blasts that between cover and mid-off. Boy, how powerful was that. Start the tuk-tuk"

"end of an entertaining innings, and it's an ugly heave that has brought his downfall. Didn't need to charge the bowler especially with them being well ahead of the asking rate. Stepped out to heave, missed it completely as Haddin effected the simplest of stumpings. Exhilarating knock"

"flicked straight to backward square leg, looked like a thick inside edge"
stays inside the crease and bunts to the leg side

"squared up by the late movement from off stump, defended back down the pitch"
tucked to the leg side as they scamper a quick single
"pulled, and pulled well. Can't keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again. Too short, Bell is too good to miss out on those. Pulled from off, using the pace to generate the power."

"yorker on middle, squeezed back to the bowler"
"Bell puts in the dive to complete that run, short midwicket fired a quick throw but it needed a direct hit"
eased down to long-on as they jog the single

worked with the spin to short midwicket
"finishes it off with a maximum! <b> Third Big Bash League title for the Scorchers. </b> The entire team hares onto the field to congratulate Klinger. This has been a sensational finish to a super campaign. Tossed up over Klinger's eye line, he gets to the pitch of the ball and launches it straight back over the bowler's head, sails into the crowd. Done and dusted. Potentially tricky target in a big final, but they have cruised home without much fuss. The celebration can begin. What a way to sign off from the WACA"
