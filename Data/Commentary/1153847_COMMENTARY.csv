"digs it in, attacking a leg-stump line. Jumps across to jab it down towards short leg, from just around chest height"
"similar delivery, a little more middle-stumpish in line. Gets a long way across again to fend it down into the leg side"
"well bowled, this one leaps up higher while slanting across the batsman even as he takes that big step across. Has to drop his gloves and sway his upper body away from the line in a hurry"
"bam. Big step across again, allows him to swat the leg-stump short ball very fine, a long way to the left of the fine leg fielder"
"another bouncer over leg stump, this time Soumya elects to duck"
"that's where Wagner wants to be. Angling across to middle stump from wide of the crease, gets it up to shoulder height. Gets across and fends awkwardly, but down into the ground, towards short leg"
"ah, that's his favourite shot, looks so good too. Back of a length, angling into a fourth-stump line, gets back and across and punches into the cover point region"

"on the fuller side of a good length now, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"another bouncer, just outside off, ducks and leaves it alone"
"this battle continues in the same way, meanwhile. Gets this one up to neck height from that round-the-wicket angle, and he takes a massive step back and across to hook. Doesn't connect too cleanly, and he just about clears the jumping Watling behind the stumps"
"there's the surprise full one on off stump, almost a yorker. Big step back and across again, jams his bat down to block into the covers"

"short again, angles it across to off stump. Jumps across and ends up cramping himself for room, jabs it down into the off side"

"this bouncer climbs higher but ends up a long way outside off stump, left alone"
"has he edged that? Not much of an appeal from Watling despite tumbling across to his left to catch it. In the blockhole just outside off stump. Stabs his bat at it, but the noise is bat hitting ground"
"shortish on off stump, hops across to defend into the covers"
"digs it in just outside leg stump. Hops across, ends up caught between fending off his hip and leaving, and is lucky not to get a tickle onto it through to the keeper"
"and again, banged in just outside leg. This time Mahmudullah raises his bat high over his head as he jumps across, lets it pass"
"chest-high short ball on leg stump, pulled in the air, juuust clears the leaping Latham at backward square leg. Hurried onto the batsman and he ended up playing a short-arm jab rather than a full-blooded pull"

"short ball angling down leg, steps across and looks to hook, only manages to glove it, but it's a solid bit of contact, and the ball flies to the right of the diving keeper"

"back of a length on off stump, defended into the point region"
"back of a length on leg stump, tucked away to the right of long leg. Looks like Wagner might be tiring a little - these last few balls haven't been the real effort short balls"
"plenty of effort on this one, gets up to throat height on leg stump. Jumps across and gets on top of it to tuck it down to long leg"
"ooh, gets into a bit of a tangle here. Steeply rising short ball on off stump, and Soumya briefly thought of fending at it before ducking his head and shoulders under the ball at the last moment"

"another bouncer, another hook, having stepped a long way across his stumps, and this time he hits it in the air, towards Boult at long leg. He moves to his right and leaps in the air, backwards, but he can't quite grab on with one hand. May have fallen over the rope even if he'd caught that"
"short again, outside off this time, taps it on its head to pick up a single to third man"
"Mahmudullah gets himself into an awkward position with his premeditated step back and across. Wagner angles a short one across to a fifth-stump line, and he does well to watch it and keep his head away from the line while dropping his wrists"
"oh, shot. Shoulder-high short ball on the stumps and he rolls his wrists over the pull to keep it down and find the backward square leg boundary"
"short, angling across to off stump, jumps across and jabs it down into the point region with both feet off the ground"

"full on middle and off, jabbed back to the bowler"
"slightly slower, just as full, defended into thje covers"

down the track and that's a little reckless from Mahmudullah. Almost yorks himself while trying to whip vigorously into the leg side. Hits the inside half of the bat and then the pad

"slow length ball pitching on off stump, presses forward, waits, and defends with soft hands"
"flatter and a touch shorter, goes deep in is crease to work this through square leg"
"just a touch short, barely any width, but that's superb judgment from Soumya to transfer his weight back for the late cut to the right of backward point"
"shorter, wider, cut away fine once again and this time it goes a little uppishly, off a thick top edge. A bit of extra bounce"
"length ball close to off stump, defended into the covers"

"straightaway past the edge. Back of a length, and that's nipped away prodigiously from an off-stump line. Goes back and across to defend, does nothing wrong, really, it's just done too much"
"things are starting to happen here. The previous ball may have been playing on Soumya's mind here. Length ball outside off, and he plays for extra awayswing, leaving a big gap between bat and pad as he pushes at it from the crease without getting a stride in. The ball doesn't swing as much, and keeps low, beating the inside edge instead"
"full, lots of swing from just outside off, left alone"

"full again, almost a half-volley outside off, driven past the left hand of the diving cover fielder, and deep point is around to clean up"
"big appeal as the off-stump yorker, swinging in late, pops up to second slip. Was it a bump ball? They're checking with the third umpire. Nigel Llong's soft signal is not out. This is quite interesting... Did that bounce just before or just after hitting the bottom part of the outside edge? So hard to tell. The third umpire's given the batsman the benefit of doubt, and rightly so. Plus the soft signal was not out"
"ooh, loose shot. Starts to swing in from Southee, a full one just outside off, but Soumya plays inside the line, looking for more swing and a no-feet cover drive. Beats the outside edge"
"full again, swings in towards leg stump this time. Jams his bat down and gets a thick inside edge into pad"
"full, swings in towards middle and off, driven with the full face showing, and Wagner dives left at mid-off to possibly save four runs, that was well timed"
"back of a length, slanting away from off stump. Looks to punch away from his body but the ball doesn't quite come on, ends up jabbing it into the ground off the inner half of the bat"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and dabs to gully with an open face"

"in the blockhole on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off and middle, defended towards short extra-cover"
"nice length, fullish and swinging in late towards leg stump. Mahmudullah gets his front pad away from the line and brings down a straight bat to defend to midwicket"
"full on off stump, and even though it's swinging back into him, it's full enough for Soumya to get his head over without really getting too much of a stride forward, and drive crisply through the covers"
"lovely. Not quite as full, and a little wider. Doesn't swing as much as Southee wants, and Soumya frees his arms to drive to the right of cover"
"fullish on off stump, defended to mid-off"
"bouncer - well directed, rising head-high over middle stump, and a surprise weapon coming after so many full balls. Soumya looks to hook, hurriedly, and can't put bat to ball"

"length ball close to off stump, defended to the squarer of the two covers"
"bouncer rising over middle and leg, Mahmudullah ducks low and gets under it"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and dabs to the right of backward point, and calls 'wait, wait, wait' loudly. A good call, because the fielder dives right and makes a good stop. No chance of a single"
"very full, searching for swing, and finds it. Plays for the initial angle, across towards off stump, looks for the cover drive, and inside-edges towards midwicket"
"digs it in short on leg stump, and Mahmudullah rolls his wrists over a pull to deep square leg"
"bowled him, poor stroke from Soumya, and a fantastic innings comes to an end on 149. Length ball straightening towards off stump in the air, and then nipping back slightly off the deck. It's a lazy shot, perhaps looking for the single to get to 150. Looks to flick, plays across the line, and misses, and the ball clips his back pad and knocks back off stump. There was a split second's silence before Boult roared in celebration - it was almost as if he couldn't believe the partnership had ended, finally"
"back of a length on off stump, gets nicely behind it to defend into the covers"
"full on off stump, a bit of swerve away. Defended to short extra-cover"
"nicely bowled, goes wide of the crease and angles this full one in towards middle stump. Defended back to the bowler"
"good bouncer, rising shoulder high over off stump, and Mahmudullah looks to pull from leg-side of the ball. Extra bounce takes it past his top edge"
"in the blockhole on middle stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"another bouncer, this time Mahmudullah chooses to duck"
"swing from Boult, towards middle and leg. Liton is half-forward, and plays around his front pad a little to clip to midwicket"
"full outside off, leans into a drive to the left of mid-off, where Wagner makes a good diving stop"

"a bouncer over off stump, 131kph, zips through to the keeper"
"that's a top shot! Full and straight, plays a perfectly-timed on drive to take him to 99. Textbook"
"<b>he's got it!</b> Not entirely in control as he hooks a short ball, but it flies well wide of long leg. Superb innings from the captain - the century off 183 balls. He may have got away with a nick first ball, but he's been outstanding since"
"full outside off, a flat-footed drive away from his body. He needs to refocus now"
"full and wide, reaching a long way away from his body and square drives to deep point"
"good length outside off, 132kph, a well-judged leave"

"short of a length outside off, Das hanging back around leg stump and pushes to the off side"

"nice shape away, full outside off, Watling dives in front of first slip to gather"
"full at off stump, steered through point"

"back of a length at middle and off, defended to cover"
"a good short ball, over off stump, Mehidy sways out of the line"
"some late swing, full at the pads, flicked in the air to the leg side"
"<b>finds long-leg!</b> Wagner strikes with the bouncer, Mehidy can't resist having a hook, can't control it and the top sails down to  Raval who takes it comfortably"
excellent short ball and he just about manages to get himself out of the line
through to the keeper

"back of a length on leg stump, swings back and is fended towards leg gully"
"that's a wild swing from the captain, short of a length outside leg, throws the kitchen sink into a hook which has enough to just clear the rope"
"even shorter this time, he swings at another hook and is beaten over the top edge. Wagner may have offered some advice"
that's massive over the leg side! He's not holding back...a mighty swing in front of square as Wagner bangs it in short again
"that's well bowled, goes for the full one, it's a knuckle ball, clipped out to deep midwicket and the run is declined"
"that's a filthy delivery, a full and wide full outside off, he does well to reach it and slices behind point"
"a yorker outside off, jabbed to the covers so he can't get the single. That was an entertaining over"

"full, wide outside off, he tries to reach it with a drive but was stood on leg stump"

"short outside off, he stands and plays it down in front of short leg"

"a slower ball, full outside off, steered to deep point"

"back of a length at leg stump, worked into midwicket"
"pushed across outside off, left alone"
"very full outside off, steered down to wide third man with an open face"
"good length, straight, tucked into midwicket"
"a bouncer, down the leg side, he chases it with a hook but it flies through to the keeper...one ball left to try and get the strike"
"great take from BJ! Very short down the leg side, Watling flings up his left hand to grab it...then loses his footing"
that's a lovely piece of timing through the off side as he times it through point...New Zealand won't mind that
"full into the pads, kicks this away down to long leg...starts off the run but there was no shot offered"
"length ball, clubbed over midwicket so he's off the debut pair...that was a proper tailenders mow"
"a bouncer, angled down the leg side"
"full outside off, leaves it alone"
gets squared up by a length delivery and the leading edge pops into the off side
big appeal for lbw as this spears into the back pad but it's heading down leg side
"back of a length on leg stump, worked away to the left of long leg"
"back of a length, angling away from off stump, left alone"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, clipped into the vacant midwicket region, refuses the single"
"fuller, a lot wider, left alone"
"length ball close to off stump, punches into the cover point region and calls for a quick single. De Grandhomme sprints to his right from point and fires in a throw at the striker's end, and Khaled - who was slow to take off from the other end - may well have been out had the throw been on target"
"length ball slanting across, just missing off stump after it moves away from the right-hander to beat his hesitant forward prod"

"width outside off, sliced to third man"
"short outside off, pulled through the leg side to deep midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, left alone...bit of a waste"
"full and straight, solidly behind the line. Well played"
"round the wicket, full at off stump, defended"
"angled into the pads, turned down to long leg"
"nearly gets through with the yorker, a slower ball as well, comes off the toe end"
"short outside off, driven out to deep point"
"full at the stumps, he's getting more in line now, defended to the covers"
"very full, actually passed the stumps as a full toss, wide outside off...poor ball to the No. 10"
"that's a good short ball, over off stump, sways out of the line"
"<b>sliced straight to deep point!</b> What a way to go. Short outside off, he didn't keep it down as he tried to find the gap between point and third man. Ended up being a simple catch for Boult. End of an outstanding innings from the captain. He can be very proud of that effort"
"goes full, at leg stump, kept out as he pushes to mid-on"
"short outside off, left alone"
"full and straight, defended into the covers"
"<B>edged, given caught behind and that's the match</b> It's back of a length, just outside off, there is a sound as it passes the bat. The batsman called the <B>review</B>. Nothing on Hot Spot. What will RTS say? There is a small spike, so this will be upheld. BJ Watling overtakes Adam Parore as the most prolific New Zealand keeper"
