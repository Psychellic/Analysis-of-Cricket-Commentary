"<strong>beats the outside edge right away.</strong> Nice and full, angling in, Guptill plays for the incoming angle but the ball straightens late past the bat"
"<strong>Bam! here comes Guptill: down the track</strong>, takes a length ball from outside off and pumps it over mid-off, exploiting the shorter boundaries"
"<strong>full inswinger</strong>, angling into middle and leg, Guptill checks his flick and chips the ball away to the right of midwicket"
"very full and down the leg side, Bumrah searches for inswing and can't control his line. Leg-side wide"
"<strong>140ks</strong>, might full and outside off, Munro hastily jabs his bat down but the ball squeezes underneath his swing"
"140ks, leg-stump yorker, tails in slightly, Munro jabs his bat down in time and ekes out a single behind square on the leg side"
"dug in short, splice-jarring length, Guptill jumps back and diffuses it to the cover-point region"
"back of a length and swings back in, no room for Munro to free his arms. Jammed out to midwicket"
"inswinger, 136ks, but too full and with fine leg inside the circle, you can't bowl there, Shardul. Picked off fine of short fine leg for four"
"mighty full on off, Guptill can't quite underneath the length, stabbed only as far as mid-on, where Shami swoops to his left to collect the ball"
"<strong>the plan to Munro is simple and clear: hit a hard length and cramp him for room</strong>. Speared on off stump, Munro camps back and defends towards cover"
"dug in short and attacking the stumps, Thakur forces Munro to defend off the back foot"
"there's width for Munro, and there's the <strong>release for Munro</strong>. Slower variation from Thakur, 116ks, full and outside off. Munro doesn't quite middle it, but manages to hoist the ball over mid-off for six"
"banged in short and just a shade outside off, Guptill rides the bounce and plays it up to point"
"banged in short and swerves back in off the pitch, tucks up Guptill for room. Inside-edged onto the thigh pad? Given as a leg bye"
"dug in short and into the body, 137ks, Munro jumps back and across in defence"
"bumper, flies over the head, and through to the keeper. Belated wide-call from Brown. Shami isn't impressed"
"hip-high short ball on off stump, got to get it up higher, Munro lines it up and swats it in front of square - NZ had a man behind square - for four"
"pitched up and outside off, 122ks slower cutter from Shami, Munro swings so hard that he nearly swings himself off his feet. Beaten"
"Shami hits the hard lengths again, tucks up Munro for room. Munro shows patience settles with a dinked single towards square leg"
"back of a length on middle and leg, hauled over midwicket, Dubey in the deep to cut it off"
"off-stump ball from Thakur, Munro steps away and manufactures space and carves it over point"
"back of a length on leg stump, India keep cramping him for room, Munro flits around the crease to manufacture scoring opportunities. <strong>Down the track and biffed straight of Shami at mid-on</strong>"
"length ball on middle, cross-seamer, that's the length Munro loves. He lines up Thakur again and drills him flat and hard over mid-on"
"Munro moves outside leg, good response from Thakur. He bowls an inswinging yorker and <strong>nails the pads of Munro</strong>"
"lifter on leg stump, takes off after hitting the pitch. Munro is cramped for room once again. He aims a hook and gloves it over a leaping Rahul for four. Munro has rearranged Thakur's figures, he has given up 30 runs in his two overs so far"
"Guptill now moves outside leg, Bumrah chases him with a short ball, glided it past the right of deep third man. Thakur slides at the edge of the boundary, but ends up fumbling the ball to the rope. Thakur's bad night gets worse"
"bumper down the leg side, Guptill ducks under it. Wide called"
"short and tailing in from wide of the crease, fenced down to mid-on"
"short, and angling in at 139ks, tip and run to cover"
"on a length, 116ks, slower offcutter, Munro reads the change-up. Opens the bat-face and dinks it to point"
"122ks another slower ball, cuts away just a shade outside off, Munro aims to force the pace and hit against the line. Instead, he is hit on the back thigh, pitched outside leg"
"really full and on the pads, this seam-up ball is whipped into the leg side, Pandey fumbles and NZ get two"
"back of a length and on the hips, slower one, Guptill picks it up, delays his whip, and sends it over square leg"
short and angling into a leg-side clip to deep midwicket on middle stump
Munro backs away outside leg and drills one away to mid-off
"slower bouncer down the leg side, wide"
"short at the body, flapped away in front of square"
"bumper on middle, flies off the surface, Guptill hooks and connects with a whole lot of thin air. Wide called"
"<strong>slower offcutter,</strong> 121ks from Shami, Guptill works it away through midwicket and hares back for the second"
"Guptill clears the longer end of the ground. <strong>Regal shot from Guptill.</strong> Length ball on middle, he plants his front leg and lofts it over wide long-on for six. What a way to close the Powerplay"
"dragged down outside off and angling away further from over the stumps, slashed away in the gap at cover"
"flat and spins away outside off, Guptill stands up tall and punches a single down to long-off"
"wrong'un? Short and outside off, Munro sits back and flashes it through the covers. Yup, it was the googly"
"looks slower and tossed up just a shade outside off, Munro swings for the hills...and misses"
"darted shorter and wider, smeared away to deep point"
"Guptill shows his ace early, ventures down the track, Chahal lets rip a quicker googly and pings the thigh pad"
"on a length and angling away outside off, Munro steps away, manufactures more room for himself and punches on the up straight of mid-off for four"
"shorter and outside off, cracked off the back foot to deep point"
"shortish and on middle, not enough room for Guptill to work with, tapped down to long-on"
"very full on middle, Munro jumps outside the line of the stumps, and drives to sweeper with a slicing motion"
"<strong>Fine relay catch at the edge of the midwicket boundary from Rohit.</strong> Back-of-a-length slower ball, 119ks, cramps Guptill on the pull. He can't manufacture enough pace for himself and splices a pull. Rohit gets under the ball at the midwicket boundary, catches it, but the momentum causes him to fall back beyond the rope. He shows good presence of mind, tosses the ball into play, then jumps back in to snaffle it. Much-needed breakthrough for India"
"back of a length and aimed at off off stump, Munro punches a single down to long-on"
"wrong'un outside off, pushed out to sweeper cover"
"good length and slides back in at off, Williamson taps it back"
"looped up and outside off, stretches out and drives straight to short cover"
"hard-spun legbreak, starts on off and breaks away, run away towards short third man with soft hands"
"shorter and breaks away outside off, Williamson waits for the ball to turn, then cuts it away behind point"
"tossed on leg stump and breaks back in, Munro miscues a slog-sweep over square leg"
"Dube, like the other senior pacers, hits a hard length but the line is a touch wider. Stabbed to cover"
tapped to the off side
"banged in on leg stump, bounces over the glove as Munro does not connect with a hook. Not called a wide"
"back of a length, chest-high ball, swatted through the leg side"
"nip-backer from a length, Williamson is caught in the crease and ekes out an inside-edge onto the front pad, then ricochets onto the back pad. India decide against a review"
"Williamson collapses his back leg, runs down the track and lifts it inside-out over extra-cover for a flat six Quality ball-striking"
"shorter wrong'un outside off, Munro slashes at it and outside-edges it past the left of Rahul, the ball streaks away to the left of deep third man"
"another googly, Munro searches for the reverse-swat...and misses"
"pushed through on leg stump, down the track and Munro muscles a slog-sweep to deep midwicket"
"dragged down on middle, Williamson rocks back and flaps a pull to deep midwicket"
'caaaaatch' is the cry from Chahal but Munro slog-sweeps this googly off the stumps and gets it wide of Dube at deep square leg
"on the pads once again, swept away to short fine leg, where Bumrah fumbles and gives up a single"
"swings hard, but ends up inside edging the full ball on middle to short fine leg"
"<b>whooooo</b>! Dude looks awesome even when he slogs. Williamson spots a length ball, clears the front leg and launches it over midwicket."
"<b>agaaaaaaain</b>! This time he moves across his stumps, almost as if he knew the bowler would be compensating, trying to bowl closer to off stump. Excellent batting from Williamson as he swings away to the square leg boundary"
"dabs the back of a length ball to third man, aka the Williamson"
"<b>taken at square leg</b>. Thakur is under the pump. He doesn't have the pace to frighten batsmen, which is apparent from his being clubbed all over the park. So he backs himself to take all the pace off. An offcutter that he hits into the pitch. Munro has to wait a tad bit - and he does - before going for the pull but the simple fact there is not so much pace to work with means the shot goes straight to the fielder. Long square boundaries here, remember"
"short on off stump, taps it to backward point"
"very straight and full, tucks it down to short fine leg"
"<b>taken at short fine leg</b>. This is the spinner's plan. Cramp the batsmen. Deny them room to swing. Jadeja targets leg stump. It's very quick as well. De Grandhomme plays the orthodox shot - the most sensible shot - a leg glance, but he forgets to place it. Straight to Dube"
works the full ball on leg stump to short fine leg
nudges a full ball on middle to deep square leg
"very quick on middle and Taylor is nearly caught unawares. Has to hurry into his flick to midwicket, otherwise he'd be lbw"
flicks a length ball on middle to wide long-on. Excellent over from Jadeja. His faster than light darts are not allowing batsman to swing their arms quite so easily
"attempts a flick off the pads, but Dube is getting just enough nip off the pitch that he beats the inside edge. Single though, towards midwicket"
dabs a shortish delivery outside off to deep third man
<b>half-chance</b>! Chahal might have gobbled it up had he been right on the boundary! The pull shot would have sat straight in his lap at deep square leg. None of the Indians on the field are happy about that. And Chahal himself only offers a grimace
steers a good length ball behind point
steers the back of a length ball to deep third man
"good slower ball. For one, it's wider of off stump. For another, it doesn't allow the batsman to get under it. All that means Taylor, who prefers the leg side, has to drag it and try as he might, with a roll of the wrist to boot, the ball doesn't even go off the pitch"
"makes room now with Jadeja targeting his pads, but there's no run to the drive to cover"
backs away and cuts the flatter delivery on middle to deep point
"full on off stump, he drives to long-off"
"chops the ball off the stumps, but he doesn't time it at all. Single towards extra cover when he is aiming point"
<b>back of the bat</b>! This is genius from Taylor. He knows Jadeja is firing them in. He knows it is all on the stumps. So Taylor steps forward and reverses it to the right of short third man
"<b>that's maasssssive</b>. That's Ross Taylor from the IPL all those years ago, when he plants himself on one knee and sweeps everything that is  bowled at him over the square leg boundary. Vicious hit."
poor line from Shami. Too far down leg. Too short as well. Williamson reads it every early and swings it over the left of short fine leg
"slower ball on middle and off, Williamson turns it to deep square leg"
"<b>Chahal misfields again</b>. He's the man this slog targets at deep midiwicket and having missed out on a catch earlier by standing too far inside the boundary, this time he backtracks towards the fence and as a result gets a bad bounce and the ball just leaps past his outstretched hands and into the rope"
launches it over deep square leg! Length. Cannot bowl length with Eden Park's short boundaries. Taylor clears deep square leg comfortable
"<b>monster hit, straight down the ground</b>! We're going to revise that predicted score. NZ are pretty much there already, with four overs left!"
"goes full and straight this time - he simply has to, every single ball - and Taylor swings it out to deep midwicket"
"short and wide, he cuts to point. Ooooh, Taylor's good with that shot. Perhaps the lack of pace and the ball being way outside off makes him mistime it"
"sweeps and finds the boundary again. <b>that's the 50-partnership</b>. With the ball sliding into leg stump, Wiliamson has an easy put-away, especially with fine leg up"
<b>that's an outstanding shot</b>! Chahal tries the trick that made a bunny out of Maxwell - the wide legbreak with no pace. But Williamson is a more allround player. He just stands up and swats it through extra cover. It's very hard to get enough power to get that to the boundary
"takes the pace off and tosses the ball up. Williamson looks to slog sweep it away. But he's through the shot before the ball arrives. Good work from Rahul behind the stumps, taking the bails off in a flash, but Williamson has not strayed"
"<b>fifty off only 25 balls</b> - that's faster than NZ's designated dasher up the order, Munro!. Who says this guy hasn't cracked all three formats?! Sizes up the short ball outside off and clatters a pull shot to the midwicket boundary"
"<b>eeeexcellllent bowling!</b>! He goes for that gloriously wide legbreak. It actually is a wide. The umpire would've given it had Williamson not gone after the ball, looking to drag it over to the leg side. Adding to the sucker punch is the pace of the ball - so very slow. so very tempting to hit across the line. Williamson is drawn into making the mistake, gets a top edge and gets caught out near the point region"
<b>unbelievable bowling</b>. Nobody in world cricket really picks the BUmrah slower ball. He runs in at the same pace. There is no change in arm speed. Just that the ball comes out at an utterly weird pace and even Taylor is left searching for it outside off
whips the near yorker outside off to long-on
"full toss on off stump, guides it to cover"
"<b>no timing</b>! He looks for the front foot pull down the ground, but the short ball is climbing on Taylor, way too high for him to control it properly"
"<b>taken at long-on</b>. The slower ball does the trick for Bumrah again. Seifert is left reaching in front of his body as he tries to heave it over extra cover. The lack of pace means he's onto the ball sooner than he'd like, drags it down the ground and ends up caught. <b>The best death bowler in the business</b>"
"pushes the low full toss to long-on. <b>That's only four runs, and a wicket, off the over</B> in a game where 10-plus has been the norm. Amazing!"
<b>juuuuuust misses his mark</b> and he's mercilessly punished. Only a few inches off the yorker allows Tayor to clear the front leg and hack it to the wide long-on boundary
"saves a boundary, Chahal makes a little amends! Shami goes slow and wide outside off. Taylor crashes it through extra cover, looking for four, but he is not allowed that by the fielder, running hard and putting his body on the line"
"<b>excellent bouncer</b>! Taylor doesn't expect it. He's on the front foot and he's late in adjusting to the change of length. Tries to hack it to midwicket, doesn't get anything"
off the toe of the bat to long-off as Shami goes full and wide outside off. Good recovery from Shami
length ball and he gets away with it! Not good work from Santner who tries to biff it down the ground and doesn't really time it as well as he should
"<b>lovely work from Shami again</b>. He sees Taylor walking down the pitch at him and immediately goes wide of his reach outside off. The batsman is obliged to reach out for the ball, losing all his balance, and only getting a single to cover"
"swings hard, but it comes off the splice of the bat! A short ball keeps coming up at him, Taylor pulls to deep midwicket. He is happy for a single, Pandey overruns the ball without picking it up, Jaddu who is back up, sends the throw, but it's wide of the bowler, Bumrah misfields, and they get overthrows"
"length on off stump, heaves it over to long-on <b>But Bumrah has gone down</b>! He is not getting up either. He tries to, but then grimaces and stays down. Replays show his left boot lands awkwardly on the side of the drop in pitch and with all his weight going into the follow through, he rolls his ankle. <b>However, after a little treatment, he feels ready to lace those boots back up and go again</b>. India are usually very cautious with Bumrah. They must think this isn't too big a deal to leg him continue like this, especially seeing as he's just come back from a different injury"
top edge clears short fine leg running back. <b>That's Taylor's first T20I half-century in six years</b>. Gets it with a front foot pull. It's been a bit of a go-to shot this innings
"low full toss which he heaves to deep midwicket. Taylor wants the second, Pandey sends in a hard and flat through, but it's just a little wide. Rahul tries to deflect it onto the stumps, like Dhoni does, but he can't pull it off"
"slogs hard, but the ball is quickly onto him, forcing him to mistime the pull to long-on"
walks across and pulls the short ball to deep fine leg. Excellent finish from India.
"on a length and swinging away against the angle, Rohit dabs it in the gap at backward point and gets off the mark"
"shorter and attached with width outside off, slashed off the back foot to Munro at backward point"
whipped with the incoming angle through backward square leg as Southee errs too full
"wide of the crease, pitched up and holds its line outside off. Rahul opens the bat-face and taps down to deep third man"
"wide of the crease, full and on a fourth-stump line again, but not quite driveable length. Pushed to mid-off instead"
"<strong>Southee gets it to skip one past the outside edge</strong>. On a length, angling in, tricks the batsman into poking at the angle but the ball seams away past the bat. Excellent over first-up from Southee"
"Santner goes too full on off stump, Rahul gets underneath the length, and smacks it over the top of extra-cover"
"dragged down leg, bursts out of Seifert's gloves"
"Santner hits a hard length and gets it to <strong>fizz through outside off, at 99ks, </strong>and beats the outside edge"
"Now, it's Rohit's turn to go over the top. Tossed up on middle, right in the swinging arc. He clears his front leg and launches it over mid-on"
"<strong>Santner finds turn with the new ball and scalps Rohit.</strong> He slows his pace down briefly and gets it to break away outside off. Rohit aims to slog-sweep against the turn from an off-stump line and skews a catch to backward point, where Taylor settles under it"
"pitched up and outside off, driven through the line to long-off"
"long-hop outside off, Rahul has all the time in the world to jump back and clatter a pull over the top of mid-on for four"
"back of a length and zips away outside off, seams away, beats the outside edge. Thuds into the gloves of Seifert"
"back of a length and outside off, Kohli plants his front leg, lines it up and pings it over mid-on for four"
"fractionally short and angling in at off stump, whipped away with the angle to deep square leg"
"wide of the crease, Bennett ventures a slower ball and slips down the leg side. Decent take from Seifert"
"another slower ball, full on middle, glanced away square of short fine leg. <strong>That's the knuckle ball from Bennett</strong> - that got him reward in the Super Smash"
"too full and straight, 138ks, picked off through midwicket for a double"
"on a length and slanting in at off, Bennett takes pace off the ball again, gives Kohli no room. Quietly worked off the back foot through the square-leg region for one"
"<strong>Tickner has been taken over the long-off fence</strong>. Offcutter, 120ks, but too full. Kohli stretches out and smokes it through the line. Clears the longer boundary with ease"
"<strong>Tickner cranks it up to 138ks,</strong> hits the pitch and swerves away. Opens up Kohli and skips past the outside edge"
"back of a length and arrowed at off stump, tipped away towards short third man"
"back of a length and speared at middle, at 142ks, rushes Kohli for pace. Squeezed to cover"
"really full and middle and leg, knocked away towards midwicket"
"Kohli jumps outsidde leg stump, Tickner follows him with a<strong> rapid, inswinging yorker</strong>. Dug out through square leg"
"wide of the crease, shortish on off, clipped off the back foot through midwicket"
"chest-high short ball, angling into middle, Kohli swive-pulls it away, all along the carpet, to deep midwicket"
"Rahul backs away outside leg, Southee follows him with a slower ball. Legcutter. Rahul still manages to carve it away behind point"
"off-stump yorker, directed down to short third man"
"on a length and angling in at off, not a bad ball, but Rahul looks it worse with some incredible wristwork. He shovels it up and over square leg for six. Kohli is thrilled at the other end"
"Southee runs in hard, hits the pitch harder. Lifter on middle, cramps Rahul on the hook and draws a top-edge but it neither carries to the keeper or short fine leg. Sails over them to the fine-leg boundary"
"full-toss outside off, Kohli reaches out for the ball and stabs it away towards long-off"
"What have you done, NZ? They miss a run-out, they miss two chances off one ball. Back of a length on off, possibly a slower ball, Rahul tips it to cover, and it results in a mix-up between the wickets. Kohli is halfway down the pitch, Rahul is ball-watching and takes off so very late. Southee misses the stumps at the non-striker's end, the ball trickles away towards mid-on, who also can't throw down the stumps. Rahul finally makes it to the safety of his crease"
"back of a length on middle, muscled to mid-on"
"banged in short and aimed at the body, Kohli backs away and swats a pull between deep square leg and deep midwicket"
"Kohli backs away outside leg again, he loses his balance as he meets another short ball. Hooked to deep square leg"
"Bennett hits that splice-jarring length once again, attacks Rahul's stumps, this is flapped away through midwicket"
"tossed up on middle, non-turner, eased down to long-off, and that's the fifty stand between Rahul and Kohli"
"fuller on middle and leg, slider, Kohli stretches out and hits it down to long-on"
"shorter and spins away outside off, Rahul gets on top of it and middles a cut to the left of sweeper. Fine save from Taylor in the outfield"
"dangled up wide of off and spins away further, well past the tramline. Off-side wide"
"front-of-the-hand slider, short, pumped down to long-on"
another off-side wide from Sodhi
"another front-of-the-hand slider outside off, back of a length and outside off, Kohli jumps back and fiercely swats it over midwicket"
"flighted and spins away a touch outside off, laced with a spin to wide long-off"
"on a length on middle, forward and pushed down to long-off"
"arrowed in at the pads, Rahul hangs back and punches towards long-on"
"on a length and drifts in on middle, Rahul resolutely defends off the front foot"
"Rahul backs away outside leg, aiming to open up the off side. However, Santner chases him with a shortish ball. Rahul adjusts and slams it over the head of the bowler. Kohli enjoyed that as well, patting Rahul on his shoulder"
"Santner darts another short ball outside off, Rahul jumps deep in the crease and slap-pulls it over long-off for six"
"Santner slows it up and shifts his line much wider. Finds some turn as well, having Rahul slice the ball over cover"
"back of a length on middle and leg, clipped off the pads to deep square leg"
"<strong>Sodhi runs in from deep third man, but can't take this skier</strong>. He runs across, then plunges forward, but doesn't even get his fingertips to the ball. Tickner has a wry smile on his face. Back of a length and outside off, Kohli looks to slog it over midwicket, instead top-edges it and gets away. A life each for Kohli and Rahul"
picked away through backward square leg for a double
"bouncer outside off, Kohli shimmies out and bails out of the hook in the end"
"on a length and outside off, 141ks, punched down to long-on and that's a front-foot no-ball from Tickner"
"<strong>Rahul brings up India's 100 and his fifty with one blow</strong>. Slower ball, short and sits up outside off, he rocks back and flat-bats it powerfully over long-on for six. That free-hit is going to hurt NZ"
"on a length and on middle and leg, punched down to long-on"
Kohli ventures down the track and drives a full ball outside off to sweeper cover
"spinning down the leg side, googly gone awry, wide"
"fuller and on the pads, shovelled away to deep midwicket"
"front-of-the-hand slider, off-side wide. Sodhi is rattled and loses his line once again"
"back of a length on middle and leg, punched away through midwicket"
chopped from off stump to short third man
"skids on off stump, punched down to long-on off the back foot"
"dragged down outside off, is Sodhi trying offbreaks? Swatted down to long-on off the back foot"
Sodhi goes wide of the crease and spears another off-side wide. Nothing doing from Rahul
"Southee runs in from off and NZ finally hang onto a chance! Sodhi ventures wide of the crease, tosses it outside off. Rahul, having jumped outside the line of the stumps, then gets inside the line. He aims a loft, instead slices it down to long-off, where Southee judges it perfectly and gives NZ an opening. Who can bring the battering ram now?"
"perfectly orthodox punch through the covers, even as Santner tries to cramp him on middle and off stump"
stays leg side of a tossed up ball and tries to drive through the covers. Doesn't beat the man inside the circle
blocks a good length ball on middle to point
fires it into the pads and Kohli bends himself away from the ball to get the wide
drives smoothly to long-off
"gets enough  bat to clear short cover. He is deceived by the drop in pace, and the change in line. Iyer is making room expecting it to be on his pads again but suddenly it is way outside off. He reaches out for it and splices the ball over the infield"
taps the flighted delivery on leg stump down to long-on
"<b>Marty Guptill again</b>. He took out Dhoni in the World Cup semi-final. He takes out Kohli here! Outstanding catch. Unreal catch. Sprinting in off the rope. Diving full length forward. Never once looking like he was in trouble. And picking the ball up inches off the grass. Huuuuge pressure catch made to look like it is a foregone conclusion. But seriously, how did the ball get that far? Kohli is just looking to clip it over midwicket, perhaps looking just a single, but the leg cutter makes him lose control just a little bit"
"full and outside off, he drives to deep cover"
<B>crashes it to the long-off boundary</b>. This is box-office cricket! He doesn't want New Zealand to get any boost from the wicket in the over. Just backs away and thumps the length ball to the boundary to grab the momentum back
"lovely shot again, seeing the pitched up ball on middle and raising it with a simple front foot punch down the ground, He looks up for this chase, even with Kohli back in the hut"
runs a back of a length ball to point
sways away from the line of the slower short ball and guides it to deep third man.
flicks a good length ball off his pads behind square leg
"<b>oooh, good ball</b>. He gives it a proper rip, angling the ball in and getting it to turn away. Iyer is made to defend away from his body and he's alert to a quick single at point"
"shortish and outside off, Dube tries to whack it through the covers, but there's not enough room to pull it off"
"<b>launches it down the ground</b>. He gets the room to free his arms this time and he makes it count, whacking a full ball outside off past long-off"
<b>just over Taylor on the boundary</b>. Outstanding batting. He knows this is going to be on his pads. He's ready for it. Puts all of his power behind it and clears the longest part of the ground at midwicket
sensibly taps the final ball behind point to take the single. He knows India have enough off the over. He knows NZ are back under pressure
"<b>googly</b> that beats the left-hander who tries to slog it away off the back foot. We do, however, have a stumping review and replays indicate Dube didn't even lift his feet off from behind the crease"
"<b>brave captaincy</b>! The legspinner would be turning the ball into the left-hander. He's been having a poor match as well. But Williamson backs him against a couple of India batsmen who aren't that experienced and Dube, after showing great composure in the last over, goes looking for another six and is caught out at long-on. Good, pressure catch from Southee"
picks the googly and blocks it towards point
"full and outside off, he drives to long-off"
backs away and cuts the shortish ball off the stumps to deep point
"nails the yorker on middle stump and then grabs the ball as it is whipped back at him. End of possibly a game-changing over. <b>Only two runs off it, and a wicket</b>"
"shortish and angled into the body, but Iyer makes room and guides it to third man"
"direct it from point, but the non-strikers is safe. They pinch an overthrow as well. Munro the fielder as he runs in to stop a cut shot from Pandey"
"slower short ball - the knuckle ball - which he plays absolutely brilliantly, rising up off his toes, nudging it towards the wide open spaces at midwicket to sneak in a second run."
"walks around in the crease but Bennett isn't fazed. He goes knuckle ball again, wide outside off, Iyer has to settle for a single to third man"
"back of a length and outside off, he pulls it to deep midwicket"
gets up tall and pulls the short ball outside off to deep midwicket.
"slugs a tossed up ball from outside off, but since it dips on him at the worst possible moment, he ends up mistiming it to long-on"
"<b>stumping appeal</b> but Iyer is probably safe. He does go a little too hard at the length ball outside off - a sign that the run-rate is getting to him. As a result, he loses his balance for half a second, his foot coming up off the ground, but Seifert can't break the stumps in that time"
"<b>that's a very very good shot</b>. The ball is very wide, intending to steal Iyer's power away from him, but that would happen only if he was premeditating leg side. Iyer doesn't here, Just stands tall and cuts it away"
pulls a short ball to deep square leg
<b>launches it and India are back in this chase</b>. The pressure tells on the bowler this time - sliding a flat one and ends up bowling a long hop. Pandey keeps his balance and slogs it over midwicket
"tosses it up nice and slow, swats it down to long-on. Sodhi is done, 2 for 36, decent, but how much will that six cost NZ?"
"slower ball on middle, Pandey drills it to mid-off and takes off."
<b>that's incredible hitting</b>. He gets inside the line of a short ball and just helps it on its way. That's all he has to do with the ball angling into his body. Clever cricket.
gets up on his tip toes to nudge a short ball to midwicket
"slower ball cramping Pandey for room, he tries to make some himself, but ends up skewing it to mid-on"
goes wide of the crease for a yorker which Pandey thumps down the ground to long-on
"excellent stop at point, Tickner diving to his right to stop a well-hit cut shot. Iyer looks good here."
"<b>again, very clever cricket</b>. He sees the bowler coming around the wicket. He knows the ball is going to be on leg stump. So he walks across his stumps, keeps his eye on the low full toss, which is quite helpful, and whips it past fine leg. Glorious"
"walks across again and <b>finds the boundary again</b>! Iyer is absolutely bossing this chase. This time he has to deal with a cross-seamer outside off. He keeps his shape, he sees the gap wide of long-on and flicks the ball away, all cool-like"
"bangs it in this time and Iyer, walking around in his crease, is unable to pull off the ramp he's going for. Touch too quick for him this time"
takes the pace off and targets the body again. Iyer backs away this time to swat it down to long-on
"slogs a length ball on off stump to deep square leg. Back to Iyer, who looks like India's match-winner"
"the knuckle ball strays down leg, Iyer tries to glance it away, but the lack of pace means he doesn't have enough on it to go away to the boundary"
"<b>this is unreal</b>. This is why India have so much faith in Iyer. A hard length ball, coming up towards his chest. But he's just backed away and thumped it over mid-off"
he's playing mind games! He's winning mind games. That <b>he's got fifty</b> almost seems less impressive than the fact he's just owned Southee here. Knows the bowler is going to go full and so he just walks across his stumps and whips the ball to the fine leg boundary
flick to deep midwicket.
"short and coming up to his ears, but Pandey is able to swat it to deep midwicket"
"and for once he looks fallible, playing a straight bat shot. Isn't that funny, he's been whacking the cross-bat ones, the ones that send the ball behind the wicket, and the first time he goes for a straiht six, he misses it"
"<b>there's the win</b>! A six over deep midwicket, and that's just as well because India have looked utterly awesome in this chase. Stays cool in the face of a slower, length ball, waits for it to arrive and then smokes it over the boundary"
