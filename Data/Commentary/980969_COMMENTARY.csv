"flat on off, no room, and Khawaja pushes it to Kohli at cover"
bit of a mix up after Khawaja flicked that to midwicket and didn't want the single. Looked like Rahane wanted it and he came nearly halfway down the track but made it back in time
"and it begins with a four! Pretty short and wide, Rahane doesn't move his feet much but has enough space to free his arms and cuts that over backward point to beat third man for four!"
"it's a mix up this time and Rahane and Khawaja are at the same end! The short of length ball deflected off Rahane's pad to Watson in the slip region and Rahane, looking at the fielder, said no to Khawaja. But Khawaja had come three-fourths down the pitch and then Rahane took a couple of steps too before turning back and Khawaja joined him there. Watson didn't get a direct hit at non-striker's end but Binny came in from mid-on to collect and whipped the bails off"

Short ball and it went off Rahane's edge as he went through his shot early, it ballooned towards silly mid-on, Aaron didn't got for it after his follow through and Watson, for some reason, didn't catch it either. It dropped right in front of him"
