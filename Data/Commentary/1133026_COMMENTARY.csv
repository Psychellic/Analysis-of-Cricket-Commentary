Floats this a touch ahead of length on off, Samuels looks to run this down to third man but can only mange a faint little deflection that has been pouched by Taylor, who moves to his right to complete it. This has been a fine innings nevertheless. Is there hope still for Zimbabwe?"

"fired full on the pads, picked over the infield to deep midwicket"
"it's that superman Sikandar Raza who may have burst open the game again. Two set batsmen have been dismissed in quick succession. Hope fetches this sweep from way outside off, this was hit well and hit flat but Raza, who would've been well aware of the prospect of risking this for a boundary, dives forward, gets nice and low to pull off a stunner literally inches from the ground. Was in control and then he tumbled over nicely to ensure the elbows didn't hit the ground hard. <b> The soft signal was out, the third umpire is happy, OUT comes the decision and the crowd goes wild. </b>"

"this time he's gone trying to hit over long-off. Cremer slowed it down just a touch, Holder didn't quite get underneath the flight this time and ended up miscuing this, Raza keeps his composure at the ropes with the advertising skirting very much lurking behind him and completes an excellent catch."
"<b> has Taylor put this down? </b> Drifts away and turns a bit as he goes for a big booming drive, deflects off the gloves towards third man. <b> Yes, he has. What drama </b>"
"<b> Redemption immediately! </b> That's an MS Dhoni-like stumping. Hetmyer suffers a brain fade here. Why would you look to hit it out of the ground? Goes for a big heave over the leg side, swings through early and misses. Taylor whips the bails off in a jiffy. This is hara-kiri from the West Indies. Zimbabwe are alive and kicking."

"too short, he rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket. They scamper back for the second as the throw comes in wide"
"over the long-on ropes. That's massive, out comes the roar and the punch of the air. That may have just killed the game. Nicely tossed up, Rovman lines himself up and then slogs this out of the ground. Big, big hit"
"has he been stumped down leg? Third umpire is having a look but Taylor didn't seem excited. Wide signalled. This was fired down, he looked to tickle it fine but missed, replays confirm the backfoot was plonked back in time. <strong>Not out</strong>"
works this full and flat delivery to midwicket
"drifts back in, keeps a touch low as well, squirted back to the bowler."
driven down to long-off. <strong>Scores level</strong>
"deflects off the pad to short fine as he attempts an expansive sweep, but it doesn't matter. West Indies win and can now control their fate going into their final game. <b> This is West Indies' fifth-highest successful chase in their ODI history. </b> Terrific chase, terrific game."
