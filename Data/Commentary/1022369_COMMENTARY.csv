"shortens his length this time, angles one back in from wide of the crease, Dickwella firmly behind the line in defence"
"gorgeous! Half-volley outside off, he leans into the drive and just eases this between cover and point. Transferred his weight forward as he timed it beautifully."
"length on middle and leg, tucked to the leg side"

"<b> clears the infield. </b> This one lobbed high but eluded square leg. Dickwella was trying to flick this over midwicket, didn't middle it at all, top-edged it"
"in the driving channel, just outside off, Gunathilaka is happy to leave"
"authoritative flick! Lovely balance, super timing. Excellent work by debutant Faheem Ashraf too. This was sliding into the pads and he picked it away off the middle. Long square boundaries meant the fielder had enough time if he hared across. Good cricket"

gets forward and shows the full face of the bat as he defends the length ball on off stump
"drifts this into middle and off, Gunathilaka looks to loft over mid-on but ends up dragging it over midwicket. Not timed well,  but there's enough for it to trickle over the ropes. What's good to see is the intent"
hops back and bunts the short of length delivery to the off side
nurdles a length ball to the leg side as they scamper a quick single
"wow, Dilshan would be proud of that. Gave away his intent even before the bowler delivered. Walked across the stumps and scoops the length ball on middle over the keeper's head. Nearly carried all the way"

"angling into the pads, lovely wrist work to put that away into the gap at midwicket"
"<b> shot of the morning! </b> The kind you'd pay to watch. Not overpitched but Mendis leans forward, shows the full face of the bat and meets it with a nice high elbow to play that straight drive back past the bowler. Classy"

"offcutter, tossed up wide outside off stump, driven off the toe-end to extra cover"
"another short ball, this one's way over the batsman's head. Rightly called wide"

gets outside the line of the stumps and paddles it down to fine leg. Excellent running

"angles a yorker-length delivery on off stump, squeezed down to square third man. Neatly done"

"<B> nearly dragged it back onto the stumps. </b> Looks to bunt this behind square but got an inside edge, luckily covered the bounce with his pad"
"whipped away into the vacant spaces at deep midwicket. Superb running, <b> Babar Azam caught napping </b> Second time they've got two after hitting it towards him"

"<B> nearly sneaked through. Saved by an inside-edge. </b> Looked to flick this from middle, got a fat inside-edge onto the pad."
"<b> through his defence. Special ball. </b> Mendis was looking threatening and it has taken a special delivery to send him back. Angles a length ball on middle from wide of the crease, Mendis is looking to whip this leg side but the ball jags away late to beat the bat and hit top of off. He lets out a roar. Big wicket"
beauty! Jags back in sharply to hit him on the box. Deflects past the cordon. Played outside the line of the length ball. Top stuff
"dragged on! <b> Maiden ODI wicket for Ashraf. </b> Full outside off, no feet movement whatsoever as he looks to slap that through cover. Went hard at it, could only find a thick inside edge back onto the stumps. How the game has turned."

"ill-directed, length and way down leg. Easy call for Erasmus. Any sort of bat on it and it could've beaten the keeper and fine leg for four"

"<b> saved by the dive in the end. </b> Walked outside the line of the stumps to nurdle this to the leg side, Imad does well to rush in quickly and fires a rocket throw at the bowler's end from mdiwicket. May have been short had he hobbled, but Mathews threw himself full-stretch."

inside-edge but onto the pad. On the move as he looked to drive that on the up
steers the away-going delivery to point
"<b> sensational catch from Sarfraz! </b> He was moving to his left and had to suddenly change direction as Dickwella got a thick inside edge. It flew low to Sarfraz who put his left glove low to his left to pull off a stunner. Hadn't taken a wicket in the tournament coming into today's game, now he has two in two and two big wickets. That of the two set batsmen. Sri Lanka are on a freefall here"
"full and angling into the pads, late on the flick, deflects off the pad to the onside and they take a legbye"

"<b> Dropped. </b> looks to cut a full ball but gets a thick edge that flies low to Sarfraz's right. He moves instinctively to collect the catch. All good until then. But as he turned to complete the catch, he lost control and the ball bobbled out of the glove. Things happening. What a spell. He knew it wasn't a clean catch, perhaps and went up immediately. Superb reflexes nevertheless. Had it in his grasp till he lost control once the elbows hit the ground."
