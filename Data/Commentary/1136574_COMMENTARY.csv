"poor from Washington. Drifts this down leg, Lewis paddles this fine to beat the man at 45. Easy pickings"
"<b> just in! </b> Saved by a centimeter or so, I'd say. This was a direct hit at the bowler's end from short third man. Lewis jabbed at this and was late to react to Rohit's call. Somehow made it in the end."
"what a welcome! This is too short and down leg, this is like a scoop of ice cream for Lewis. Swivels back and helps him along the way to clear deep backward square leg."
"floats this full and slants this across, defended from the crease towards cover point"

"excellent yorker, right towards the base of leg stump, Lewis jammed his bat down quickly to keep that out. A single may have been on, but Rohit lost his balance at the bowler's end"
"slower length ball outside off, left alone but guess what? De Kock has let this through his legs. Four byes. Very poor.  Kohli fumes"
"slower ball outside off, but this nicely comes on as Lewis splits the gap between backward point and short third man. Siraj's bleeding runs already."

"short on middle, and angling across Lewis. Tries to muscle this cut behind square, but mistimes it instead. Through to the man in the deep"

"good length outside off, and Rohit punches off the back foot. Hit with the bat's open face, and comfortably played to third man"
"short on off, and enough room for Lewis to cut. But he tries to play this with hands that were too hard, and can only bottom-edge it towards the keeper"
"overpitched on off, and Lewis crunches this drive to Kohli at cover. Well stopped by the fielder there and has an aim at the stumps. Good comeback from Siraj. Only three of the over"

"half-tracker, and Lewis swivels to pulls this square! Rocked back onto his backfoot, and slapped this off his pads. Deep midwicket's sliding effort goes in vain. Another expensive Washington over"
tossed up full on middle and leg. Rohit comes down the wicket and drives past the non-striker. Almost a caught-and-bowled chance for Chahal first up
"good length outside off, and despite the ball staying low, Lewis manages to cut off the back foot to deep point. The throw from the deep is awry, but there was someone backing up"

"slower ball, on a good length. Punched down the ground - past the bowler - to mid on"
"full and wide outside off, Rohit sticks his bat out and jams this shot to backward point. He wants a risky single, and Lewis would've been gone if Mandeep had connected with the direct hit!"
"good length just outside off and another slower ball to end the over. Opens his bat's face and taps it to point, but Lewis once again wants a risky run. Rohit needs to put in a dive at the batsman's end to be assured of his safety. The ball eventually hits his elbow"
"full outside off, and zipping straight across Lewis' body. Tries to punch towards cover, but misses competely"
"short and wide outside off, and forces Lewis to reach at it. The ball stays low and he misses the cut once again. He's surprised that it's not a wide, but the ball was inside the tram-lines"
"<b>releases the pressure!</b> Two dot balls, but Lewis ain't wasting the third. Tossed up on off, and Lewis comes down the wicket to lift it over long off. Not even the best of shots, with the bat turning while hitting the shot, but enough power to clear the boundary"
"<b>second tier!</b> Full on middle, and slog-swept over deep midwicket this time. Once again quick to get down on one knee, and then Lewis' bat speed does the rest"

"<b>top edged, and taken!</b> De Kock gets under it and completes a swirling catch. Tried to flat-bat this over mid on, with the ball angling into Lewis' body, but he's through his shot too early, and comes off the toe end. It was in the air for a long time, and QDK had to run backwards for a while before the ball came back to Earth"
"full on off stump, and going across Rohit. Punched off the back foot to cover point"
"full on off and driven away from his body. Takes a thick outside edge, and flies over point to third man. Slight misfield from Sarfraz there, but manages to recover quickly enough. Virat ain't pleased though"
"short on leg stump, and this is cattle fodder for Rohit. Rides the bounce and pulls over the square-leg umpire with ease. No chance for fine leg either"

"half-tracker on middle stump, but bowls very straight. Krunal rocks back and check-drives back to Siraj. Aggression from the bowler, who takes a aim at Krunal's stumps... but doesn't throw it in the end"
"too short! Pitches on middle, and soars over Pandya's head. He didn't even bother playing a shot. Kohli, however, is not pleased, but replays suggest that the umpire got it spot on"
"soft appeal for lbw, but turned down. Good length on leg stump, and Krunal can't connect with the leg-side swipe. Takes the top of his pad and the ball trickles away towards cover"

toe-ends a lofted hit to long-on
"touch short, spinning away from outside off, Rohit slaps this to sweeper cover"
"he's not only picked the googly but also gotten himself right towards the delivery and hoicked it across the line to clear long-on. Chahal specifically drifted this across, Krunal ended up dragging it but he got plenty of wood on that"
"goes across again and fetches this slog sweep, on the bounce to deep midwicket"
"shortish delivery angling in towards leg stump, whipped towards deep midwicket"
"<strong>just lands short of a diving Kohli at cover.</strong> Nicely tossed up wide outside off, Krunal looked to reach out and go over cover but there was no timing on this one."

"right into the blockhole, dug out to the off side, nearly a collision with the bowler at the non-striker's end. Krunal receives some treatment and water. Small break in play."
"steps out and swings this length ball back towards long-on. Anderson put his left hand out but couldn't stop. The throw from Woakes was flat, Anderson collected the ball cleanly and removed the bails. Remains to be seen if the dive saved Krunal. No. <strong>He's short by a long way.</strong>"
"buffet ball. Short, wide outside off and Rohit belted this through point. No chance for square third man. Pretty similar to the first delivery. Very poor from Corey Anderson"

"rubbish ball. Full but way outside off, trying to bowl at that wide line to not allow Pollard a swing through the arc"
"has hit this straight to long-on. Dragged this from outside, bat face turned in his hand which meant there was no power and AB took this nicely running around the ropes. Clever from Woakes as well, didn't give Pollard much pace to work with as he rolled his fingers over the ball."
"beauty first up. Snakes back in from length to kiss the outside edge? <b> Hardik reviews immediately. </b> Woakes the only one to appeal for this one. <b> There's a small little disturbance, can't really call it a spike. </b> Nothing conclusive, so the decision has been overturned. Kohli has a word with umpire Nitin Menon, more like letting out his frustration."
"belted into the stands! This is a poor ball, tripe ball. This is too short., freebie for Pandya as he mucles this behind square"
"slaps this length ball, just clears long-off. This is back of length outside off, Pandya held his shape and waited for the ball before swinging through cleanly."

"lofted over the bowler's head, one bounce into the ropes. Clean strike down the ground"
"this has been smacked over deep extra cover. Is that a no-ball? Thought I saw the umpire's right hand go out as he bowled the delivery. Missed his length completely, looking for a wide yorker, and Rohit picked that away. Okay, so this isn't a no-ball."
"flat bats this full toss back over the bowler's head, long on comes around but Woakes can't get there. <b>The season's highest individual score</b>"
"he's hit this straight to Woakes at long on this time. Rohit won't get the hundred but what an innings he's played. For a while, it looked like he'd hit this well but Rohit knew there wasn't much power."
"sees the batsman making room, bowls this full and wide. Umpire calls this wide, but Hardik has the presence of mind to scamper through."

"yorker on middle stump, and Virat does well to dig it towards cover. Only a single"
