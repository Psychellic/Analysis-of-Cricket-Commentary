"good length on off stump, defended on the front foot"
"flipper, back of a length and headed at off stump as he backs away. Just gets bat on this cut to point. Afridi thinks there's pad on it first, though. He has convinced Morgan to <b>take the review</b>. It's not out, the pad is nowhere near That's their review gone"
