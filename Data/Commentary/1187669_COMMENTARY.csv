"full, 120kph and diving in from outside off stump as Guptill has a yahoo and misses"
"smashed off a length, easy-paced from Curran and <b>Guptill rocks back and belabours a pull over midwicket and away!</b> First runs of the day"
"shortish, 124kph/77mph and again Guptill frees the arms, hacks an inside edge through square leg"
"drops a little short again, Munro charges down and whips a pull past midwicket, not completely timed and Tom Curran runs gingerly after it"
"short and wide, maybe a slower delivery... <b>splatted over the infield for four more!</b> Almost carries all the way to the cover boundary, as Munro tucked in"
"pitched up, in the slot and <b>crunched down the ground for six!</b> First one of the day, just a lofted drive from Munro and it carries easily beyond the rope at long-on. Might see a few more of those..."
"short of a length, slower delivery and heaved away, again not quite timed but gets it in front of deep midwicket for four"
"length ball, pace off... <b>and pace back on at a rate of knots!</b> Smeared into the crowd at deep midwicket, bat swinging like a meat cleaver. Oof!"
"tighter line, this is swatted away through square leg for a couple more"
"pitched up, 134kph/83mph, nice and juicy - <b>Blammo!</b> Straight back down the ground and into the bleachers for six more!"
shortish outside off and Guptill carves it up and over cover point for a couple more as the fielders give chase
"slower ball, mistimed on the pull towards midwicket"

"goes full and wide, 136kph/84mph but that simply allows Guptill to open his shoulders and slap it hard through point for four"

"flights the legbreak, swing and a miss from Guptill... and Billings whips off the bails, too, necessitating a check with the third umpire. Don't think his back foot ever left the crease, though"
"floated up wide of the stumps, here comes Guppy again... <b>bludgeoned into the crowd at wide long-off!</b> Smashed hard and flat for six more"
"ugh, that's filth! Full toss, 'hit me' written all over it, and that's just what Guptill does, <b>creaming it into the top tier once again</b> - straight back down the ground this time!"

"banged in, 134kph/83mph and <b>top-edged over the keeper for four!</b> Not where Munro was aiming, but they all count"
"hits a length, Munro swings hard across the line... did he get an inside edge? Mahmood seemed to be celebrating as Billings collected the ball, but the keeper was focused on shying at the stumps as Guptill ran through"
"whipped into the leg side, <b>that takes him to his fifty</b> - first one of those for Guptill in international cricket since the opening match of the 50-over World Cup!"
"short outside off, Munro attempts to ramp but doesn't connect"
"dug in, 136kph/84mph and <b>swung all the way over deep backward square!</b> More pain for the England bowlers as these two make hay"
"gottim, <b>chipped to deep midwicket!</b> Some respite for England, Rashid making the breakthrough as we approach the halfway stage. Came off the toe of the bat as Guptill aimed for the pickets once again, securely taken by Banton a few yards in from the rope"
"flighted, on middle and leg, Munro sweeps hard but picks out deep backwards square"
"tossed up on the stumps, heaved off the pads and CDG fancies two, starts to come back... but Munro isn't moving! The throw goes to the right end, but de Grandhomme sprawls home"
pushed into the off side for one
"tossed up, swung away in the air, bouncing out towards deep backward square"

"short ball, pulled without great timing to deep midwicket"
"flipped over short fine leg, 137kph/85mph and he uses the pace to whip this to the rope for four"
"hurls this down fast and bumpy, touch leg side but gets away with it"
"dug in short, CDG clubs it but off the splice, <b>held by Vince running in!</b> Looked like a legcutter from Mahmood and it was completely mistimed, lobbed out towards deep midwicket - the longest part of the ground - and there's no mistake from the fielder this time"
back of a length and swatted leg side for one
"short, maybe a slower ball, Seifert backs away and plinks it along the ground towards long-off"
"tossed up, pitching on leg and swung away"

"pushed through quicker, jabbed into the off side"
"tossed up, gets collared again! <b>Carted high and handsome over deep square!</b> More humpty from Seifert, lifts NZ once again"
chopped into ground towards point
"fires in a well-directed yorker on leg stump, Seifert squirts it to backward point"
"<b>hammered down the ground!</b> Picks the slower ball, Munro makes room and extends the arms to pepper the stands once again"

"pace from Jordan, 139kph/87mph in the channel outside off, draws a big swing-and-miss from Seifert"

"fires the ball in full on off, dug out and Curran fields in his follow through"

"another full bunger, Siefert latches on and <b>dumps it over the rope at long-off!</b> Dismissively done"
"<b>timber!</b> Yorked in response, Curran finding his mark... Quick enough and tailing in a fraction as Seifert tried to make room for another big hit"

"ooh, not sure about that, Ross... goes for a cute reverse dab, actually using the back of the bat, but fails to connect!"

"yorker length, worked away"
pressed back down the pitch and they trot one
"ooh, a half volley, and scooped lustily over long one for a <b>maximum</b>"
"<b>it's given out</b>. Banton not happy. It looked like the first strike, on the front pad was going down leg fractionally perhaps and when it hit the back pad was well in line. It's gone to umpires call though, and that was OUT."
"worked away to the leg side, just settling"
"<b>oh!</b> That looked to be drifting away slightly, was a tricky length and Vince has spooned it straight to mid off."

"good length, drifting in and he leaves it"
worked away to the off side
latches onto it and sends it way back down the ground
worked away and the gallop through
worked away again as they rotate the strike
""
that shaped away from him and he sends that over cover nicely
"short ball, he goes inside and hoiks it over his shoulder towards fine leg"
"another short ball, Curran takes a swing and it's over the rope at wide-ish third man"
"full and outside off, Curran plants the back foot and clubs it over long off"
"back of a length and pitching outside off, Curran swings and misses"
"a slower ball, good length but it bounces high and is missing everything"

Bairstow plants the front foot and drives straight back down the ground as the ball slides on
and he's smacked that with disdain back down the ground too!
well outside off and a wide given

"Bairstow <b>beaten there</b>. Back of a length and rising high outside off, he goes to give it a good whack and gets a faint but distinct edge"
"and he's <b>gone!</b> Curran advances, it's going a good bit wide of off stump and the keeper does well to collect as Curran stretches to regain his ground. The bat is still in the air though as the bails are removed."
"half volley, he hits through the line and it goes into the seats over long on"
"a slower ball, and he chips it to cover. That was brief."
worked away and they take off for a single
"advancing, he clips towards mid wicket"
guided to the off side
pressed towards cover and they'll canter through again
"wide and full, Billings steps across and reaches but misses"
"No, not out as it was pitching outside off and missing."
"another full, wide one outside off and it's missing everything"
"similar ball and Curran latches onto it, punishes it down the ground"
"a few wide ones, that one's too wide"
""
"<b>wow!</b> Messy. Billings drops his bat coming through for a second. Fortunately for him, he has time to get his body over the line."

"well wide of off, Billings goes to chop at it but he can't reach it's that wide"
