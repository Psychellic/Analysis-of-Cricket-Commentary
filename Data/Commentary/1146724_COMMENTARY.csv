"stands tall to punch through cover, but gets an inside edge onto his right thigh. Ouch."
"how close is this? Very, very close and he's gone. Lewis has reviewed immediately, but I suspect that's just being very optimistic. This is much fuller, cuts back in to beat the inside edge and hit him just above the flap of the pad. But he was rooted to the crease, so the ball didn't have much distance to travel from there on. The on-field call was out, so all it had to do was just clip, and ball tracking confirms it would've done more than just that, on middle and leg. So Lewis has to walk back."

he's cracked this between cover point and backward point. Delightful. Opened his wrists up nicely as he backed away and then allowed the timing and placement to do the rest. West Indies are on the move now.
"goodness me, how powerful are those forearms? Much like a tennis shot, swatted away over midwicket for six. Short of length and angling away, Russell is deep inside his crease as he lines himself up to pull and then deposits this out of the ground."
steers this slower delivery to short third man
"sees the batsman backing away and spears this full and wide. Left alone, wide called."
"has given it his all, but no timing. Slices this but the ball bounces over to the square third man boundary. <strong>He followed Ravi Shastri's advice there: 'Flashed and flashed hard.'</strong>"
"he's feathered an edge, and the party is over. Extra pace and bounce but the key was the angle - from around the stumps. Russell is cramped for room, so is denied the free swing as he lines himself up to muscle over deep midwicket, got a faint top edge and Mushfiqur did the rest. Big, big wicket."
"edged, but the <strong>keeper and a widish slip fielder end up looking at each other.</strong> How lucky is Samuels?"
"so what if Russell is out, I'll show you how hard we hit it, Marlon seems to be saying. This is right into his swinging arc: too full. He stands still, swings this way over the long-on boundary and then reacts as if he didn't do anything at all. As cool as one can ever be."

"slips this full delivery down leg, excellent grab by Mushfiq"
"appeal for lbw as this slides back in to beat the inside edge. He was a long way across, so this is rightly been referred by Bangladesh after the umpire turned down the appeal. Let's see. Yes, yes, ball tracking confirms this would've crashed into leg stump. Once again because the batsman was rooted to the crease and the ball didn't have too far back to travel. Ramdin is also not all that tall. Rubel has done the trick and Bangladesh are chipping away."

"looks for a mow across the line, off a thick inside edge to short fine leg."
"this is simply brilliant at wide long-on. Liton Das, running across from deep midwicket, had to be aware of the long-on fielder running across fill tilt, so he not only had to move away from his line to prevent a collision but also at the same time have his eyes on the ball. It can be distracting at the best of times but he somehow managed to keep his composure and pull off a stunner. Coming to the ball, it was nicely tossed up, dipped on Brathwaite but he went through with the shot. And because he didn't get to the pitch of it, there wasn't the kind of power he would've liked."

"short, and walloped one bounce to the deep midwicket boundary. He was lining that leg side boundary, had his eyes there all the while as the bowler was about to run in. And when it arrived, he transferred weight back and pulled that away. Superb."
"thick edge and superbly taken by Mushfiqur. This was another short bouncer angled across, the heave is ungainly this time because it got big on him. Still got a thick edge but Mushfiq leapt high and plucked that out. Boy, does that put Bangladesh ahead now? Surely."

"slashed away to beat short third man off a thick outside edge. Ho-ho-ho, this is going down to the last over. Nurse gave away his intentions early by making room, Fizz went short and for the angle across, the batsman had enough room to swing his arms and that's what he did."

"backs away and drills this to long-on, <strong>now 14 off four</strong>"
"he has hit this really, really high into the night sky. The man at deep midwicket would have had his heart in his mouth because this was in the air for a long, long time. Ariful who dropped a catch earlier in the night was so calm and composed this time and took the ball with his palms facing the sky, Australian style. Surely this turns it in Bangladesh's favour?"
