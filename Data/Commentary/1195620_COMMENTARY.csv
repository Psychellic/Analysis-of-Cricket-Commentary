"length, outside off, nibbles further away, and <strong>beats the outside edge</strong>, as Stoinis looks for the drive through cover"
"length, and he looks for the drive towards long-on, and <strong>that's a magnificent catch by Salt</strong>!

In the end, taken comfortably, and Siddle gets the big wicket that Strikers would have been gunning for"
"length, just around off, and he defends"
"length, nip back in, and he places this to the right of point. Chased down to the deep point fence, and they take the two on offer"
"short, and he scoops this towards deep mid-wicket. Rashid Khan is the man at deep square leg, and has to move across to his left to field. The ball actually spins after bouncing towards him, making it easier"

"length, angles in from around off, and he defends"

"length, but down the leg side. Easy put-away with fine leg inside the circle, and Larkin just helps it along with a little flick"
"fuller, and driven back towards the bowler"
"backs away and whacks a length ball past point. <strong>That was hit really, really hard!</strong> Some urgency, at last, in the Powerplay. Not that the Strikers bowlers will mind this at all"
"googly, and he goes back to punch this. Cannot beat mid-off"
"<strong>got 'im!</strong> Fullish ball, and turns back in. Maddinson backs away and wants to go inside out, but is beaten by the sheer pace of this, more than anything. Through the gate, and Rashid spreads his arms wide in celebration, with that silly but trademark grin of his! RKO, anybody?"
"length, googly, and he drives to cover"
"shorter, and he backs away and smacks this hard. Cannot beat cover-point, though"

"Maxwell stands with an open stance, and looks to get a full whirl of the arms to a slower ball, around middle and leg. Plays it away towards deep square leg"
"length, and he looks to steer this towards third man. Too close to point, but they pinch the single anyway"

"<strong>that's the wicket they wanted!</strong> Agar hangs this one a little shorter, a touch slower around off, and Maxwell goes for the booming drive. Cannot keep it down, and Head takes a sharp, low catch. Maxwell, with that open stance of his, made it difficult to get his position right for the drive, and ended up playing a bit of a slog. Strikers won't mind that at all. If they weren't favourites already, they should be now"
"short, into his ribs, and Gotch gets this down towards fine leg"
"length, and he runs this towards point"
"little short in length, and he plays against the turn towards deep mid-wicket. They go through for two"
"fuller, and he comes forwar to defend. Off the inner edge, and trickles over close to leg stump!"

"length, and he defends this towards cover"
"length, slower ball, and he pats this towards sweeper cover"

"length, and he goes back and cuts with the spin, out towards cover-point"
"short, and he goes back and plays a whippy drive. Placed to the right of deep point, and made sure he put enough pace into that drive. <strong>Proper cricket shot!</strong>"

"length, nips back in a touch, and he plays this quite late towards deep mid-wicket"
"length, cut away towards point"
"length, around off, turning further away. Gotch plays for the googly, and then has to adjust to try and cut. Misses out, and that also just about hits Carey's gloves and drops at his feet"
"short, just outside off, and he leaves. Called a wide, much to the surprise of the bowler and the rest of the Strikers team. Was an off-cutter, and did seem to elevate up to head height, to be fair"

"fuller ball, and he looks to flog this through mid-wicket. Off the inner part of the bat, and goes to deep square leg, <strong>right down Rashid Khan's throat</strong>!"
"slower ball, around off, and he swings this elegantly towards deep mid-wicket. Fielder down there, though, and so he will only get one for that"

"slower ball, around off, and he drives this to wide mid-off"
"slower, straighter, and he nudges this towards mid-wicket"
"quick ball, flat down the leg side, and he moves across and tries to flick. Appeal for leg before, as that goes off the pads towards short fine-leg"

"length, and he backs away. Wasn't sure of what pace this was coming at. Seemed prepared for a change-up, and ended up late on an attempted glide down towards third man"
"backs away, and tries the scoop over the keeper this time. Agar is fast, full and outside off, and Handscomb cannot make contact. Admonishes himself immediately"
"length, dragged down the ground to the right of long-off"

moves across and paddles a full ball from off and middle down to fine leg!
"backs away and looks to cut a length ball. Just bounces ahead of Weatherald at point. He dives forward, but that doesn't carry to him either"
"<strong>that's a fine shot!</strong> Length, around off, and Handscomb picks the length early, goes down on one knee, and unfurls a majestic swat over mid-wicket"
"length, outside off, and driven back towards the bowler"
"short, and he looks to fetch it from outside off. Takes it on the cue-end, and it pops up, but lands short of short third man"

"length ball, and he scoops this up towards square leg...where it's taken! Smart catch by Short, diving forward, with both hands under the ball. Saw it all the way through. If you would want to defend 22 off the last over, most times you would want Siddle to do it"

"<strong>that should do it!</strong> Nails the yorker, and Handscomb can only get this down to fine leg"
"<strong>knocks off stump back again!</strong> Pumps his right fist, and he has bowled this last over near perfectly. Full ball, and Worrall backs away hoping to go inside out. Beaten by the pace of it, and that goes through his defence and takes off stump out again"
