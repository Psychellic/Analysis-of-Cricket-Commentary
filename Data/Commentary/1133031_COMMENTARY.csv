tossed up. Right up. That could possibly be in the 50s. And it's short and on the pads. He taps it to short fine
another loopy length ball. Shahzad has time to change his expression from shock to disgust before pushing into the leg side
"<b>and he's got him!</b> Oh this is...comical, really. Shahzad is sulking like he's been mankaded after facing bodyline bowling for four hours. But the truth is, it's just extremely slow bowling that has completely suckered him. Another loopy length ball from Gayle. Shahzad lines up, then decides to step out. Yorks himself and chips it straight to mid-off. Gayle is bemused. Shahzad shrugs...then pulls out a big celebration just outside the dressing room that hasn't caught Phil Simmons' imagination...absolute Under-14s stuff this!"

shuffles across and blocks a length ball
"pitched up on middle and off, clipped to wide long-on"
"throws it away by needlessly stepping down for a glorious shot. Good innings, nonetheless, but he'd be kicking himself for not finishing it off.

"that's outta here! Nabi hastening Afghanistan's pursuit of victory. Backed away early to xpose all three stumps. Gayle fired it in around leg stump and he stepped down, gave himself more room before whacking it over long-on"
"goes again, and goes bigger! This one's monstrous and goes, sits on the roof. A length ball that slides towards leg stump and he steps down, gets to the pitch and hammers it straight over"
and that's it! Back-to-back sixes to finish this off. Important moment in Afghanistan's history and progression as a top side. Comes down the track and goes big down the ground. Skews it off the outside of the bat but the power on that shot will do
