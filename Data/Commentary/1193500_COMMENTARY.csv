Wants to clear the man stationed at long-off, and possibly wanted to go wide of him too, but it's straight down his throat.

"<strong>there's the breakthrough!</strong> Bowls this wide of the crease, and pushes it through a bit flatter and straighter. Brathwaite stretches forward to defend, but plays outside the line of this. A maiden wicket for Hamza after Nitin Menon takes a long, hard look.
