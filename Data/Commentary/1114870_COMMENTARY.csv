"<b> dropped by Gannon at third man! </b> Wright steps out to flat bat this over cover but ends up slicing this towards square third man, where the fielder did all the hard work by running in towards the ball, but was on the move as it descended and couldn't quite hold on. Has to be taken at this level, or any level for that matter."
"plays all around a skiddy length ball that would've hit middle stump. This ball drifts away just a touch and skids on, Dunk looks to work it through midwicket when he may have been better off trying to play towards mid-on. Was a dead duck the moment it struck him on the pad."

"belts this to the cover boundary. Stand and deliver. Friendly length ball but there's plenty of width outside off, KP walked across just a touch but then he stood tall and used the width to slap that wide of cover."
"steers this behind point, good work by square third man as he came haring in to keep it down to a single"
"skiddy bouncer, he gets on top of the bounce and fends. Awkward bounce. But in trying to dish in an effort delivery, the bowler has overstepped. <b>Free-hit coming up </b>"

chops a cut to the keeper. Looked to thrash that over point but didn't have the room

skids through to hit him on the pad as KP looks to whip this from outside off towards deep midwicket

"the man at long-on didn't have to move an inch. KP knew he had mishit that the moment he made contract. KP gets this slog high on the bat, which doesn't give him any power, and has to walk back for a neat, little cameo. Heat are chipping away"

"this time he manages to upper cut that over the keeper. Short and angling away, this one had a hint of width, and Maxwell used the pace to help it away. He moved just a fraction outside as the bowler released, that may have forced Cutting to bowl it just a touch shorter."

belts this full delivery down to long-off
"<b> nasty blow? </b> This short ball smacked the helmet with the helmet then nearly rolling onto the stumps. He's hit right on the grille as he looks to pull off the front foot, this hit him near the ear piece as the helmet snaps off and goes flying. This however rolled away. Hastings immediately puts his hand out to say he's fine, but the physio is out attending to him nevertheless. Hastings was rattled by the bouncer alright but had the awareness to kick the ball away."

"he's got his reward finally, but not before McCullum has entertained everyone thoroughly. Courageous from the bowler to toss it up once again, this time it was the wrong'un which meant McCullum didn't get the power even though he was well forward, ended up slicing it towards long-off."
