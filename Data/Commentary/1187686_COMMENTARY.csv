"slight swing in the air, and slight nip off the pitch. Hits him on the thigh pad. Missing leg"
"only swing this time, and shaw defends it off the back foot. This is pitched on a length, but Shaw likes staying in his crease to these"
"really full, starts too straight, and is driven to mid-on"
"wide on the crease, and good to see Shaw get a stride in as he drives it to mid-off. India will like that the feet are moving better than they did in Wellington"
"slightly short of a length, and he is right back to work it to leg. Can't beat square leg"
punched away as Southee pitches it a little short. Can't beat the man at cover-point
"swing first up, looking for that lbw. Agarwal equal to it, gets the bat down in time, and the ball runs off the inside half of the bat"
"on a length, angling across him, Shaw throws his bat at it, gets a thick outside edge for four wide of gully. The good thing about all this is that Shaw's front foot is not cemented as it was at Basin"
"pitched up outside off, left alone"
"<strong>beaten</strong>. Has a nibble at one outside off, expecting it to swing back in, but the ball keeps going on with the angle"
"short of a length, rocks back, drops this on his toes, and sets off for a single. Positive start from India"
"slight swing, past the inside edge, hits the pad, but it is clearly headed down leg"
"on the money. Just fuller than good length, middle and off, swinging away. Shaw defends it solidly, but he is not forward"
"nice punchy cover drive for a couple. All hands with this one, but again his weight is tranfering forward, which is an encouraging sign"
"wide on the crease, really full, Shaw likes the drive, through covers, gets another couple"
"really full, nearly a yorker, Shaw digs it out to square cover"
"nice shape, slightly fuller than good length, driven on the up to mid-off"
"lovely shot. He might have problems with full swinging balls, but you give Shaw nothing short-of-a-length deliveries, and he will make you pay. Rocks back to punch this through point"
"slight swing back in, but Agarwal plays it late, and helps it along to fine leg for one"
"squared up a touch. Again looks to play from the crease, but the ball seams away a touch, opening him up. Keeps it down, though"
"another lovely drive from Shaw. Solid, down the pitch, Boult gets a hand to it, saving two. Positive forward movement again"
"on a length, slight movement back in, beats him, but hits him high on the pad"
"pitches on a length, middle and leg, seams away a touch. Shaw defends it back to Boult"
"short of a length, around off, defended solidly to cover"
"on a length, straight, Agarwal defends from the crease. Not much swing"
"wide on the crease, really full, left alone outside off. The ball moves the other way after crossing the wicket, and Watling has to dive to his left to save byes"
"wide on the crease, full, Agarwal is positive and moving forward and drives to mid-off"
too straight as he goes searching for swing. Clipped away for an easy single
"lovely shot again. It might seem a length delivery, but Shaw - a short man - likes to camp back and turn these into short-of-a-length deliveries. Punch-drives it. Away from the body, but great hands"
"lovely batting. Majestic drive. Shaw is showing the Sehwag comparisons are not entirely unearned. Southee pitches up looking for swing, but ends up a touch too straight. Shaw drives it straight back where it came from. Between the umpire and mid-on it goes. All along the ground"
"<strong>edged away</strong>. Agarwal is playing for the swing, but the ball pitches middle and leg and angles away. The thick edge flies wide of gully, and the outfield is quick despite the early rain. Three fours in a row"
<strong>slight tangle</strong>. Agarwal not sure which way Boult is moving it. This time he is really late into the defensive shot as the ball hones back in towards his pad. Keeps it out
"<strong>beaten on the outside edge this time</strong>. Finally a string of good balls for New Zealand. Agarwal looks for the swing, but this seams away after pitching just outside off"
"<strong>and he has got him</strong>. Out, in, out, in, and he has been given out lbw. Just like at Basin, Agarwal reviews with one second to go. This is really full, nearly a yorker, and pretty straight. Swinging back in. Agarwal's bat gets stuck in his front foot. As soon as the first replay shows there is no bat involved, Agarwal looks dead. He is hit in front of middle and leg, and the ball is taking out the leg stump. India lose their first wicket and one of their reviews"
"on a length, slight swing back in, hits Pujara high on the bat"
"this one pitches on a length, and seams away a touch. Again Pujara is hit high on the bat as he defends"
"nicely played. A length ball, swinging away, he plays it late, and opens the face to guide it wide of gully for another couple"
"but Southee remains full. No swing, and it beats the inside edge to hit him high on the pad"
"on a length, around off, watchfully defended to mid-off"
"on a length, no swing again, which means Shaw has to defend his wicket. And he does that well"
"bouncer this time, middle and leg, and Shaw ducks it. Good carry as Watling collects it overhead"
"on a length, on off, no deviation. Looks for the punch but is cramped up a touch"
"on a length, around middle and off, and Pujara doesn't know whether it will continue swinging or seam away. Is hit on the inside half of the bat as he defends"
"so Boult starts straighter, looking for that lbw ball. The ball goes with the angle, and hits the outside half of Pujara's bat"
solid front-foot defensive this time as the ball swings back in
"<strong>really good short ball</strong>. Pujara sways out of its line, but his gloves are not too far from the ball. He nearly got out this way last Test"
"<strong>wide of short leg</strong>. Swinging in from a lnegth, slight extra bounce, goes off the high part of the bat, but wide enough of the man stationed there"
"short of a length, not much carry, and Pujara defends to cover"
"another lvoely shot. Shaw is extremely positive here. Southee pitches up on middle, and the moment it doesn't swing away, Shaw is ready to naturally play it with the angle and wide of mid-on for four more"
and now he shows better judgement as Southee bowls the teasing delivery outside off. Left alone
"bouncer this time, Shaw ducks it comfortably"
"wide on the crease, full, drive wide of mid-off for another single"
"full, just outside off, defended off the front foot"
"full and straight, Pujara looks for the drive into the leg side, but finds neither timing nor placement. This miught be it for Southee this session. Shaw has negated him well"
"<strong>edges and short</strong> of slips. Boult in a good spell. On a length, around off, the batsman doesn't know which way it is going. He still has a hard drive at it. The ball goes with the angle, and for some reason dies well in front of first slip. From the second slip, Southee dives to his left but can't get there"
"short of a length, concedes a leg-bye"
"on a length, outside off, goes with the angle, left alone"
left alone outside off again. This is a length ball but carried in front of his face by Watling
"and signs there that Pujara has been spoken to about his intent. He sees a full ball and throws his hands at it. Very unlike Pujara, trying to muscle a ball. Slices off the outside half of his bat, and lands safe"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone, and this one bounces in front of Watling"
"full, swinging away, driven to mid-off"
"on a length, just outside off, defended off the back foot"
slight nip back in from short of a length and just outside off. Hits him on the thigh pad
"straight and slightly short of a length, worked to leg for one"
"down the leg side, worked away to fine leg for one"
"beautiful batting. de Grandhomme pitches this right up, looking for swing. He manages to get swing, but Shaw sees it is pitching right undet his head, and drives it. Carresses it actually. Through cover, all along the carpet"
"on a length, middle and leg, slight nip away. Watchfully played by Pujara from the crease"
"on a length, outside off, Pujara gets the front foot moving, and then leaves it alone"
"too full as he looks for swing, and Pujara drives this through straight mid-off. This one is there for the taking, and Pujara takes it"
"full and wide, left alone by Pujara"
"shape back in, but Pujara is equal to it and defends off the back foot"
"wide on the crease, gets some nip from just outside off. Left alone"
superbly punched down the ground! Lovely ondrive to this full delivery on the stumps
"squared up a hint by the length as de Grandhomme shortens it a touch, manages to defend back with a straight bat"
"width and he crashes this to point, good stop by Blundell diving to his left"
nips back in from length to hit him on the box. Shaw a tad late in rising with the bounce there. Ouch
"looks to punch on the up, rolls back to the bowler off the inner part of the bat"
"square driven behind point, this races away to the fence. All class and timing"
"full and swinging away, Pujara watches it through as he hides the bat behind the front pad"
rises with the bounce and defends off the backfoot
"short of length outside off, zips through as Pujara leaves"
"cracker! Nips back in and sneaks through the gate, <strong>misses off stump by a whisker</strong>"
shapes to drive but bails out of it at the last moment

right behind the line as he defends
"edged but <strong>doesn't carry to second slip!</strong> Poked at this, but ensured he didn't go with hard hands"

"goes yorker-length but slips it down leg, Shaw late on the tickle"
defends this incoming length delivery to the leg side
works this off his wrists to square leg
defends with soft hands to the off side
"big appeal for lbw, not given by Michael Gough. New Zealand review. Bounce to Pujara's rescue? He shouldered arms to this back of length delivery that nipped away. Impact may have been just outside off as well. Let's see. Replays confirm Pujara has been saved by height, <b> New Zealand lose a review </b>"

solidly defends this full delivery on the stumps again
gets well forward and defends this full delivery
"oh, ho ho ho! Nearly an edge. This is full on off, swung away late to beat Shaw as he played down the wrong line in trying to straight drive"
balance and timing superb as he whips this behind square for three. It was uppish but there was no one behind square
works this with the angle to square leg
"driven handsomely past the bowler and mid-off, Williamson with the chase as he pulls it back in"
"flicked down leg to the boundary. Wrong line from Jamieson, easy pickings for Pujara"
"dug in short outside leg from over the wicket, Shaw ducks under this one"
"goes for the hook, gets a big, fat top-edge, just clears fine leg. <strong>Fifty for Shaw but he nearly fell to the trap!</strong>. Just eluded Jamieson"
ducks under this short ball again
"handsomely pulled in front of square, straight to the fielder though"
"slants this full and across, left alone"
right on top of the bounce as he defends
"<strong>plucked out one handed by Latham at second slip!</strong> Shaw lives by the sword, dies by it. Looking to drive as this shapes away but he's late on the shot, gets a thick edge and Latham does the rest. This flew off the blade, absolutely flew, Latham flung himself high and happy, put his left hand out and plucked it at second slip."
"delicious little flick in front of square, races away towards the midwicket boundary. Kohli is away"

"Boult starts with a shortish ball, rising towards Pujara's chest, who keeps the fend down"
"short again, and Pujara ducks this one. Pretty straight at his body"
"on a length, around off, Pujara stays back to defend"
"pitched up, gets a bit of swing, hits the inside half of Pujara's bat"
"short of a length, in and around off, defended back to Boult"
"goes for the short ball, just outside off, and Pujara drops his gloves under it"
"and he has got Kohli first up but Kohli reviews with one second to go. This is desperate reviewing, and he will be hoping there is an umpire's call on it because there is no way this is not out. This is just too good from Southee. Pitches it up for the outswinger, the ball seams back in after pitching, beats the inside edge on the drive, and he is hit plumb in front. Wastes the review. Will hate it for Rahane or Pujara to get a stinker from the umpire now. Back to the delivery: this is the classic plan to Kohli. Keep bowling outside off for swing, and if it seams, you expose the other edge too. Tood good on the day. A less attacking batsman would have probably got an inside edge on it, but that was one good nut. Swing and seam both"
nice relaxed late defensive stroke from Rahane to start off with
"short of a length, into the body, defended"
"wide on the crease, Rahane leaves for an outswinger, but it keeps coming in with the angle. Not close enough to bother him, though"
"really full, looking for swing. Rahane plays from the crease but late and with soft hands. Hit on the inside half of the bat"
"wide on the crease, on a length, outside off, left alone"

"full, just outside off, defended off the front foot"
"short of a length, angling in, defneded down into the pitch"
"<strong>glove?</strong> Short of a length, angling in, goes wide of Watling, and the umpire calls leg-byes. Replays show this has come off the glove. Doesn;t go to hand anyway"
"full, on off, defended"
"wide length ball, left alone"
another leave outside off
"angling in, beats the inside edge, hits the thigh pad"
"full, swinging away, dipping on him, defended to leg by Rahane"

positive front-foot drive to a length ball outside off. On the up. Along the ground
"wide length ball, left alone"
"late swing into the pads, Pujara plays it late too, and guides it past mid-on. A good straight bat"
"lovely shot. Boult overpitches outside off, and he crunches this cover drive all along the ground. I could be wrong, but this might be Pujara's highest score in New Zealand"
"more stroke play from Pujara. He has got his eye in now, and is not missing out. Boult strays too straight with this swing, and he drives this wide of mid-on. The bat face closes at the last possible moment"
"on a length, slight nip back in, hits him on the thigh pad and belts out a half appeal"
"on a length, just outside off, inside edge onto the pad"
"wide on the crease, on a length, outside off, left alone"

another leave outside off. Three straight maidens post lunch for Southee
"full, outside off, some posthumous swing as Pujara lets it be"
"<strong>edged</strong>. Lovely delivery. Swinging in the air, and then nipping away a touch after pitching. Soft hands from Pujara mean it doesn't carry to gully"
"full, dipping, swinging in, Pujara early into it and gets a leading edge. The good thing is, his bat is straight. If the bat face closes, slips are in play"
"another edge but soft hands mean it dies down and they get a single. This is on a length, and around that off stump"
"short of a length, rising towards the chest, Rahane takes the bottom hand off as he fends. The ball doesn't lob up"
"swing this time, but it starts too straight and goes for a leg-bye"
"good bouncer. Into his body, cramping him up, and Rahane goes for the hook. He is clearly late into it, and is lucky there isn't enough meat in this top edge. Goes over the keeper as opposed to flying towards fine leg. First runs off Southee in this session"
"full, looking to swing it, but the ball pitches and goes straight on. Driven to mid-on"
"wide on the crease, really full, driven to mid-off, who is straight and deepish"
full and swinging. Not quite the driving length. Left alone outside off
"wdier on the crease, Rahane refuses to get tempted. Again some wobble after going past the stumps"
"wide on the crease, really full, draws no swing. Rahane drives this but straight to mid-on"
"starts with a short ball outside off, and he drops his gloves to see it sail through to Watling"
"short of a length, slight nibble away. Pujara does well to not follow it"
"bouncer outside off, Pujara wants to have nothing to do with it"
another bouncer outside off left alone by Pujara
and tried the full ball now but ends up bowling it down the leg side. Flicked away for a couple
"wide outswinger, left alone by Pujara"
"and he draws another wicket. Lovely swing bowling. Goes wide on the crease, Rahane has been leaving these alone, but now he is dragged forward into defending it. The ball swings away nicely to take a healthy edge, which surprises Ross Taylor at first slip with the carry. Taylor does well to hang on to it. He has pent hours playing the ball late this series, but makes a mental error here and plays out in front of his body, and that too a defensive stroke"
"swing again, defended from the crease, and gets a single to leg"
"full, swinging outside off, driven to cover"
"wide on the crease, gets some swing away, but Pujara leaves it alone"
bouncer from wide on the crease. That flies over Watling's outstretched left hand with the angle

"looks for swing but bowls too full and too straight, conceding two runs to fine leg"
"on a lwength, straight, defended back to him"
"wide on the crease, angles in, holds its line, bounces extra, <strong>hits the top of the bat</strong>. Lucky for Vihari it doesn't lob up"
"bouncer, straight at him, Vihari watches it till the end and then sways out of its line"
"short of a length, angled in from wide on the crease, Pujara gets a couple off the glove. Forced to fend"
"lovely outswinger. Similar to the one that got Rahane, but Pujara doesn't follow it. Withdraws the bat at the last moment"
"full and straight, doesn't swing this time, Pujara looks for the drive, and gets a couple off the inside half of the bat"
"nice late swing from middle and off. Pujara doesn't turn to leg, which is why he is able to make the adjustment to the movement and play this back to Southee"
"overpitched as Southee goes looking for swing, and Pujara drives it down the ground with a straight bat. Southee gets a finger to it, but the outfield is quick enough to take it to the fence"
"on a length, around off, watchfully defended by Pujara"
"full ball, Vihari drives from the crease, gets a couple off the inside half of the bat, sending this wide of mid-on"
"half-volley outside off, Vihari likes to stay leg side of these and drive. He does so through cover and all along the ground"
"short of a length, into the body, Vihari fends and gets hit on the bat handle but the ball stays low"
"good bouncer, over his left shoulder, and Vihari makes a last-moment decision to bail out after shaping up to hook. New Zealand fielders are interested for a moment"
"<strong>dropped</strong>. Watling goes for a catch going at comfortable height to first slip, and shells it. Two short balls seems to have done the trick, and Vihari is caught with his weight back on a full ball. Regulation edge, carrying to first slip, and still Watling dives in front of him and gets only fingertips to it. Not Watling's catch"
"short of a length, outside off, and left alone"
"Stars with a length ball, slight swing from outside off, and left alone"
"on a length, worked away off the pads for one"

"bouncer, middle and leg, and he ducks it"
"another bouncer, follows him after pitching, and Pujara sways out of its line"
"<strong>nearly gets Pujara</strong>. Jamieson enjoying zero luck. Keeps bouncing them to push them back, and then bowls the full one. This one nips back in to take the inside edge, and it sails over the stumps"
"gets some swing again, but starts too straight and concedes a leg-bye"
"full outside off, left alone"
"on a length, middle and off, slight nip away and slight extra bounce. Pujara does well to keep it down"

defended back from the crease
"driven back firmly, de Grandhomme gets his left hand on the ball in trying to stop that on his followthrough"

"zippy short ball, Vihari looks to pull but is beaten. Overconfident a touch?"
"slower and fuller, Vihari is up to the task as he belts this down the ground past mid-off. This was a knuckleball, picked out of the hand and timed superbly"
"he's gloved him down leg at the stroke of tea. Why on earth would he do that? It's a question Vihari would do well to answer. Looking to get inside the line to pull, only managed a feather. Wagner is pumped, he knows he's got his man. The walk back to the pavilion won't be a very pleasant one."

Looks to drag this from well outside off, the short ball holds its line slightly, and the top edge goes straight up towards backward square leg. BJ Watling has enough time to call it and claim it. Uncharacteristic shot from Pujara after all that fight"

"<b>oh Watling. Another missed chance thanks to him</b>. Regulation outside edge towards first slip, and Watling moves in front of Taylor to set him off, and then withdraws at the last moment himself. Taylor stands no chance. Two poor bits of judgement from Watling"
and now pant rubs it in with a nonchalant flick off the toes through square leg
"pulled away, along the ground, to fine leg"
"on a length, on off, pushed to mid-off"
"and Pant refuses to take his chances. Reprieved twice in the last over, he has a loose waft at a length ball outside off, and gets an inside edge onto his pads and then onto the stumps. The two lapses in the last over have cost New Zealand nine runs, and have transferred a Boult wicket to Jamieson's account"
"on a length, outside off, left alone as it straightens a touch"
"short of a length, outside off, defended quite solidly"
"and there Yadav has a go. To be fair, this ball is there for the cut, but Jamieson's extra bounce beats him"
"and Jamieson has four. Pitches this slightly fuller. Yadav stays back and looks to defend. The ball holds its line, takes the edge, easy as that"
"on a length, middle and off, defended from the crease"
"Jadeja takes Boult on. Gets under a length ball, and chips it over mid-on for four. Now the field might go back"
"oh loose ball, into the pads, and Jadeja is good enough to glance it fine of fine leg. Smart batting"
"length ball, outside off, swinging away, left alone"
"Boult pitches in short to try to keep Jadeja at this end, but the ball doesn't get up and he pulls it away for an easy single"
"<strong>and he nearly doesn't survive it</strong>. Too good for Shami as it seams back in and beats the inside edge. Luckily for Shami, it sails over the stumps"
"short of a length, pretty straight, defended down"
"and that Jamieson bounce undoes Jadeja. And he has a maiden five-for in only his second Test. Jadeja knows he has to get on with it, but he could have chosen better. Hooks Jamieson, manages only a top edge, and Boult dives in front at fine leg to complete the catch"
"on a length, straight, defended by Bumrah"
"<strong>nearly a sixth</strong>. Wide length ball, extra bounce, Bumrah defends, fails to edge it"
"slogs at a shortish ball, early into the shot, and is beaten again"
"<strong>another wild swing</strong> to a wide length ball, and he is beaten. Another wicket-maiden"
"length ball outside off, pushed to cover"
"short of a length, straight, fended square on the off side"
"and Shami swings hard at a full ball, gets an inside edge fine of fine leg. They all count"
"another swing, beaten, hit on the pad, but this is pitched outside leg"
"yorker, gets the inside edge, onto his body"
"another yorker, squeezed out to gully"
"<strong>another swing and a miss</strong>. Bumrah mows this across the line, and the extra bounce from Jamieson actually saves him"
"and Bumrah connects this time. This length ball is in his wheelhouse, and he sends it over midwicket with a slog"
better connection but less timing on this one. Clears midwicket easily but doesn't send it far enough. Gets a couple for it
"bouncer this time, and Bumrah sways out of its line"
good leave outside off. Bumrah is now beginning to fancy himself
"fuller, makes him play, Bumrah does so with soft hands and gets a soft edge past gully for three. The partnership is now worth 13. Every run counts"
"mow across the line, gets an inside edge for a single to square leg"
"swing and a miss again. Shami has an almighty go at this short ball, and is beaten by the bounce"
"Shami is having some fun here, and it is hurting New Zealand. Another slog at a length ball, and the top edge has enough to sail for a six to the square leg fence"
"whoa, this is bigger, stronger and longer. Clears the front leg, and smacks a full ball sweetly over long-on. Boult getting a taste of his own medicine"
"short ball, hits Shami in the grille as he charges at him. Immediately raises his hand in apology. The fast bowlers' club exists"
and that's that. The old one-two trick. Bouncer followed by a full ball. Hits his pad plumb in front before ricocheting onto the off stump
"short of length and angling across, left alone"
off the pad to fine leg. Wrong line that time
works this off his pads to long leg
solid forward defence to a full delivery outside off
"<strong>corker!</strong> Left him late, squared him up completely. Not sure how that missed. That wicket angle, bounce and late movement. Everything that makes Bumrah a dangerous proposition"

"nice and full outside off, drivable length, left alone"
"shapes away nicely from outside off, left alone"
"straighter, on middle and leg, they sneak in a leg bye as this deflects to the leg side off the thigh pad"
"absolutely flies off the pitch, so high that Pant had no chance. Good leave by Latham as he got out of the way. Byes"
"slants this full outside off, left alone"
"attacks the stumps, gets this to move in late but Latham's up to the task as he plays a solid defence"
"slants one in full, just around off stump, stabbed away"
"peach! Slants in, hits the deck and straightens to beat the outside edge"

"comes back in a long way from outside off, left alone"
hops back and defends this incoming delivery
"edged and short ! Or did it carry? <strong>Just fallen short as replays confirm. </strong>. Genuine edge but Latham didn't push hard at it, hit the shoulder of the bat and landed on the half-volley to Kohli."
goes right back and across as he defends this incoming length delivery
"good leave, very good ball. Touch ahead of length, just outside off."
in his half and he puts that away through extra cover. Confident from Blundell
looking to whip it away but the ball keeps coming back in to hit him on the box. Cramped for room completely
"length ball that nips away from outside off, left alone"
"good leave! Back of length outside off, straightens a touch and zips through"
"edged, through the gap. Past gully for four. Streaky but they all count"

hops back and across as he defends back
"tucked behind square, Shaw hared in from the deep to prevent the second. They couldn't have got it anyway as Latham slipped while turning."
"punched superbly into the gap at extra cover. Nice hands, high elbow as the bat came down in a lovely arc. Nothing more than a defensive push, hitting on the up and it came right out of the screws. This brings up the half-century stand as well."

turns this gently into the leg side with the angle
"glorious! Pitched up and smacked. Lovely, lovely timing to hit it past mid-off"

ducks under this short ball angling in
turns this length ball into the midwicket region

"short of a length, down the leg side, trying the way Ishant Sharma got him out last Test? Left alone"
"short of a length again, straight, defended to leg"
"<strong>seams away</strong>. Starts just outside off, Latham plays for the shape, but the ball nips away to beat his bat"
solid front-foot defensive to end the over
"on a length, angling in, nicely worked away past that short midwicket"
"on a length, angling in, defended into his own boot"
"fuller, into the pads, clipped away to that short midwicket. Along the ground"
"this one seams away against that angle in, but starts a touch too wide to make him play"
"soft outside edge as this length ball holds its line outside off, Rahane misfields at gully to allow them a couple"
"<strong>beauty</strong>. Short of driving length, but draws him forward in defence, then pitches and leaves him against that angle. Latham lucky to not edge it. Actually he has done well to not follow the movement with his hands"
"on a length, straight, going down with the angle. Blundell likes to hang back to these, and is hit on the pad"
"full, swinging away, but is wide enough to be left alone"
"<strong>given lbw and Blundell has reviewed it</strong>. Sounded like two noises to me, but the second noise was bat hitting the pad so it looks like they are going to waste the review. Well we get an umpire's call on height so they at least retain the review. It looks plumb live time. Yadav has produced a near repeat of the Ishant sharma delivery from the last Test. Full, just outside off, catching Blundell on the back foot and then seaming it back in. He was bowled last time, this time he is hit on the pad. Very little guesswork for Umpire Gough because he is so far in the crease"
"full and straight first up, testing his defence, and Williamson pushes this wide of mid-on for a single to get off the mark right away"
"<strong>loose shot</strong>. This is a wide length ball, and he follows it with his hands. The ball holds its line, and beats him"
leaves it alone this time as Yadav stays wide
"<strong>beaten</strong>. On a length, holds its line outside off, against the angle, and beats the defensive shot from Williamson"
"short and wide, too early in the innings to make Williamson go for the cut"
"short of a length, outside off, defended with an open face, towards gully"
"full, just outside off, and Williamson exploits the extra fielder on the leg side by dropping this towards cover for a single"
"really full, straight, defended to mid-on"
"<strong>beaten again but is he too short again?</strong>. This is too good again: angling in, and then seaming against that angle. The only problem: short of a length, allowing the ball to do too much to take an edge. And Latham doesn't follow it with his hands"
"outswinger just outside off, left alone"
"seam movement. From a length, just outside off, it nips back in as Williamson is shaping up to leave it. It takes the inside edge for a single"
"short, but not too wide, so Latham decides to not cut"
"short of a length, angling in from around the wicket, tucked away off the hip"
"slightly fuller, wider on the crease, makes him defend off the front foot, which he does"
"short of a length, wide, Latham lets it go. If his eye is in, he will be punching these way"
"and Bumrah has the big one. Kohli is pumped up. Mental error from Williamson. He defends at a widish length ball, expecting it to come back in. It does come back, but not as much as expected, and takes the outside edge through to Pant"
pushes at a wide length ball. Gets it in the middle of the bat
"bouncer, but it moves a lot after passing the stumps. Pant has no chance to save this. Called byes, and not wides, but then again these calls are relative to batsmen and not wicketkeepers"
"<b>big swing from wide outside off</b>, and some seam too. Beats the inside edge, and India belt out an lbw appeal. More in excitement than in conviction. Too high, and probably hit outside the line"
again big swing after passing the stumps as Bumrah tries a straight ball to Taylor who tends to shuffle across. It just keeps going down leg
"short and wide, Taylor tries the cut, and is beaten by slightly spongy bounce"
"<strong>left alone for two runs</strong>. Uncertain, late withdrawal of the bat as Yadav angles this in from around the wicket. Takes the toe of the bat through point for a couple"
"angling in too far down leg, and clipped away for one"
"wide length ball, swinging away, left alone"
"short of a length, straight, defended to leg"
<strong>shapes to swing and then seams back in</strong> to hit him high on the thigh pad. Almost trampoline bounce from a length
"short of a length, just outside off, defended from the crease"
"full, angling in, defended solidly back to him"
left alone outside off as it swings away from him
"short of a length, well outside off, left alone"
the good-old leave on length and angle. Watches it angle across and sail over the height of the stumps
another leave to a length ball pitched within the stumps
"full, on off, nicely push-driven wide of mid-off for a couple"
"short, wide, Taylor is ready for the cut. Important to make sure you punish these deliveries. Shifts the pressure back"
"full, swinging away, dips a little, defended back to Yadav"
"on a length, angling in, defended off the back foot"
"extra bounce from a length, and Taylor takes his bottom hand off as he defends. <strong>Hit on the right glove</strong>"

"wide length ball, left alone"

"wide length ball, left alone"
"driven on the up, slightly risky, but off the middle of the bat. Finds mid-off"

"wide length ball, left alone"
"closer to off, but not full enough to make him play"
"short of a length, Latham looks for the late-cut, but it seams back a touch to cramp him up"
"wide on the crease, short, wide, and Latham lets it be"
"on a length, outside off, left alone"
"slightly fuller, but still not full enough to make Latham commit"
"short of a length, outside off, defended"
"short of a length, wide, left alone"
"slightly fuller than the last delivery, but still too short. Defended by Taylor"
"a length ball that swings back in, and Taylor drops this slightly wide of mid-on for a single"
"<strong>leave on length</strong>. India are excited as this seams back in, but Latham is chilled as this sails over the middle stump"
"slightly fuller than that last ball, Latham plays at this, gets a thick outside edge that goes wide of gully"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone. Extra bounce as Pant collects this in front of his face"
"fuller, makes him play, swings it in, hits the inside half of the bat, and they steal a single"
"short of a length, straight, defended to leg"
"full and straight, worked away past that catching backward square leg for a single"
"wide length ball, left alone as it holds its line against the angle from around the wicket"
"long half-volley. Just what Latham has been waiting for. Just presents it the full face of the bat, and drives it almost over the stumps at the non-striker's end"
"full, no turn, defended to leg"
"full and straight, quick to pull out the sweep, Shami runs to his right from fine leg and puts the big boot down to save one run"
"full, really full, Latham would have driven it had this not been the first ball he was facing from Jadeja this morning"
<strong>hit in the helmet</strong> as he goes down the paddle. Extra bounce from a length outside off
defended in front of wicket this time
another front-foot defence to end the over
"lovely length angling in from wide of the crease, defended"
"extra bounce, hops back uncomfortably as he pushes it to the off side"
"nice and full outside off, Taylor defends back"
"edged but l<strong>ands short of gully.</strong> Short of length, zips through outside off, Taylor played it with soft hands luckily"
"<b> corker of a delivery! </b> This one angles in, hits the deck and nips away. Taylor just about plays inside the line as this whizzes through to Pant. Shami thought there was something there, the umpire didn't. Kohli and he had a word, but weren't convinced to go upstairs."
punched into the gap between backward point and gully
steps out and works it with the spin into the gap at midwicket. Agarwal with a long chase
jabs this away as he gets forward to this full delivery
defended back to the bowler as he fires it in
"leading edge, is it a chance? Yes, it is. <strong>Outstanding catch from Umesh</strong> running back from point. Deceived in flight as Jadeja shortened his length after seeing him advance, the ball spun away and Taylor couldn't resist. Looked to hoick to the leg side, got the leading edge and it was taken superbly."
defends this full delivery on the stumps
"round-armish, full on the stumps again, kept out"
"slants this full and across the left-hander, defended"
"banged in short on the body, Nicholls pulls even if not entirely in control, into the gap at long leg"
hops back and across to defend this short of length delivery
"through Pant's legs. <strong>Four byes, shoddy effort.</strong> Yes it bounced in front of him as Nicholls let this length ball go but should've been collected"
"<strong>beauty!</strong> Angles in, hits the deck and leaves him late to whizz past the edge"
"goes fuller, just outside off, dabbed to point"
works it off his pads to deep square leg
nudged wide of square leg as he gets across the stumps a touch
"shortish, spinning back in, defended back"
steps out and then lunges forward to tap it into the off side
turns this with the spin to short midwicket
eased into the gap between cover and mid-off
hops back into the crease and whips this nicely into the open space at midwicket. Lovely timing
shoulders arms to an incoming length ball from outside off
right on top of the bounce as he defends
"late movement back in as he slants it in from wide of the crease, defended back but there was a gap between bat and pad"
"this one angles in, hits the deck and leaves him, Nicholls lets it go"

hops back into the crease and defends this short of length delivery
"races past gully and point again, played it with soft hands and with a slightly angled bat though"
"dug in short, Latham ducks under this"
"full outside off, reverses in a long way to squirt off a thick inside edge to midwicket"
"<b> that is a Shami special! </b> Latham decides to leave and it's a horrendous decision as the ball jags back in a long way to crash into the stumps. You just saw this coming and India are chipping away. Latham trusted the bounce, expecting this to go over. But it didn't."
"back of length outside off, left alone"
plays this half-pull very nicely. good stop at deep square by Agarwal. This was traveling
tucks it nicely wide of midwicket
"gets it to angle in from wide of the crease, Watling is right behind the line in defence"
good leave to a full delivery that moves away late from outside off
"sneaks in a long way to beat the inside edge and hit the pad. Huge appeal, but <b> India decide against reviewing the onfield call. </b> The appeal, however, was very vociferous to begin with from Bumrah"
"lifter outside off from around the stumps, left alone"
"gets this to leave the left-hander, Nicholls lets it go and rightly so"
<strong>peach!</strong> Has a poke at this but the ball leaves him late to beat the edge. Incredible from Shami
"got him! Kohli pulls off a stunner diving to his right at second slip. He's claiming the catch but Nicholls isn't going anywhere. <strong>The soft signal is OUT.</strong>  Will be close. Let's see. On first sighting of the replay, there <s> appears to be some doubt. </s> This is going to be an incredibly hard decision to make for Aleem Dar. But he's convinced the fingers are underneath so the onfield decision stays. Five wickets in the session for India and counting. Credit to Shami as much as it must be given to Kohli. That angle from around the wicket has been troubling the left-handers."
"<strong>the good old French cut to start off!</strong> On another day, the inside edge would've crashed into leg stump"
"big appeal, close. But not out. Michael Gough the umpire. May have gone over again. India don't bother reviewing."
"angles in wickedly from wide of the crease, Watling somehow manages to keep that away"
"nice and full outside off, left alone"
"nice length, just a touch fuller but not full enough, nips away from outside off and Watling leaves"
"appeal for lbw, big appeal. Massive appeal. Not given. <strong>Will Kohli review? He will. He will.</strong> Fair delivery. Nips back in from a length to beat the inside edge and hit him on the flap of his left pad. No bat involved so the umpire only had to check for ball tracking. And it tells us this would've missed the stumps by a long, long way. Onfield call stays. Not out. <b> Emotional review that </b>"
turns this gently into the leg side
driven nicely but straight to short cover
edged and four! He'll play his shots and look to drive the game forward. This one's a thick edge that races between backward point and gully
"good length outside off, left alone"
nips back in to hit him high on the left thigh.
once again the late inward movement beats the inside edge to thud into the thigh pad. They take a legbye off the deflection to the off side
right besides the line to defend this time
"moves away from outside off, left alone"
positive start from de Grandhomme as Bumrah strays down the leg side. De Grandhomme flicks it away nicely square on the leg side
"<strong>beauty</strong>. Unlucky to not touch any wood on the way. On a length, pitches just outside off, seams back in, beats the inside edge, and sails over the middle stump"
"short of a length, outside off, seaming back in, left alone. Lot of movement after it goes past the stumps"
"slightly overpitched, and de Grandhomme is looking to take all the scoring opportunities. Push-drives it between mid-off and cover, all along the ground"
"full again, but Watling is watchful as he defends this back to Bumrah"
"on a length, wide outside off, left alone, and again Pant is given a workout as it moves a long way after passing the stumps"
"full, outside off, de Grandhomme drives, but straight back to Shami. Hit on the inside half of the bat"
"looks for another drive but this is not full enough, and it hits him on the inside half of the bat"
"overpitched this time, and de Grandhomme is looking to make the most of any such deliveries. The mid-off is wide so he off-drives it straight through that gap between the bowler and mid-off"
"on a length, outside off, left alone this time"
bouncer to tell de Grandhomme he can't just keep planting his front foot down and driving. de Grandhomme ducks it
"on a length, just outside off, which means de Grandhomme has to give up any intentions to drive. He defends this with a slightly open face"
"digs this in short, but pitches it wide. Watling doesn't get close to it"
"short and wide, but Watling resists the cut as the ball seams back in and moves a long way after going past the stumps"
"lose drive, and Jadeja pulls off a beauty at point. This is full and wide, and it calls for a drive. He has resisted two scoring opportunities earlier in the over, but goes after this one. He hasn't hit it up and over, it is a flat hit. Jadeja at point dives to his left, gets both hands to it, and makes this look way easier than it is. India are switched on right at this moment"
"short of a length, inside edge onto the pad as Southee defends"
"and India are on absolute song here. A nothing shot from Southee, the kind of thing that happens when you are under incredible pressure. Short of a length, wide enough to be left alone, but he has a fend at it, and Pant gets an easy catch as the bounce is too much to handle for Southee"
"every ball looks like it can get a wicket here. Full outside off, holds its line, beats him"
"length ball, outside off, seams away to <strong>beat him</strong>. Too good. He has to play the angle because it is so close to off"
"on a length, this one goes with the angle, and he defends solidly"
"on a length, straight, defended back to him"
"slightly fuller, asking him if he fancies a drive. de Grandhomme tires the drive, and is beaten by the seam movement away. This is 51 overs old, and still seaming. Great skill"
"wide on the crease, seaming in again, but headed down as it hits the pad. They appeal for a bat-pad catch too, but this is nowhere near the bat either"
"wide length ball, left alone, and Pant has to dive full length to his right as this deviates massively after passing the batsman again"
"<strong>absolute beauty</strong>. On a length, close to off, he has to play the angle, but it seams away to beat him"
"slightly short of a length, kept out by Jamieson"
"full, angling in, clipped to leg, and short midwicket puts in a diving save. This is what happens when momentum shifts. Everything goes to hand. Fielders dive all over"
"on a length, just outside off, defended"
"the bouncer now, and it seams back in too. Unlike in Wellington where they had the lead, Jamieson is not hooking right now"
"short of a length, wide, left alone"
mean bouncer. Rises from not too short. is at him too. de Grandhomme does well to withdraw out of a fend at the last moment
half a shout from behind the wicket but de Grandhomme has got an inside edge to a straight length ball
"<strong>that is a legcutter at high speed</strong>. This pitch is looking unplayable right now. Bold upright seam, pitches on a length just outside off, and then cuts away a long way to beat the bat and also the diving Pant"
"short of a length, extra bounce, defended off the back foot"
"gets closer to the stumps and bowls one really full and straight, clipped away through midwicket to take three runs. That will give him strike for the next over"
"on a length, straight, defended back to him"
"<strong>beaten</strong>. Short of a length, angling in, has to be played at, and then leaves him after pitching"
"on a length, wide, driven on the up, in front of the sweeper sent back for de Grandhomme. He gets a couple"
<strong>beaten again</strong>. Considerable seam movement as de Grandhomme plays just the angle. Does well to not follow the seam movement with his hands
"fuller, straighter, and for a change it goes on with the angle. Defended soldily"
"that's a half-volley, de Grandhomme goes after it, but even that seams away after pitching. <strong>Beaten again</strong>"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
"short of a length, and it goes away like a legcutter. Pant collects it in front of the first slip"
"fuller, driven down the ground, and all of a sudden Jadeja is present in all the hot spots. He makes a full-length diving save from mid-on to keep them down to one"
<strong>another legcutter at high speed</strong>. They might even be hoping it seams a little less here. From a fullish length it cuts away to beat the outside edge
"starts straight, seams back in and is headed down leg. Half a shout from behind the stumps"
"on a length, outside off, left alone"
"on a length, outside off, he walks towards it, and surprisingly they push for a second on the last ball of the over. What's more?<strong> They have run one short</strong>. So basically they have got the single but still de Grandhomme doesn't get to keep strike. Not the smartest bit of batting ever seen"
"short of a length, angling in, punched down to mid-on"
"short of a length, wide, and despite the seam back he has managed to punch this between the slips and gully for a couple"
"goes fuller, is honing in on the lbw, but gets an inside edge on the way through"
"strays into the leg side, and Jamieson clips it past midwicket for a three off the fourth ball. So there is not going to be any shielding of Jamieson, that much is clear"
"full, straight, de Grandhomme gets an inside edge onto the pad"
"goes for a big drive at a wide length ball, <strong>but is beaten</strong> as it holds its line"
"short of a length, just outside off, punched to cover"
"on a length, straight, Jamieson drives it to mid-on"
"stays on a length, just outside off, defended to cover"

"straight length ball stays low, and is kept out"

driven for what looks like a single to long-off but Jadeja puts in a diving save to his left
driven back to Jadeja
stays back to a fullish ball and defends it outside off

"short of a length, just outside off, defended solidly"
"too straight, worked away into the leg side for a single"
seam movement from just short of a length and around off. Hits him high on the thigh pad
"on a length, draws a forward defensive, which he does well"
"short of a length, slight width, and steered away to third man for a single"
"short of a length, straight, pushed to mid-on"
defends a length ball in front of his body
"oh what a beauty. It was often repeated he is picked for his batting, but Jadeja is showing here he is no mug with the ball. He is a Test spinner of impeccable merit. Slows it down now, pitches it on middle, gets enough turn to go past the outside edge and hit the off stump. This is sensational stuff form India"
defends a full ball outside off
"flatter, defended off the back foot"
"gets some turn to beat the inside edge, but this is turning down leg"
defended off the front foot
"short of a length, just outside off, defended off the back foot"
"on a length, on off, defended off the front foot"
"into the pads, worked away wide of mid-on, they think of two, but Vihari, the man at deep midwicket, keeps them down to one"
"bouncer as expected, and he ducks it"
"another short ball, and he has a leg gully in place for that. <strong>This goes just wide of that man</strong> as Wagner fends"
"down the leg side, nicely glanced away for four. Jamieson enjoying this drop in intensity from Bumrah and Shami to Yadav"
"tickled away nicely to fine leg for a couple as Shami comes around. Oh, he's back too."
goes right back and defends
"lunges forward, covers the line and defends back"

"holds his length back a touch, dabbed gently to point"
right behind the line of this length ball as he defends
squirts this in-drifter off an inside edge to the leg side
"appeal and gone! Wagner reviews immediately. This comes back in sharply from around the wicket, rises awkwardly to have Wagner fending, it appears as if the ball kisses the right shoulder on the way through to Pant. <b> Decision overturned, not out </b>"
"goes full and straight, defended back"
"<b> dropped at fine leg by Vihari! </b> Shami bounces him, Wagner takes him on with the pull, gets a big top edge. Vihari was under the swirler but was off balance as this descended. Needed a better effort"
square driven nicely into the gap between cover and point
Pant heaps high and puts his right hand out to stop this wayward Shami bouncer
eased wide of point for a single to keep strike
punched to sweeper cover
"fired full on the stumps, pushed back to the bowler"
punched wide of cover
works this with the spin to short midwicket
goes right back into the crease and taps to the off side
gets well forward and smothers this
play and a miss! Zips past the shoulder of the bat as he hangs his bat out

"eased into the gap at extra cover, soft hands, good timing. Two more"
"<strong>top-edge, four!</strong> Good bouncer, took him on and got it over the keeper's head"
squirted off an inside edge to mid-on
gorgeous! Shot any top order batsman would be proud of. Stood tall and punched it on the up past the bowler. Purred to the fence
"steps out, Jadeja shortens his length, dabbed"
turned to short midwicket
goes across a long way and sweeps it with the spin to fine leg. The deficit narrows further
right back into the crease as he works it to the leg side

edged and races down to square third man
beaten comprehensively! Angled in and left him at the last moment
a cross-batted punch of sorts to mid-on
"takes on the pull, gets big on him but he goes through. <strong>Lands short of Jadeja at deep square</strong>"
works this length ball on middle to midwicket
"hint back hard, uppish but will get four! More frustration for India. Stood tall and simply slapped it back"
"full on the stumps, defended back"
lovely wrist work as he puts this into the gap at midwicket. Too full from Bumrah that time
punched on the up quite beautifully! That will hurt the ego of any fast bowler. When an opposition No. 10 stands tall and punches you on the up like that
ducks under this short ball on leg from over the wicket
"fends, lands short of gully"
squirts this full delivery back to the bowler
crunched away on the up to mid-off
"punched off the backfoot, into the gap between cover and mid-off"
beaten as he looks to pull from outside off
"slashed away over point for four! The runs continue to flow. <strong>Short, wide and put away</strong> Raises the half-century stand"
"comes back in awkwardly, cops a blow on the glove as he looks to fend"
"<b> outstanding from Jadeja! </b> You wouldn't have been wrong in looking at the boundary thinking it'd be six. But no, because there's a superman called Sir Jadeja. He was three-fourths to the rope at deep square, and so he had to leap high, which he did. Then he put his left hand out instinctively and it stuck. The balance after it got stuck was even better. At no stage did he try to juggle or lose control over the ball. Incredible."
"sees it in his half and belts this up and over, lands in front of the sightscreen. Super hit"
"looks to whip it up and over midwicket, no timing and it lands wide of the fielder."
"backs away, exposes all three stumps and bunts it wide of point"
"the grille of the helmet takes a beating and falls as <strong>Jamieson is cops a blow</strong> by a ripper of a bouncer. Jamieson seems okay, the helmet is off. He's moving his head alright, but there are concerns. He has to go through the mandatory concussion protocols."
"slower and fuller outside off, squeezed wide of point"
sways out of the way of this short ball on middle
"straight up in the air, <strong>brilliant catch by Pant</strong> running back and then sideways as this swirled. <b> Jamieson will have to wait for a maiden Test fifty. </b> This was banged in short, Jamieson went for the pull, this went a long, long way up and Pant had to run a good 30 yards or so to his right. Then he put in the dive to complete the catch. Superb effort. India grab a very slender lead and that's tea on day two."
"shapes to drive, slices this to backward point. Movement straightaway for Southee"
"gets well forward, head right over the ball as he confidently defends to cover"
"slides this into middle and leg, the ball thuds into the thigh pad and deflects to short square leg. He was looking to tuck it away"
"hops back awkwardly to tickle this away to fine leg, Agarwal off the mark"
"gorgeous! Full, straight and this is a lovely, lovely straight drive. Beat Southee even before he could put his hand out on his followthrough"
works this length ball from off to midwicket
"dangerous from Agarwal, getting his front pad across in trying to work this to the leg side. Big swing in from Boult. <strong>Agarwal a candidate for lbw</strong>"
"slants it across, Agarwal has a good look at that and decides to leave"
"feeble push to a full delivery angled across, off a thick inside edge to deep square leg"
"slants a length ball across, pushed to point"
"nips back in and given. Agarwal's nightmare of a Test is over, and he doesn't bother reviewing (rightly so!). Agarwal trapped on the crease as Boult gets this to swerve back in a long way, both feet were in the air as he was struck low on the pad. That was plumb."
nips back in to beat the inside edge and hit him high on the pad
"full and swinging away from outside off, left alone"
"length ball closer to the stumps, defended solidly"

"looks to drive but plays down the wrong line, this one rolls to mid-on"
shoulders arms to a short of length delivery angling away
shapes to drive but then ends up stabbing it away with hard hands
"full on middle and leg, tucked to fine leg to get off the mark"
"steered nicely into the gap at gully. Played it with soft hands, made an effort to get on top of the bounce"
plays inside the line of this away going delivery as this zips past
"moves back in a long way but from outside leg, through to Watling"
"<b>big shout for catch at the wicket</b>. It has swung late from a length just outside off, and it misses the edge by probably an inch"
this one straightens from middle and leg. Pujara ends up defending in front of his body
"again it straightens from middle and leg, and Pujara does well to not close the face early. That means the edge is finer and goes down, wide of gully"
"Shaw is going to go after those. Southee looks for swing, and pitches right up, and he gets a thick outside edge on the big drive"
"on a length, on off, holds its line, defended off the front foot"
"this one comes in, not sure if by design or off the seam. Pujara plays it late, which means he can cover the movement"
"on a length, just outside off, defended off the back foot"
"on a length, just outside off, movement, punched to point"
"big swing in, but Shaw is not holding back. He whips it off the stumps, in the air, but wide of the diving backward square leg"

"on a length, just outside off, Pujara right forward in defence"
"full, gentle swing, pushed back into the stumps at the non-striker's end"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> as this swings back in a touch and hits him in front. The bounce, though, is carrying it over. Actually umpire's call on height"
"on a length, outside off, driven wide of mid-off"
"full and straight, clipped to midwicket"
throws this up wide to see if Pujara wants to have a go. He doesn't
"on a length, on off, angle away, defended with an open face"
"full outside off, driven straight to mid-off"
"and the short ball does it for Shaw. He has nowhere to go as Southee bowls the perfect short ball for him. This is at his throat, and angled in. He is late into the fend, and ends up lobbing it into the cordon"
"tries another bouncer, and this one keeps climbing. Watling leaps and gets a hand to it to keep it down to just one bye"
"full, just outside off, slight swing away, defended off the front foot"
"another short ball, and a good one. Over the top of off, and Pujara sways out of its line"
"and Pujara is trying to leave one alone, but the ball kicks at him and takes the outside edge. He does well to ride it, and send it down between the slips and gully"
"full, straight, looks like you can clip it to leg, but it swings late and straightens to take the thick leading edge down into the ground"
"straight, on a length, looking for the pad, but Kohli defends solidly and belts out a loud call of no. Not that Pujara is interested in a quick single"
"full, outside off, Kohli wants the drive, but the ball swings to hit the inside half of the bat"
"on a length, shaping up to swing, but pitching and nipping away. Kohli plays it late, with soft hands, and keeps it down"
"<strong>nearly got him</strong>. On a length, outside off, Kohli is playing in front of his body as he looks for the cover-drive. The ball pitches and leaves him to beat the edge"
"<strong>another play and miss</strong>. Short of a length, and Kohli is defending for the angle. The ball holds its line after pitching, again missing the edge"
"and now tries to go behind him for the lbw but ends up bowling too straight. Combined with prodigious movement after passing the stumps, this counts for four byes. All of them count"
"length ball, into the pads, worked away for a single to long leg. A quicker runner than Pujara might have taken two as Boult sweeps up from fine leg"
"wide length ball, swinging away, and Kohli lets it go this time"
"closer to him, on a length, slight shape away, Kohli moves across and forward and defends it solidly. That will give him confidence"
"wide on the crease, angles one in. Kohli on the crease but right behind it"
"that is Kohli. Wide on the crease, looking for the full swinging ball, ends up with a full straight ball, and Kohli lets it come to him before clipping it through midwicket for four"
"slight seam off a length, goes past the inside edge, hits him on the thigh pad. Only half a shout from behind"
"short ball from around the wicket, hits him on the bottom glove, but there is <strong>no short leg to take this catch</strong>"
"fuller, swinging in, defended off the front foot"

"he has got Kohli doing what he wants him to do: drive at a wide length ball. But he has done this sweetly, opening the face to adjust to the swing, and gets four through cover-point"
"short of a length now, closer to off, but left alone"
"<strong>edged away</strong>. This is a good ball. On a length, just outside off, holds its line, takes the soft edge, and goes straight to ground. Between slips and gully. Lead 55 now. Every run counts"
looks for the straight lbw ball but Kohli has not yet been dragged far across. He watches this onto the bat as he defends
"hangs this one wide, but Kohli doesn't go after it"
"full, outside off, gentle swing, defended to cover"
"straighter, shapes to swing, but goes on with the angle after pitching. Headed down leg, though"
"on a length, straight, defended to leg"
"full outswinger, outside off, Pujara has enough restraint to not go after it"
"on a length, just outside off, defended off the front foot"
defends a length ball from the crease to play out another maiden
"on a length, wide outside off, left alone. He resists the drive"
"short of a length, angling in, dropped behind square on the leg side for one but Pujara doesn't run. Kohli not happy"
"wide length ball, he denies himself the drive as this one swings away a touch"
"tries the bouncer, Kohli shapes up for the hook, but this seems to have left him. He doesn't withdraw from it, and is lucky to get enough bat on it to clear point"
"wide outside off, on a length, left alone"
tries the full straight lbw ball but Kohli is equal to it
"and he gets off the strike. Short of a length, into the body, tucked away into the leg side"

"on a length, outside off, defended to mid-off"
"short of a length, just outside off, left alone on bounce"
"fuller outside off, slight shape away, left alone"
"short ball, checking if Pujara wants to fend at it. He sways out of its line, keeping his gloves down"
"oh de Grandgomme, what a beauty. He has teased, teased and trapped Kohli in front. This is excellent seam bowling, and I stand corrected for underestimating him. Sir Colin, as Bazid Khan likes to call him. On a length, just outside off, shaping up to swing, but it seams upon pitching and goes past the inside edge to trap Kohli in front. No DRS review wastage this time"
"wide length ball, left alone as it swings away"
"on a length, slight shape away, Rahane forward into defence"
"leave outside off, but this one doesn't continue swinging. Rahane has done well to get his front foot across, though, just in case it nips back in"
"on a length, just outside off, defended back to him"
"swing away from a full length outside off, defended with an open face"
"full and just outside off. The rare overpitched delivery, and he plays the off-drive, straight of the diving mid-off. Lead into the 60s now"

"on a length, outside off, defended off the front foot"
"short of a length, into the armpit, fended down"
"<strong>one bounce to short leg?</strong> Yes it dies in front of him. Pujara fends again, but can't keep it down. Latham at short leg is deepish, and his weight is back too as Pujara fends"
"gets inside the line of this short ball, and avoids it"
"again, armpit height, around off, fended down this time"
"pitches this one up, Pujara equal to it as he defends"
"short ball down the leg side, doesn't bother Pujara"

"touch full on leg stump, Pujara defends from the crease"
"off the thigh pad, down to fine leg. He was looking to hop back to play it"
"<strong>dropped at deep square by Colin de Grandhomme!</strong> This could've been the Test, and the series, right there for India. Absolute brainfade from Rahane as he falls for the trap in trying to fetch a pull from outside off, was high in the air, he got both hands to it but was on the move as he bobbled it"
ducks under this short ball outside off
gets on top of the bounce and defends
"did he get some bat? Yes, looks like. Slips this down leg, Rahane looks to tickle it fine, brushes the glove on the way to the fine leg boundary"
ripper of a bouncer that <b> raps Rahane on the glove </b> as he looks away while avoiding this short ball
gets on top of the bounce and bunts it gently towards the slips
tucks this gently to square leg
<strong>is it off the helmet? Yes</strong>. Rahane has decided t take on the short ball. Leg byes. Rahane signals to the dressing room that he's fine
avoids this short ball angling in without much hassle
"short ball outside leg from over the wicket, Rahane ducks under it"
"short ball outside leg, Rahane moves to the off side as he lets it go"
"backs away and slashes hard, <strong>one bounce to point</strong>. Rahane is clearly unhappy about being peppered by short balls, he wants to go for it. Either hell or high water"
ducks under this short ball on the body as it whizzes past the helmet
stands tall and punches to point
"ducks under this short ball on middle, swerves away as it passed the batsman"
tucks this off his hip to the leg side
"disconcerting bounce as it jags back in to trap him awkwardly on the crease, rapped on the glove"
"<strong>nearly hit wicket</strong> there as Rahane walks across to pull, <strong>hit on the side of the helmet</strong>. He was through with the pull even before the ball arrived. Oh, dear. Rahane is all at sea against the short ball. And none of his attempts to take them off have been convincing. New helmet comes out"
"hops back and across to square himself up, hit on the right thigh."
jabs this length ball away outside off
"sways out of the way of this short delivery outside off. This is a real contest, don't go too far away"

gets out of the way of this short ball on the body by moving to the off side
"<strong>nearly had him!</strong> Off the glove, on the bounce to gully. Snorter of a delivery"
gets out of the way of this short delivery angling in
"firmly driven, short-cover half-stops and parries it to where mid-off would be. Rahane back into the hot seat"
"he's chopped this onto the stumps! That's the end of one of the most bizarre knocks Rahane would play. This is another short ball, came a lot slower off the surface. Rahane walks to the off side, looks to help it along to fine leg but is taken aback by the slowness of the delivery, nearly through with the shot as the ball arrived, got some bat on it and straight onto the stumps. Wagner has deserved this wicket."
"four leg byes. Useful runs. Walks across to work it off his hip, deflected off the thigh pad and the keeper's gloves"
rises with the bounce and defends

"short outside leg, Pujara avoids"
"length outside off, left alone"
full toss on the pads and he picks it away nicely into the gap at deep square leg
right on top of the bounce as he defends this incoming short of length delivery
"got him! What a peach. Breaches through Pujara's defense. Beauty from Boult. <strong>Hey, Wasim Akram? Did you watch? </strong> The legend would've been proud. He goes wide of the crease from around the wicket, floats it full. It starts from somewhere around the seventh stump, swerves in late, really late. The inward movement is towards the shiny side. Pujara plays half-forward, isn't fully committed to the defensive stroke and the ball sneaks through the gap between bat and pad to crash into the stumps."

onto the backfoot as he defends

"another one from Boult! Umesh leaves a big, big gap between bat and pad as he looks to play. Feet glued to the crease, the ball bends back in a long way to beat the inside edge and smash into the stumps."

"full, just outside off, no swing, defended solidly by Vihari"
"slightly shorter, and Vihari lets it go on length. Also just a touch too wide"
not a bad idea to start off with a bouncer when the batsman is watching out for swing. Pant does well to sway out of its line
"looks for swing, has Pant stretching out in a forward-defensive. Hits the inside half of the bat"
"swings this time, but starts a touch too wide to make him play"
"on a length, angling in, defended to short midwicket"
"wider on the crease, gives him a half-volley, Pant flicks, but can't beat short midwicket"
"good bouncer to end the over. At his melon, which Pant saves by nonchalantly getting out of its line"

"wide on the crease, a touch too wide, and Vihari feels like he can have a go at it. And he times it well through cover-point for four"
"wide on the crease again, hangs this even wider, and Vihari knows this is the sucker ball and doesn't go after it"
"and of all the ways to get out, Vihari tickles one down the leg side. Oh cricket, cruel cricket. You are watching out for the seam and swing just outside off, getting across to cover the line, mindful of the occasional bouncer, and then you get a plum offering on the pads that you can glance for four down leg, but what do you end up doing? Edging it to the wicketkeeper. Cricket, eh"
"full, really full, nice positive push to mid-off"
this one seams away off a length just outside off. Jadeja stays inside the line
<strong>Pant has a nibble</strong>. Not the smartest shot. Just a defensive poke to a length ball outside off as it seams away. Beaten
"fuller, slightly wider, Pant pushes at it still. This one hits the inside half of his bat"
"and Pant does what he has been trying. A really disappointing innings. Pushing defensively. If he is going to play at balls outside off, might as well swing at them so that at least you have a chance of the edge flying over the cordon. Here he has been pushing at them, and the best you can do is middle them for a dot. The worst: the ball moves a touch, and takes the edge through as it has done just now. Really disappointing couple of efforts from Pant in this Test. These are the conditions where he is supposed to be aggressive and try to take conditions out of the picture. Or perish trying to do that. Does he have that confidence, though, after all the criticism and axes he has received for aggressive batting in the past?"
"swings this in, defended back to him"
"length ball, angling in, uppishly pushed through the vacant mid-on region"
"<strong>unplayable</strong>. Shami has to cover for the angle and the swing back in, but it pitches and seams away. Beaten"
and Jadeja takes it with a flick to deep square leg
"straight length ball, runs off the thigh pad of Shami for two leg-byes"
"Shami backs away to try to swing to leg, but a Southee bouncer follows him and hits him on the right bicep. No attention needed"
"wide on the crease, full, Shami is deep in the crease, but still manages to push it towards mid-off, who is slightly deep. They come across for a single"
"it is short but doesn't quite rise, and Jadeja pulls it down towards mid-on for a single"
"wide on the crease, solid front-foot push towards the deepish mid-off, but Jadeja does well to <strong>turn down the single</strong>"
"mean bouncer, and <strong>Watling does really well</strong>. Beats Jadeja's hook, and keeps climbing. Watling gets the timing of the jump absolutely right. Any byes here can hurt New Zealand"
"slightly short of a length, and it seams away from just outside off to beat the bat"
"really full, just outside off, kept out by Jadeja"
"looks for the lbw with the real full ball as Jadeja is hanging back, but the bat comes down in time and he works it to leg for one"
"length ball, swinging in, punched to cover. Middle of the bat"
"looks for the lbw ball swinging back in, Shami gets a thick inside edge towards fine leg, and <strong>this time they take the single</strong>. So Southee will start the over against Shami"
"bouncer, hooked away, and it bounces just in front of fine leg. So a good result for India"
<strong>beaten</strong> as he pushes at a length ball outside off. Seam movement again
"<strong>dropped?</strong>. No it doesn't carry. Jadeja has another push at a wide length ball, and the edge is dying in front of first slip. Watling dives at it, but it reaches him on a half-volley"
"Shami does the right thing, but New Zealand have their field placements spot on. He slogs at a length ball, nearly middles it, but he has found deep forward square leg to perfection. At least the attitude is right. Not sure about Jadeja, though, who doesn't cross, and gives Bumrah two balls to survive"
"wide on the crease, really full, Bumrah doesn't push at it"
"on a length, outside off, left alone"
"short, straight, Jadeja backs away and cuts, and turns down the single"
"full and straight, pushed back to Jadeja"
"on a length, seam away, and Jadeja <strong>is beaten</strong>. Too good for him"
"backs away, skips down, has a big swing at Boult, but the ball swings away to beat him"
"yes sir. Is it ever? Jadeja gets under a full ball, and lofts it right back over his head. Middles it. Six valuable runs. Take the lead into the 120s"
"Boult hangs this wide to disallow the single. Jadeja has a push at it, and the seam away from him <strong>beats him</strong>"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
"full, swinging, dipping, Bumrah has a push at it, but it is too good to take the edge. <strong>Beats him by a long way</strong>"
"valuable runs. Southee strays down the leg side, and Bumrah gets enough bat on it. lead 125 now"
"<strong>swinging too much for Bumrah</strong>. He has gone wide on the crease, to the edge of the box, has pitched this right up, and it still swings away enough to beat his edge"
"<strong>mind holding the bat straight, sir?</strong>. Southee is swinging it miles, and Bumrah is not good enough to edge it"
"full, just outside off, pushed back to Southee"
"calls for two, will get it comfortably. No more than an inside edge as far as midwicket. The man coming in had a lot of work to do anyway"
"slips this length ball down leg, through to the keeper"
"steps out and gives this a wallop to clear mid-on, runs away for four and India's lead into the 130s"
hops back and defends this skiddy short delivery
"slips this down leg as he searches for late swing, Jadeja looks to work it to fine leg but misses"
"oh, dear. Absolute mess-up in the running. Jadeja didn't want the single as he tucked it gently into the leg side, Bumrah was halfway down when he was sent back. Boult quick to hare across and fire a throw to Williamson, who had run in from mid-on. Bumrah had no chance. <b> New Zealand need 132 to take the series 2-0 </b>"

prods half-forward to get a thick inside edge onto the pad
"<strong>through him!</strong> Nearly an inside-edge. Nipped back a long, long way. Pant full stretch to his left, didn't get any bat or glove so it's just one bye. Oh hang on, replays suggest there was a thin inside edge. <strong>So it's been dropped</strong>"
"leaves, and it's a dangerous one! Very, very close to the off stump"
"appeal, a stifled appeal but not out. This one nips back in to beat the inside edge as Latham half prods"
"close, very close. Another one not given. There's an inside edge on this one, it seems. Cracking over."
"hops back, right on top of the bounce in defence"
"appeal for lbw, the ball deflects off the pad to the off side and they'll get a leg bye. Shami went up  big time, missing leg though"
"tickles the pad, beats Pant and it's four down leg. Poor from Shami."

"full, on off, defended back to him"
"full, on the pads, defended to leg"
"tossed up again, Latham stretches forward to defend"
"tossed up outside off, driven with an open face, past point, and they take on a tired Bumrah to steal the third. This is like Courier going for a jog after beating Agassi in his early days"

dabs this gently to gully
"appeal for lbw, not given. Height may have been in question. <b> India may as well review and they do. </b> This length delivery snuck back in to beat the inside edge and hit him on the right pad. Blundell was rooted to the crease alright but at the point of impact, it just felt a tad high, so there's a good chance this will come back as umpire's call. Ball tracking confirms this would've clipped the stumps, so the on-field decision will stay. <b> Not out. </b>"

"dug in short, sails way over Latham as he lets this go"
"wicket finally for India as they avoid two back-to-back 10-wicket drubbings. Umesh digs this in short on middle and leg, gets big on Latham as he looks to pull, only manages to glove it through to Pant who puts his right hand out and takes an excellent catch. Latham didn't even bother looking at the umpire and started walking."
"slants one in full from wide of the crease, defended"
"in that off-stump channel, back of a length and thereabouts, Blundell leaves as this nibbles away a touch"
<strong>glorious!</strong> The confidence you can derive from time spent at the crease. Not a half-volley by any means but he plants forward and belts this through cover on the up.

sways out of the way of this short delivery angling in
"<strong>gloves this gully.</strong> Ripper of a delivery from Bumrah! This took him by surprise. This one zipped through, Williamson looked to duck under it but this was so quick that he couldn't get his gloves out of the way. Jaffa"

right behind the line as he defends this back down the pitch
cover driven with disdain. This was full and he simply flayed that away
"the off-stump is flattened! What a ball from Bumrah. Now, now. Can only wonder what if they had another 80 runs to play with. This ball wickedly comes back in from outside off, skids through to beat Blundell's half-hearted forward push. This is very, very close to being a no-ball though. The umpire is having a look at the point of landing. Is the heel behind the line? I think there is nothing. Even if there is, I can't see it. Let's see what the third umpire thinks. Okay, he's been given out, millimetres."
"angles in a full ball on the stumps, defended"

works this off a length to midwicket
works this down to long-on. That's the Test and the series for New Zealand. <strong>120 points into the kitty.</strong> They win the series 2-0. What a reversal from the T20I whitewash. New Zealand bounced back to take the ODIs 3-0 and now the Tests 2-0. <b> The win also takes NZ to second in the ICC Test rankings </b>
