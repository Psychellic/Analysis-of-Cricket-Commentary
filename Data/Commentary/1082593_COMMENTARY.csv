"nice start. Full and straight, 141 kph. Some swing, not a lot. Worked to midwicket"
"lovely start. Just opened up his stance a touch. Knew there would be some inswing. Full and straight, drilled through mid-off. Full face of the bat. Great timing"
"drags that length back right away. Good bowling. Saw if there was some swing early on, didn't quite work so he pulled his length back, forcing Roy to defend"
"full and wide outside off, mis-timed drive to mid-on. Leaden footed too. That's how he plays though"
"full and wide outside off, Roy strides forward and carves a punchy cut through backward point."
"good length delivery on off, a shovelled stab to midwicket. Tidy over for Gujarat. Lovely pace in this surface"
"the googly to start. Flat on off, pushed to long-on. Didn't quite pick that, read it off the pitch"
"another googly, outside off, full. Driven back to the bowler. Doesn't look comfortable against legspin"
"well, there is an option if you're not picking it. A flat straight delivery on middle and off. Roy gets outside the line and reverse-sweeps through point. So much power, a more productive area for Roy"
the quicker delivery but ill-directed. Down leg. Wide
"not picking it again. Flat and quick on leg, hits Roy on the pad. Goes through his legs to the keeper"
"yikes, a rank long-hop. Filthy. Sat up for Roy too. Pulled to deep square leg"
"84 kph, another one that was not the legspinner. Flat and straight, pushed to long-on. Well played by these two"
"the seam-up delivery? He has one that floats out, seams away. Full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"that was rubbish from KKR. Flat and wide outside off, plenty of width. McCullum cuts towards backward point where Kuldeep dives over the ball and allows the boundary"
"flat outside off, blocked towards cover"
"ooh, 92 kph. Full, quick and straight. McCullum closes the bat face too early, a leading edge towards point for one. Lucky for Baz"
"too full from Narine. Full and straight, driven to long-on"
"quick and straight, McCullum walks right across and works to fine leg. Had to make connection, he walked too far"
"that was a rubbish delivery that gets the wicket. What a way to go. A filthy long-hop on leg. Roy gets into position to pull, but somehow gets a leading edge. Hangs in the air for a while before settling in Yusuf's hands at square leg, running to his right from midwicket. Not the best IPL debuts for Roy."
"flat and slowish outside off, a nervous prod towards point"
"well played. Percentage stroke. A flat delivery on off, sits up for Raina and he plays a low-risk pull to deep midwicket"
"that's maaaasive. Enough he's had. Flat and straight, McCullum clears his front leg and gives the ball a good thwack. A slog sweep way over midwicket, Not much spin in this surface so far"
"well bowled. Slower through the air outside off, skids on after pitching, forcing McCullum to defend"
"played that off the stumps. Flat and quick on off, aiming towards the top of off. Guided to short third man"
"nicely bowled. Nicely played. Full, swerving back in towards off. Raina gets forward and pushes to long-off"
"slogged away, but finds the gap wide of long-on for a couple. Full and straight, stabbed away into the gap"
"flat. Almost went for six. McCullum backs away, Narine drops short. Scythes a cut with so much power over point. No chance. Gained elevation"
"well played by both parties. Full and straight, McCullum sees a good delivery and defends"
"too short again. Sits up for McCullum on middle, pulled easily through square leg. They have erred short instead of full"
"good end. Full and straight, McCullum blocks"
"so much power that even the parry goes for four. That's a superb stroke. Overpitched on middle, Raina drills a drive straight back at Woakes, who gets a right hand on it. Deflects for four anyway"
"slower ball on off, hit to mid-off. Full face of the bat"
"good length down leg, Raina backs away. Woakes follows him. Flicked down to the backward square leg boundary. Exceptional batting. Raina looks switched on today. These are all high-percentage strokes"
"a slower ball on leg, shovelled through midwicket for a couple"
"<b>dropped</b>! Tough catch. Kuldeep got there but couldn't quite cling on as his arms hit the ground. Short delivery on middle, Raina was surprised by the length. Pulls anyway, hangs in the air for a while, allowing Kuldeep to move to his left and backwards from mid-on. Catches it, but the ball spills out"
"worked away to midwicket, slower ball"
the wrong un to start from Kuldeep. McCullum gets forward and blocks
walks across and works the ball to midwicket. Well played.
"a good stroke. Slightly short from Kuldeep, Raina goes back and cuts to deep point"
"75 kph, another wrong 'un on middle and off. Blocked"
"this is first legspinner to McCullum. Short on middle and leg, pulled to deep square leg. In front of square"

"full on leg, worked to square leg for a run"
"a slower short ball on middle, McCullum is too early on middle. Under-edged to the keeper"

"slogged. A proper one. Full on off, shovelled to deep midwicket. Clears his front stance"
"too straight and Raina helps himself to some runs. On the pads, worked to the fine leg boundary. The fielder was in the circle"
"that was plumb! Just misses a straight one does McCullum. Full and straight from Kuldeep, on middle. The legbreak. Spun towards leg, struck McCullum in front of leg. Could it have spinning down? May have been too full for the umpire to consider that option. Didn't look a bad decision at first glance."
"a low full toss, Finch chose a good option. Got low to paddle sweep, but got a toe-end towards square leg"
"flat and straight, nudged away towards midwicket"
"beauty. The googly outside off, Finch plays the line but is beaten on the outside edge. Lovely deception in the air"

worked away towards square leg for a single
"flat and straight, worked away through square leg. Clever batting. Use up all these middle overs"
"in the arc, and Finch gives it a whacking. How dare you float one up? On off and middle. Finch gets low and muscularly pulls over midwicket"
"this is even bigger. This is humongous. Slightly flatter but on middle and leg, heaved away over square leg. Exceptional batting. has almost removed him from bowling again"
"slightly short outside off, cut to deep point"
"short and slow, pushed to long-on"
"flat and wide outside off, a chopped cut towards point"
"lobbed up outside off, Raina chips a drive down to long-off on the front foot"
Finch holes out to wide long-off. Suryakumar pulls off the finger-on-the-lip celebration. This is the tossed-up googly from Kuldeep. Finch backed away outside leg to loft it over the covers. He probably picked the googly but did not get the execution right; sliced it off the outside edge to long-off running to his left
"straight ball on middle, hangs back and nudges to midwicket"

Boult pouches the ball, then tumbles over the boundary, but before he fell over he had the presence of mind to toss the ball back into the field of play. Superb effort from Boult"
"Raina uses his feet again, he is nowhere close to the pitch, slices it in front of the advancing long-off"
"Raina uses his feet again, attempts the loft again, this is the googly, turning away from him. Raina carves it over the off-side infield"

"slower through the air, turns away outside off, Raina having stepped out is beaten in the air but somehow defends it"
"tossed up on leg, Raina uses his feet and chips it in the air. The ball lands in between deep midwicket and long-on. Karthik wants two, Raina doesn't. There is a <b>horrible mid-pitch mix-up</b>. They eventually chance the second, Karthik is forced to pull out a full-length dive. Kuldeep collects the ball but does not even attempt to disturb the stumps. Bizarre. Even if Kuldeep had ferried the ball to Uthappa, Raina would have been out at the other end"

"looks like a slower offcutter outside off, bounces, Raina swings early and misses"
"<b>Mid-pitch collision</b>. Raina, ball-watching, rams into Woakes. The bowler is down. He gets up and shares a laugh with Raina. This was short and wide outside off, scythed to point"
