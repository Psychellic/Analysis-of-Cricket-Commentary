"short, wide, flayed on the up through cover point. Sanga still has it. Sanga has always had it. He sees the width and laces it through the line"
"<strong>edged and dropped at second slip</strong>. Fuller and closer to off, angling in, straightens away to have Sanga poking at it. Asif Ali at second slip stretches to his right and spills it"
"back of a length and slanting away outside off, no shot"

"back of a length and outside off, Shehzad punches on the up and hits it to extra cover"
picked off the hips to the right of long leg for a double
"<strong>Raees has his man now</strong>. Asif Ali bends low and makes no mistake this time at first slip. Full and Raees explores the channel outside off, finds movement off the pitch, Sanga hangs his bat out and snicks it behind. Looks like the rain has juiced up the pitch. Rare failure for Sanga"
"good length and put outside off, Bravo shoulders arms"
"full and just a shade outside off, Bravo loosens his grip and drops a single to cover"
"good length and breaks in against the angle, squirted back to the bowler off an inside edge"
"pitched up on off, draws Shehzad forward, blocked to short cover"
"good length on off, Shehzad aims the leg side, instead leading-edges it to short cover. <b>He's on 2 off 11 balls</b>"
"back of a length and angling across off, stabbed on the up past the right of the bowler and left of wide mid-off. First boundary since the first ball"
"short on the hips, glanced to fine leg"
"full and probing away just a shade outside off, moves past the outside edge, <strong>nearly trimmed the top of off</strong>"
"Shehzad puts bat on ball now, although this is a streaky outside edge that rolls away to deep third man"
"<strong>Sami bounces out Bravo</strong> and lets out a big roar. Banged in short at the shoulder, angling away, cramps up Bravo for room. The batsman loses his shape and falls over. The resultant top edge is snaffled by Finn diving forward from short fine leg. The England quick seemed to have misjudged it but then moved in and to his right to recover"
Sami goes past the outside edge again. This is neither full nor shot. This is the in-between length. The batsman is neither forward nor back. He is pinned to the crease and watches the ball skirt past the bat. Sami is turning the clock back
"full and just a shade outside off, tapped to extra cover off the front foot"
"short and outside off, Shehzad rides the bounce and jabs it away to the right of deep third man"
"back of a length and outside off, that's the <strong>definition of a crunching dot</strong>. Punched on the up to the right of backward point. Shadab throws himself to his right to pounce on the ball"

"overpitched at the toes, clipped away to deep square leg"
"back of a length and outside off, Shehzad jumps on top of the bounce and punches to cover-point"
"<strong>Flapped into the lap of Raaes at mid-on</strong>. Good length, and nipping away outside off, Maqsood shapes to slug it over midwicket. Instead, he pops a leading edge to Raees. Sami is having a ball in Dubai"
back of a length and hits the bat hard as opposed to bat hitting ball. Squirted to the leg side
"dug in shorter and outside off, not much room to free the arms. Stabbed to cover-point from the crease"
"<strong>First boundary for Shehzad off his 20th ball</strong>, in the last over of Powerplay. Dragged down outside off, Shehzad sat back waiting for this. Pulled away in front of square to the midwicket fence"

"rising short ball outside off, Malik rises with it, pats it down, and sets off"

full and angling into the front-foot push between midwicket and mid-on

full and angling into a push to mid-on
"Shehzad has been put out of his misery by Finn. Back of a length and climbing onto the hips, Shehzad pulls but can't keep it down. He hits it straight to deep fine leg. A soft innings meet a soft end"
"there's a deflection, but was it off the bat? Pollard dares to shimmy out. Finn pulls his length back and gets it to nip back in sharply, catches the flap of the pad and carries to the keeper. No bat involved, and hit outside the line"
"on a length and outside off, Pollard reaches out for the ball with his hands and scoops it in the air to third man"
"short and just a shade outside off, Malik rides the bounce and plays to backward point"
"short, wide, laced away to the right of deep third man for two"
"full and angling away outside off, Pollard belts it in the air straight of mid-on. Dismissive"
"very full and skids back in off the pitch, the batsman is late onto his leg-side shot and wears it on the pad. The angle was too sharp to threaten the stumps"
"short and outside off, chopped down to third man"
"back of a length and outside off, punched up to backward point. You can't get it past Shadab"
"banged in short outside off, Malik rides the bounce and fends to point"
"lifter outside off, Pollard lets it go"
"fullish and outside off, dabbed square through the off side for one"

"pushed through on middle, Malik presses forward and glides it to backward point"

"darted short and wide outside off, chopped to backward point"
"darted flat on middle and leg, tucked around the corner for one"
"<b>skiddy googly</b>, breaks back in, beats the inside edge of a helmet-less Pollard and the top of off. The batsman did not pick it and played for the legbreak"
"short and decks in on off, Malik hops, skips, and chops to point"
"nails a yorker on off stump, Pollard can do nothing but toe-end it down to long-on"

"on a length and outside off, right in the swinging radar, Pollard clears his front leg and<strong> launches it into the top tier</strong>"
"<strong>Four boundaries in five balls</strong>. This is a top edge but everything counts. Banged in short and outside off, tucks up Pollard, who pulls, and skies it over the keeper"
"<strong>Russell hits back to trap Pollard</strong>. It looks pretty adjacent but Pollard asks for a review. This was the change-up offcutter, grips in the surface, and hits the front pad as Pollard hangs back and plays around it. The on-field out decision is vindicated. The tracker returns three reds. Pollard, however, has given this innings a leg-up"
"rising short ball outside off, dropped in front of point for one"

Badar aims a fine scoop but is fooled by this cutter and hit on the thigh
"back of a length and outside off, Malik slashes and only collects fresh air"
"<strong>short, wide, possibly an offcutter, nailed straight to backward point</strong>. You just can't get it past Shadab - one of the best fielders in the world. Russel has his hands aloft and celebrates. Malik cuts hard but can't keep it down. He had stabilised Multan's innings, who will finish it now?"
"short and outside off, tip and run to cover"
"A comedy of errors. This was full on off, nowhere near short to cut. The batsman chops beside his feet, Tanvir sets off for a single. Russell runs in to attack the ball, he aims to throw the stumps down at the non-striker's end but misses. Shadab is frustrated. Mid-on collects the ball. Russell, though, is on the floor, wondering what might have been. He's an excellent fielder in general but misses the chance this time"

"full on middle, stays leg-side of the ball and pumps it to extra cover"
"<strong>middle-stump yorker</strong>, squeezed to square leg"
"112.4ks dipping full-toss, foxes the batsman, and leaves the stumps in a mess. Slower delivery from the back of the hand, look at the sharp dip on the bat. Badar aims to swing across the line but misread the change up. Even if he had read it, I suspect he would have hit it. Great skill from Raees: he can swing the new ball, get it to skid off the pitch, bowl yorkers and slower ones. Gun T20 bolwer"
Tahir stays leg-side of the ball and watches this swing and bounce over middle stump

"very full on off, the batsman can't quite get underneath it. Sliced through cover-point"
"<strong>knocked 'em over</strong>. Yorker on the leg stump, Tahir backs away, swings wildly, and misses. Excellent T20 bowling from Raees"
"full and straight, tickled to the off side off an inside edge. That scrape of wood saves the No.11"
"full and skids in again, pins the pad as the batsman plays across it. <strong>Pitched outside leg</strong>"
"off-stump yorker, inside-edged to fine leg"
"Asif Ali nails a direct hit from deep midwicket. Irfan is caught short on the second. This was really full on off, he can't get under the length and toe-ends it to the deep, where Asif puts on a show"
"full, angling away, swinging past the outside edge"
"back of a length and slanting away outside off, ignored this time"
"Irfan generates extra bounce and away movement to have Ronchi nicking off. Kicks up from a back of a length outside off and nips away, Ronchi wafts with no feet and tickles it behind. Pollard hangs onto a chest-high catch. Perfect start for Multan"

"back of a length and angling across off, thumped away square through the off side. Beats deep third man to his right"

"good length and angling across off, Farhan chases after it and is beaten on the outside edge"

"darted onto the pads, tickled fine on the leg side"

"short on top of off, Walton gets behind the line and punches up to mid-off"
"93ks dart outside off, Farhan brings his fast hands into play and crashes the ball through extra cover. He went low and muscled it"

"another little dab to third man, this is placed fine of the fielder for two"
"back of a length on off, glided behind square on the off side"
"back of a length and bounces outside off, the batsman wafts, and has he nicked it behind? <strong>Irfan challenges the on-field not-out decision</strong>. Don't think there was bat on that. No deflection, and Ultraedge detects nothing. Ali survives"

"full on off, tip and run to cover"
"Oh dear, Maqsood runs in with the ball from mid-on but misses the stumps at the non-striker's end. Flapped to Maqsood. There's a mix-up between the wickets. Maqsood aims to just run in and tip the bails off. Then realises he doesn't have enough time, attempts an under-arm throw and makes a royal mess of it. Poor judgement from the fielder, think he had time to simply run in and break the stumps. Pressure can make you do strange things"

full and nibbles away past the outside edge
"much shorter and bends away outside off, Talat hangs his bat out and is beaten on the outside edge again"

shorter and spins away outside off - legbreak - Tahir finds extra bounce and has Ali feathering it behind. Sanga rides the bounce and takes it smartly
"<strong>Tahir sets off on back-to-back celebratory sprints</strong>. He has turned the chase. This was another full wrong'un, Russell does not pick the variation - it breaks back in sharply - Russell has a short stride and plays outside the line for the legbreak. He is hit below the knee-roll on the front pad in line with middle. No bat involved, Ultraedge defects nothing. But was it spinning down leg? The tracker returns umpire's call on leg stump. <strong>Tahir claims the big wicket of Russell and is on a hat-trick</strong>. Scenes in Dubai"
"tossed-up googly, draws the batsman forward, and breaks away past the outside edge. Sanga whips the bails off in a flash. The back leg is grounded and Ashraf survives. Tahir thought he had got Ashraf and set off on a sprint. Mute the celebration"
