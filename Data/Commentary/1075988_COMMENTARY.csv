"tossed up on middle, grips and spins back in to hit Hasan high on the thigh pad as he looks to defend"
"pushed through quicker on middle, Hasan is back inside the crease as he defends back down the pitch"
"poor, very very poor. Looks to hit this out of the stadium, but pick out Jordan, who has bucket hands, at long-on. Didn't get to the pitch of the ball as he stepped out, got more elevation than distance. As far as catches go, Jordan couldn't have asked for an easier one at the boundary."
"flatter one on middle and leg from around the stumps, turned wide of midwicket to get off the mark"
"steps out but is still made to reach out, driven but straight to mid-off. Good flight from Hafeez"
works it with the spin to long-on. Excellent first over
"gets this to shape away from outside off, left alone"
"angles one back in from wide of the crease, defended back with soft hands"
"he dropped a sitter last night, but has more than made up for it now. Babar slashes, but can only manage a thick edge. Believe me, it was flying and looked almost certain to beat Sammy on the dive at slip, but no! He stretched full length to his right and plucked it out. Sensational stuff. What's even more amazing is that he held on even as his elbows touched the ground. What control, simply outstanding."
starts off with a sumptuous cover drive. Leans forward and caresses it into the gap between cover and point. Lovely timing
"slides a length ball into middle and leg, tucked away into the gap at deep backward square leg. Sanga up and away in a jiffy"
solidly behind the line of that full delivery that jags away from middle.
"pushed through quicker on middle, defended back down the pitch"
"look to fire this in but the ball slips out perhaps. Lobbed over Gayle's waist as he looks to swing this over deep midwicket, but couldn't generate much power. Surely a no-ball? Umpire doesn't think so. Hafeez quickly apologises"
eases it into the gap at cover and walks the single
punched off the back foot to Boom Boom Afridi at extra cover
"fired in full on the pads, tucked to square leg"
"drifting in from wide of the crease, Gayle gets a good stride forward to smother the spin"
"he's pulled this straight to midwicket, would you believe it? Jordan won't mind that. Not the kind of delivery that generally fetches you a wicket against a batsman of Sanga's class and quality, really. Short, he looks to take him on with the pull but didn't close the bat face. The timing was off as well and Hafeez managed to take it easily in front of square, near the umpire."
"nips away off the seam from off, defended carefully"
gets behind the line of that length ball and bunts it to mid-on
"delightful straight drive, shows the full face of the bat to ease that down the ground. It was a half-volley that deserved to be put away, superb balance from Malik"
"angles a length ball into middle from wide of the crease, bunted back down the pitch"
uppish but on the bounce to the cover fielder
gets forward and blocks the full-length delivery
"flatter and fuller on middle and leg, turned to short midwicket"
driven but straight to Morgan at cover. Pressure building. Is the release shot coming?
"as plumb as they come, and this is a big moment in the match. Bowls the slider from around the stumps, Gayle plays for the turn but there is none. He's struck right in front of middle. That is a straightforward decision, really. You could sense Gayle was edgy, he's never comfortable facing the spinners early on, and the ploy of using Hafeez has worked for Sammy. Karachi in tatters now"
"cut away, into the gap between cover and point. Too short and he picked the length early"
"slides one on off stump, punched past point for a quick single"
"delightful square drive on the up, third man comes around with a tumbling stop. That was travelling"
"thick edge, and <b> Kamran Akmal has failed to get his gloves to it. </b> Reacted late, but it was still a catch. Poor footwork, you have to say. This was definitely the keeper's catch. <b> Reprieve for Bopara </b>"
what does Bopara do to add insult to injury? Hops back and whips a length ball on middle into the square leg boundary. Sensational timing and use of the bottom hand to generate power
"stretches forward, opens the bat face slightly and eases this behind point"
"looks to play a flat-batted pull, but the ball got big on him. Toe-ended it to short midwicket"
"mixes his pace up with an off cutter, Bopara taps it towards point and scampers across for a quick single"
turned with the angle to midwicket
"drifts in a short ball that spins away a touch from middle, punched to long-on"
"too short, crunched off the back foot to sweeper cover as they jog the single"
"slider that beats Malik's attempted whip, hit high on the left pad"
"tossed up outside off, there's a bit of grip and turn, driven to point this time"
"pushed to point, the non-striker called for the run and made it in the nick of time. The throw wasn't the best one either."
"slips in a length ball across the batsman, punched to deep point"
"play and a miss. Short and angling away, looked to ease it behind point but was beaten for pace"
"uppish drive, but on the bounce to backward point"
"slower delivery, the batsman is deceived and pokes at the away-going delivery. There was some noise, some deivation too. Sammy went up in an appeal, Wahab ran through the length of the pitch, but Kamran Akmal didn't appeal. Perhaps he thought there was nothing. Umpire wasn't convinced either."
flayed away but an outstanding stop at backward point by Hafeez
"controls the pull nicely, down to deep square leg"
"drifts in a short ball on middle, he makes room and crunches it to deep point"
gets to the pitch of the ball and eases it into the gap behind square on the off side
"flipper this time on middle, he's hurried into an attempted push, just about manages to get some bat on it as it rolls to Afridi's right, they steal a single"
"too full and down the leg side, nurdled to square leg"
"grip, turn and bounce, he gets on top of the bounce and defends it back down the pitch"
misfield at point allows a single
"short of length delivery that rears up on off stump, Malik gets on top of the bounce and fends it to the off side"
"errs in line, slides this down leg but is lucky to get away. Bopara looks to flick behind square but can only get some pad on it as they take a run off the deflection"
"pulled imperiously! Just fractionally short, Malik was ready for it as he put that away in front of square. Little press forward, then swivelled back and found his timing"
uses the pace of the bowler to steer this down to third man
"off-cutter this time, not much change in action, defended back gently"
"short, wide and he's crunched that to deep point"
"peach of a delivery that squares Bopara up. Plenty of fizz, this drifted in and spun away past the shoulder of the bat"
"fired into middle from wide of the crease, squeezed back down the pitch"
"too full to cut, still goes through with the shot and finds point"
"play and a miss. This one's much slower through the air, plenty of revs as the ball pitches and beats Bopara's feeble push. Akmal breaks the stumps and appeals for a stumping. Bopara's back foot that was in the air for a second or so is back inside the crease."
"too full on the pads, driven to long-on"
"turned to the right of Afridi, who runs across towards short midwicket"
"sees the batsman stepping out and fires this in, Malik blocks it with his pad"
"too short, he makes room and cuts this into the gap at deep extra cover"
"full toss on the pads, turned to long-on"
"draws him forward, and beats him in flight and dip. Back foot just inside as Akmal whipped the bails off. Superb delivery"
"leading edge that rolls past the bowler, just short of him. He's beating Bopara in drift here"
gets forward and bunts this into the gap at cover
"too close to cut, goes through with the shot. Morgan moves to his right to cut that off"
"fired full from wide of the crease, turned to short midwicket"
"steps out but Afridi fires this full and wide, Bopara adjusts and taps it towards point and scampers across for a single"
"looks to go down town but got too close to the delivery, squeezed to long-on"
jabbed hard to cover. Afridi is mixing his pace quite well here
"nearly chips a return catch. Looks to work it across the line, this one spun away just a touch and lands in front of Afridi, off a leading edge."
"drifting into middle and leg, punched to deep midwicket"
"backs away to go over cover, but the bowler cleverly tosses this up well outside off, left alone"
sweeps and misses. Had to fetch it from well outside off
fierce sweep shot down to deep backward square leg
steps out and punches the in-drifter to long-off
"whipped across the line to deep midwicket, the 50-stand is up"
flayed away on the up to sweeper cover
chops this down to third man for an easy single. Wahab is looking to bang them in short
"pulled in front of square, but straight to deep midwicket"
dabs it late and gets it down to third man again
"short, he gets into position early and thumps it in front of square. Back-of-the-hand slower delivery, enough time to play the pull."
"steps out to go over cover, Wahab sees him coming and bangs it short outside off, Bopara sways out of the way"
heaved across the line to deep midwicket
"didn't get underneath the flight, but went through with the inside-out stroke. Wanted to hit it over cover, but ended up giving catching practice to Jordan at long-off. Credit to the bowler for being brave and tossing the ball up in the end overs. This may not be a bad thing after all from Karachi's point of view."
"looks to whip this away, looks like he managed a bit of inside edge, down to short fine leg as they complete a quick single"
lofted straight down the ground and into the first tier. Long-on was a mere spectator. Pollard didn't look happy at being told what to do. Took out the anger on the ball.
"grip and turn from off stump, bunted to the off side for a quick single"
"another biggie. This one's too full, he advances, gets underneath the flight and boom! Over long-on again. Sania Mirza, in the stands, gives her nod of approval to the shot. Excellent use of the feet to get to the pitch of the ball."
"shuffles across to whip this length ball, deflects off the body to the leg side. Hit near the ribcage"
cut away towards the man coming in from deep point
"pulled but didn't get hold of it as much as he would have liked, long-on comes in quickly to cut that off"
"top edge and put down by Afridi, who was running back from short fine leg. The ball was swirling around for a long time, he did well to keep his eyes on the ball, but somehow lost control as it was descending rapidly. Got a touch away from him too and he grassed it in the end."
makes room and slaps the short ball into the cover boundary. Pure muscle
"right into the blockhole, drilled to long-on"
"looked to swing this over long-on, could only manage a thin nick through to the keeper. Wahab is quick. This was full and angling away, Malik was completely beaten for pace. End of a handy knock nevertheless"
"defended to point, sharp work by the fielder there. Can't get a single"
"why would you try to go for the big hits when all you need to do is give strike to Pollard? Beyond me. Wasim looks to make room and go over cover, the bounce does the trick this time. He gets it high on the bat and Sammy, running backwards from mid-off, hangs on."
uses the pace and angle of the bowler to ease this down to third man
"digs one in short on middle, fended to the off side"
"looks to bowl a dipping yorker, but loses direction and slides this down the leg side"
"eased past the bowler, Amir wanted the run, Pollard didn't but reluctantly managed to get across. Not-so-good match awareness from Amir this time."
flays an away-going length delivery to deep point
"Wahab at fine leg was briefly in business, but this was struck really well by Pollard. Sailed over the ropes. Too short, he was in position quickly and pulled him behind square."
"hit really hard but Jordan, on his followthrough, gets some hand on it and deflects it down to long-on"
swing and a miss. Off-cutter this time at length from Jordan
"full toss outside off, flayed to sweeper cover"
"full and straight outside off, Pollard squeezes this to deep cover and puts his hand out immediately, as if to suggest one is all that he will run for it. Keeps strike for the start of the final over"
pulled but on the bounce to deep backward square leg. Pollard refuses the single
"swings north, ball goes south. Wanted to pull in front of square, ended up getting a top-edge that flew over the keeper's head"
pulls and misses. Kamran cops a blow on his knee as he looks to gather it on the bounce
"muscled into the deep square leg region, two men back in the deep but can't prevent the second as the throw was weak"
"pulled in front of square, straight to deep midwicket"
"this is precisely why he refused the single off the previous delivery. Too short, this was also a slower variation which Pollard read off the hand, waited and then rolled his wrists over the pull to pick the gap at deep backward square leg"
"oooooooh, this was very, very close. His heart would have been fluttering, I can tell you. Full and swinging back in, Hafeez looks to work this across the line and is hit on the pad. Umpire reckons that may have missed leg. On replays, I must say it's a superb decision"
gets a good stride forward and defends the full delivery on off stump
"length ball that deviates a wee bit from middle, Hafeez gets back and bunts it to the off side"
"goodbye, and goodnight Hafeez. First ball last night, fourth ball today. This is a beauty from Amir. The ball nips back in, this was a touch fuller, he made the cardinal sin of trying to work this across the line, missed it completely and was plumb in front of middle and leg."
"shapes back in from off stump, Kamran is late on it but manages to squeeze this back to Amir"
"through him. Cuts him into two halves. Phew! Length ball that jags back in off the seam to beat Akmal's push away from the body. After it passed the bat, the ball deviated in a long way and Sanga had to dive full length to his left to stop that. Superb delivery, great effort behind the stumps. Exceptional first over"
"full and swinging in from leg stump, the ball deflects off Malan's pad, or did it? Sanga effects a one-handed stop. Given wide"
walks across the stumps and defends the in-swinger to midwicket
"too short and pitched outside leg, he is caught on the hop but the ball deflects behind square on the leg side and they sneak in a leg bye"
"big shout for lbw as Kamran walks across the stumps to flick. He was hit on the pad, but the angle may have taken it down the leg side. Good decision in the end, but worth a shout nonetheles"
"full and swinging away from outside off, he mistimes a drive to cover"
"beauty of a delivery. Gets this to land outside off and shape away, Akmal pokes and misses"
"what a strange, but beautiful game cricket is. In the form of his life yesterday. Fetched him 88 fine runs. Little less than 24 hours later, he has to walk back for a duck. Looks to pull but the ball gets big on him, he is caught in an awkward tangle. Miscues this straight to mid-on"
"outstanding, tails this away late to square Malan up on the full-length delivery. Sensational display of swing bowling this"
works this from middle to deep fine leg
"tentative push to a full delivery, down to point as they complete a quick single. Morgan off the mark"
squared up by a peach that nips away to beat hi tentative push. Missed it by a mile
"just past the outstretched hands of the second slip fielder. Looked to angle it behind point but got a thick edge. Did he react late?  May have, the ball raced away to the third man boundary"
gets back into the crease and bunts the good length delivery to the off side
"swings back in late from middle, Morgan is hit on the pad as he looks to flick"
"play and a miss. This time it is an attempted run down to third man, but there wasn't much room for him to play that stroke"
ball skids back in to hit him high on the thigh pad as he looks to hop back and defend.
too much width this time and he's crashed that behind point. Super timing from Morgan
"steps out and wallops this wide of mid-on! Didn't get hold of it completely but had just enough to clear the infield. He gave him the charge to negate that late swing, the ploy worked this time"
opens his wrists at the last moment to pick the gap behind point. Third man comes around to cut that off
goes a long way outside off and turns this to midwicket for a quick single. Plonked the bat in
"shapes this away from length on off, Morgan watches this through to the keeper. Pulled out of it"
"this one nips back in, Morgan shuffles across to play but is hit on the pad this time. Doing too much"
"play and a miss. High back lift, was beaten by the time the bat came down to ease it behind point"
"sliding into the pads, and Morgan accepts it gleefully. Flicked behind square, fine leg was up and so once he got some bat on it, that was headed only one way"
"fast hands, mindblowing hand-eye coordination. Short of length but not much width, I really don't know how he managed to open up that big a gap to flay that away behind point. Third man hardly moved by the time the ball reached the boundary"
"full toss outside off, thumped into the cover boundary"
punched off the back foot to long-off as they jog the single
"worked to the leg side, Sanga hares across to cut that off but can't prevent the single"
"beautiful execution, delightful inside-out drive. Got underneath the flight and lofted it cleanly. Didn't try to over-hit it. Lovely"
"spanking drive, this time to the left of cover. Mid-off had no chance either, as did the man at the boundary. Not all that full, didn't get to the pitch in fact, but still went through with the drive and struck it well"
leans forward and eases the flighted delivery back to Malik
driven firmly to cover
"play and a miss. Looked to slap this over cover, but the ball fizzed across without much turn"
"drifts away to take the leading edge and roll to the off side, looked to tuck it wide of midwicket"
shows the full face of the bat to ease it down to long-off

gets to the pitch of the ball and eases this to cover
"flighted on middle and leg, wrists it to long-on"
"touch short on middle and leg, worked to deep midwicket"
"drifting into middle, punched to long-off"
"short, spinning back into middle and leg, worked with the angle to deep midwicket as they jog the single"
"almost a catch to cover. Flight, drift and dip. Morgan reached out to drive, and was nearly out to cover. Coach Mickey Arthur lets out a cry of anguish from the dressing room. Super delivery"
stretches forward and blocks the tossed up delivery on off stump
"not much room for him to cut, goes through with the stroke, mistimes it to cover"
worked to long-on as they jog the single
"looks to go inside-out over cover, but played too early. Beaten"
gets across the stumps and eases it with the angle to long-off
"pressure was building, Malan goes for a wild slog and has picked out Babar Azam, who takes an excellent catch at deep midwicket. The ball was dying on him but he ran in and then dived full length forward to complete the catch even as the ball was dying on him. There's still life in this contest."
"beaten by the drift. This one angles away to beat Sohail's drive. Sanga whips the bails off, was the back foot in? Looks so. He stretched a little too far forward, but the back foot was firmly inside the crease."
"touch short, he makes room and crunches it to deep point"
worked with the spin to wide long-on
"beaten by drift. This one is a googly too, Morgan prods forward and plays inside the line as the ball whizzes past the outside edge"
"another wrong'un, Morgan gets to the pitch of the ball and smothers the spin this time"
"worked with the spin to long-on, too short this time"
gets forward and defends a tossed up delivery outside off

"tries to cut, beaten again"
worked across the line to Pollard at long-on
"excellent delivery. Drifts in, pitches and holds its line. Beats Morgan"

"short and sliding into middle and leg, eased to long-on"
"too full on the pads, nurdled to the man coming in from deep midwicket"

"steps out and gets too close to the delivery, squeezed to cover"
"steps out and works it with the angle towards deep midwicket, they complete the second quite easily"
"firm push past the diving Malik, down to long-off. Run-a-ball off the over"
drives this to the left of point and scampers across for a quick single. Hint of confusion but they went through with the run
"big appeal for caught behind, Morgan tried to play the back flick, but was too early into the stroke. Could have only been glove, but there was daylight"
"crunched int the gap at sweeper cover, too short this time"
"wrong'un on middle, driven to short cover, looks for the single but the fielder does well to dive to his left and cut off the single"
you have to be really brave to keep flighting the ball. Morgan this time is up to the pitch of the ball and lofts this back over the bowler's head
"pulled away into the gap between deep midwicket and wide long-on, there is a tag-team effort as one fielder slides and passes it onto the other."
"fraction short, he rocks back and whips this into the gap at deep midwicket, back for the second quite comfortably"
clean! Pleasing shot. To the pitch of the ball and goes inside-out over cover. Trademark Morgan shot
"reserve slap, if you can call it. Malik bowls this on middle and leg, how quick must your hands be to use those wrists to change grip and flick this behind square? Sensational"
punched to the man running backwards from mid-on
sees the batsman giving him the charge and fires this full and wide. Morgan was outside the crease but recovered quickly to make his ground even as Sanga tried to flick the ball back onto the stumps
"full on off, defended back to the bowler"
right out of the screws. Gets down on one knee and slog sweeps this over deep midwicket. Nailed it. Sensational
big appeal for lbw but looks like the ball may have pitched outside leg? He tried to work it across the line too. Replays say it pitched on and would have hit top of off.
gets forward and defends the length ball to the off side
worked across the line to deep midwicket
"play and a miss. Too full for him to play a big booming drive, had already passed him when the bat came down"

"pulled into the gap at deep square leg. Didn't time it all that well but it was into the gap, most importantly"
"sharp bouncer on middle from wide of the crease, Sohail ducks under that"
gets forward and defends back down to the bowler
a direct hit at the bowler's end would have made things interesting. Sohail was looking to hoick this but was cramped for room and turned it to the leg side somehow
"full and angling into middle and leg, tucked away towards the man coming in from deep midwicket"
"deceived by the change in pace. Amir rolls his fingers over the delivery, the ball grips and bounces more than he expected, Morgan is beaten as he tries to ease it wide of cover"
"flicked behind square! What timing, the placement even better. He knows his angles really well. Fetched this from outside but once again exhibits the power of his wrists to place the ball where he did"
angles a short of length delivery down to third man
"Ahmed did all the hardwork in running backwards from cover, but just couldn't hold on. Morgan deceived by the slower one, and ended up slicing it towards the off side. Scores level"
"slower delivery again, grips and spins away, he looks to turn it to the leg side, the ball takes the edge and rolls to the off side. That's all they need to complete the run and a clinical seven-wicket win"
