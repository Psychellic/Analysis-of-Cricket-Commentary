"right on target, length on around middle, cramping him for room, makes a little room and pushes it into the off side for one"

"full on middle, tapped to mid-on"
<b>that looks plumb.</b> Overpitched and coming in with the angle from off stump. He looks to drive for the one that straightens and is beaten big time on the inside edge. Feet are rooted to the crease and he's struck in front of middle
"<b>this looks good too!</b> Superb from Faulkner. Swings a big one in again, from wide of the crease. He has completely ruined the batsmen so far with variations from where he's delivering the ball. This hoops in from off, beats his flick and catches him dead in front. Two sounds, but we'll have to wait and see if one of them was bat. <b>He's on a hat-trick</b>"
"yorker length at leg stump, jammed into the leg side"
<b>deflected off the bowler</b> and past mid-off as it rolls out to the boundary. That must have caught the bone in his forearm because it sprinted away despite hitting him in the follow through. A length ball hammered back at him

Was looking to duck a short ball and that didn't quite rise as much as he expected. It's caught him on his way down. The team doctor is out to check on him. He's walking about, but he still looks dazed to me. <b>Looks like he will continue batting.</b> A new helmet has come out."
