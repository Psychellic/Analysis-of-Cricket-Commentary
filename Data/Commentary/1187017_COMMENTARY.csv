"back of a length, angling in towards leg stump, gets on top of it and plays it down to midwicket"
"fullish, fifth-stump line, left alone. If there's any swing away from the left-hander, it's feeble"
"back of a length just outside off, gets across to defend towards backward point/ Not too much bounce - the ball hit the bottom part of the bat, below the sweet spot"
"fullish, angling in towards off and middle, blocked back to the bowler. No swing still"
"back of a length on off stump, Shadman has plenty of time to get behind the line and defend to mid-on"
"full outside off - possibly there for the drive, but it's only the first over, and Shadman ignores it watchfully. A tiny bit of swing just as it approaches the keeper"
"fullish, angling across the stumps with a hint of swing back in. Gets his weight forward to defend into the off side"
drifts onto  the pads and Imrul tucks it away to fine leg to score the first run off the SG pink ball
"full, a bit of swing into a fourth-stump line. Gets forward for a checked drive to mid-off"
"again onto the pads, clipped away to fine leg"
"length ball, pitching on middle and off and angling away, not straightening back enough to induce a shot from Imrul"
"fullish on off stump, defended off the inside half of the bat into the leg side"
"A bit of swing away from the fifth-stump channel. Back of a length, and Shadman shapes to defend but adjusts and decides to leave in the end"
"beauty. This one angles in - the initial angle would have probably taken the ball towards middle stump - and forces Shadman to play, the length pinning him to the crease. Then it swings away late and beats the outside edge, and soars over the top of off stump"
"back of a length on off stump, defended off the back foot"
"back of a length, comes in with the angle from outside off. Gets across to defend into the point region"
"full and a touch too straight, clipped off the pads through backward square leg"
"on the fuller side of a good length, plenty of swing away from the left-hander. Starts too wide outside off to make the batsman play"
"back of a length, continuing with the angle across the left-hander, again starts a little too wide to make Shadman play"
"drifts a little too straight again, down the leg side, and Shadman can't connect with the flick"
"shot. A touch short, and the angle across creates just enough width as well. Rocks back and carves it away to the left of backward point. Excellent, decisive footwork"
"back of a length on off stump, hops back and across to clip to midwicket"
"short again, gets up to chest height outside off stump, and Shadman pounces once more with a fierce pull to the left of midwicket"
"fuller now, angling away from off stump, left alone"
"good leave. Length ball in the fifth-stump channel, with a wee bit of shape away"
"back of a length on middle stump, tucked away through backward square leg"
"length ball close to off stump, defended into the cover point region. He let that come to him, and let the ball hit his bat rather than the other way round"
"back of a length, a touch wider this time, left alone"
"fuller now, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"nice carry to Saha, who takes it in front of his face. Again it's in that fifth-stump channel, on the fuller side of a good length. Third leave in a row"
"length ball slanting across to off stump, good stride forward to defend into the point region"
"fullish, on middle stump this time, defended into the on side"
"back of a length, leg-stumpish. Looks to flick but only gets a bit of thigh pad on it, rolls into the square leg region"
"length ball slanted fairly wide of off, left alone. It straightened into Shadman, but from a wide line"
"again a touch too wide, and Shadman leaves once more"
"length ball, straightening towards the top of off stump. Stays on the back foot and squares up a little while defending towards gully"
"big appeal for caught behind, and Joel wilson's finger goes up immediately, but <b>Imrul reviews</b> just as quickly. It's the typical Ishant ball from round the wicket, angling in towards off stump and straightening late. Imrul's bat comes down at an angle, from gully towards wide mid-on, as he looks to get on his toes and defend, and the ball slides <i>past</i> the outside edge and goes to the keeper off the back thigh. Wilson has to reverse his decision"
"huge swing away from Imrul, but it starts wide of off stump - sixth or even seventh-stump line - and it's left alone, forcing Saha into a big dive to his left"
"big appeal again, this time for lbw, and Wilson's finger goes up again. Ishant has lately developed this cutter that comes back into the left-hander, and Imrul, playing for the one that holds its line, gets into a big tangle, his front leg going a long way across the stumps as he looks to defend. Past the inside edge and onto front pad. He's reviewed again, but I don't know why. It hit him well below the knee roll, and it's hitting leg stump halfway up"
"greets him with a short ball, but it's a fair way outside off, and Mominul leaves it alone"
"nice length, excellent carry - Saha takes it over his head - after Mominul leaves an away-swinger starting in the fourth-stump channel"
"short ball, gets up to shoulder height just over off stump. Mominul gets on his toes and defends with soft hands, gets the ball to drop gently a few feet away, square on the off side"
"even bigger cheer as Shadman gets into an awkward position against the short ball. It was outside off, and he shaped to hook first before deciding to leave, but he left his bat pointing up, and the ball hit it, popped up in the air, but fell safely between the converging bowler and gully"
"huge appeal from Saha for caught behind off the inside edge, and Shami doesn't even appeal, just runs towards the slip cordon with a big smile on his face. Not given. <b>India review</b>, but there's no bat on it. Back of a length, nips in off the seam as Shadman defends off the back foot. Beats the bat, tickles the thigh pad, and Saha takes it well, diving to his right"
"short, gets up to shoulder height, but angling down leg slightly. Controls a wristy pull down to long leg"
"back of a length, comes in off the seam but starts wide outside off, and Mominul leaves it unfussily"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and blocks into the off side"
"back of a length, angling into the stumps, defended towards mid-on"
"full, swings away from a wide-ish line. Left alone"
"big swing, from just short of a good length outside off. Leaves it alone, forcing Saha into another big dive to his left"
"good ball, fullish length, angling into the fifth-stump channel and leaving the left-hander late. Even better leave"
"back of a length, angling in towards middle and off. Jumps across and defends to mid-on"
"another superb leave from Shadman, this one was full and it began from fourth stump, but he watched it well, saw it beginning to curl away, and then made his decision"
"back of a length on off stump. Gets off his feet to ride the bounce, drops it gently into the off side with soft hands, and calls his partner through for a single"
"length ball, starts wide of off stump and seams away further. Much easier leave for Shadman"
"another leave. Better line and length from Shami, probably around sixth stump, but it's still wide enough to leave"
"back of a length close to off stump, hops and dabs into the cover point region"
goes wide of the crease and angles it in towards off stump. Hops across and defends into the pitch
"another great leave. Wide of the crease again, bowls it a little fuller than the last few have been, and gets it to seam in quite a bit, but again Shadman judges it well, despite the angle being so acute. Again, Saha has to show off his agility"
"easier leave. Moves in just as much, but starts from much wider"
"what a catch, Rohit Sharma! Lovely length from Umesh, angling across and straightening in. May not have hit off stump if Mominul left it, but no batsman would leave that line when it's moving in that direction. Possibly played for more movement than there was, feeling for it after a half-stride forward, and gets a thick edge that's flying towards Kohli at first slip, except Rohit dives across from second and plucks it out one-handed"
"length ball close to off stump, nice stride forward to defend"
"bowled him! The previous ball had swung away from Mithun, and this one may have been threatening to leave him in the air, but it nips back in off the seam and Mithun, rooted to the crease with bat coming down at an angle in defence, inside-edges it into his stumps"
"goes wide of the crease, bowls a back-of-a-length ball that climbs towards chest height close to off stump. Defended into the cover point region"
"looks to swing it from middle and leg, ends up drifting onto the pad, clipped to square leg"
"length ball leaving Mushfiqur in the corridor, left alone. Good carry once again to Saha, who collects it over his head"
"digs in a bouncer from round the wicket, the line is outside off and Shadman leaves again"
"ooh, finally Shami induces a loose shot outside off from Shadman. Full, angling in from wide of the crease. It was there to drive, but Shadman's weight was on the back foot, and he ends up edging thickly - flies quickly at head height between third slip and gully"
"length ball this time, angling in towards off stump, and straightening a touch. Gets behind it to defend with soft hands, and it runs away wide of gully off the outside half of the bat"
"back of a length on off stump, hops across to tuck it to the left of midwicket"
"chopped it on. Mushfiqur gets bowled quite a lot, leaving a gap between bat and pad, and on this occasion the ball cannons into the stumps off the inside edge. Back of a length close to off stump, came back in slightly, and Mushfiqur defends slightly outside the line, and that's enough to bring the inside edge into play"
"slips this down leg, let away movement but started from way outside. Through to Saha"
"full and swinging back in from middle, hops back to defend when he may have been better off playing forward"
"hint of late movement away, Shadman was on the move with the forward prod as this pinged past cover point for a couple"
"tickled away to the fine leg boundary. Short, down leg and all he needed to go was get some bat to beat the keeper."
whips this off his hip to Agarwal at deep square
"has he nicked this? May have, just <strong>landed short of Saha</strong> as he dived forward. Umesh had a wry smile. Lovely delivery, squared him up with the late movement, and <strong>yes, he got a thin edge</strong> on that."
"length ball that moves away from outside off, left alone"
"full and angling in from around the stumps, left alone"
"toe-ends a cut to Jadeja at backward point, swift movement to his left as he picked the ball one-handed to hurl a rocket throw. Saved a run at least"
squirts this off a thickish inside edge past midwicket
"big movement, searching for late swing but ends up slipping this down leg. The ball moves further away from a diving Saha. Crime that it'll go against his name as byes"
"full and moving away from outside off, left alone"
watches this full delivery nip away and thud into Saha's gloves
"beaten on the drive for pace. This was full and slanting away, not much swing. Was there to hit, but he was late on the shot"
"there's another one for Umesh! Shadman plays for the swing in but this one nips away from length on off-stump. Shadman is rooted to the crease and he's opened up in trying to defend that, kisses the edge and Saha takes an easy catch. 100th dismissal for him, Umesh's third. Well, well, well.....five down and we've still got 42 minutes to the Supper break."
impeccable balance and timing as he wrists this full delivery on middle through midwicket. <strong>That's a VVS Laxman special</strong>
"back of length outside off from wide of the crease, left alone"
"uppish but he's punched this wide of backward point with an opened bat face. Short and wide from Umesh, sat up nicely and Liton put that away without much fuss. This is what Bangladesh need, someone who can try and drive the game forward now"
deflects off the thigh pad to fine leg for a leg bye
"gets this to nip back in from length on middle, turned to midwicket"
hops back and across to gently defend this short of length delivery into the leg side
"tries to get outside the line of off to defend, there's  big inward movement and he somehow manages to defend this"
"punched into the gap between cover and point, called for the single straightaway"
"invites the drive by bowling full on fifth stump, left alone"
"hit on the back pad, height may have been in question. May have been doing too much. Umpire Erasmus doesn't make a signal so he reckons there was some bat. <strong>India don't review</strong>"
beaten by late away movement as he's squared up
drifting down leg and he tickles this to beat fine leg. Umesh is searching for late movement but there is none this time
"full outside off, this one moves away a hint, he shoulders arms"
shoulders arms to a short of length delivery moving away
"squirts this full delivery into the covers, rooted to the crease as he defended that"
skiddy bouncer that Mahmudullah ducks under without much fuss
"big movement back in, Liton is well forward as he defends"
"guides this away with an angled bat face past point, substitute Shubman Gill hares behind that and pulls it back in"
"driven beautifully, excellent stop by Pujara at extra cover"
excellent leave. Ishant pitches up in the hope of inducing a drive from Liton
"excellent length ball outside off, hint of movement away, left alone"
"pitched up outside off, left alone again"
"too full on the stumps, not much turn, defended"
eased with the spin to extra cover
"drifting into middle and leg, length on the shorter side, turned to deep square"
"races away to the midwicket boundary. Too full again, no turn and he flicks this superbly into the gap. Liton is looking in excellent touch"
"length ball, some turn, punched to cover"
turns this to midwicket
"nice and full outside off, bails out of the drive"
"cuts back in from outside off, this is that in-between length again, defends solidly"
squirts this full delivery to backward point
"edged and Saha has come up with an incredible grab. <b> Superman Saha! </b> He dives to his right, full stretch. Absolute full stretch, not kidding you. Right in front of first slip. And he hangs on despite landing on his elbow. It was dropping on him, and the first slip fielder had to try and get out of the way very quickly. Mahmudullah pokes at one outside off, wanted to withdraw his bat but indecision has cost him big time."
"hustled for pace, he's hopping back in trying to defend. Hit on the thigh pad"
"big swing, late swing and byes! It <strong>even beat Saha's full-stretch dive. Just shows you how much it came back in.</strong> Full, swinging in from outside off, whizzes through the huge gap between bat and pad, flies over the stumps and past the diving superman."
bunts this length ball to point
"big appeal, huge appeal. Not out says umpire Joel Wilson. Reckon impact may have been outside off. Tell you what, it was a lot closer than that. <b> India don't review. </b>"
"beaten for pace, late on the pull, <b> hit on the helmet as it lobs to the off side. </b> Liton takes his helmet off immediately. He's taking a look at the helmet, Shami walks up to apologise. The physio rushes in as per the latest concussion protocols. Looks like he will play on. He wants to. Liton puts his helmet on and he'll continue."
takes on the short ball and he's hit this incredibly well. Races past Agarwal at deep square. Got into position early
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"pushes outside the line, gets a thick inside edge to deep square"
"nice and full, he's crunched this into the covers. What timing, delightful placement. Leant into this as well as he possibly could"
"full and swinging away from outside off, left alone"
"full, there for the drive again, but he lets it go"
"fuller length, this one lifts off the deck, but too far outside off for Liton to play. Saha collects in front of his face."
"fullish, wide of off stump, left alone"
"length ball outside off, Ebadot gets half-forward for a half-hearted poke, ends up playing well inside the line and getting beaten by a ball that actually swung in slightly"
"yikes, <b>another ball hits the helmet</b>. Short, and it just kept following Nayeem as he looked to sway away from the line. Didn't manage to get under the ball at all, and it cannons off his helmet and loops to Kohli running back from second slip. India's physio Nitin Patel comes out to check on Nayeem. The Bangladesh physio must be busy attending to Liton. The ball hit his helmet just above the left earpiece as he turned his head away."
"another bouncer, but this one goes well down the leg side and Nayeem can awkwardly get out of the way. The ball was initially in line to go over the stumps, but it jagged in a long way off the seam"
"well played. Another short ball, but it's outside off. Nayeem stays leg-side of the ball and uses the pace to help it over the slip cordon"
"back of a length, and this one nips in off the seam. No footwork from Nayeem, just jabs at it from a standing position, and the ball beats his inside edge and passes juust over the top of off. Dies as it reaches the keeper, almost yorking Saha's left glove as he dives left to collect it"
"short again, rises to around shoulder height. Looks to fend it away, eyes off the ball, and the ball hits him flush on the glove"
"length ball, a bit of width, and Nayeem throws his bat at it and ends up middling it beautifully, a wristy square drive on the up"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"beaten. Fullish outside off, pushes at it and plays down the wrong line"
"full again, no footwork from Ebadot. Just pushes at it and flukily middles it uppishly to the right of Jadeja at backward point. They run two, but umpire Erasmus signals one short - Ebadot failed to ground his bat behind the crease at the bowler's end"
"beaten again. Fullish once more, outside off, and a hesitant front-foot stride to drive"
"bowled him. Ebadot has been playing down the wrong line repeatedly, so Ishant bowls a length ball that straightens towards off stump, and Ebadot pokes at an imaginary ball a foot to the leg side of the real one"
"length ball angling in towards middle and leg, defended to mid-on"
"fullish, angling down leg. Looks to flick but can't make contact"
"ooh, misses the top of middle and leg by a couple of inches. Nips back in off the seam, and Nayeem, jabbing at the ball with no footwork, is beaten on the inside edge. Another superlative diving save from Saha, to his left"
"bouncer outside off, Nayeem ducks without keeping his eye on the ball all the way"
"length ball, fifth-stump line. Nayeem has a wristy jab at it without moving his feet, and fails to make contact"
"length ball outside off, this time he manages to get bat onto that wristy jab and play it to backward point"
"bouncer angling down leg, jumps up to try and ride the bounce and fend it away, the ball sneaks under his glove and hits him on the stomach"
"length ball outside off, and that's nicely played by Mehidy, gets his weight onto the front foot and opens his bat face to steer it between gully and backward point"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, gets forward to defend into the covers"
"back of a length close to off stump, rides the bounce nicely and defends into the off side"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"glorious. Fullish, a bit of width, and he gets forward and drives on the up, through the vacant covers, with a high left elbow"
"length ball on off stump, defended to the new man at cover"
"length ball, nipping in slightly towards the top of off. Stays leg-side of the ball and tries to punch into the covers, ends up playing it back to the bowler off the inner half of the bat"
"again, Shami targets the stumps with a little bit of inward movement. Blocked back to the bowler"
"short ball - attempted bouncer, but it loses a lot of pace off the pitch and only gets up to chest height, outside off. Was initially flinching, looking to duck, and then he sees an opportunity to score and opens his bat face to steer the ball over the slip cordon"
"shortish outside off, jumps up and taps down on top of the bounce to send the ball running away quickly through point"
"bouncer, just outside off, too much bounce for Nayeem to be able to play that uppercut, and Saha has to jump up to catch it over his head"
"fullish, angling into middle stump, defended into the covers"
"length ball close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"fullish, angling into middle stump, defended to mid-on"
"beaten. Back of a length, a bit of width. Mehidy has a flash at it without really moving his feet"
"full on off stump, defended into the covers"
"well bowled. That newly developed legcutter again. On a fullish length, wide outside off, inviting the cover drive. Mehidy goes for it and gets beaten"
"got him! Was this a plan? Full again, this time on middle and leg, and Mehidy flicks uppishly and Pujara, at a square-ish midwicket, dives forward and to his right to take an excellent low catch"
"back of a length outside off, nips away late to beat the attempted no-footwork jab through point"
"full, slants this down leg, and Saha, diving full-length to his left, can't get to it. The signal is leg-byes, but I'm not sure that hit anything after Nayeem missed the flick"
"ooh, nearly. Nayeem's been playing this shot often, and India have put Jadeja at third man as a catching fielder. Shami digs it in outside off, Nayeem plays that uppercut, but Jadeja, sprinting forward, can't quite get to it with a dive to his front"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended square on the off side"
"another bouncer, over off stump, and Al-Amin does well to keep his eye on the ball, sway his head out of the way, and drop his gloves under it"
"beauty. Length ball, fourth-stump line, jags away to beat the outside edge as Al-Amin comes half-forward to defend"
"nips in off the seam to hit front pad as Nayeem looks to defend from the crease, not really getting behind the line. No appeal, because that would have gone a long way down the leg side"
"in the blockhole on middle stump, manages to bring his bat down quickly and jab to mid-on"
"bouncer, close to off stump. Nayeem is in midair, his head twisting away towards the off side, eyes completely off the ball, and his hands rising instinctively to protect his head. The ball jams his hand into his handle"
"full on off stump. No footwork, just swishes his bat at the ball to send it running away through the covers. Hung in the air briefly, to the left of the fielder there"
"bowled him, another gorgeous legcutter, and this is Ishant's first five-for at home since the one he took against Pakistan in Bengaluru <a href='https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/14158/scorecard/297808/india-vs-pakistan-3rd-test-pakistan-tour-of-india-2007-08' target='_blank'>way back in 2007</a>. Pitches on off and middle and sends off stump cartwheeling as Nayeem plays down the wrong line in defence"
length ball angling into the stumps. Stays rooted to the crease and jumps up to defend into the off side
"Shami goes short again, and at the body - or it would have been at the body had Al-Amin not moved towards the leg side. Looks to pull, ends up late on the shot and the ball pings off the bat into the off side"
again Al-Amin shuffles towards the leg side and Shami follows him with a full ball. Pings the pad but that's not headed anywhere near the stumps
"got him, Pujara bags a one-bounce catch at first slip. Short outside off, Al-Amin has a little chop at it, and he ends up hitting it straight to Rohit at second slip. He juggles it, and the ball pops into the waiting hands of Pujara. Fiftieth catch in Test cricket for India's No. 3"
width outside off and Agarwal flays this behind point. Races to the boundary in a jiffy. Poor delivery first up.
"nips back in off a length on middle, Agarwal looks to turn this to the leg side but the ball deflects off the thigh pad to square leg"
rises with the bounce and taps this short of length delivery into the off side
"bowls full on middle from wide of the crease, defended"
"off the mark Sehwag style! Short and angling into the body, Rohit picks the length early, swivels back and helps this pull shot along to clear deep square leg. The ball lands right on the skirting."
"comes back in sharply, Rohit hops back and defends. Bristling start."
"gentle outswing to begin, left alone"
"beautifully driven, but a good stop by Mahmudullah at extra cover"
"squeezes this drive into the gap between cover and point, will come back for a second"
beaten as this one skids through and keeps a touch low from back of a length. <strong>Beat the inside edge</strong>
"good leave from Agarwal, assured leave as Jayed bowls length outside off and takes it away"
"invites the drive by pitching it up, Agarwal happy to leave"
tucks this off his hip to deep backward square leg

"pitched out and moving away from outside off, left alone"
"angles one back in from wide of the crease, length quite full, Agarwal shows the full face of the bat as he defends"

off a thick inside edge to fine leg as he prods outside the line of this full delivery

solidly defended off the backfoot into the off side
"gone! Looking to steer this behind point but gets a thick edge and this is well taken in the gully. Agarwal practices a leave as he walks off. The ball flew off the blade, nicely taken by the concussion sub Mehidy. Al-Amin belts out a roar."
"full outside off, gets this to nip back in, Pujara gets outside the line and lets it go"
stabs this length delivery without much trouble
"goes full on the stumps, pushed to mid-on"

steered and four! Opened the bat face to ease this between second slip and the diving gully fielder
punches this short of length delivery to cover
"<strong>what have you done Al-Amin? Dropped at fine leg!</strong> Oh, dear. How do you drop that? He just had too much time in the world. Jangling nerves, never looked settled underneath that. Rohit took him on with the pull, didn't the timing right, high on the bat, straight in, straight out as it bobbled out of his hands, onto the thigh and then the floor. <b> Could prove to be very costly </b>"
"there for the drive, left alone though"
"full and swinging away from outside off, left alone as Pujara doesn't bite the bait"

"driven into the gap between the two cover fielders, covered the line, waited for it and just tapped it away. <b> It's time for tea </b>"
"fullish, fairly wide outside off. Left alone"
"similar line, even fuller. Rohit reaches out for it and stabs it away, but gully dives right to make a good stop"
"too full once again, angling into middle stump, and Rohit clips it away elegantly through square leg"
"back of a length in the corridor, and he induces some uncertainty from Rohit, who feels for the ball and sends a thick edge running away to the right of the diving second slip fielder"
"big appeal, no stroke offered, and it's given! No hesitation from umpire Erasmus, but <b>Rohit has reviewed</b>. Looked out at first glance, nipped in sharply from outside off as Rohit shouldered arms. Not much of a stride forward, and the ball struck him just above the knee roll. Clipping the top of off stump, in ball-tracking's opinion, so it stays with umpire's call. India retain their review, but Rohit has to walk back after that little misjudgment. Excellent delivery from Ebadot, nipped back a long way off the seam"
"and he gets off the mark with an edge. Length ball, straightens from around off stump, and Kohli, defending from the crease with his bat at an angle, edges between second slip and gully"

"legcutter outside off, Kohli watches it well and leaves alone"

eased to long-on
squirts this off an inside edge to midwicket
"short and holds its line outside off, Jadeja gets on top of the ball and stabs it out to extra-cover"
"<strong>Jadeja offers no shot and loses his off stump</strong>. Good length, angling in from round the wicket, Jadeja shoulders arms, thinking it might move away against the angle outside off. However, it was not to be. Jayed hits the off stump and gives Bangladesh some cheer immediately after the lunch break. Big error in judgement from Jadeja"
"full and wobbles away outside off, no shot"
"<strong>more cheers for Saha</strong> as he stretches out, takes a half-volley from outside off and belts it through the covers. Strong drive from Saha to get off the mark"
"much fuller and slanting in from wide of the crease, Saha keeps it out off the front foot"
"too full on middle, whipped past the right of midwicket. Taijul chases and hunts the ball down in the outfield"

"shorter and outside off, comes so very slow off the pitch, Saha adjusts and stabs it out to cover"
"much fuller and wobbles away outside off, Saha judges it well enough and lets it go"

"dropped short again, cut away with the break to sweeper cover"

inside-edged to the right of midwicket. <strong>300 up for India</strong> just before Bangladesh are set to take the second new ball
"looped up outside off, Saha deploys a big stride and drives with an open face, sending the ball scurrying past the right of sweeper cover for four"
"arm ball from Taijul, Saha goes on the back foot to deal with it"
"<strong>Edabat draws a false shot from Kohli.</strong> Back of a length, angling in and straightening rather late, Kohli eyes up the leg side and leading-edges it behind point"
"fuller, starts outside off, and <strong>swings further away,</strong> nothing doing from Kohli"
"The ball seemed to be destined to fly into the boundary.... until Taijul threw himself to his right from square-ish long leg and plucked a catch out of thin air. Edadot brings out the salute, and Kohli wears a wry smile on his face as he walks off. This was a pretty loose ball, though. Overpitched on the pads, Kohli picks it up and whips it away in the air. Look at this athletic intervention from Taijul... in stark contrast to the fumbles earlier in the game. He initially ran in, but then adjusted and leapt to grab the catch"
"back of a length and swinging into the hips, picked off to fine leg"

"back of a length and holds its line outside off, ignored"
"good length in the channel, Saha shoulders arms"
"banged in short and outside off, good carry to the keeper, left alone"
"full, starts outside off, and swings so further away that it has been called an off-side wide"
"inswinger from Ebadot, but does not threaten off, so Saha lets it go. Muffled appeal for caught behind, not given and Bangladesh ask for a review, more out of desperation. Daylight between bat and ball. There was a sound, but it came from the bat brushing the bat-flap. Umpire Erasmus' on-field not-out verdict is upheld"
"overpitched on off, driven straight to mid-on"
"back of a length and holds its line outside off, nothing doing from Saha"

"short and swinging down the leg side, Ashwin does not connect with a pull, the ball beats the diving keeper as well and sneaks into the fine leg boundary"
"full and swinging into the legs, Ashwin flicks it away elegantly once again. Jayed runs across to his left from long leg, slides, but can't haul the ball in"
"banged in short and angling into off, barely 125ks, Ashwin nails a pull over midwicket"
"full, angling in, nipping away, Ashwin carves a drive towards point"

"pitched up and angling, swinging down the leg side, Saha can't touch it"
"on the pads, tucked around the corner"
"short and angling in at off, Ashwin is forward and across as he pushes to mid-on"
"<strong>full inswinger from Al-Amin,</strong> Ashwin plays around his front pad and misses it. Impact might be outside the line of off, so Ashwin goes to challenge the on-field out decision from Joel Wilson. The tracker returns umpire's call on impact and Ashwin has been dismissed"
"full-toss, angling in at off, worked away to deep square"
"on a length on middle, jabbed to mid-on"
Umesh stays leg-side of this outswinger and is beaten on the outside edge
"<strong>edged and taken at second slip</strong>. Fuller than a good length and nips away slightly outside off. Umesh aims for a massive leg-side slog and just manages to nick it through to Shadman for a duck. Well, that wasn't so much fun"
"wide of the crease, swings away outside off, Ishant lets it go"
"nice and full, angling in at off, then moving away, Ishant jams his bat down, not sure if he has nicked it, but it doesn't carry through to Mithun diving forward"
back of a length and skidding in to hit Saha on the thigh pad
"full and outside off, whipped out to deep midwicket"
"<strong>Ishant has been pinned lbw,</strong> given out by Wilson once again. Ishant has a word with Saha and asks for a review. But, this looks very adjacent. Full and sharply swerving in after pitching outside off. Hits the pad in line with middle and leg. Umpire's call on impact, it would have just about grazed leg stump. Three wickets in three overs. Can Shami provide some entertainment now?"
"back of a length and outside off, run away to point"
"lifter outside off, takes off like a NASA rocket. No chance for Mithun. The ball sails over to the boundary"
"another bouncer, well-directed this time, Ishant sways out of the way"
"short and outside off, Shami reaches out for the ball and jabs it away behind point to get off the mark with a boundary"
"full on the pads, Saha flicks to deep midwicket and declines the single on offer"
"full and floated down leg, Saha can't flick this way"
"short and angling into off stump, defended"
"wide of the crease, angling into middle, chipped out to deep square. Saha turns over the strike to Shami"
"Yes, this is fun. Pitched up on off, right in the slot, Shami gets underneath it and smites it over the long-on boundary. Whacked away"
"banged in short and outside off, Shami has a crack at the pull but does not connect"
"shorter and outside off, Saha opens the face, punches to sweeper and keeps the strike"

"another bumper outside off, Saha ducks under again"
"back of a length and outside off, Saha diffuses it off the back foot"
"full and swinging away from way outside off, left alone"

"angles one full just around off stump from around the wicket, Shadman looks to defend but lets it go in the end"
"invites the drive by pitching it up, almost daring Shadman to do so if he wishes, left alone though"
"angled in full, the ball pitches around a length on off, moves away to hit him on the back pad. A tiny portion of the off stump is visible at the point of impact. The on-field decision from umpire Erasmus is out, so unless the ball is missing, he'll be out. Ball tracking comes back to show it was clipping off, so Shadman will have to walk back. Bangladesh will keep their review, but lose their opener."
squared up by the length but manages to defend this short of length delivery from the crease
"slants one around length on off, defended"
hops back and across to defend this one that kept a tad low
uppish but this one falls short of mid-on. The bat face turned in his hand as he pushed at that
tentative push as he gets a thick inside edge onto the pad. Playing down the wrong line
flicked nicely but straight to Ashwin at mid-on. This was full and swinging in from Umesh
tucked away nicely off his hip to deep square for a couple
"full and wide outside off, he reaches out to drive and is beaten because he's late on the shot"
"beaten again! Swing, big swing. Pushing without any feet movement. Saha once again with the dive to take that. He's going to be a very tired man"
"in that off-stump channel on a length, left alone as it swings away"
"touch too full, squeezed into the covers. Didn't lean into the stroke, hence no timing"
"edged and another one goes! Such a tame dismissal from the captain, who just hung his bat out as if he was feeling for it with uncertainty. The ball swung away late to kiss the edge and Saha accepted the catch gleefully. No. 7 in the game for Ishant. <strong>Pair for Monimul</strong>"
"full, late swing in, Mithun pushes at this to get an inside edge past midwicket"
stands tall and tucks this wide of square leg
"short of length delivery moving away from outside off, left alone"
"short of length again, this time he gets on top of the bounce and taps it gently int the off side"
shoulders arms to a length ball that moves away a long way from outside off
confident push into the covers for a quick single
"sneaks past the inside edge to hit him on the pad but the height was in question, may have missed leg too."
"cuts back in a long way from outside off, Mithun is rapped just above the knee roll. Impact on leg stump, and ball tracking shows the ball would've clipped the outside of leg, so it comes back as <b> umpire's call </b>"
"<strong>oh dear, not again!</strong> <b> Right into Mithun's helmet as he ducks under this. </b> The helmet comes off, the physio is out, the entire Indian team is around him to check on him. Nasty stuff, hostile from Ishant. Firstly, they  need to surely replace that helmet. That made a crrrrrrrrracking sound as it hit the top part of his ear. Mithun got into a terrible position trying to duck. He was looking way, the ball skidded off the pitch to hit him bang above the ear."
"squirts back this full delivery on middle down the pitch. Opened up completely again, length very full again from Ishant"
"big movement back in from a length outside off, he's off balance as he defends into the leg side"
"<strong>another nasty short ball</strong>, this time Mithun tries to get his bat out of the way, this pings his glove and rolls past short leg"
"goes around the wicket and bowls full on middle, defended back. <b> It's tea on day two. </b>"
"full and swinging away from middle, punched past the bowler and mid-on for a couple, nicely done by Mithun, presented a straight bat to meet that off the middle"
"simplest of simple catches to Shami as Mithun toe-ends a pull to short midwicket. Looked to fetch it from way outside off, the bat face turns because he's been done in fr pace and it pops to the local hero."
"off the mark with a gentle dab into the off side. Squared up, got it high on the bat but he played it with soft hands"
"nice, confident push forward as he punches this full delivery past mid-off"
"ducks under the short ball which doesn't rise, it was a tad outside leg too, so his back wasn't in the firing line"
"short ball, this one climbs into his ribs as Imrul looks to hop back to defend. <strong>That should leave him with a bruise mark when he wakes up</strong>"
"big inward movement from outside off, Mushfiqur turns it with the angle to fine leg. Came off the pad, as per umpire Erasmus"
"<strong>corker of a delivery, unplayable!</strong> Angles in from wide of the crease, sees the ball cut away and whizz past the shoulder of the bat"
squirted off a thick outside edge to a diving Rahane at gully as he pushes indecisively at this full delivery. Off the backfoot again when he may have been better off playing forward
"edged and into the hands of Kohli as he dives to his right at third slip, besides Rohit. Ishant shortens his length a tad, allows the ball to nip away off the seam. Imrul pushes at this, thick outside edge and the captain takes it nicely this time."
"rooted to the crease as he plays inside the line of this full delivery, beaten"
"beautifully driven into the covers, that shouldn't worry anyone in the Indian camp but will give oodles of confidence to Mahmudullah, who has had a poor game thus far, not just with the bat but on the field too"
"good leave, this is a lifter from a length outside off"
"gentle push into the off side as they look to scamper a run, Jadeja swoops in and fires a wayward throw at the striker's end to concede an overthrow"
in the slot for the drive but he lets it go
off the pad as this rolls wide of square leg
beaten on the drive as he plays without any feet movement
"big outswing again from around the off stump, defended from the crease"
"how much did that move in? How did that miss the stumps? How did it miss Saha? Wow, wow, wow. Angles it in from wide of the crease, Mushfiqur leaves, This one moves back in a long, long way after it passes the batsman. Saha puts out a dive but can only get the tip of his gloves"
"confidently put away, lovely square drive. Played with intent, lent a touch of class to that"
"appeal, appeal and India decide to review as Erasmus says not out. Mushfiqur once again defeated by the big inward movement, he's off balance in trying to work this to the leg side. Hit well above the knee roll, would've missed the stumps. Yes, ball tracking confirms this would've missed leg stump. <B> India lose their review. </b>"
"punched confidently into the gap between cover and point, Mahmudullah wanted the third but Jadeja was so quick to give it chase and then put in a slide to stop. The recovery was even better as he fired the throw."
"stands tall and steers this behind point, used the pace nicely to put that away."

beaten as he looks to flay this off the backfoot through point
"uppish and past the gully region, races to the square third man boundary."
"edged and taken at first slip by Kohli! It's a straightforward catch and Ishant has nine in the match. This was a nothing poke, with an angled bat. The length was good, nibbled away a hint and had Mehidy feeling for it when he should've left it alone."

"in and around the off-stump channel, left alone"

"pushed to mid-off, came off the toe end"

"big appeal for lbw, umpire Erasmus is unmoved, may have been an inside edge. Taijul decided to run away for a single before as the chance came about. Good decision"

"<strong>huge lbw appeal, this time Mushfiqur has been given, but he reviews immediately. Did he get some glove on this sweep?</strong> The spontaneity of the appeal seemed to suggest so. Mind you he went a long way across. And yes, replays confirm this deflected off the glove onto the pad as he played the sweep a tad too early. <b> Decision overturned. Not out </b>"
defends this indrifter from the crease

slings the first ball of the day down the leg side. Too far out of Ebadot's reach to clip it fine
"full, angling into middle and leg, almost a yorker. Stays leg-side of the ball, as he usually does, and blocks it back to the bowler"
"past the edge. Length ball outside off, and Ebadot has a hesitant waft at it, without moving his feet. Ends up playing inside the line, as he often has in this Test match"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"length ball close to off stump, angling in. Strides forward to defend into the point region"

"back of a length, a bit of inward movement towards off and middle, defended back to the bowler off the back foot"
"length ball angling into middle stump, blocked back to Ishant"
"bouncer gets the first wicket of the day. Well-directed by Umesh, comes in off the pitch, follows Ebadot and rises towards his right shoulder as he looks to sway away from the line. Fends at it in self-defence, and the ball pops up to third slip off the handle of his bat"
"bouncer, but this time it's slanting down leg, not threatening Al-Amin's well-being"
"bouncer, rises loopily over the stumps, and Al-Amin ducks under it"
"another short ball, <b>another blow to the helmet</b>. You've got to ask if India should be bowling so many bouncers at the tail-enders. Looks to duck, but can't get entirely out of the way, and the ball ricochets off the back of the helmet to the fine leg boundary"
"length ball on off stump, defended with an open face into the point region"
"in the blockhole, angling into the batsman's feet. Clips it away through midwicket, meeting it with a nice straight bat"
"length ball straightening towards off stump, defends close to his body, towards backward point"
"back of a length angling into the stumps, and straightening slightly after pitching. Gets on his toes and defends with nice soft hands into the cover point region"
"length ball straightening along an off-stump line. Squares up slightly in defence, and the ball runs away through point off the outer half of the bat"
"full now, angling into middle and leg, clipped away through midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, a bit of extra bounce, and Mushfiqur slogs and misses. Clears his front leg and looks to hoick over the leg side, can't make contact"
"full now, on middle stump, whipped to the left of long leg"
"back of a length on off stump, pushed into the covers. No one in the infield in that region, just deep cover and deep backward point, but he declines the single"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to deep cover. No single again"
"back of a length just outside off, opens his bat face to punch to deep backward point. Refuses the single again"
"bouncer over leg stump, Mushfiqur ducks safely under"
"another attempted bouncer, ends up well down leg, and Mushfiqur fails to connect with the hook. Or has he got a tiny edge on it? Half-hearted appeals of caught-behind from the Indian fielders, and no review when the umpire says not-out"
"another bouncer, gets up to Mushfiqur's left shoulder, and he gets into position quickly to swivel and hook to the fine leg boundary"
"digs it in short, and the ball loses a lot of pace off the pitch, ends up coming to Al-Amin slowly at hip height, around off stump. Pushes into the off side and sets off, but Jadeja, running to his left from cover, cuts it off in a flash, and makes him hurry back to his crease"
"back of a length on off stump, slows down again off the pitch, waits on it and steers it neatly to the right of gully"
"short, wide, slows down like a deflating balloon off the pitch, and Al-Amin, slashing hard at it, can't connect"
"fullish, angling down leg. Looks to stay leg-side of the ball and flick, ends up getting hit on the pad"
"length ball angling into off stump, defended towards mid-on"
"looks for the yorker, following Al-Amin's movement away from leg stump, and he jams his bat down on it, and gets a bottom edge that runs away to the fine leg boundary"
"tossed up close to off stump, driven to long-off, no single"
"shot. Brings out the reverse-sweep. The line is on off stump, with a bit of flight, and the hands and feet move like lightning to get him into position to swipe it away wide of slip"
"flatter on off stump, stays on the back foot and blocks it back to the bowler"
"now the conventional sweep. Tossed up on middle and off, and he stretches out and sweeps hard and flat through square leg"
"looks for the paddle-sweep now, but can't nail it like he did the previous two shots. Lbw appeal from India - this one went on with the angle from round the wicket - and impact may have been just outside off. <b>Ball-tracking later shows three reds - impact in line, hitting the stumps</b>."
"flat and quick, full and angling into the batsman's feet. Looks to flick and misses and is hit on the pad"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked into the off side"
"back of a length, angling into the stumps, defended into the on side"
"fourth wicket for Umesh, the ball slowing down off the pitch does Mushfiqur in. May have been a slower one too. Length ball outside off, looks to launch it over the covers, but is into his shot too early and ends up spooning it high in the air for a simple catch to the fielder at cover"
"bouncer over off stump, sways his upper body away but keeps his eye on the ball, and thereby gets into a good position to ramp it over the slips. Slows down near the boundary, though"
"back of a length on off stump, opens up, exposing all his stumps, to make swinging room and flat-bats it firmly through mid-off"
"shortish, angling into the hip. Looks to whip it into the leg side but can't connect"
"full on off stump, jams his bat down and pushes it through mid-off"
back of a length on off stump. Stays leg-side of the ball and hops up to defend
"bouncer over off stump, steps away from leg stump and has a jab at it, but can't make contact"
"another bouncer, gets up to shoulder height and follows the batsman's movement away from leg stump. Has a big heave at it, eyes off the ball, and sends a top-edge flying high over the keeper"
"full now, just outside off, and Al-Amin, skating away from leg stump and jabbing at the ball, plays and misses"
"in the blockhole on middle stump. Exposes all his stumps, but brings his bat down in time to keep it out. The ball rolls towards short midwicket, and Ashwin picks it up and throws at the bowler's end, and Shami, backing up from cover, takes a blow to the leg, and the ball runs away for an overthrow"
"back of a length, straightens from a middle-stump line, and <b>India have become the first team to complete four successive innings wins.</b> Al-Amin doesn't get behind the line to defend, and sends a thin tickle through to Wriddhiman Saha. Mahmudullah won't come out to bat. A five-for for Umesh Yadav, and 60 more Test Championship points in the bag for India"
