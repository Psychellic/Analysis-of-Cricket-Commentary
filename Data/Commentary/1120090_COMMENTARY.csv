"fine start from both parties. Southee checks how much swing there is by pushing this full around off, Rohit opens his bat face to hit the ball wide of mid-off for one. Williamson gets around"
"gets past mid-off. Full around off, the ball swinging back in, pushed past mid-off, who dives to his left, not great timing so mid-on gets around"
"pushes that full outside off, not much swing but Dhawan leans into a drive and it is caressed through cover for four. Beautiful stride forward"
"good length around off, the cross-seam delivery that allows Southee some control. Pitches and moves away, beats the bat. Southee thinks there is an edge, nope, just lateral movement"
"short on off, a change in length. Dhawan picks the length early, but the ball moves away, angled away. A toe-end pull down to third man"
"good end from Southee, 138 kph, on a length around off, no room. Rohit happy to defend"
"edge! But there are signs already of a slowish surface. It's full on a fourth-stump channel, Dhawan plays the line but some outswing takes the outside edge, lands two feet in front of second slip."
"good single, it's a real strength of these two, tip and run. A good ball too. On a length outside off, some movement away, tapped towards backward point. Soft hands"
"138 kph, too full from Boult, good running. Overpitched outside off, Rohit leans forward and caresses a drive through cover. Not great timing. This Wankhede outfield is generally quick, not today. Williamson pulls it in, running around from mid-off"
"well bowled. 140 kph, around off, defended into the off side"
"gets this to hold its line, which leaves Dhawan in an awkward position, but he is a good enough batsman to improvise. Good length on off, defended into the off side. Excellent line from Boult, speedy too, 141 kph"
""
"135 kph, full delivery on a fifth-stump line, Rohit gets forward but some away shape takes the outside edge down to third man. Disciplined start from New Zealand, seeing how much swing there is"
"definitely hurried him for pace there, or wasn't expecting that length. Short down leg, doesn't get too high, shoulder height. Dhawan pulls, off the glove down to fine leg. 131 kph"
"mis-timed horribly. Full delivery on off, Rohit likes to play that shot, the lofted drove over mid-off, but he may have played for some outswing. There was none, which meant the ball skewed off the inside half, past mid-on for two"
"good length delivery outside off, defended into the off side. Immediately pulls back his length"
"132 kph, full on middle and leg, worked away into the leg side this time, towards square leg"
"another good end. Goes slightly wide of the crease, bowls it on a length around off, defended into the off side"
"fullish delivery around off, Dhawan defends the ball back. That's the best ball to Dhawan"
"edged and gone! Fantastic bowling from Boult. Good length outside off, fifth-stump line, it's not wide enough for Dhawan to cut, and Dhawan feels he needs to play because of that previous delivery and with Boult getting the ball to hold its line. This one, though, pitches and swings further away, and Dhawan wafts at it needlessly. Gets a thick outside edge which flies at chest height to Latham's left. That's Boult's wicket, set him up with some superb bowling."
"good length on leg, 142 kph, solidly played into the off side"
"on a length, closer to off this time. Defended into the off side"
"hangs it outside off, fifth-stump line. A nice press forward to leave"
"a wicket maiden from Boult. Full delivery outside off, Kohliu watchfully plays this towards point. Fine over. He isn't getting much swing, but just enough"
"short and wide, the ball moving further away, slashed to extra cover"
"width, short and wide again, Rohit slashes a cut to backward point, Guptill dives to his left"
"132 kph, full delivery on leg, this one doesn't swing. Rohit is struck on the pad"
"just over fine leg. An impulsive pull. Short on leg, hurrying Rohit for pace but he just can't help himself. Milne backtracks slightly at fine leg, gets close to the rope, but the ball lobs over him. Terrific use of the short ball. Well directed too"
"another one! <strong>Rohit doesn't learn from his mistake</strong>, but gets away with it anyway. Short, but not as high. On leg, shoulder height. Rohit pulls over fine leg, Milne jumps to his left but the ball goes over him"
"Southee tests him out again, this time Rohit plays the right stroke. Short down leg, pulled down to fine leg, kept that down, at least tried to, one down to fine leg"
"good length on off, 137 kph, defended into the off side"
"around off on a length, played quietly into the off side"
"wow, that's exuberant from Rohit. But he gets away with it again. Counter-attack. Full delivery on leg, Rohit runs down, looking to hit the ball over midwicket, put the bowler's length off, but he misses, and the ball clips the pad en route to the keeper. They think about the review, but decide against it, good non-review"
"my, my. That's not international cricket, you can't keep making mistakes and expect to get away with it. Boult bowls this full around off, and his natural angle gets the ball to come back into him. Rohit stays in his crease, looks at the right side of the ground to hit the ball but plays an awful stroke, it's another T20 heave, the ball finds a big gap between bat and pad, and knocks off stump. Four mistakes in seven balls, one of them makes him pay"
"full outside off, Jadhav gets forward to defend"
"good length outside off, dabbed down to third man for one. Boult doing what he does best, take wickets with lateral movement"
"good single, good batting, on a length around off, worked towards square leg, quick single"
"130 kph, good length outside off, seam movement back in, left alone."
"good shot, Munro toppled over before reaching the ball. But Kohli didn't topple over during his flick, full around off, gets forward and works that to square leg, who dives to his left, a parry allows one"
"another good single, slower ball around off, worked away to mid-on, soft hands, one run"
"full delivery outside off, beautifully, languidly driven to short cover. He is well placed"
"short delivery down leg, 136 kph, Kohli gets on top of the bounce and works the ball towards square leg for one. Respectfully played"
"lovely drive. 137 kph, overpitched outside off, crisply driven to mid-ff"
"short and wide, 136 kph, opens the bat face to guide it down to third man for one. That shot put him in lots of trouble against Australia, potentially very dangerous to Boult too, who gets the ball to come back in"
"excellent bowling, 137 kph, quick down leg, a bouncer, Jadhav gets underneath it"
"and follows it up with a yorker, on off, excellent execution. Jadhav jams it out. New Zealand on top, India need to soak all this up for the next 15 minutes ot so"
"143 kph, good length down leg, Jadhav beaten for pace, strikes him down leg, off the pad towards square leg"
"137 kph, short outside off, chopped back towards the keeper. Fantastic eight overs from New Zealand"
"134 kph, on a length around off, impeccable defensive technique, lets the ball come to him before a firm forward push in front of his eyes"
"shortish outside off, dabbed down to third man, past a second slip fielder. With the new ball, that shot is relatively safe, but when the ball starts reversing, he may have to put that shot away?"
"shortish outside off, Jadhav withdraws his bat, lets it go through to the keeper"
"good length around off, defended back up he pitch"
"full delivery outside off, 134 kph, blocked into the off side. A half-stride to the pitch"
"on a length around off, shovelled into the leg side, towards square leg"
"<strong>beaaauttyyy!</strong> 136 kph, good length outside off, he has been getting the ball to come back in, but this one moves away and beats the bat. Play that, a nod of appreciation from Kohli"
"good length around off, 141 kph, defended back confidently. Good response from Kohli"
"shortish length on the body, 143 kph. Kohli gets on his ties to defend. Played nicely enough. This is stellar cricket, a bowler at his best, a quality batsman trying to weather the storm"
"good single. On a length outside off, pushed into the cover region for a quick single. Gets off strike"
"<strong>Boult appeals</strong>, no one else does. Good length outside off, Jadhav misses an open-faced dab. No bat"
"full outside off, 139 kph, left alone. Boult is 5-1-7-2"
"good length outside off, 136 kph, left alone. Fabulous bowling"
"shot! Overpitched from Milne this time, outside off, Kohli strides forward, brings his bat down at a perfect angle and drills a drive through cover. Placement is exquisite"
"shortish on the pads, helped along for a run to square leg"
"that's loose. Short and wide outside off, Jadhav cuts, a thick outside edge to third man"
"overpitched on off, driven to mid-on, who fumbles the collection, and allows the run. The bat jars in the ground and hurts Kohli's arm"
"136 kph, short delivery around off, the ball comes back in, Jadhav keeps his hands down, the ball jags back in, hits him on the body and ricochets to the third man boundary. Leg byes because there was evasive action"
"flight outside off, driven back to the bowler, too full"
"shortish on leg, 84 kph, some turn, Kohli goes back and pushes the ball towards midwicket"
"on the pads, worked away to deep midwicket for one"
"89 kph, on the pads, worked to square leg for a run"
"overpitched and wide outside off, caressed through to the sweeper cover"
"quick on the pads, nudged to short fine leg"
"short outside off, climbing up steeply, glided off the open face down to third man"
"digs this in, on middle and leg, pulled to deep square leg. Got on top of the bounce to ensure the ball went down"
"intentionally bowled wide outside off, 137 kph, inside the tramline, left alone"
"143 kph, full delivery outside off, skewed to mid-on"
"nicely played. Short down leg, Kohli gets on top of the bounce and pulls down to fine leg for one"
"good length around off, the ball seaming back in, strikes Jadhav on the body"
"full and straight, not a lot of swing, driven to cover"
"slower through the air, nice length, forces Kohli to stay watchful. Played into the gully region"
"quick on the pads, 88 kph, fired in, off the inside edge towards short fine leg"
"pushed through, quick around off, driven to cover"
"that's too quick and too wide, Kohli leans forward and drills a drive to the sweeper cover"
"lovely over. Just one off it. Shortish and wide outside off, chopped down towards backward point"
"full and wide outside off, 127 kph, sliced off the outside half to the sweeper cover for one"
"good length outside off, chopped down to third man for a run"
"just wide of backward point. Full and wide outside off, Kohli drives away from his body, which means he isn't quite in control of his drive, the ball lobs off the outside half, beats Guptill and races away past third man too"
"the genuine edge this time. Full outside off, Kohli wafts, gets a thick edge and races down to third man's left. Straight to slip"
"full and straight, worked down to long-on"
"fullish and wide, the ball moving away, bunted to long-on for a run"
"93 kph, risk-reward, gets ample reward for that risk. Short and straight, around off, Jadhav goes back, opens the bat face, takes the ball from the stumps and carves the cut past slip."
"and goooone. Another start for Jadhav and he's chipped his wicket away. Flight around off, Jadhav gets forward but plays the ball too early, the ball is just bunted back towards Santner's left, he runs around and takes the sitter. The key on these surfaces is to play the ball as late as possible, but Santner slowed this one up, compared to the pace of the previous delivery, forcing Jadhav to play earlier than he should have."
"drives, inside out, back to the bowler as Santner keeps bowling middle and leg"
"good length ball on middle and leg, defends into the off side"
stretches forward to defend a fuller delivery on middle and leg
"opens the face to ease a tossed up delivery on leg stump to cover. He's starting against spin, which he absolutely pulverises in Ranji Trophy."

"good length delivery outside off, opens the bat face to guide this down to third man for one"
"full delivery outside off, 126 kph, Kohli leans into his drive, finds cover"

"slow through the air, outside off, Kohli gets forward and just pushes the ball into the gap at sweeper cover"
"quick and straight, around middle and leg. A solid defensive block"
"slightly wide, and Karthik pounces all over that, carves his cut past point. And the ball races away on this outfield. Nice shot, didn't overhit, used the pace of the ball and hit it into a good area"
"slow around off, 82 kph, pushed towards cover from the crease"
"short down leg, Karthik misses a sweep. The umpire takes plenty of time before calling wide"
"slow on middle and leg, pushed away to long-on for one"
"big, big appeal. No, says the umpire. New Zealand don't review either. Quick on the pads, Kohli misses a flick, the ball misses the inside edge, hits the pad and bobbles up for Taylor at slip. No bat, thinks any person in the ground"
"123 kph, offcutter outside off, Karthik tries to find third man with an open-faced dab, but can only find point"
"chipped for four. Wow, fantastic timing. On a length around off, Karthik just pushes the ball on the up, the ball is in the air but well wide of mid-on. Just a punchy tap through the line of the ball"
"good length outside off, carved down to third man for one"
"did that carry? Full and wide outside off, Kohli plays the ball too early, he drives in the air straight to Santner at cover. That was a dolly. <strong>A big chance dropped</strong>, didn't get his hands in the right position. The ball burst out of his hands"
"full around off, driven back to the bowler"
"shortish and wide, Kohli opens the bat face and guides it towards short third man. The fielder dives to his left and saves three"
"leans forward to nudge a tossed up delivery, outside leg, to long-on. Santner's flexing his left hand, which took a jarring blow when he dropped the catch in the last over"

"on the pads, Kohli works it away to deep midwicket"
eases forward to drive the flighted delivery to long-off
"can't quite reach the pitch, and so has to block the length ball on off stump"
"neat little late cut, waiting for the turn, which is there in the pitch, and then using it to his advantage. Short third man is in place and comes in very handy"
"slower bouncer, on middle and off. But it goes a little too high for both Karthik, and the umpire's liking"
"steps out - but by doing so very early, he gives the bowler a chance to pull his length back. Punch to short cover"
"that's the slower ball, in line with off stump, Karthik blocks"
"back of a length and just outside off, pushes to cover"
closes the face on impact so that he can send a back of a length delivery to long-on
"meets the fuller delivery outside off a little earlier than he would like, and so it gets the inside edge to midwicket"
"good, strong stride forward, taking him towards the full and wide delivery. And because he is right over the ball, he can drive it smoothly to the sweeper"
and this is why India should think they can recover. Loose ball - short and wide - expected of a part-timer and Karthik lashes it to the point boundary

"drives, forcefully, to send the shortish delivery outside off to long-on"
"goes wide of the crease and the resulting angle works well enough for Kohli, who nimbly glances it to long leg"
"seems like a legcutter, cramping Karthik, who manages to eke it out to long leg, though it goes more off the inside edge"
rolls his wrists over the top of the shortish ball on middle to find a single through midwicket
"sails over long leg. Risky shot, with the fielder out there, but Kohli backed himself. Shifts across, pulls hard, goes up and over, with no intention of keeping the ball down, and the only person catching that is the ball boy, and boy does he do well. It's a one-handed stunner from a kid wearing a Mumbai Under-14 shirt"
"full and outside off, blocks into the off side"
"<b>fifty in his 200th ODI</b> and the Wankhede erupts. Chants of 'Kohli, Kohli, Kohli' ring around the ground as he laces a straight drive to perfection. No need to over-hit. Just let the ball ping off the full face"

drives a full delivery outside off to mid-on for a quick single
"fullish on off stump, defends"
"backs away, but Munro has been clever in this spell, he's kept his length short, but not allowed it to become a long hop. He's also followed the batsman as often as possible. Like in this case, Kohli was looking for a cut, but he has to settle for a block"
nudges it off his hips to long leg
"brilliant drive, on the up, full face of the ball seeking the covers. But Santner is there, redeeming himself wit ha full-length dive to the left"
that's too short and Karthik pulls it sweetly to the square leg boundary. Reads the length early and then places the ball perfectly between the two men in the deep
defends a good length ball on off stump
"closes the face to try and push the good length ball on the stumps to long-on, but he angles it too far and it goes to short midwicket"
"nice and tight on off stump. Kohli's attempt to glide it to third man doesn't work, but by playing with soft hands, he steals a single towards point. It was Karthik's call though, so good on him too"
gets behind a shortish delivery on and around off stump
"tailing into the pads and Karthik is able to flick it neatly to deep square leg - where Colin de Grandhomme, back on the field after a spell of vomiting, does well."
"overpitched on middle and Karthik meets the ball with a sublime roll of his wrists, waiting until the last minute so he can get the placement and the timing right. Couple through midwicket"
"bouncer, on middle and off, Karthik plays the hook, but Milne has bent his back and made sure the bounce is substantial enough to mess with the batsman's timing"
"another bouncer, this one wandering down leg"
"steps out of the crease, but is cramped by a shortish delivery angled at the body. (Awkward) flick to midwicket"

"slower bouncer, outside off, Karthik leaves it in the hope it will be called a wide. No luck"
pulls a shortish delivery outside off to short midwicket
"taken at long leg! It's a top-edged hook - when Karthik played that shot once before, and he was beaten for pace. This time, he miscues it down the throat of Colin Munro. He does make a bit of a mess of it though, sliding to his left and nearly letting it pop out. Luckily, he is able to brace the ball against his chest. New Zealand were desperate for a breakthrough and Southee provides it"
"walks at the fast bowler, that's not very nice, and flicks a ball from outside off out to mid-on"
"back of a length and outside off, Dhoni pushes it to cover"
"back of a length and outside off, waits on it nicely, but not long enough to beat short third man. New Zealand have done well to keep him nice and fine"

"full and outside off, spears it through the covers"

bouncer - right over middle and off stump. Dhoni knows he can't get on top of it and so ignores it
"slower ball on off stump, Dhoni moves across and flicks it to deep square leg"
"isn't entirely in control of the dab to third man, meaning the ball travels a lot of its distance in the air to the fielder. Southee's hitting the deck and getting it to respond to him."
"back of a length and outside off, and the ball thuds into Kohli's open face as he glides to a newly placed gully"
<b>half an appeal for lbw</b> as Kohli shuffles across and ends up in front of all three stumps. But the scrambled seam delivery pitches outside leg
"smashes a short ball, in front of square, but the extra bounce Boult is getting, bending his back, is not allowing Kohli to time it as well as he'd like"
"expects the left-armer to move the ball across him, so he wanders away outside off and pulls it to deep square leg."
"bouncer, but it is off line. Kohli lets it slide down leg and his team collects an extra"
"he's reaching for the good length delivery - scrambled seam again, perhaps, judging from how the ball kicks up. Kohli checks his drive to mid-off"
"flicks a shortish delivery to square leg, and Boult himself goes out to keep it to a single"

"short and wide, sits up for Dhoni to go back and cut to the sweeper cover"
"short around off, Kohli hurries back and punches to long-on for one"

"a slower ball wide outside off, outside the tramline, wide called"
"full and wide outside off, 139 kph, punched to the sweeper cover for one"
"short around off, pushed towards midwicket. Kohli knew there was one, Dhoni waited to see if the ball passed the fielder. They discuss as they complete the run"
"soft! Guptill may have not picked the ball, but he takes it anyway. It's a shortish, wide delivery outside off, was there to be cut and Dhoni goes after it. Guptill is standing very close, at point, and seeing Dhoni's backlift, he would have anticipated a fierce cut, but it was a gentle push and that lack of pace almost did him in. But he takes the catch somehow, anyhow."
"slow around off, pushed away towards mid-on for one"
"short down leg, 90 kph. Pandya misses a paddle sweep, wide called"

"short down leg, a help-yourself delivery. Swivel-pulled down to fine leg for one"
"a big appeal. A bouncer down leg, Pandya wants to get something on it down to fine leg, but is hurried for pace. The ball goes past. Latham doesn't go up, just Southee. No, says umpire Gough"
"off the mark. Short and wide outside off, pulled to deep square leg for one, played that along the ground"
"goes wide of the crease, 130 kph, full on off, the ball seaming back in. Kohli takes a step forward, looking to go straight, up and over mid-off but the ball goes 180 degrees the other way, via the inside edge, past the stumps, to the fine leg boundary"
"another edge, another four. Short around off, using that length very well. Another well-directed bouncer on middle, Kohli pulls, but the ball is way over his head, gets a thick edge which flies past Latham."
"134 kph, good length outside off, dabbed to point. He is not happy he did not get one there"
"in the slot and outtttaaa here. Flight around middle, Pandya gets underneath the length and calmly lifts the ball over long-on. Second tier hit."

"there it is. <b>No. 31 for Kohli</b>, a tired lift of the bat and follow-through. Short delivery on leg, pulled away to fine leg, all along the ground. Fine, fine effort in draining conditions"
"superb captaincy. Another bouncer on middle and leg, a thick leading edge lobs over the keeper. But Boult, at third man, is very fine, he gets around to save two"
"Milne gets there, but can't cut it off, another short slower delivery outside off. Pandya picks it early and swats it away over midwicket for four. A forehand tennis swat"
"another bouncer, this is superb use of the short ball. Pandya can't make contact, Kohli feels Southee has used up his quota prior to this delivery, the umpire disagrees"
"wow, that's the shot he used so much in Australia. Short delivery outside off, Kohli chooses a different area, lofts the ball over cover. No one there"
"the wide yorker outside off, 139 kph, sliced away to deep backward point"
"lovely catch from Williamson, superb stuff, New Zealand's fielding has been amazing. A full slow ball outside off, Pandya backs away, doesn't get underneath that enough, the ball goes straight up off the outside half of the bat, Williamson runs across from cover point and takes a stunning diving catch at the mid-off region, running back"
"short around off, opens the bat face for a run to third man. May have to back away for a few overs, take it into the last three overs"
"139 kph, outside off, chopped away towards point"
"a low full toss outside off, pushed to the sweeper cover"
"nicely played from Bhuvneshwar, a short, slow legcutter outside off, Bhuvneshwar gets underneath the length and carves the drive over cover"
"full around off, pushed towards short cover for a tight single. Kohli doesn't lose speed even now, but Milne nearly found him short if he hit the stumps"
"in the gap, and four. Full around off, the ball seaming back in, Kohli just flicks over midwicket, no feet movement. Superb shot"
"short and wide outside off, the slower ball, Kohli fails to connect with an upper cut, he won't be happy with that"
"short and wide again, chopped towards cover for one"
"short and quick, following him with a bouncer. Bhuvi backs away and guides this down to third man for one"
"full and wide outside off, slashed towards backward point for one"
"a slower ball around off, Kohli flicks towards deep square leg"
"a slow, wide delivery outside off, dabbed to point."
"a short delivery around off, 133 kph, Bhuvneshwar misses a cut. Needs bat on ball, Kohli tells him the same"
"short around off, 135 kph, pulled towards mid-off for one. Great defensive, death bowling, mixing up the lines and lengths and pace"
"just four off it. A wide slow delivery outside off, pushed to deep backward point. 4 for 35 from his 10 overs, sublime spell from Boult"
"happy to keep the strike. Full and wide outside off, the ball seaming in, awkwardly hit to mid-off"
"134 kph, de Grandhomme in the wars. Short delivery on off, Kohli pulls, doesn't keep it down, the ball lands just in front of him and hits him on the shoulder. Fine effort"
"full and wide outside off, awkwardly hit to mid-off for one"
"another short delivery outside off, pulled to midwicket. 130 kph, Kohli not happy with it bot being called a bouncer"
"129 kph, another short one on off, pulled down to long-on for one"
"another bouncer, short on off, Bhuvneshwar knows it's coming, stays under the ball and pulls over long-on. just clears the boundary at long-on. Out on most grounds, not here"
"shot of the day. Shot of the year. Wow, full around off, not too full, not too short. Kohli somehow makes room by clearing his front leg and then whips his hands through the ball, hits the ball dead straight and it hits the press box. That is an unbelievable hit, how did he get so much power behind that?"
"six and out. But he's done his job, much more actually. It's shortish around off, Kohli uses his bottom hand to swing through the line, the ball lobs to long-on, where Boult takes a simple catch. A tired acknowledgement of the applause, what fitness, superb innings"
"a short and wide legbreak outside off, Bhuvneshwar misses a swat"
"four more. Another bouncer, maybe predictable, Bhuvi gets underneath the length and pulls over short fine leg for four."
"maaaaasive. Too predictable is Southee, another short, slow legbreak, it sits up for Bhuvi to hammer over midwicket, such good timing and power behind that"
"lovely catch to finish, 131 kph. Another short delivery on leg, Bhuvneshwar gets underneath the length but not enough power, pulls away towards deep midwicket, where Nicholls dives in front to take a great catch. 16 runs and two wickets off the over."
"a hint of shape through the air, and it's threat is enhanced by Bhuvi pitching it in the corridor of uncertainty. Guptill wisely lets it go"
sensational hit down the ground. By no means is this a half-volley but Guptill is a superb player down the ground. Just extends his defence and admires the on-drive
"not entirely timed, with Bhuvneshwar pulling his length back and the ball holding in the pitch. Guptill checks his drive, and yet it pings away to the long-on boundary"
"good length ball, outside off, defends"
"lovely bowling. He's searching for the drive away from the body, making the ball swing away from the right-hander. Guptill, for his part, ignores the bait"
"probes the channel outside off, Guptill holds himself back from chasing it. That was a really fun first over."
<b>ripper to start</b>! His ability to hit the deck and make the ball skid on surprises Munro as he tries to block and comes away beaten outside off
"now the indipper, cramping Munro at pace and thudding into his thigh as he tries to flick"
"fuller delivery outside off, slashes it to point"
"<b>falls short of first slip</b>. Even with a fast bowler at top pace, and with a genuine outside edge, Munro was pushing so hard at it, India do not have a wicket because Shikhar Dhawan appears to have been positioned very wide and very deep."
"back of a length, in line with the stumps, Guptill has to plonk a straight bat down on it even as it <b>stays low</B>"
turns a length delivery on middle to short midwicket
"outstanding shot, over square leg. The work for this is made before Bhuvi bowls, when Munro walks across, pre-empting the seamer's line and being perfectly balanced to clip it off his pads"
"<b>how has that missed the stumps</B>?! Pitches it up on off stump, gets it to seam off the pitch, so Munro is alerted to the threat so very very late. Has no idea what to do and is lucky he isn't bowled"
"charges the seamer and flays the good length ball to mid-off. Mistimed, so it falls short of the fielder"
"drives smoothly to the right of Kohli at short cover, who prevents the single with a dive, and comes up fighting off a cramp"
"short ball, at reasonable pace, enough to surprise Munro as he tries to pull. Can't put bat to it and has to settle for leg byes towards square leg"
"slithers down leg, and Guptill will be disappointed he didn't tickle that away to the long leg boundary"
"stands up tall and drills a shortish delivery to point. But having done so, he yanks his right glove off and wrings his hand. Must have bounced extra."
"full on off stump, Munro protects it well"
turns a short delivery on off stump away to square leg
"<b>past first slip</b>! Dhawan again, diving full length to his right, but the outside edge from Guptill has too much on it. Brilliant bowling from Bumrah though, getting to ball to straighten away from the angle"
"another outside edge, this one going to ground quickly enough and scurrying to square leg. Guptill is standing on leg stump, and he is getting squared up a lot, feet and hands going in the opposite directoin, to Bumrah"
"doesn't move his feet, but is happy slogging at a good length ball, that might also have kept low. The only saving grace is that the ball is angled across his stumps and so it misses them"
"defends a shortish delivery, with soft hands, in between point and cover"
hacks a full length delivery from outside off out to short midwicket
"slower ball, and I think it's the <b>knuckle ball</b> too, because it swings into the left-hander. Munro plays the angle, and the floaty nature of the delivery, looking for the expansive cover drive. Ends up with an inside edge"
"short ball at the body, Munro pulls it strongly to long leg"
"not enough room for the cut shot, even if he has stepped towards leg. Chops the knuckle ball to point"
"shifts around the wicket for a bouncer at 132 kph. Munro shapes to hook, but then pulls out and collects the wide offered by Umpire Nandan. Both Bhuvi and Kohli are displeased with the call."
"pushes to the left of cover, cramped as he is by the knuckle ball on off stump"
works a shortish delivery on middle to deep square leg
can't do much more than defend a shortish delivery on middle and leg
"<b>dropped</b> by Jadhav at deep square leg. Munro picks him out perfectly with a flick off his hips, the timing on the shot working against the batsman this time. The fielder comes in, underestimating the pace on the shot, and ends up having to jump and reach up behind him with the reverse cup. To no avail"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
races down the pitch and heaves the short ball out to the deep midwicket boundary. Fierce hit.
"full on off stump, whips it to mid-on"
"<b>offcutter</b> and Munro does not pick it at all. By the time he wises up to the change of pace, and checks his flick, the ball bobbles up to the left of midwicket. Lucky again."
"short of a length on off stump, defends"
presents the full face against a back of a length delivery to mid-off
"pitches it on a good length, just outside off, and the ball skids through to hit Guptill on the pad. Inside edge first, though"
steps forward to defend a length ball outside off
"plants his front leg onto off stump, and therefore has to work overtime to bring his bat down in front of it to prevent the lbw."
"the shortish delivery straightens away from the angle, leaving Guptill poking away from his body. Little bit ofn outside edge wanders to point"
carves a shortish delivery outside off... straight to point. He's annoyed with himself for that
blocks a back of a length delivery to mid-on and sprints through for the single
"full toss, misses out on it by driving straight to cover point"
"<B>deceives him with the slower ball and it only just misses off stump</b>. There is no change in the action, in the arm speed. But out comes the ball, at off pace, grips into the pitch and makes a fool out of the batsman flicking against the break"
nudges a shortish delivery to the left of midwicket
"tries to flick to midwicket, can't get bat, but Munro is alert enough to pinch a quick legbye"
clips a shortish delivery on middle and leg to deep square leg
"short ball, pushing across the left-hander, Munro attempts to hook it against the angle and is beaten again"
"rushes at the seamer, but Bhuvi is too good. Adjusts by bowling it short and making it rise up to the helmet. Can't deal with those when you're as off balance as Munro was, hurrying into his hook shot"
"<b>knuckle ball</b>, swinging in through the air and surprising Munro for how much it moves. He tries to flick it away, but only gets an inside edge onto pad"
defends the back of a length delivery outside off to point
"width and that's what he loves. Throws his bat at a short delivery and hammers it over point. No intention of keeping it down. Despite India's seamers' good work beating the bat, New Zealand are going at over five an over."
"yorker, tailing into off stump, and forcing Guptill to bring down his straight bat. Good work, he even manages a single to mid-on"
"bouncer on middle, Munro sinks under it"
"leading edge, goes straight up and Karthik takes the chance backpedalling from cover point. Munro's looked dreadful against the slower balls, and he's fallen to one. The offcutter from Bumrah, with no change in arm speed, and pitching on leg stump to draw the batsman into a flick. He does exactly that, playing too early, his bat wandering well in front of his body. End of a rather awkward stay in the middle."
"another searing yorker, at the base of middle stump, and even Guptill is made to look a bit awkward as he digs it out"
"<b>between slip and the keeper, and the slip is positioned wide</b>! Bumrah throws his hands up in exasperation. Such an important player, Guptill. And right after a yorker, his feet go nowhere. Perfectly primed for the away seamer, which Bumrah executes perfectly, making the batsman play, getting the outside edge, all to no avail"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"tosses it up outside off, Williamson drives to long-off"
presses forward to block a flighted delivery on middle
"loads up the sweep, against a good length ball, perfectly in line with middle stump. If not for the inside edge, that could have been very close to an lbw"
"<b>makes him reach</b>, the ball drifting away from Wiliamson, who has committed to a drive to long-off. Ends up skewing it through extra cover"
"reads the googly off the pitch as he backs away, opens the hips, perhaps to pull it. But with the turn going in the opposite direction, he has to block"
"<b>given out lbw, but Guptill reviews</b>. This is a flatter delivery, but it's still full in length. Guptill comes forward, gingerly, to block and replays confirm the <b>inside edge</b>. 'Big deflection,' says the third umpire Tucker, and the on-field decision from Nandan is overturned."
"nice and tight on off stump, Williamson defends"
"lets the shortish delivery come on, drops it down towards point, looks up to see Guptill responding to a quick single. Jadhav is the man aiming a throw at the non-strikers' end, and he hits Williamson"
"all but mid-on in the leg side are in the deep, so Guptill's top-edged hook lands safe. Bouncer, at decent pace and climbing sharply on the right-hander too"
"defends a good length ball into the covers, from where Kohli throws and the man backing up, Bumrah fumbles"
"sliding down leg, Guptill flicks, can't get bat to it, but it does slide off his pad to long leg"
"beautiful shot. He positions himself on off stump, gets on top of the ball, waits those few milliseconds because this is a slow pitch, and finally rolls his wrists to give it the power needed to scurry away to square leg"
"loopy delivery outside off, Wiliamson scythes it in front of point"
"nudges a tossed up delivery on leg stump past the diving Kuldeep and MS Dhoni groans from behind the wicket, saying these are the ones that need to be stopped"
"keeps getting those big wickets! And it looks like India's plans against Williamson have worked - toss it up wide, make him play away from the body, and Williamson obliges by bopping the ball tamely to extra cover. Jadhav takes it without any trouble this time."
"looks like another googly, on middle and leg, Taylor plays the paddle sweep to long leg"
"<b>another huge appeal for lbw</B>, and it seems to pin him in line with middle. Question is, would it have turned too much? None of the India fielders seem certain, not the bowler, not even Dhoni, and Kohli prefers to hold on to his review. Good length ball, drawing Guptill forward. It pitches and turns sharply enough to beat the inside edge and pin him in line with middle stump. Hawk-Eye says it will miss leg stump"
"shapes to paddle sweep again, but Kuldeep pushes the length fuller and makes Taylor play with a straight bat. Aaron Finch had come with the same ploy a few weeks ago, and Kuldeep adjusted so well that bowled him neck and crop. This is a super contest"
"back of a length and on off stump, defends"
"good length on middle and leg, Guptill tries to flick, but ends up inside edging onto pad"
"<b>hits him on the box</b>, Guptill and Pandya exchange wry smiles. Good length, darting in off the pitch, beating the batsman's flick."
"full and outside off, Guptill drives back to the bowler"
"inside edges a shortish delivery on off stump to midwicket, and he's wringing his right hand again, suggesting the ball is hitting the bat hard and is jarring his fingers."
pulls an attempted bouncer in front of square out to deep midwicket
"googly, pitches it short and so Taylor, who is hanging back, has the time to punch it to cover"
presses forward and flicks the flighted delivery with the turn to midwicket
"reads the googly this time and smacks it to the point boundary. Beautiful work. Once you spot the variation, it's all a matter of muscle memory"
"good length ball on middle and leg, clips it to midwicket"
flicks a length ball on middle through midwicket
"short again from Kuldeep and on a slow pitch, that affords Taylor all the time he needs to rock back and pull to the square leg boundary. So much power in the shot that even a fielder there doesn't help"
"good length delivery on off to begin after drinks, Guptill is watchful in defense"
"a thick inside edge, full delivery outside off, Guptill goes through with his drive, a thick edge evades the stumps, gets one to fine leg"
"short and wide, chopped away towards backward point"
"full and wide outside off, 127 kph, Taylor's timing so bad, another chop to point"
"that's what you do when you're scratching around, a gentle push to mid-on for a run"
"dangerous option. Short delivery outside off, Guptill gets inside the line, arches his back and looks to upper cut over slip, makes no contact. It's an instinctive shot"
"nice loop on middle, gets the outside half towards point for a run. Lovely bit of flight"
"flight again, driven towards short cover, where Dhawan dives to his right to save one. Fantastic effort, keeps Guptill on strike"
"goes following the ball, very slow through the air around off, Guptill watchfully plays it out"
"79 kph, short and wide, slashed to the sweeper cover for one"
"the flipper, 82 kph, quick, pushed through outside off, Taylor misses the cut, and it almost hits off stump. May have been the googly actually"
"nice and slow outside off, carved towards point, no run"
"short and wide outside off, Guptill fails to connect with his upper cut, I don't think Pandya will mind if he connects"
"fine catch from Karthik. 140 kph, not a great shot from Guptill. Short around off, Guptill chooses to pull but gets a leading edge on the shot, the ball hangs in the air for a while. Karthik runs in from deep square leg, and takes a great catch running in. Lost his patience there, maybe should have weathered the storm for a little while longer. Got big on him, and the fact that he had to drag the pull didn't help him. That's Pandya's wicket-taking  hard length"
"short and wide outside off, slashed past cover for a couple. The sweeper cover has to run around"
"full around off, a thick inside edge towards fine leg for one, 129 kph"
"138 kph, good length outside off, left alone, very close to that off stump, would have uprooted a fourth stump"
"133 kph, fullish outside off, solidly behind the line to defend"
"overpitched flight on off, drilled down to long-off. I like Taylor's intent tonight, has often got stuck early in his innings"
"a low full toss outside off, paddled down to fine leg for a couple. Well played. Latham coming off a stint in Durham, conditions entirely different in Chester-le-Street though"
another fine paddle sweep down to fine leg
"ooh, short around off, the ball slides on, Taylor goes on with the cut, it beats point and earns him two. Would have hit off stump if he missed the ball"
"flight around off, worked to midwicket"
comes down at the bowler and works it away towards midwicket
"good length around off, 128 kph, defended back"
"full and very wide outside off, carved away towards backward point. Rahane dives to his right and saves a run or two"
"full delivery outside off, played to point"
"superb shot, short outside off, Latham stands tall and guides the punchy cut past point, to his left. The sweeper cover runs around but can't get there"
"short down leg, pulled down to fine leg for one"

"84 kph, tossed up around off, off the inside edge towards fine leg for one"
"77 kph, short around off, another risky cut, to point. The odd one sliding through"

"flight around off, pushed towards cover"
"lots of flight, far too much, too full, skewed away off the inside half towards square leg"
"78 kph, short on middle and leg, flicked away through square leg for a run"
"lovely display of loop and flight, very slow outside off, the stock ball spins away and beats the bat. <strong>A beauty</strong>"
"the googly, and out comes the sweep. It's very well played, but the sweep is also an indicator that he isn't sure which way the ball is going to spin. Gets low and nails his sweep behind square, fine stroke"
"short and slightly wide, the ball spins away, Latham goes right back in the crease and cuts to the sweeper cover"
"flight outside off, 80 kph, driven to long-on for one"
"the outside edge, but took a chunky part of it. Flight outside off, takes the outside half en route to third man"
"beautifully played. Lots of loop outside off, Latham opens the bat face and guides that through cover point for one. Made the run by opening the bat face"
"quick and straight, driven to long-on for one, that was pushed through"
"slow around middle and leg, the ball spinning in, worked away to square leg for one, played with the spin"
"beauty from Chahal, flight outside off, the ball rips away and beats the bat.<strong> Getting the ball to drift, then dip, then spin away. </strong>"
"short and wide outside off, Latham gets on top of the bounce and cuts to the sweeper cover. He has been playing spin really well tonight"
"flight outside off, 73 kph, defended into the leg side"
"premeditated the sweep, then realised that the ball was too full for it, and then improvised very well to work to square leg"
"flight outside off, 81 kph, driven with the spin to cover"
"overpitched on leg, driven to long-on. Full enough for Latham to play it against the spin"
"75 kph, quick around off, Taylor brings out the fine paddle sweep towards fine leg for a couple. Really good batting. One of the better periods from an opposition against Chahal and Kuldeep in the recent few months"
"quick outside off, misread the length, stayed back and guided to point"
"the sweep, flight outside off, gets low and nails his sweep to deep midwicket"
"lots of turn, pitched outside leg, spinning away, worked away through square leg"
"runs forward, converts flight into a full toss and drives to long-on. Very impressive from Latham"
"the googly, picked, Taylor goes back and punches it back to the bowler"
"beautiful pace, slow through the air, around off, defended back"
"shortish around off, Latham goes back and cuts to the sweeper cover"
"lots of flight outside off, skewed back to the bowler"
"the edge, but there is no slip. The stock ball outside off, the ball spinning in from well outside off. Dhoni is moving to his left because the ball is spinning that way, the ball takes the outside edge and flies away. There is leg gully"
"the full delivery around off, Taylor runs down and smothers the spin"
worked away towards square leg from the back foot
"79 kph, another edge, quick around off, the ball spinning away, off the outside edge towards third man for one. Latham <strong>wants to stay on the back foot</strong>, but Kuldeep knows that which is why he is bowling fuller."
"130 kph, full around off from around the wicket, shovelled towards wide mid-on"

"drops slightly short, Taylor goes back and pulls towards fine leg for one"
"another sweep, flight outside off, Latham gets low and crisply caresses his sweep to deep square leg"

short down leg for a wide
"a nice cutter, on middle and leg, misses the inside edge and hits Taylor on the body"
"just short of the boundary. Full delivery outside off, Taylor runs down to the pitch and smashes the ball over mid-on. Straight down long-on's throat. Fantastic execution again from Taylor"
"on a length around off, pushed towards cover. Taylor wants one, Latham doesn't. Taylor runs back, topples over, over-balances, his shoe comes off. What an ugly return to the crease, who cares, he's still there, the throw hits him too"
"shortish delivery outside off, 133 kph, tapped down to third man for one"
"a slower delivery outside off, Latham lets the ball hit the bat, as it does he opens the bat face to get one to third man. The de Villiers way"
"short outside off, Latham stays back and pulls to wide long-on. Happy to play wristspin from that deep in the crease"
"a low full toss, pushed down to long-on"
"nailed that. A full delivery around off and middle, Latham may have premeditated that stroke, it was the googly, and absolutely belted that sweep in the gap at square leg"
"shortish and wide outside off, carved to the sweeper cover"
"74 kph, overpitched again, around off, driven to long-off"
"shortish outside off, Latham stays back but the ball doesn't turn as much, he misses his cut. Heads go up in despair, including Latham's"
"out with a direct hit. Short on middle and leg, worked away towards square leg. Dhoni races to it, picks up, swivels around and hurls a throw at the bowler's end. Chahal is watching the stumps and the ball, hoping they'll connect, but the ball misses, and receives some rather mellow words from Kohli. Have to do the basics well"
"flight outside off, paddled down to fine leg."
"shortish on middle, skids on, cut away to the sweeper cover for one. Taking it from the stumps, he doesn't mind"
"flight outside off, 77 kph, blocked to cover"
"the googly, Latham comes down, gets close enough to drive to long-on against the spin. Latham's 39 has been worth a lot more, sensational innings so far"
"slow outside off, the ball spinning away, Taylor gets forward to defend"
"full and wide from around the wicket, hit back to the bowler"
"digs this in short, loops over Latham who watches the ball go over him, wide called"
"full and wide outside off, driven sweetly to the sweeper cover for one"
"good length on leg, worked past short fine leg for four. Too straight from Pandya, all Taylor needs to do is flick past the fielder."

"shortish and wide outside off, carved away towards third man for one, opened the bat face late enough"
"an offcutter and wide outside off, carved towards backward point."
"flatter delivery on middle and leg, Latham clears his front foot and clips it to midwicket"
"'caaaaatch,' everyone cries, including the 20,000 at the stadium, but the top-edged sweep lands short of deep backward square leg. Beautiful bowling from Chahal though, danging it up and getting the ball to dip"
"defends a straighter delivery and gets an outside edge. A slip is in play for just such turns of events, but this time the ball goes wide of him"
"gets down the pitch, and as a result, Chahal pulls his length back and tosses it up wider. Latham defends it behind square leg"
"loops it onto leg stump, the ball drifting nicely. Then it pitches and turns, and Taylor, mindful of all that, blocks"
"whips it away to deep midwicket, and having placed the ball far enough to his left, they pick up an extra run. <b>Neat little stroke to bring up his fifty</b>. He looked disastrous on his last tour of India. But after a good home season, he's regained his confidence and is playing like the senior man he is in this line-up"
nudges a shortish delivery off his hips to midwicket
blocks a shortish delivery on off
"pushes the slower ball to mid-off and pinches a single to Jadhav, one of India's weaker fielders"
"lets the shortish delivery come on, having judged it to be outside off. When it's within his range, he simply taps it down to deep third man"
"<b>plays and misses</b>. That's not happened too often to Latham tonight, but he underestimates the pace and bounce (actually, it was lack of) of Pandya here, cutting and missing"
"sensational placement, just to the left of mid-on! He accesses that gap by first shuffling across onto off stump, so the ball at the base if it ends up on his pads. From there, it's a simple case of flicking the ball in the gap"
"short and wide, Taylor cuts to the sweeper cover"
"gets down the track, and though he mis-hits down the ground, the ball still skews enough to the right of Chahal for him not to get to it"
"tosses it up on leg stump, Taylor defends with bat in front of pad"
"outside edge, but there's enough bat in it to lob over point"
"a teaser outside off, Taylor thinks he can smash it over extra cover. Comes up second best on this occasion. In other words, beaten"
"he's backing away, trying to make room to cut, but the short ball pitches and turns so sharply that Taylor has to move in the opposite direction, reaching out outside off to late cut"
"not quite short enough for the pull, and Latham gets struck on the thigh"
"clips the outside half of the front pad and dribbles all the way to the long leg boundary. Well, Latham did intend to get the ball down there. <b>That's also the hundred partnership</B>"
"picks away the straight ball off his pads to deep square leg to bring up a <b>high-quality fifty</b>. Takes in the applause from his dressing room, and savours silencing the great cauldron that is the Wankhede"
"<b>chance of a run-out</b>! And it's surprising really, Latham has placed the ball to the right of cover, but Taylor still isn't keen on the single. Reacts late. Even gives up and Kohli, with only one stump to aim at, misses"
"short and wide, Taylor slaps it to deep third man"
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b>, and though it hits Latham in line with middle, the batsman playing all around it, it has pitched outside leg."
"shortish and outside off, steers it down to deep third man"
calmly defuses a shortish delivery on middle to long leg
"ensures his front foot doesn't wander across - which isn't too hard for him, he loves room to swing his bat - and so is in perfect position to flick through to deep square leg"
opens the face and runs the shortish delivery outside off to deep third man
"they're looking to nail Taylor lbw or bowled, but he is not letting them, making sure the front foot doesn't stray across. That coupled with his quick hands mean he has easy singles through square leg"
nudges a full delivery on middle to short midwicket
"uses soft hands to dab the back of a length delivery outside off behind point. Taylor drawing from his experience, taking the game deep"
"offcutter, and it should only have been one, but Chahal dives over the ball, which skips away to the extra cover boundary. Latham's gets a massive return from what is basically an extension of defence"
pushes it through the cover point
"short ball, but on this slow pitch, Taylor has all the time in the world to see it and pull it down to deep square leg"
"strikes him on the pads, but it may have pitched outside leg again. With Bhuvi bowling over the wicket to the left-hander, unless he can make the ball straighten, lbws won't be possible. Also, there is an inside edge as Latham flicks"
"back of a length and outside off, taps it to point"
"digs it into the middle of the pitch, and since it is targeting Taylor's body, he takes evasive action"
"inside edge as he blocks a good length, skiddy delivery on off stump. Latham drags his partner for a quick single, and Taylor only just survives the throw at his end. He's slowing down..."
<b>beats the outside edge</b>! His ability to hit the deck and demand help from it is simple phenomenal. Just what a set batsman hates. Latham is led on a wild goose chase...
whack! What a shot to bring up the 200! Width on offer and Latham smashes it to the point boundary and silences the crowd again.
lifts off his feet to nudge a shot delivery off his hips to long leg
"short and at the body, Taylor pulls it gently to fine leg"
"slower ball outside off, Taylor slices it to point."
"back of a length and outside off, dabs it behind point for a quick single. Taylor stretches to beat the direct hit from Jadhav."
pulls the short ball from outside off to deep square leg
"brilliant shot! Straight over Bhuvneshwar's head. Shimmies down the pitch to get closer to the length ball and pummels it. Although, at the end of the shot, he's been forced into some stretches to avoid cramping up. The humidity must be such a challenge for New Zealand, even now."
steers it between cover and point for a single
"pins him on the pad, with Latham playing around it, but the ball has pitched outside leg so no point in the lbw appeal"
on the pads and Latham turns it gently behind the corner. Gently because it comes off his thigh
"full and outside off, Taylor lashes it over point"
a little bit of an inside edge as Latham stands up tall to punch the shortish delivery through the covers. Settles for a run to midwicket instead
"shortish offcutter outside off, Taylor steers it to deep third man. He's tiring, but he's not giving it up."
"another offcutter, which Latham drives to the right of short cover and pinches a single. These are taking their toll on Taylor, he begins jogging, thinking the throw won't be coming to his end, but India are targeting him for a run-out"
"shortish on middle and leg, Taylor tries to flick, but he's a touch slow on the shot and has to settle for a leg bye to point. To do that though, he has to motor, and stretch to beat the throw at the non-strikers'"
"loads up the lap sweep, taking the ball from outside off to long leg"
"<b>big sweep, but he's beaten</b>. Excellent bowling from Chahal - tossing it up, and a lot wider, seeing the batsman go for the cross-bat shot and then throwing him off balance"
"goes for the sweep again, and he connects much better, finding a single to deep square leg"
"the right-hander resorts to the sweep as well, gets an inside edge to fine leg"
"he's brought about this short ball - he's engineered it by sweeping Chahal repeatedly. Fearing that shot, Chahal drops it short and Latham can cut it to deep point"
"brings out the reverse sweep now, taking the ball from outside leg and depositing it to deep point's hands."
"<b>he's reverse-pulled</b> the ball to the third man boundary! Three of the five men in the deep are on the leg side, and seeing the ball short, Latham exploits a gap in the field with a superb shot"
"hangs back to cut a shortish delivery, but it kicks up a little more than Latham expects. <b>Beaten</b>"
gets down low to sweep the ball from off stump to short fine leg. <b>Latham appears to be cramping as well</b>
"he backs away, seeing the short ball outside off, shaping to cut it. But then it breaks the wrong way, the googly. And Taylor just about reaches it"
"goes for the sweep again, but this time Kuldeep throws it a lot wider and gets it to dip beneath the bat swing"
"he's pinned to his crease, with Kuldeep bowling flat, but keeping the length full. Pushes hard at the ball, panicking a bit, and gets the outside edge to third man."
Chahal scratches his head as he has to deal with another lap sweep to a flighted ball on off stump that yields a single to long leg
"excellent shot, as he gets deep in his crease against a short ball and pulling it strongly between deep square leg and deep midwicket. Karthik does well, diving to his left"
nudges a full delivery off his toes to deep square leg
"<b>just over Pandey running to his right at deep square leg</b>! It's the sweep shot again, and this time Latham gives it everything. Good that he has, because there is a fielder patrolling the boundary and it only just lobs over him. Would have been a catch if Pandey had been on the boundary."
"another sweep shot, this one bouncing well in front of Pandey at deep square leg"
smears a tossed up delivery outside off to the sweeper cover
"flatter delivery, on middle and leg, Taylor pulls it to long leg"
"oh, he's just showing off now! He's waited until the chase was under 50 to bring out the extravagant strokes and now they're all he's playing. Another reverse sweep, to go with a reverse pull, to find the third man boundary"
"reverse sweep again, but actually misses out on a full toss outside off"
"full and outside off, sweeps it strongly to deep square leg"
reads the googly early enough that he is able to dab it to short third man
cuts the flatter delivery outside off to deep point
"'caatch,' Bumrah yells, turning around as midwicket is moving to his right. But Latham's flick - lobbing off a leading edge - doesn't land anywhere near him. Excellent slower ball, in line with middle to draw the shot against the break of the ball."
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
charges down the track and heaves a length ball out to deep midwicket. Those shots were his lifeblood ages and ages ago. Then he realised he's a much better player. But every now and again...
"knows this will be a short ball - waits on the back foot, loads up the pull, and beats the man at long leg to his left. This is brilliant batting."
"outside edge, skews away towards the third man boundary"
"yorker, just outside leg - it's actually only by a sliver, as Latham flicks and misses. Really harsh to penalise that"
"launches it over wide long-on! <b>Latham is one short of a century</b>! What an innings this has been. He got a hundred in the practice match at No. 5. And now he's proving his case in international cricket, against one of the better attacks in these slow conditions."
"back of a length and outside off, Taylor gets, gets a thick outside edge past Dhoni. <b>He's into the nineties now</b>"
pulls the short ball well in front of square
"good length ball on middle, nudges it to short midwicket"
"<b>fourth ODI hundred, first in Asia, and one of the very best</B>, and this effort is after he has kept wicket for 50 overs. Gets to it with a simple nudge off his feet and then takes off his helmet to salute his team-mates and then enjoys a hug well done from his partner."
"shortish and outside off, nudges it to square leg."
"full on off stump, pushes back to the bowler"
"yorker on leg stump, Taylor tries to flick, but it misses his bat swing and accepts a leg by to long leg"
"fuller delivery on off stump, defends"
pulls the short ball to deep square leg
"full toss outside off, drives to cover"
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> and it did look good. Umpire Gough says not out and India have reviewed. The hoick from Taylor, his front foot on middle and off, and the bat hacking at the ball like a machete. Misses it altogether and is struck on the pad. The first replay the third umpire sees is about the no-ball, and it appears tight. 'At the moment, I;ve got nothing to say that's definitely a no-ball' says umpire Tucker. 'That's the best we've got,' says the technician. So its ruled a legal deliver. No bat involved. And ball tracking says its umpire's call. <b>Taylor survives</b>, and might well have enjoyed the break in play"
"full and outside off, Latham drives to the sweeper cover and takes the single. <b>Taylor will be off strike, on 95, and New Zealand need two to win</b>"
"back of a length and outside off, Latham steers it to backward point"
"offcutter on off stump, Latham pushes it to cover"
"short and wide, Latham cuts to the sweeper. That's the 200th run of the partnership, and and the scores are level. Taylor on 95 as well..."
"gets down the track, is surprised by the wide yorker, Taylor stretches to steer the ball to point"
"Chahal is claiming the catch at extra cover and Taylor is gone for 95! He's played a splendid hand, but it ends with a wide half-volley being smacked to the fielder, low to his right."
"heaves it over deep square leg for the victory! A length ball, sent soaring into the night sky, and towards a crowd that is simply stunned."
