"107kph, slower ball outside off, he slices this high in the air, to point and it lands safe between three men! Stoinis can't believe it"
"slower ball, on the hip, he just tucks this around the corner for a single"
"slower ball, he picks it and plays a magnificent cover drive, inside out, lacing it to the rope!"
"100kph slower ball again, he skips down and hammers a drive to Zampa on the circle"
"<strong>nearly caught at deep backward square!</strong> He swings high to deep backward square, Handscomb runs around, dives and gets two hands to it, and it pops out as he hits the ground! It would have been a beauty"
"<strong>caught at deep midwicket!</strong> Stoinis gets one to finish! He launched this miles in the air, Maxwell, one of the best in the business runs in from deep midwicket, camps under it and takes it very calmly!"
