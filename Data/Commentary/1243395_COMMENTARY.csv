"Dhawan ventures down the track once again, Sam Curran is wary of it, banging a lifter and shifting his line wider. Dhawan drops his gloves and let it go"
"sharp inswinger from Topley from left-arm over. He has Rohit falling over the flick, but this seems to have <b>pitched outside leg</b>"

"much better from Topley! He threatens to bring this length delivery back in with the angle from left-arm over, but it hits the pitch and straightens away past Dhawan's iffy little prod"

pulled away to the right of deep square leg. More work for Livingstone or rather Malan this time. He swoops down to his right and keeps it to a single

"Rashid belts out an appeal for lbw, not given out. England choose to challenge the on-field not out decision. <strong>Did that pitch outside leg?</strong> Dhawan plays around his front pad and misses this legbreak, wearing it on the front pad below the knee-roll.

"dragged down on middle, Dhawan goes back and heaves it away to deep square"
clipped out to deep midwicket
"<strong>Rashid provides England the breakthrough with the wrong'un</strong>. On a length and zipping in to strike the top of off. Rohit didn't pick the variation at all, playing for the legbreak. The spinner cuts the opening stand at 103. Rashid will now have Kohli to work with"

"onto the front foot, drilled hard into the covers once more, picking out the sweeper again"
"tickled off the legs, behind square"

"back and across, clipping the full length to the on-side"
stretching fully forward to smother the spin. This is a bit of a surge from England. Their spinners are doing the job that India's manifestly failed to do in the last game
"round the wicket, dipping on an off-stump line, forward with an angled bat and tapped to cover"
"<B>aggression from Kohli</B>, a gorgeous whip of the bottom hand to drill that so straight through long-on, but Topley makes good ground to cut off the four"
nurdled to the leg side
"<B>a horrible hack from Kohli and he's bowled!</B> Oh wow, that's turned a fair bit from an off-stump line, but Kohli's eyes were bigger than his stomach there, he rocked back for something wildly optimistic over the off-side, and had his leg stump clipped as the ball surged through... well, not so much a gate as a vacated citadel!

"on the back foot, another googly to the leftie and defended on the back foot"
"stretches forward this time, and nudges to square leg"
"very fine sweep, into acres of space behind square, but doesn't quite have the legs to reach the rope as Stokes sweeps round"
"<B>battered over cow corner!</B> Pant is restored to his favourite slot, to finish the over with a bang! Just tossed up a touch too much to a leg-hungry six-muncher. And that will settle his stomach a bit after a cautious start!"

forward and pushed back to the bowler
"tickled to the on-side, on the front foot, and they jog the single to complete the over. Moeen is doing a fine job here"
"<B>flicked contemptuously off the legs!</B> Who needs footwork when you have eyes like a hawk and wrists of steel! Pinged high over midwicket, there's a man lurking out there, but he can't get close! One bounce over the rope"
"shaping down the leg side, must have clipped the pads to avoid the wide being given ... ah, it was given. As you were!"
"<B>Scooped!</B> Super scooper, high over the shoulder to disrupt a perfectly decent delivery"
"nudged to the leg side, into the gap that that previous shot has just created"
"loopier length, dipping on the pads, blocked to the on-side"
"dangled outside off, a legbreak, and poked with firm wrists to cover"
"drilled from the full length, out to point. Some aggressive intent from Pant in that over, but England will still be happy with this situation after the start India got"
"<B>crashed in the air, and inches short of Sam Curran at cow corner!</B>  He does well to intercept it on the half volley, Pant seemed to scuff the turf with his shot, which maybe killed some of the pace on the ball"

chipped out to midwicket

"outside off, rocking back for the cut, slightly too short to open his account but the sweeper tidies"
"<B>a second-ball wicket for Livingstone!</B> It's a terrible ball, but it's bagged a massive scalp! A hip-high full toss, drawing a one-handed thump across the line, and Moeen behind square pulls off a blinder, pouncing to his left to cling on in both hands!"

"round the wicket, poked to the off side"
"<B>here comes Pant, nowhere near the pitch, but nails it all the same!</B> An offbreak to the leftie, dipping before he could reach it, one hand comes off the bat, and it's way over long-off!"

"tossed up, into the pads, deflected to short leg, Livingstone recovers well from a bruising start to his over"
"<B>Hardik's in the mood now as well!</B> Stands and delivers, a flat crease-bound whack through the line. Not dissimilar to the third of Kapil's four sixes at Lord's 1990... in case you fancy a throwback reference!"

"looped onto the legs, and tucked square"

"another legbreak to the right-hander, poked to point"
"drawn onto the front foot, pushed into the covers. A decent over so far... can Pant ruin it for him?"
"<B>so nearly a caught-and-bowled!</B> What happened there? Livingstone seemed to be moving to the leg side, to intercept a clip, but Pant finds a looping leading edge, and the bowler stuck out a boot, in an attempt to volley the chance into his hands! Can't find the tekkers, but a dot ball is a win too"

"off-stump yorker at `142ks, dug out"
Wood nails the stumps. Krishna backs away outside leg and has a feeble prod at it. Wood fires it full and pings middle stump
"short and slanting away outside off, Kumar pulls against the angle and top-edges it in front of third man running in"
Topley hits that in-between length outside off. Bhuvneshwar clears his front leg and aims to slug it down the ground. He can only carve it in the air. Curran swoops in from mid-off and pouches it to wrap up India's innings
"<B>hard-handed stab, and that's nailed through the covers!</B> That looked oddly tentative, not sure which way the ball was swinging, but watched it hard, and utterly pinged it!"
"<B>inswinger, belted back down the ground!</B> Well now, that's set the tone! Clubbed with a closing bat face through long-off"
"shaping back into the pads, fenced to the on-side"
"closing the face on another straight drive, pressed very straight back past the stumps... that's a measured response to Bhuve's each-way threat"
"curling into the pads, and <B>clipped with sublime timing through square leg!</B> Outstanding from Roy, timing over power in each instance, and filleting the gaps in the Powerplay"
"<B>zings through the gate!</B> Like I was intimating... in spite of the runs, Roy never quite looked at his imposing best in that extraordinary over, and he's undone with an utter pearler! Perfect length, perfect shape, nipping off the pitch, into the timbers through a flat-footed response!"
"very full length, very straight bat, clean down the line of the ball"
"fired down the leg-side, Pant fumbles on the dive, but they don't risk the byes as short fine leg tidies up"
"<B>angle across the left-hander, that's a dangerous ball!</B> Bairstow pushing on the up, and nearly nibbles as the ball gets big around his splice"
"overcooks that inswinger, way down the leg side"
"nurdled off the pads to deep square leg, Bairstow is up and running"
"inswinger to the left-hander, a decent yorker to the new batsman, dug out to the leg side"
"two slips in place, but that's too wide to take the edge! A half-tracker outside off, and Stokes needs only to get a toe-end on his cut to rush that through the infield to the cover boundary"
"angled bat, tighter line and fuller length, blotted down to third man"
"fully forward, head over the ball, and poked to cover"
fired down the leg side
firmly forward on the off-stump line to defend
"very full, angling across the left-hander towards off stump, and bending back in a touch to demand a block on the front foot"
"<B>jeepers, that's power and timing!</B> Nothing wrong with that ball, full and angling back into the stumps, but Stokes pounds through his drive, hitting up into the ball, high over the on-side!"
"back of a length, up on the toes to cut out to point"
"<B>way across his stumps and Bairstow is gone!</B> He has reviewed, but that looked pretty adjacent to the naked eye. It may only be height that can save him. Leg stump is visible on the replay as his bat misses with a clip. Yep, thumping the top of leg, and both England's openers are gone!"
"two steps out of the crease, to defend with attacking intent, if that is a thing"
"outside off, tight line, lifting past the off stump as Stokes leaves alone"
"angled bat, poked to point, another single to the cause"
"open face, Malan is back on his stumps, as is his wont early in an innings, and picks off the single to third man"
fired past the leg stump
"<B>zinger!</B> So tight to the edge, bending and lifting off the seam, and Pant fumbles standing up to the stumps. No edge on that occasion"
"<B>clattered past backward point!</B> The catcher was briefly in business, but he threw his hands hard at that one, wide of off stump, and cuffed it to the rope!"
nurdled to the on-side and another single to the cause
"striding to meet the full length, Stokes' feet are moving well in this innings so far, as that one is pumped back to the bowler in his followthrough"
"back of a length, met on the back foot with a dab to the off side"
"<B>a horror drop from Hardik Pandya behind the bowler's arm!</B> A plant of the front foot from Stokes, seeking to drill his straight drive into the sightscreen, but he got right under the shot, high in the air, and it was a dolly at mid-off! Plopped towards his hand like a rain drop!"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
patted to the on-side from back on the stumps
"whistling past the legs, good shape on the ball, but swinging too much"
"on the front foot, eased into the on side"
"striding to the pitch once more, head over the ball as Stokes pushes firmly to cover, and a loud no as he half ponders the single"
"another leg-side wide, there's movement on offer, but it's shaping down the wrong side of the bat"
<B>zips past the edge!</B> That's a better line! And this time the movement confounds Stokes as the ball gets big past his splice!
"tapped to short cover, and good reactions from Malan to hurtle through to the danger end for a pressure-relieving single"
"on the back foot, and clipped to the leg side"
"on the toes once more, and clipped to the leg side"
"on the back foot, stroked into the covers, gathered with a scramble to cut off the single"
"fuller length, attacking the stumps from a tight line, poked back past the bowler"
"angled bat, poked to third man for another single. Uncomplicated from Malan, he's got licence to take his time and build into his innings"
"on the back foot, slightly squared up by the back-of-a-length delivery, jabbed back down the pitch"
"on the back foot again, and nudged to the on-side"
"back of a length again, tapped to the on-side, another single to keep things ticking"
"<B>Stokes is startled from the outset!</B> Looking to cut, but Krishna's height extracts some extra bounce, and he has to limbo to keep the ball down"
"<B>pumped through long-off!</B> Power and timing again, looked like he was lining up the cut, but aimed a lot straighter on impact, and there's no intercepting that!"
"up on the toes, and cut hard to deep point. Stokes riding the extra bounce well after that unnerving first ball"
"high elbow, pumped to mid-on"
"up on the toes again, another slammed cut in front of square, but straight at short cover"
"back of a length, and <B>Stokes was struggling there!</B> Set off for the quick single for a back-footed flog to cover, but he was slow setting off due to his rooted footwork... a direct hit would have been close!"
"solid and blocked, back down the pitch"
"drags back the length, soft-handed defence"
"another crack of the bat through the off-side, hitting the cover ring with another forceful stroke"
"on the legs, and nurdled to the on-side"
"spears in the yorker, blocked into the off side with very soft hands. Another single to the cause"
"fended into the covers, leaning onto the front foot"
"<B>more zippy extra bounce, and Stokes gets away with a top-edge!</B> That's miles over the boundary, but a win for Krishna! Stokes was in no position for the pull and is lucky he's got a fat edge!"
"width, wafted down to third man with an open face"
"<B>Malan's best shot so far</B>. Fuller length, and a crushing drive from Malan, all about the weight transfer, through the shot, through the covers"
"back of a length, hops into the crease, with an open face again. Poked to point"
guided out to point on the back foot
"<B>sweetly timed off the back foot!</B> That's been Malan's go-to shot so far, but this time he adds power to the open-faced glide, in front of third man. The ball zips across the increasingly dewy outfield, which will you suspect play some part"
"cracked hard through mid-off, that's sweet timing too, but good relay fielding on the boundary's edge"
"Stokes advances for a wristy drive, but hits short cover"
"<B>full bunger on the pads, and Stokes has launched that straight to square leg!</B> Huge moment ... is this above waist height? Stokes advanced to meet the ball, and that may undo him on the balance of probabilities. The ball was dipping, and yep, he has to go! That's a vast moment in this game. Advantage all India now"
"full length from over the wicket, shape into the pads. and blotted to the on side"
"guided into the covers with an open face, on the back foot"
worked to the on-side
"width outside off, Malan has a wipe and misses out on the cut"
"more width, <B>clubbed through point!</B> That was close to the fielder, but it was also travelling, that habitually open face fizzes the ball to the rope!"
"more fierce contact on the cut shot, but third man slides round to intercept"
"full length, curling into the toes, and nurdled to deep midwicket"
"angled bat, half a step out of the pitch to poke to the covers"

"round the wicket, firmly forward and blocked to cover once more"
"cut hard to point, grabbed well on the bounce and in comes the shy to cut off any thoughts of the single"

"firm block to long-off, another single"
"dipping into the toes from over the wicket, tickled behind square"
"back of a length, open-faced glide once more, down to third man. Easy pickings for Malan in that region"

"on a length and outside off, Malan engages in another busy dab down to third man"
"on a length and around off, tip and run into the covers once again"
"<strong>inducker from Thakur</strong>, slams the pad, not given out lbw. Kohli has a chat with Pant and asks for a review. Fullish and jagging back in to beat the inside edge and hit the front pad just above the knee-roll. Was this heading past leg stump? Nope, ball-tracking suggests that it would have struck leg stump. Golden arm: Shardul Thakur. Umpire Chaudhary has to reverse his on-field not-out decision"
"very full and jagging into middle, down the track and whipped away through midwicket"
Thakur appeals for caught behind but this is a leg-side wide. Back of a length and flung down leg

"back of a length and outside off, forced off the back foot to long-off"
"pushed through flat and quick from Krunal, he finds some spin, too, to thump the front pad as Malan plays around it. <strong>Kohli calls for another review</strong> after the on-field umpire rules Malan not out. No bat again, but this is spinning down leg. Umpire Menon is right once again"

"darted outside off, sliced away towards short third man"
worked with the spin to deep midwicket
"tossed up on middle stump, Livingstone stretches out and drives down to long-on"

"Livingstone is so very strong on the leg side. He shimmies out, takes a full ball from just outside off and whips it fiercely behind square, between the two men in the deep"

"Krishna's response to back-to-back fours is a lifter, <strong>socks the shoulder</strong> and rolls down to deep third man"
"Malan has kept third man busy all evening. Short and wide, he gets on top of the bounce, cracks it away to the right of point and left of deep third man. <b>Make that three fours in four balls</b>"

"flat and spinning into the stumps, pushed down the ground"

"back of a length and outside off, stabbed to the left of midwicket off the inner half"

"cramped on the leg stump, clipped to the on-side for the single"

"better length on a leg-stump line, Moeen slides back and across to block"

"banged in short, and a top-edged pull landed safe. Another single"

"slower yorker, pretty well delivered, as Curran checks his stroke outside off, and pushed to mid-off"

"full again, dipping into the toes, that's a good over from Krishna, as the rate extends a touch from a run a ball"
"<B>thumps the pad, but <I>just</I> pitching outside leg!</B> That's what the umpire thinks at any rate! Kohli has <B>reviewed</B> at the last second... is this the game? Yorker length, Curran was toppling across his crease. No edge in sight, and that is splintering the stumps. But yep, six inches outside leg. Gosh!"
"very full again, on a leg-stump line and nudged off the toes."

"back of a length, Curran wants the single to point, Rashid is having none of it, and he skulks back to his crease"
"cracked uppishly through third man, another single to the cause"
"opens the face on the wide line, tapped to gully. A typically tight over. Bhuvi has two more up his sleeve. England's rate is creeping back towards seven"

"<B>stunner from Kohli in the covers!</B> A chipped drive, low to the skipper's left, he was only going to get there with one hand, and he plunges superbly to grab, and out pop his eyes on stalks. A one-man meme machine in this contest! Thakur's cutters make the priceless breakthrough!"

"back of a length, finds a fat edge off the back foot, down to third man. A productive area today, but it's got Curran back on strike"
"<B>clipped from a full length, down to long-on, for Curran's fifty!</B> Just 45 balls, it's been a good hand in tough circumstances"
"attractive tonk off the front foot from Wood. Can't beat the sweeper, but he comes back for two useful runs"
"low full toss, Wood toe-ends a drive to mid-off"
"<B>top-edged pull, and over fine leg!</B> Wood loves to lamp it, and he doesn't care how they come when he throws the bat!"
"back on the fuller length, thumps the pad outside leg stump, deflects to gully. A decent over for England in the circumstances. And Curran will be on strike"
"outside off, a Test-match line and length, as Curran lines it up and leaves it alone"
"driven off the back foot, and <B>eludes the outside edge</B>! Clever bowling... mixing up the seam position while ploughing a tight furrow"
"compactly onto the front foot, solid defence. Respect from Curran, who knows that as match-ups go, this isn't one of them!"
"very full again, nothing to drive on that length, Curran blocks to long-off, and decides against the single. Protecting Wood too, maybe"
"low full toss, a rare overcook from Bhuvi, but not a costly one, as Curran cloths his swing across the line to deep midwicket"
"solid in defence from Wood, onto the front foot. Just one off the over. Respect from England. Bhuvi has one over left... Kohli well might hold it back for an emergency. It's already a long shot with that run-rate surging now"
"<B>Curran clears the front dog, and biffs the attempted yorker into the stands!</B> Huge intent, high over long-on. Now then ... is this the do-or-die over for England and Curran?"
"much better yorker, Curran was winding up again, but realised it was too pinpoint this time. Good nerve from the rookie"
"another excellent yorker, clubbed from a full length to long-off, and Curran turns down the single. Challenging Nat to keep hitting his blockhole"
"another fine yorker! Well bowled again, this time Curran takes the single, realising that he might need to recalibrate for the next over. Wood for two balls then..."
"pumped hard through the line, just back of a yorker length from Wood, who connects well to long-on, and takes the single"
<B>superb yorker again!</B> Curran digs it out to long-on and settles for the single. That was some nerve from Natarajan after his first-ball treatment
"back of a length, clubbed into the leg side with a roll of the wrists. Wood thought the single was on, but was sent back from virtually Curran's toes!"
jabbed off the pads... <strong>and this time Curran wants the single </strong>and Wood won't go! Careful now... Thakur sprints through to field. Misinformation between England's batsmen!
"good delivery, a cutter gripping on the back of a length, punched to cover, a tight run but safely home"
"<B>back of a length, panned past Kohli at short cover!</B> So close, and so nearly wrapping that left hand round it again! Hit firmly by Wood, which saved him"

"low full toss, effectively a yorker, as Curran toe-ends a biff to wide mid-on"
"<B>flashed high down to long-on, and <I>just</I> short of the fielder!</B> A valiant dive from Rahul, and a good piece of bodywork to save the boundary as the ball dips in front of him"
"<B>cracked hard down the ground </B> but short of Rahul again. No single as Curran bides his time, looking for the boundary"
"rolling his wrists on a violent pull, but again can't find the gap on the leg side. Now there's a challenge for England. Nearly two a ball needed now"
"<B>that's a pick-up and a half!</B> Pandya spears in the leg-stump yorker, Curran falls across his crease to force the angle in front of the leg-side sweeper. Top boshing!"
"<B>full toss, 'oh no!' says Curran as he top-edges the pull</B> but it's plugged safe in the deep! No no-ball, that may have dipped below waist-height, no umpire check"
"there's the wide cutter, but this time Curran's wise to it, with a flat-batted smack into space on the off side. He hustles back for the second"
"<B>full toss, slapped through the covers!</B> Tremendous drilled drive, fast hands to capitalise on a rare bad ball... it's still on!"
"another cutter, comes out as a long-hop, but Curran's cut can't beat the sweeper this time... no run as he keeps the strike"
"<B>pounded in short and wide, and slammed over long-on!</B> Curran rocks so deep into his crease, belting the cutter as it sits up in the pitch... this is the big over now!"
"another cutter outside off, short again, thwacked with all of Curran's mini-might, into the covers, and Wood hustles well to get back for two!"
"<B>crashed high over the covers!</B> Bissects the fielders for another boundary, got under the shot slightly, but picked the gap... it dribbles over the rope. Huge over for England!"
"<B>perfect from Wood</B>... back of a length, flogged to deep cover. A precious single to get Curran back on strike"
"fired past the leg stump, but flicks the pad along the way. No wide"
"outside off, swinging away, Curran shapes to cut, leaves alone... <B>and gets the wide</B>"
"<B>another wide, down the leg side</B>. Pant does brilliantly to limit the damage with a dive to his right"
"slower ball, good ball. Curran blocks under his eyeline"
"<B>bashed with a round-house slog down the ground!</B> Pandya at long-on parries well to save the boundary. Wood's back on strike, but he wanted the second! Confusion!"
"<B>very full, huge appeal, Bhuvi has the breakthrough!</B> <B>England review</B> There did seem to be two sounds with Wood well back on his stumps for the inswinger.. nope, no bat, but it's going to be a dead ball if this is going over... <B>missing!</B>"
"<B>plays miles inside the line to see off the main threat</B> Outside off, bouncing through to the keeper. Now then. Curran back on strike. <B>19 from 12 is the equation!</B>"
"Curran gives himself room to leg, Hardik follows him. Good bowling, precious dot"
"on the back foot, open face, and <B>a misfield!</B> They've got to run for everything now, and Prasidh's lanky frame at third man can't stoop low enough"
"<B>Wood has a wipe, and Thakur at midwicket has dropped another shocker!</B> That is simply terrible, the match on the line, he barely got a finger to it as it plopped out of the lights on the edge of the circle... wow"
"<B>high, hoisted over the leg side off the top edge, three men converge, Natarajan spills it!</B> What is going orf out there! Slower ball, miles in the air to third man... he made a dive, but made a hash of it!"
"right back on the stumps, Curran looks for a flick, but that's too full and straight to work with"
"opens the face on the full length, poked to point. <strong>Curran keeps the strike</strong>"
"decent yorker, decent connection, drilled to long-on, Wood gets his World Cup final skates on in an attempt to run back to the danger end, but it's a brilliant bullet throw from Pandya to the keeper, and <B>he's short!</B>"
"good connection, pinged to deep point! That'll do..."
"not this time, another full ball, wide line, and Curran drags to the leg side"
"flogged to long-off, he missed his yorker, but Curran missed his wind-up! It's do or die now..."
"<B>clattered hard, but not hard enough!</B> Whistles through the covers, but not quite with the necessary elevation!"
"pumped to long-on, but it's <B>India's game and series!</B>"
