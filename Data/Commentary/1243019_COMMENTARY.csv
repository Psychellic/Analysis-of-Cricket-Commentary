Brilliant work from Fortuin, who slid, picked up and threw all in one movement, with one-and-a-bit stumps to aim it, leaving Pakistan's captain well short! That'll silence then, um, audio effects guy"
"pushed through on off stump, patted square"

"swung leg side, there's a man out at deep square... <b>and Snyman holds on to a stunner!</b> Haider's sally is cut short, looked like he got a good connection, but Phehlukwayo may have taken some pace off, and then it was over to the debutant, Snyman, running around the rope for a diving take"

No, not according to Shozab Raza! It was <i>very</i> tight, looked to me like he might have just got some boot rubber in contact with the turf, but not according to the man whose opinion matters.

"nearly bowled! And big lbw shout denied! Similar delivery to the last ball pitching on middle and straightens to beat the forward prod, clips the top of the back leg and goes just over the bails before escaping past Rizwan.

Another wrong-un flighted and landing full on fourth stump, Snyman goes for an almighty heave and the ball rips back to piece a sizable gap between bat and pad. Middle stump is knocked back."

"length ball on fourth stump, goes to drive over cover, thick edge flies fine past the keeper for four. South Africa roaring back in this over."
"<strong>another googly, another wicket! Or is it? They call for the review on the lbw call.</strong> On the live shot, I thought it was spinning down leg. Qadir has been getting very sharp turn on his googlies all innings. It pitched on off on a full length and spun past his attempted flick to the leg side. Ball-tracking shows it is... <strong>missing leg! Aleem Dar is no longer infallible!</strong> Now 11 of 12 decisions upheld in T20Is."
"another googly, way too short this time and pulled behind square."
"fullish length outside off, prods this gently into the ring to scamper a single."
"flighted full on off, sweeps the length and hammers this in front of square, splits two boundary riders to the rope."
"beauty! Flighted full on fourth stump, drives at this but beaten by the turn."
"lots happening here! Flighted full on off, goes to reverse sweep and comes off the body, Rizwan dives forward and claims a catch. Aleem Dar gives not out. <strong>Babar calls for the review quite quickly thinking he got some glove on this. </strong> He definitely missed getting glove on it on the initial shot, but there's a possibility it rode up his forearm/glove on the follow-through after it caromed from the pads. Replays though indicate it missed everything in both instances. Aleem Dar begins a new streak of decisions upheld on review."
"good length ball on the legs, Hendricks backs away to flick over the leg side for a long single."
"short on the stumps, sits up for him to pull this flat to deep square leg. Haris has been getting hammered when bowling the short ball all match long but this time he gets away with it, perhaps bowling to a plan with the man out on the rope at deep backward square, and Klaasen obliged by picking him out. Taken at head height."
"short and wide outside off, slaps this into the covers."
"good length ball on fourth stump, goes back to flick through midwicket. <strong>50 up off 38 balls for Hendricks. He's picked up his strike rate the last few overs. </strong>"
"nearly drags on! Back of a length on off stump, goes to cut and cramped for room, bottom edge skittles past leg stump and races through fine leg to the rope."
"slower ball lands short on the legs, flicks this behind square for one. Don't think Pakistan will mind keeping Hendricks off strike."
"wide yorker on fifth stump, can't jam this away into the off side."
"overpitched too full on off, Phehlukwayo phumps this high and deep over long-off, clears the sightscreen by some distance."
"full toss follows Phehlukwayo backing away from leg and pings him on the knees, could easily have been flicked for six over the leg side but flubs the shot and it dribbles off the pads for an extra."
"yorker on off stump, Hendricks premeditated a shuffle across to ramp over fine leg but it's too full to get under and he jams this back to the bowler off the toe."
"premeditates another ramp over fine leg, this time Shaheen can't pitch this and Hendricks seizes on a shin height full toss to flick it between the keeper and fine leg."

"back of a length on off, slaps this back down the pitch to get off strike."

What a match he's having! </strong> Slower ball lands on a good length, tries to pull to the leg side and inside edges this in between his pads. Hendricks wants to run, but Phehlukwayo isn't exactly dedicated to responding seeing Rizwan charging forward. Yes no yes no. Hendricks is the only one who leaves his crease in the end but by the time he realizes his partner is staying put, Rizwan has collected and propelled himself Superman style into the sticks before Hendricks can dive back in. Brilliant from Rizwan, brainfade from Hendricks."
"overpitched on fourth stump, elegant lofted drive by Pretorius off his first ball to clear extra cover and long-off can't cut it off."
"<strong>dropped!</strong> Full on off, slams a drive back to the bowler. Haris is slow reacting to this chance at neck height. Doesn't look like he ever saw the ball coming back to him as it pings him straight in the left shoulder before a carom toward mid-off. If the ball goes a few inches to the left, Haris may have been taking a trip to the dentist because his head was ducking forward in his follow-through."
"cutter on the legs lands full at 132 kph, flicks this very wristily but doesn't free the arms to get power behind this trying to launch it over deep midwicket. Haider is stationed perfectly on the rope at cow corner to take this at head height a yard in."

"wide yorker on fifth stump, Fortuin tries to jam this out but misses."

"slower bouncer over off stump, Fortuin shuffles across trying to ramp this over the keeper but misses."
"yorker lands on off stump at 146 kph, Fortuin tries to jam this out in defense but it comes off the edge (and perhaps may have even shaved off stump as well!) before skittling to the third man rope. Definitely wasn't an intentional shot, not played with an open face by any means."
"full and wide, drives hard at this toward extra cover, Faheem makes a clumsy and theatrical dive to knock this back in to keep it to two."
"in the slot on fourth stump, slams a flat drive to long-off."
"pinpoint yorker on middle and leg, toe-jammed out toward long-on."
"slower ball lands full on the legs, keeps the hands back to chip this with a sand wedge over long-on. Didn't even follow through but he's timed this incredibly well."
"knee high full toss on fourth stump, could easily have gone for six but he flubs this trying to muscle it straight down the ground and it bounces well short of long-off."
premeditates the scoop once again and times it perfectly over short fine leg. Got the length he needed from Faheem pitching it full and wide on fifth stump.
"in the slot on leg stump, he got the length he needed to launch it over midwicket but instead he scuffs this flicking it to deep backward square. Fielder could have let it go over the rope for a one-run win but puts in the effort to flick it back and it's relayed in for a single. Faheem makes it interesting but is able to defend 18 (barely) off the final over to clinch a three-run Pakistan win!"
