"good length, cuts in off the seam to find the inside of the bat as he stands in the crease and punches"

well-bowled. Backs away and the bowler follows him with a dipping fuller ball that's been carved away to sweeper cover
"<b>oh, brilliant catch</b>. That's as good a take as you'll ever see. Waller responds to a dipping full toss from outside off by getting down on one knee and heaving a sweep.

<b>in the air and safe!</b> Moor looks to pull and gets a top-edge as he's tucked up. It lands in square leg with a man from the deep running in and midwicket running across. Lands in between both

"74 kph, quick and flat around off, outside-halved to point"
"ooh, what happened there? A stumping missed? Or did the ball hit the stump, it did, <strong>it hit the leg stump with lots of force</strong> but it's a stubborn piece of equipment. Masakadza takes off the bail, weighs it and puts it back. Wow. Tharanga came down to the pitch and inside-halved the ball into his body, it ricocheted back but somehow Tharanga survives"
"what a shot, flight on off, Tharanga clears his front leg and lofts the ball easily over cover"
"poor delivery. Short and wide, slashed through extra cover for four. Was aware that Kusal may come down, but he didn't. The batsmen won that battle"

"128 kph, full delivery on off, pushed to mid-off"
"127 kph, on a length around off, dabbed into the point region"
"and gone. Too many shots from Sri Lanka and they lose one. It's full outside off, he looks to flay a drive through the off side.

"short and wide outside off, 130 kph, Kusal looks to crash a cut through the off side but extra bounce takes it over the bat"

"125 kph, a big appeal, no says the umpire. But Zimbabwe review. They want Mathews. It seemed a tad high, full around off, the ball seams back in, hits Mathews high on the front pad in front of off. No bat on that. Missing the stumps says HawkEye, rising over. <strong>The review is lost</strong>"

The ball lobs away towards cover, who backtracks and keeps his eyes on the ball. The ball pops out of Cremer's hands, but he takes the parry. But has he overstepped? Yikes, nothing behind the line, according to me. A no-ball for me. But he's been given. Hmm. Interesting."

"and Zimbabwe take the game! A slower short delivery outside off, Chameera is completely deceived by the lack of pace, meets the ball too early and the ball lobs to point. Sensational game goes to Cremer and Zimbabwe. It was a clever change in pace, with the batsmen expecting the ball full and straight, but it was an offcutter that flummoxed Chameera, forcing him to make contact much earlier than he expected. Sri Lanka's dismal ODI record in the last few months continues."
