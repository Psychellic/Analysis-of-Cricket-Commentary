"outside off, good length, met cautiously on the front foot"
"tucked to the leg side, they scamper back for the second and this is very tight... off come the bails at the very instant that Marsh slides his bat for the crease.. but he's just home, through benefit of doubt as much as anything. Close!"

"swing and a miss to a full ball outside off, the feet didn't really move"

"back of a length outside off, Plunkett keeps the length short, bobbles off the face towards the keeper"
hint of a leading edge about this as he shapes to play to the leg side
"he's gone now! He knew he had to press the accelerator, he charges out of his crease, nowhere near the ball, has a swing across the line, misses and it's a simple stumping for Buttler"
"not sure he picked that googly, pushing forward and gets a thick inside edge to the leg side"
"nudges a shorter delivery towards midwicket, can't find the gap"
swept from outside off to deep square
"a delicate paddle-sweep, takes this from well wide of off stump, down to fine leg"

cuts this off the stumps straight to point but is able to steal the single
"uses his feet, can't get to the pitch and pushes to cover"

"goes right across the crease, tries to flick this away, does make contact, glances the pad through to Buttler...there's a query for lbw"
"this time he moves outside leg, goes too far, then can't reach a full delivery speared outside off"
"that's why England warm-up with football! Great skills from Woakes. Superb from him all-round, in fact. Firstly he out-smarted White with a slower-ball bouncer which was bottom edged into the crease, Carey came through for the run, Woakes followed through and right-footed into the stumps"

"wide outside off, White swings and gets a toe end down the ground"
"<B>dropped</b> at deep midwicket by Root! Did he lose it in the sun? Got into a horrible tangle. Short of a length, swung strongly, almost straight down Root's throat and he palms it down. Still, only a single"
"this time he's taken at deep midwicket! Roy this time. Good length, bit of pace off, Starc tries to clear the leg side and can't get the distance needed"
"full and straight, superb, driven to mid-on"
"short of a length, connects cleanly as he swings this out to deep midwicket"
"a bouncer, beats him over the top edge as he goes for the pull"
"gets this over the rope! It's a low full toss, he uses his power and thumps it over wide long-on"
"direct hit! Dot ball and a wicket to end. Woakes goes short, Tye bottom edges into the crease, they go for the run, Woakes is quickly on it in his follow through then spins around and hits direct at the non-striker's end"
"outside off, shades of swing, left alone with a flourish"
"swing again, shaping into the right-hander's pads, deflected fine"
"better line, bending into middle and off, and forcefully defended on the front foot"
"flicked off the toes, and <B>scooped up at short midwicket!</B> It was the swing wot won it, aiming straight, looking for the lbw, Roy's bat came swishing across the line but couldn't stay on top of the shot. A good low grab from Finch to lift Australia's spirits"

"full length, outswing, read early and Bairstow's supreme timing comes to the fore to pierce the covers with quick hands"
"jeepers, how did that miss! Fast and full, and Bairstow was beaten for pace, under-edging a defensive push off the toe of his bat and past the off stump!"
"forward again, this is genuinely brisk from Richardson, skidding low from a low trajectory"
punched off the back foot to mid-off. A very fine first over from the new boy
"a long-levered drive into the covers, smothered with a dive"
"short, and pumped with firm forearms through midwicket. That sat up and begged"
dabbed to cover
"a loose full toss outside off. That's a rank delivery from a fine bowler, and Hales picks his spot, behind square on the off side, with a dismissive slap"
"better areas, full and straight with a hint of inswing, but Hales taps and goes, teasing mid-off with a cheeky single"
"width, and steered to point with loose hands"
met on the front foot and pushed to cover
"brisk again, 144.6kph, met on the back foot with a cautious jab"
"drilled to cover, another sharp single to Warner who shies at the non-striker's stumps but to no avail"
"full and straight, cautious defence on the back foot"
"full again and firmly spanked back down the pitch, but Richardson drops his hands on the ball to intercept"
"outside off, and jabbed to point"
"too wide again from Starc, and Hales just uses the pace to glide a cut past point"
"on the back foot, defended with a hop"
"short, and wafted out to deep midwicket, looks as though he opted against a full-blooded mow, with the man back on the rope"
"too short, too wide. Starc is not getting it right often enough in this spell, and Bairstow batters a cut through point. No swing back into the right-hander, so the wider line is a freebie"
"that's sublime. Fuller length, tighter line, drilled through the covers"
"sharp bouncer and that's cracked Bairstow on the side of the grille like a right hook! He's fine, the lid does its job as the ball bobbles into the gully. Actually, it looked like the breastbone on second viewing."
"tight line, defended"
worked into the off side
"tight line, solid defence"
"clobbered through the covers! Pace, but no movement, and the faster it hits the bat, the faster it comes off..."
"outside off, steered down to third man"
guided to midwicket with a roll of the wrists
"round the wicket, too short, too wide, pumped through point. Not a good start"
"round the wicket, aping Root's line on leg stump, and duly defended"

"punched with high elbows to mid-on, thoughts of a second, but not this time"
"forward, and pushed to mid-off"
tidy line and length
"blocked on a middle and leg line, angled into the right hander on a full length"
"good areas once again, bending into the top of the stumps as Hales attempts a squeeze through third man"
"on the back foot, poked to cover"
defended back down the line of the ball. Good tight restrictive line
"over-ptiched and clouted along the ground, through the covers! Excellent opportunistic batting, waiting for the error and cashing in with aplomb!"
"a big appeal but Bairstow is so far down the track that it is guesswork... Smith declines the review, though it might have been tight..."
swept square
"another sweep, finer on this occasion, but it was way outside leg and a no-risk opportunity for the batsman to have a swing"
"pumped in the air, past the diving bowler"
forward and worked out to point

"banged in short and straight, through to the keeper who gives a tap of applause as he gathers"
worked into the off side once more

"fuller and straighter, blocked this time"
"over the wicket this time, tapped out past the diving short cover"
"looped up and dipping outside off, flogged with lots of bottom hand into the leg side"

flicked into the leg side
leaning onto the front foot to defend
another tight line to Bairstow who squares up in defence
"a crazy miscue from Bairstow, suckered by the slower ball, and somehow middled a checked shot, high up and over the cover ring, and almost all the way to the boundary"
short and aggressive. Too short...
a glided drive out to point
"on the back foot, worked to the leg side"
"too short, too wide, too repetitive from Australia's quicks. Interspersing excellent deliveries with rank long-hops, and England are cruising at the moment"
"fuller, straighter, punched to cover"
"worked into the gap, too wide to be a threat"
punched into the covers
"short, and hauled over midwicket with all the time in the world"
eased out to cover
"better ball, leaning forward to defend"
"angled bat, out to midwicket. A curate's egg of an over"
"short, a short-arm pull out to midwicket"
"short again, pulled down and across, rolling the wrists to control the stroke"
"opens the face, guides out to point"
