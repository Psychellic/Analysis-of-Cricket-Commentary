"good length, jags back in immediately to middle and leg. Worked to fine leg to get off the mark"
prodigious movement. The late inswinger darts back in from outside off to off and middle. Baz gets bat down late to flick to wide mid-on
"looking for a big hit but has to improvise. Tight line around off and middle, ED tries to hoick but bailed out and nudged to square leg"
"shimmies down straightaway to put the bowler's length off. Runs down at Bhuvi's inswinger and tries to loft, but a thick outside edge flies to the third man fence"
"all action so far. Good length outside off, Dwivedi steps down but misses a wild heave"
"poor delivery. Bouncer attempted, down leg and wide called"
"poor shot. And Lions are one down. Shortish and wide, there to be hit anywhere but Dwivedi gets his angled bat down late on his cut. A thickish leading edge flies to Boult at third man. Easy catch and the move hasn't worked."
"full down leg, another wide. Some swing for Boult, inswing to the right-hander"
dances down and pummels the drive to Warner at mid-off. Ouch. Somehow Warner stops the drive. All power
"hanging back, waitinjg for a shortish ball but Boult invites the swing by bowling a full inswinger on off, drilled to mid-off"
"full and wide, smashed away for four. A bit of width and Baz frees his arms. Past cover and to the boundary"
"oh my. 142 kph, where was that going? Good length and just outside off. Baz dances down and swings wildly but misses. Are Lions going too hard too early?"
poor delivery and put away. Better from baz. A full toss on the legs and nicely clipped in front of midwicket. Races away.
good comeback. Good length on middle and off. Blocked under his eyes
Raina backs away and misses a lofted drive. It's his first ball. Bhuvi swings one away outside off. Clear intent to go hard in the Powerplay
"fullish on off, better from Raina as he watches it to the last instant before working to square leg"
"overpitched on off, pushed to mid-on"
"fantastic stuff from Dhawan. Stopped a boundary. Short and wide, a loose offering. Baz scythes a cut with immense power and Dhawan scurries across from deep extra cover to deep point and a dive saves the boundary"
"good length outside off, Baz swipes a heave to mid-on. Looked a premeditated stroke because that should have been smashed through the off side"
nicely ended. Yorker outside off is driven to mid-off
"lovely stroke. Full on off, Raina backs away and drives beautifully. A high elbow and straight bat. Warner stops at mid-off"
"gone. Raina plays across this time and pays the price for it. Quite full on off, very similar to the previous ball. This time he is down late on the flick and the ball sneaks past to hit Raina on the back pad. Umpire Erasmus very quick to raise the finger, looked out too. Poor shot selection against the outswingers of Boult."
"better. Fullish on middle and leg, more inswing to the right-hander. Blocked"
"shot! Shot of the day. Full and wide outside off, Dk lunges forward and creams the cover drive. Beautiful."
back of a length on the hips and tickled to short fine leg
"rather full again outside off, a mis-timed drive finds mid-off"
"slower ball to start, 122 kph on off and Baz blocks"
Warner stops another boundary. A half-volley outside off and Baz drills another drive to mid-off
very well played. Waited for the slower delivery to come to him before playing his pull early to get the length delivery behind square. Well executed
"ooh beauty. Fullish and just outside off, Baz is cut in half as the inswinger beats him"
"yikes. Full and down leg, big wide. Lots of swing though"
nice bowling. Sees BM coming and bangs one short and wide. Baz ignores
poor delivery. Drifts down leg and McCullum lays into it. Uses his wristy power to flick over short fine leg. Landed half a foot in front of the boundary
"86 kph, flat slider to start from Bipul. DK backed away but defended"
"slower outside off, a hint of turn. Pushed to cover"
"that's not a bad delivery. Flat on off, DK manufactures the stroke by walking across and flat-batting a sweep behind square. Didn't bother keeping it down, nice."
"another darter on off, pushed to long-off"
"slowish pace on off and middle, Baz waits before turning to square leg for one"
"quite flat outside off, bunted into the off side"
starts with a good length delivery on off. Baz opens the face to slice to third man. Wellplayed
sees DK coming and bangs one in on middle and leg. Pulled to midwicket with bad timing
"130 kph bouncer on middle and leg, Baz bails out of a pull"
slower delivery and smashed. Knew the field and executed well. Too much width despite it being short. Baz muscles the flat-batted loft over mid-off. On the bounce
"low full toss on leg, clipped to midwicket for an easy run"
"good length delivery on leg, easily worked to deep square leg for a run"
superb. A slower ball on off but DK runs down and opens the bat face and uses his wrists to find the gap at cover with a well-timed cover drive. Lovely batting

"back of a length on middle and leg, a swivel pull to deep square leg. Timing em well is DK"

"well bowled. Really slow through the air, not much spin. Blocked"
"flatter this time on leg, Baz shuffles across and works to deep square leg"
"shot! Long-hop on off, Karthik rocked back and pulled in the gap at wide long-on. Played that at the right time to get it in the gap"
"should have been out. Cutting misjudged that totally. Tossed up on middle, Karthik shimmies down and flicks uppishly straight to deep midwicket. Cutting ran across and was at least a few feet inside the boundary. The ball evades his stretched hands and clears the boundary."
gone. Karthik is run out. He isn't too happy with Baz. Shortish outside off and a thick outside edge goes straight to Boult at short third man who picks up and fires an accurate throw at the strikers end. Even a full-length dive cannot save DK. End of a promising innings. Some miscommunication with McCullum
"tossed up and straight, pushed back"
"back of a length on leg, pushed to cover for a quick single. McCullum labours through for one"
"fullish outside off, keeps low. Bunted to cover"
"some swing. Fullish and wide outside off, driven to cover"

leg side-ish and easily played to fine leg
"not short enough but Finch manufactures a stroke. Helped by the line, leg stump and Finch rocks into his pull and sends it to the backward square leg boundary"
"what a shot. That was full and wide, Finch reaches out for it and lofts the drive with so much power that it clears the long-off boundary with ease. Immense power"
"good length outside off, tapped to point"
"a slower cutter outside off, angled to point. Two dot balls after two boundaries"

"a good yorker outside off, sneaks past Finch's bat"
"flat on leg, worked to short midwicket for an easy run"
"big shot, miscued. Flat on leg, Finch comes down and skews the swipe to long-on off the inside half"
"pulled to wide long-on, too short from Bipul"
"should have been the keeper's catch but <b>Sran drops a dolly</b>. Flat on leg, Finch top-edges his sweep-pull and the ball goes straight up. The keeper backtracks, but Sran sets up for an easy catch at short fine leg. Goes through the reverse-cupped hands"
""
"gone this time. Straight to deep cover. Bhuvi takes the catch. Tossed up on leg, the ball spins a touch and McCullum runs down and skews the cover drive off the outside half this time. Straight to deep cover. Eerie similarity to his dismissal in the last game"
"shortish delivery on leg, Smith is through his pull too early and gloves towards the keeper"
"good length delivery outside off, punched to the sweeper cover"
"good length outside off, smashed on the bounce to cover. Bounces off Henriques' wrists at cover but Warner cleans up"
"another one goes. Awful shot. Short and wide, Smith could have done anything with that but was insistent on cutting it in the air. Can't keep it down or find the gap and straight to Dhawan at deep point."
nagging lines around off and pushed to cover from the back foot
not short enough but Finch goes through with the pull. Sneaks past his cross-bat to strike him on the side
"short and wide, scythed away in front of point for a couple"
nicely steered. Opens the bat face to guide a fullish delivery to third man
"just wide of cover and to the boundary. Shortish delivery outside off is slapped uppishly, but just in front of cover. Hooda runs across from wide long-off to stop but doesn't do enough as the ball trickles into the boundary"
"no stopping from Finch. Full on leg, and Finch clears his front foot. Thereafter he goes after a heave and connects. Huge six over midwicket. Massive"
well-executed yorker outside off. Finch misses
"four more. All muscle, all power from Finch. MH drops short on middle and Finch latches onto the length with a cross-batted swat. Got it in front of deep midwicket too. On the bounce"
"fullish length on off, pushed to long-on"
"mis-timed and almost carries the distance. In fact it did carry but Cutting leapt over the boundary to stop the six. Leaping over the midwicket boundary, he caught it and threw it back in while in the air. But deep square leg couldn't scurry around to get across. Fantastic piece of work from Cutting"
"fullish on middle and leg, driven to long-on"
"slowish short delivery on middle, helped across to backward square leg"
"overpitched on off and middle, drilled to long-on again"

"overpitched on middle, worked away to midwicket again."
"131 kph, very full outside off. Mis-timed to long-off"
"slower ball outside off. In fact, it was so wide that it was past the tramline but Finch premeditated the scoop and went across. Tried to improvise a cut but missed that too"
"short and wide with third man up. Not clever. Finch just upper cuts, gets enough bat to get the ball over a leaping short third man"
"oh yes. One of the shots of the day. Overpitched on off, Finch stood in his crease and with his head right over the ball, pushed a muscular drive to the long-off boundary with power I can't describe. Fantastic"
"slowish delivery on off, inside-edged towards square leg"
"137 kph, full delivery outside off. Skewed to long-on"

"nicely hit. Full on off and middle, Jadeja presents the straight bat and lofts the drive over his partner and to the long-off fence"
"low full toss, clipped to midwicket. Finch tries to steal an overthrow after the ball hits Naman's pads but cannot"
"slower yorker on off, 125 kph. Driven to cover"
"no no. Sran again, sloppy work. Good length down leg after following a backing-away Finch. Somehow, he gets a pull to fine leg after being hustled for pace. Sran runs across but lets the ball go through his legs."
"whoa. Bowled im, an inside edge onto the body and then onto the stumps. A full toss down leg again. finch backed away again. Instead of putting the offering into the midwicket stands, the ball ricochets off Finch's body and clatters into the stumps. Very important wicket at this stage"
drifts down leg first up from around the wicket and Bravo tickles it to the fine leg boundary. Easily done
nice bouncer. Well-directed on leg and Bravo sways away hurriedly

low full toss and smashed to long-on. Dhawan returns the throw to the bowlee who fumbles and allows Jadeja to get three. The throw to the bowler again wasn't god either and Jadeja tried to come back for the fourth. What is happening?
"fullish and wide, played away into the off side"
"slower legcutter outside off, Dhawal misses. Decent end"

"nice shot. Fullish and wide outside off, Dhawan presses forward to punch to cover."
strays down leg. Pings off the pad to square leg for an extra
could be out? A direct hit at the bowler's end and the third umpire is called for. Good length delivery is pushed to cover and Dhawan sets off for an unnecessary run. The fielder picks up and effects a direct hit to find Dhawan a foot short. There was no run there. Fantastic fielding by McCullum

"slower ball outside off, pushed to extra cover for a quick run. Well played"
strays down leg for an extra

"slower delivery on MH's pads, easily whipped to square leg"

"back of a length on leg, Yuvraj clips to short fine leg"
