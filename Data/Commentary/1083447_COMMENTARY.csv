"Three men follow the swirling ball on the leg side. Mushfiq, who has the big gloves, calls for it. Runs after the ball, tumbles, and pouches it safely. This was the cutter again from Mashrafe. Hip-high cutter, going away outside off, 118ks. Danushka does not spot the change-up again. He pulls early and splices the ball over square leg.
