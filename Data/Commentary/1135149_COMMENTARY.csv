length ball on middle stump. Skids straight through and he stabs it into the leg side with soft hands
"<b>off the mark.</b> Brathwaite as watchful as ever. Allows this straight length ball to come on and hurriedly jabs it wide of mid-on, who is quite close in"
"good length and swing into the batsman, who has his front leg out of the way to tap this into the leg side"

batsman aware of the shape this time. Has already shuffled back and across as this swings into his pads and he dabs it to leg gully
oh well done. Shape into the corridor and Brathwaite watches it very closely to ensure it's causing no harm to his stumps. Leaves it alone
"<b>jabs</b> it to leg gully's right. Big inswinger at a length again. He's shuffled a long way again. This strategy might work as long as the ball is new, it's doing too much to cause an lbw danger for now"
"length on the stumps, tapped away into the off side"
"<b>what a ball!</b> Followed by an excited appeal from Sri Lanka for caught behind. Lakmal angles it into the corridor. Brathwaite, watchful as always, fails to get far enough forward to get close to this as it jags away off the pitch Ends up getting beaten on the outside edge. Sri Lanka won't review. The sound was the ball brushing the back pad"
"<b>beaten again.</b> Short of a length outside off, plays inside the line once more and can't get close"
"behind this one. Probing away in the channel, is Lakmal. Brathwaite gets an angled bat on it this time"
"<b>got him!</b> Lakmal, you gorgeous fella. Completely shattered Brathwaite's mental resolve. He's been jumping around to tackle Gamage's inswinger and suddenly he has four going away from his batting box outside off. Tentative once more. Jabs at this one, the fullest of all the inswingers so far. There is bounce on it and the outside edge carries comfortably through"

"short of a length on leg stump, some shape down. Tickles the pad on the way to the keeper as he looks to glance this"
big swing away. Is he controlling it? Hard to say. Starts outside off at a length and goes a long way away. Left aloe
"<b>sliced away</b> but with little control. Full outswinger from Gamage in the corridor. Smith's front foot stride is minuscule. The ball's aerial, but wide enough of point to beat him to his left"
<b>beaten.</b> Hangs the bat out with a half-stride that hasn't landed before the ball has. Fizzes past the outside edge
"full on off stump, looks to drive down the ground. That shy forward stride lets him down again. It's an inside edge into the leg side"

<B>now we're talking.</b> Steep lift off the surface from Lakmal. Into the corridor from back of a length. Making him play because of the angle. His bat is inside the line though and that's beaten the outside edge
"<b>direct hit.</b> Chandimal from cover has sprinted across to his right and broken down the stumps at the striker's end. It was another inswinger, dabbed with soft hands into the off side. Smith does not ground his bat. Plonks it in lazily and just makes it. That would have been a disgusting way to go on your Test comeback. Some would say deserved. But he has survived. Nice work from Sri Lanka's captain."

"outswinger dug in at a length, wide outside off, left alone"
<b>is there an edge?</b> No. Just past the outside edge. Nicely worked by Gamage. Floats this one up. It's still wide enough to be left but the trajectory draws Powell into trying a drive through the covers. Front foot non-existent and he's almost falling over by the end

"<b>Smith's gone!</b> Survived a close run out call earlier, won't do so this time. And once again, you've got to say, that's a lazy effort from him. But was it a good call in the first place? Powell nudged this to midwicket's left who sprinted and fired in a rocket throw right next to the stumps. Smith's stretch to get in lacks any thrust. he's short by an inch"

<b>chases and he's gone!</b> By far the most harmless delivery after lunch. Short and wide outside off. Hurries through a square drive off the back foot and gets a thick outside edge. But there might be hope for him. Gamage appears to have overstepped...<b>yes!</b> No-ball.

That's the first sign of a ball not rising as much as expected. It's generally been steep bounce so far"
ooooohhh tempting. Floaty half-volley just outside off. Tries to draw him in but he resists the temptation and lets it go
another tempter. Short and very wide. Won't take it on with the cut

"this is top quality cricket. Lakmal zooms one into the corridor with all the usual ingredients - angle in, movement away, decent pace. But this one looks like it's landed on the seam and taken off. Chase has been defending those so far but makes the right decision to let this go. Superb viewing."
