"<strong>Pollard makes a deserved breakthrough! </strong>Not a great shot from Perera though. Another one of those offcutters with a little bit of overspin, angled across and leaving the left-hander. Perera gets low and tries to heave this into the next century over midwicket, but he's playing against the angle and the turn, so to speak, and because there's overspin on this ball, there's a little extra bounce. It takes his top edge and flies into the keeper's gloves. Pollard's been fishing for that dismissal since last over."

"and then, err, a mistake. Not sure there was anything in that ball to worry Mendis, the way he was batting. But he's out either way. This is a bouncer, at around shoulder height, and Mendis tries to pull again - a shot he had played to excellent effect - but then he can't get over the top of this one, and he mis-hits it in the air.

"good length on middle, and hammered to deep midwicket, but only a single on offer"
"full toss, outside off, and he slices an attempted lofted drive. Ball rolls away to cover"
"<b>innovative!</b> Holder goes full and wide, but Hasaranga runs across towards the tramlines and opens the leg side completely. Flicks the wrists to hit it over deep backward square"
"<B>over mid off!</b> Back of a length on off, and he makes room before flat-batting it over the infield"
<B>middle stump clattered</b> as Hasaranga runs across exposing his stumps. Misses the flick while Holder nails the yorker
"back of a length on off, and he can't connect with the shot. They run across to try and steal a bye, but the throw from the keeper to Holder is good enough. Sandakan's halfway back when the TV umpire says its out"
"full outside the tramlines, and Udana can't connect. Wide called"
"<B>Pollard takes another catch</b> and Holder gets another wicket. Low full toss outside off, and he looks to go over long off. Doesn't have the distance however. <B>Sri Lanka 307 all out</b>"
"length ball on the stumps to start, no obvious movement. Defended back down the pitch."
length a little outside off. Poked towards point.
"slightly shorter, and closer into the stumps. Driven straight to mid off."
length on about off stump. Seemed to stop on Hope a touch. Defended into the covers.
"fuller, in the channel once more. Just a touch of seam movement this time, but that's no issue for Hope, who bunts it into the offside again."
"maiden to start! Sri Lanka's new-ball bowlers have been very stingy this series, and Pradeep makes another good start. This is a length ball outside off. Not wide enough to cut. Not full enough to drive. Hope only defends."
"short of a length, on the pads. Turned into the legside off the inside half of the bat, and as it dribbles off between midwicket and point, they take a single"
"<b>beaten</b>. This is length outside off, and there is a touch of away swing. Hope plays and misses."
"length outside off stump, pushed into a gap around the cover region and there's a run there"
"length on off stump, defended to cover"
"fuller, outside off stump but still in the channel. Ambris gets over this one and defends it to leg"
"fuller and in the channel again, defended once more. Another cheap over."
"hint of shape away from the right-hander for Pradeep now. This is a fullish ball, defended to cover by Hope"
"length ball, in that channel again. There's really been only one ball so far that's not been in the channel. Hope drives this on the up, without a lot of power, but far enough away from mid off to allow a single"
"strays into the pads for the first time. Ambris turns this around the corner to fine leg, but there's a scrambling save there from Thisara Perera that prevents a boundary"
"length on the stumps, defended to leg"
"floated up on to the pads, clipped away nicely by Ambris who bisects mid on and midwicket. Hasaranga tracks it down and keeps it to two"
"fuller, a bit of away-movement in the air again, but not much. Ambris just defends this to off"
"back of a length, on the pads. Tucked away in front of square leg for a couple."
"fuller and outside off stump, in the channel again. Driven with modest power to mid off"
"<strong>a big shot from Hope!</strong>. Again length in the channel, and he launches it high over mid off. He got under it a little too much though, so it goes higher rather than further. Gets a couple as the mid off runs back and reels it in a few metres from the rope"
"beautifully struck. The first boundary for West Indies. This is full and on the toes, and Hope gets his head over it, turns his wrists and flicks it in front of midwicket. It goes along the ground the whole way, whizzing all the way to the boundary."
"length outside off. Hope hits this firmly to cover, who fumbles it and allows a single"
"big swing across the line to this length ball just outside off. Ambris collects only fresh air though, and it whistles through to the keeper just past that off stump. A few Lankan hands go to heads."
"length in the channel, defended into the offside. I should copy/paste this line for when Pradeep is bowling."
"or maybe not... Hope is done just waiting for the bad balls. He runs at Pradeep this time, who sort of sees him coming and bowls at the pads. But Hope has made enough room, and he drills it past the bowler, in the air, and all the way to the fence"
"shorter ball, into the body. Hope gets inside the line and shovels it over his shoulder to fine leg. There's enough time for a second."
"on the pads again, and turned to square leg, where Sandakan makes a diving stop and keeps it to one"
"length outside off, defended back to the bowler"
"floated up on the toes, flicked in the air, but far away from the square leg fielder. Fine leg runs around to cut that off and the batsmen take two"
"length on off stump, driven to mid off"
"tighter into the stumps this time, and Hope whacks it to mid on, but not with a lot of power, so there's time to take a single"
"length, in the channel, poked straight to mid off"
"fuller and wider, and perhaps Ambris should have made more of that. He throws his bat at it and drives it far enough away from mid off for a single, but when you're chasing 307, those kinds of balls probably need to be put away"
"<b>edged</b>, but past the wide slip. This is length outside off. Hope tries to push it to cover, gets a thickish edge and it races away to the third man boundary."
"<b>yeeeesh</b>. That's more like it from Hope. He plays a checked cover drive, on the up. Timed so sublimely that no one moves as it scorches through the infield and on to the boundary."
"floated up again, and this time Ambris latches on to this one. He shuffles across to get close enough to the ball, which is pitched outside off, and he uses his wrists to launch that over midwicket for four."
"into the midriff. Pradeep pitches this shorter, and hits Ambris, who misses with a swivel pull"
"length in the channel, defended back to the bowler"
this is pulled away ferociously - a throat high ball outside off stump - but Lakshan Sandakan runs around at fine leg and manages to cut it off. A fantastic shot for just one.
"length on the pads, gets it into a gap towards deep midwicket, and Hope calls early enough and runs hard enough to get a couple"
"short of a length outside off, a little bit of away-movement off the seam. Hope wafts and misses."
"short of a length, into the thigh. Ambris tries to tuck this around the corner, but misses, and it hits his thigh pad. Trickles away to fine leg and they take the leg bye"
"length on the legs, clipped towards deep midwicket for a single"
"Ambris is early on this shot. Not the first time we've seen this tonight. Length on the stumps, a 125kph delivery. Ambris spoons this up over the bowler after getting through his drive too soon. They think about a run but decide against"
"shy at the stumps! This is played to leg and there's a little bit of miscommunication, but they sort themselves out early enough that they get back safely"
"length outside off, just pushed into the infield towards cover"
"fullish, on the stumps, flicked away towards deep square leg for one"
"starts with a full ball on the pads, which is flicked away to deep midwicket for a couple"
"fullish again, but on off stump. Ambris tries to launch this with turned wrists over midwicket, but doesn't connect as he wants to. Still gets it to the deep midwicket area for a couple."
"boom! First six of the innings, and Ambris is getting going. Overpitched just outside off from Udana, and Ambris launches that over long on for six. Just clean hitting through the line."
"slower ball, 99kph, back of the hand. Ambris' eyes light up again, but he's through the shot very early, misses"
"length ball on off stump, turned to midwicket"
"another slower one, 113kph. Ambris again gets fooled and tries to go for a big heave, but it barely gets up to knee height and passes under his bat to the keeper"
"full, wide of the stumps. Hope crunches this into the off side, but Avishka Fernando at cover is all over that, diving and cutting it off. A saved four."
"length on off stump, and hope gets beautifully inside the line and turns this behind square on the legside, to get the ball to run away for four. Super wrists."
"length ball outside off, defended back to the bowler."
length ball outside off. Defended
"length on about middle stump, flicked to deep square leg for a single"
"Ambris goes aerial down the ground again! No risk with that shot, because it's still inside the Powerplay and there are no fielders out. He gets a slightly overpitched ball outside off, and launches this back over the bowler's head. It lands a few metres from the boundary and bounces away towards the sightscreen. An outstanding finish to the initial fielding restrictions for WI."

"another short one, though not quite as short. Outside off again. Pollard bends backwards and lets that past"

"slower ball, 104kph. This is length on off, and Pollard defends it"
"almost a yorker. Low full toss in the end. This is the quicker one, and Pollard just digs it out. If he's come out early to provide fireworks, he hasn't tried to light the wick yet."
"tossed up hugely, but dipping on Pooran, who can only drive it to mid off"
"<strong>ohhhh</strong> what's happened there? Tossed up massively again. So many revs on this. And it pitches on leg, completely beats Pooran who is trying to heave it down the ground, spins past the inside edge, past the leg stump, completely deceives Kusal Perera as well, and skips away for byes"

Pollard doesn't want that to happen, but Sri Lanka have been allowed the review because of the confusion in the middle.

"full toss on Pollard's pads, and he doesn't miss out. Whips it as behind square as he can, and beats the diving Mathews at square leg"
"full outside off stump, the ball goes beyond the tram-lines, but Udana gets leeway since Pollard had walked across. Would've been a wide otherwise"
"full, and too wide this time. Nearly off the pitch! Pollard doesn't move and happily takes the wide run"
"full, outside off, and clobbered to wide long off, where Shanaka cleans up"
"fullish, very wide outside off, and Pollard slaps this comfortably in front of square. Picks the slower ball and deposits it over cover"
"<B>Mathews gets another breakthrough!</b> Length ball, angling into the stumps, and Pollard skies this attempted swipe. Ball in the air, and Udana runs in to take a diving catch near short midwicket. Massive wicket! Pollard falls just short of 50...."
"good length, on middle, and he stays rooted in his crease before pulling over square leg for four"
"good length, outside off. Tries to punch through cover, but inside edged instead. Keeper dives well to his left to stop it from squirting away for four"
"good length, outside off, and runs it down to short third man. Calls for the single early"
"full outside off, and pushed to long off"
"full, outside off stump. Clobbered to long off"
"full and wide, and Allen throws his hands at this. Drives uppishly, and it's flown off the bat's face! Over extra cover for half a dozen..."
"good length, outside off, and he walks across before clubbing the ball to deep midwicket. The second run is taken very swiftly"
"full, on off, and driven with the bat's open face in the gap near deep point. Another comfortable double"
"<B>that shoulder looks fine!</b> Full outside off, and he slices this along the ground, past third man, for another four. Fifteen off the over already..."
"Udana finishes the over well. Full and wide, his trusted line, and the ball goes under the batsman's blade"
"<B>Mathews turning it on!</b> Good length, on off, and he looks to deposit this over cow corner. Not off the bat's middle, and the fielder at deep midwicket takes a comfortable catch, fairly inside the boundary line. Replays show Mathews bowled the cutter there..."
"full, outside off, and he drags this to the right of deep midwicket, who has a lot of ground to cover. Does well to stop the four"
"full, outside off, and Allen goes for a big one. Not the best connection, and the ball's in the air for eternity. Eventually goes just beyond Mendis at long on"
<B>dropped by the keeper?</b> Surely looks so with Allen edging this slow and wide ball. Perera dived to his right and got fingertips to it. Hit the outside of his right glove...
"full, outside off, and he goes for a leg-side swipe. Under edged to the keeper"
"good length, on middle, and flat-batted to long on for a walking single"
"full and wide, and edged to point for a single"
"misses the yorker, is a low full toss. Drubbed to long on, and Allen wants to get back strike. Walsh is running to the danger end, and Perera collects the throw to whip the bails off. The umpires go upstairs, but replays confirm that Walsh is out. He did dive, but he fell short by around half an inch. Great throw from Shanaka, the substitute fielder. Good thing for West Indies is that Allen remains on strike"
"<B>and that's why Allen came back on strike!</b> Full, outside off, in the slot and he smacks it over the bowler's head for six! All 98 metres of that... over the sight screen. WI need 15 off 9"
"full on middle, and muscled to long off. Allen wants two again, and looks like Chase is run out for a zero-ball duck because the throw from the deep is accurate again!"
"full toss on middle, and flicked to deep midwicket"
"full toss, on middle, and thumped to deep midwicket"
"<B>what a start!</b> Short and wide, and Allen tees up before flat-batting over cover"
"<B>is that six? No! Caught at deep midwicket</b> In the slot on middle, and Allen goes for the biggie over the leg side. But it's not got the connection he was looking for, and taken by the fielder riding the boundary line"
"good length, outside off. Wild swing from Sheldon, but he can't make the connection..."
"good length, outside off, but too far wide reckons the umpire"
"good length, and outside off again. Cottrell wants to go for the big one, but can't connect again"
"full, on off, and he flicks behind square. They settle for a single"
<B>Sri Lanka clinch a nail biter!</b> Another full and wide ball that Cottrell can't connect with. Mathews is ecstatic and so is coach Mickey Arthur
