"good length ball on middle, Rahane defends and then opens the face to see if he can get any runs at point. Nope."
"ooh, inside edge gets Rahane and Pune off the mark. He prepares to a cover drive, but pulls it off the stove too early. The bat turns in his hand and the good length ball angled across him ends up 180 degrees off target"
"nudges to long leg, a more measured stroke, to a ball on the pads"
"feels offput by McClenaghan's pace as Tripathi, stuck on the crease, gets struck on the thighs by a back of a length ball. Promptly puts Rahane in the firing line"
"full, with a hint of inswing, and that sends the ball down the leg side. Rahane's flick can't reach that far"
"gorgeous strike down the ground, but his India team-mate at the top of the order, and Mumbai captain today, puts in a fine effort to keep that only to a single."
"off for a duck, for the first time in the season! Tripathi digs his bat into the turf as he walks away, after it fails him against a scary old inswinger. McClenaghan is rapid. And he's pitched this right up, at a place where the hairs on back of a batsman's neck flare up in fear. Tripathi, in panic mode, flicks all around the delivery, and looks back to see his stumps in disarray"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks to cover"
a lovely little whip sends a shortish delivery outside off away through midwicket. Lovely balance and strong wrists.
"loads up a back foot cover drive, and for some reason, it seems like he is into the shot a tad too early. Has to adjust in his followthrough to get a single"
waits for the ball to come at his pads and then clips it through square leg
"and the captain's gone too! A leading edge soars up into the night sky and then comes down in Hardik's hands as if he were serenading it all through. Smith walks off, wondering how his strength could fail him. He was looking to take a back of a length ball just a tad outside off stump for a party at deep square leg. But he mistimes it so badly."
"glides a shortish delivery to the left of point, but Hardik ensures he doesn't let it pass him."
rises with the delivery on off stump and runs it down to point
blocks a shortish delivery on off stump to point
heaves it over deep midwicket. Wow! He doesn't play these shots. He hides them even in the nets. But here he takes the good length ball and bulldozes it
"and this is all grace. Even if the front foot didn't quite come down the line, the bat comes down lovely and straight and then directs the ball through the gap at cover."
"shifts around the wicket for a searing, full delivery on middle and leg. Rahane uses the pace and works it to deep square leg"
"fuller delivery outside off, Rahane looks for the on the up drive through cover but finds himself with an inside edge towards mid-on. Is there not enough pace on this pitch?"
starts with a bit of freebie - a length ball on leg stump - but Tiwary flicks straight to short fine leg
"gets good bounce as he hits the deck on off stump, Rahane works it off his hips behind square leg"
""
soft hands slots the shortish delivery in front of cover point
"looks to punch a shortish delivery down the ground, but Bumrah makes this nip in off the deck just enough to beat the middle and get the inside edge. Quick single taken"
"gets up off his toes to flick a shortish delivery on off stump through midwicket, only for the leading edge pops out. Tiwary's heart rate would have popped up as well, but the ball went through the unmanned gully region."
"tosses it up outside off, makes him reach out to try and block. A little outside edge results"
"slips in the googly on middle and off, Tiwary lunges forward to block and gets the inside edge this time"
good shot. Steps down the pitch to turn a good length ball into a full toss. Finds a single to deep midwicket
"threads the needle. He steps forward, and outside leg, positioned perfectly for the overpitched delivery meant to cramp him. Then out comes a glorious drive and he places it to the right of the short cover fielder"
turns it past short midwicket
darts out of the crease to flick a full delivery through the right of midwicket
startled by the ball not coming onto the bat. Tiwary is about an age too early on the flick. The leading edge results but lands safely to the right of the bowler
"offcutter on off stump, Tiwary spots it, defends it with soft hands, and pinches a single"
turns a back of a length delivery on middle to short midwicket
"change of pace again, and though the batsman is aware of it, he can only hit to to one of the many fielders inside the ring. Today's winner, midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, carves it to point. Top work from Simmons, diving quickly to his left. That would have been four without him"
"another slower delivery on off stump, taps it through midwicket"
"tosses it up on middle and off, Rahane pats it down the ground to long-on"
"he's had enough of edging and nudging. Races down the track and exploits the short, straight boundaries. Easy to do once you reach the pitch of the ball"
"good length ball, with enough flight to make him reach in front of his body a bit, Tiwary blocks"
"this is a flatter delivery on middle and leg, Tiwary pushes to long-off"
leans over the tossed up delivery on off stump and flicks it to long-on
"expects the legbreak as he lunges forward to block, but this one holds its line and takes the inside edge towards short midwicket. Good bowling. And if we want to see more, we'll have to wait for the time out to end"
"quick, flat and on off stump, Rahane turns it to short midwicket"
"steps down the pitch to nail the inside out cover drive, but Krunal's drift cramps him. The inside edge comes out and the bowler dives to his right and collides with the non-striker. Nothing serious though. Both men come up with smiles"
clips it through to deep square leg
"shortish delivery, outside off, dabs it to short ht"
"pulls out a reverse sweep, but the ball is on leg stump, and so he has no leverage. Finds short third man"
"full and quick on off stump, drives to cover. There's only been <b>three runs off the last 10 balls</b>"
"you're going to pay for that last over, says Rahane, as he charges out of his crease, and bullies a good length ball outside off until it hides in the crowd over long-off"
"back of a length on middle and leg, turns it through to deep square leg"
"goes for the short ball, outside off, Tiwary waits on it and pulls to long leg"
"looks to nurdle a shortish delivery on off stump, but this pitch being slower, means Rahane can only get an inside edge onto pad. Single towards point"
"good length ball, just outside off, Tiwary is on the move, looking to defend, when the ball catches the inside edge and hurries away to the long leg boundary"
"moves wide the crease, but the length is there for the drive and Tiwary nails it, over the cover fielder."
"gets into the reverse sweep, but it only amounts to a single as Bumrah stays alert at short third man"
"well bowled. He seems to always know when the batsman wants to attack him. Like a weird Spidey Sense. Pulls his length back and Tiwary, coming down the pitch, is stranded and can only block"
turns a fuller delivery on middle through midwicket
clips a flatter delivery on leg stump through square leg
heaves a shortish delivery from outside off over to deep midwicket
pats a shortish delivery through midwicket
"a slow,  dipping full toss outside off, gently guides it to extra cover."

gets down the track and drills a good length delivery to long-off
"full on off stump, squeezes it out to deep point"
works a good length delivery on off stump to long-on
"good shot. For once, Krunal gives the ball a little air and Tiwary slogs it over wide long-on. The bat turns in his hand as he makes connection, but there is still enough power in the shot"
"strides out of his crease, a touch too early, and that allows Krunal to bowl it quicker, and a lot flatter."
whips a full delivery sliding down the pads to long leg
doesn't account for the back spin! McClenaghan at deep square leg races to his left to get behind a hard-hit sweep. But the ball pitches a few feet in front of him and breaks past his right side
goes back and flicks it through to long-on to bring up his second fifty of the season
the legbreak is dropped short and Rahane pulls it between deep midwicket and square leg
"flatter deliveyr on off stump, Rahane rocks back and flicks it to the right of long-on"
"this is pressure. It shouldn't be on Mumbai, but on this occasion, they do stumble. Krunal, running in from deep midwicket, has to race in to stop the batsmen taking two. Rahane had flicked the ball softly with that express purpose. And he gets what he wants as the throw coming in from the deep is off target and there is no one backing up"
"he's struck in line! Rahane doesn't quite pick the googly, planting his front leg on off stump, and flicking around it. The ball turns in and nails him on the knee-roll and gives the umpire a straightforward decision to make"
goes back to a flatter delivery outside off and pushes it towards cover
"this one comes into the right-hander too, and Dhoni doesn't read the variation. He's looking to block on off stump and the ball grips the pitch and comes up to hit his back thigh"
"back of a length and outside off, steers it to deep third man"
"takes on a short ball, coming up to his chest, with a hook to long leg"
"steps down the pitch, but Bumrah shortens his length. Tiwary mistimes the flat-batted strike to cover. A misfield gets him the run he wants"
"back of a length on middle, Dhoni covers it with a nudge to long-on"
"loads of offcut in this ball, and Tiwary doesn't quite account for it. Looks for the glide to third man and is lucky not to play on"
stays deep in his crease and isn't really in the best position to handle this fuller than good length delivery on off stump. He's reaching out in front of his body to block and gets an inside edge onto pad. Dhoni drags him for the run
"stays back to a good length ball and punches to point. No single there, says Dhoni"
strides down the pitch and drives a fuller delivery past short cover's right
"into the stands! Sprints out of his crease, manufactures a leg-stump half-volley and launches it over deep midwicket"
"goes back, sensing the shortish delivery on off stump, but blocks to short cover"
"that backlift soars up high over his shoulder, and Karn is aware of the punishment coming his way. Slips in the quick, legbreak on off stump and Dhoni has to block"

punches a flatter delivery outside off to long-off
"slows it up and tosses it up on off stump, Tiwary, from deep in his crease, reluctantly comes forward and pushes to short cover"
"good length ball outside off, taps it to point"
works a flatter delivery on leg stump to long-on
pushes it down to long-off
sweeps a fuller delivery outside off to deep square leg. And so Krunal finishes the spell with only two boundaries in the game and an economy-rate of 5ish.
"it's a bouncer first up, angling into the right-hander. Dhoni goes for the hook, but he is simply beaten for pace and bounce."
"back of a length on middle and off, Dhoni tries to flick, but only manages an inside edge onto pad. McClenaghan doesn't want any of his efforts to go in vain so he fields the ball himself and earns a dot"
"tries to pummel a shortish delivery on off stump over the leg side, but he doesn't get enough power going. Single to long-on"
"looks to slog a back of a length delivery, but it's coming on to him too quickly. Hits the splice as well and gets only a single to deep midwicket"
"steps out of his crease, but it's a short delivery, digging into the middle of the pitch, and cramping Dhoni for the one thing he wants - room. He inside edges the ball on off stump to deep square leg"
"slides a back of a length delivery down the leg side. He's lucky to get away with only a wide considering Tiwary was setting up for the scoop. Oh wait, umpire Ravi's not called it"
"hustles him with another short ball, and the pull shot comes out all wonky. Pollard at midwicket moves to his right, dives, but can't get under the ball. Good effort to try and convert a half-chance"
"slogs at a good length ball at 141 kph and gets it down to deep square leg. The fielder runs around to his left, and while sliding to stop the ball, his feet touched the rope."
spins around for an lbw appeal as Bumrah gets a good length ball to skid onto the right-hander. Tiwary flicks and finds his thighs bruising and his bat of no use. Too high for the lbw
"bangs it in just outside off, Dhoni goes for a pull, and basically looks like a rusty gate as he is beaten"
"too quick, and not enough room to leverage the shortish delivery over midwicket. The ball actually goes right over middle and off stump"
"back of a length on off stump, Dhoni slogs and gets an inside edge to deep square leg"
"looks to lap sweep a full delivery, but the angle into him, cramping him is no help. Tiwary gets an inside edge, and is also hit on the leg and he limps across for a single"
"gets the beamer away! And that's his fifty as well. A full toss from around the wicket, over the waist, and the batsman pulls it to the left of long leg"
"gives him length, gives him width, and is taken for the maximum. He's been on song all night, but this cross-seamer was awful. Tiwary belts it down the ground"
"full on off stump, Tiwary clatters it down to long-on"
spears in a yorker and it zips through the feet of Dhoni as he tries a flick. Box-office bowling against a box office player
"launches it over deep midwicket, so many many miles. Dhoni is camped deep in his crease and he gets a length ball outside off. Takes full toll. Gleefully"
"goes for the slower ball, pitching it short and trying to hide it from Dhoni's reach outside off. But he overdoes it"
"goes for the short, slow and wide delivery again and Dhoni ignores it to collect the wide"
"loads up the big shot again, and this ball is there to be smashed. Length and outside off. But he misses altogether."
"it's heading for the Pune dugout. There's so much height on this, but Wankhede is a tiny ground, and this just lobs over the fielder at long-on. Rohit does valiantly to keep it in, leaping back and for his trouble landing on a few water bottles and the ice-box"
"it's that dipping slower ball, and Tiwary, from deep in his crease, swings it away to deep midwicket. Had originally scooped it in the air and it lands safely before the man at deep midwciket can get in"
that's Dhoni's first six against Bumrah! It's flat. It's hard. It's sending the opposition crowd into rapture. A baseball drive over the top
"pulls and though he mistimes it, his superb fitness is able to help him pinch an extra run"
"bye bye length ball on off stump. Clears the front leg, winds up that big bat and launches it straight back over the bowler's head"
"nails the yorker, angling into leg stump and Dhoni's legs. Inside edge. No run, because Dhoni said so. He wants the strike"
"yorker on middle, blocks it, Bumrah fields it, but it's the last ball, they should try for a run. And when Tiwary sets off, Bumrah runs over to the bowler's end to break the stumps"
"good length, slight shape inside in the corridor, then goes straight on as Simmons looks to drive on the up. Beaten on the outside edge"
"offcutter, back of a length outside off stump. A nervous push from Simmons, but he wasn't close to it as it cut viciously off the pitch and went past his outside edge"
"another offcutter. Back of a length at off stump, shuffles across and looks to open the face to run it past short third man. Beaten again."
"good length at off stump, defended with soft hands to point to get off the mark"
"slight shape away from a good length, just outside off stump. A confident stride towards the ball, tapped on the up to backward point"
"offcutter, back of a length outside off. For a moment, it seems like Parthiv will take advantage of this field with his favourite shot, the cut. But the ball sits in the pitch and climbs at him. He chops it on the bounce to backward point"
"flat, good length at off stump, pushed back at the bowler off the back foot"
"back of a length at off stump, backs away, not enough room, punches it back at the bowler"
"good length at middle stump, pushed through plat. He goes on the front foot and clips this between mid-on and square leg"
"arm ball, fired in back of a length at middle stump, hurries him on the pull and he can only push it to square leg"
"<b>close.</b> Because midwicket is in, he takes the chance at this middle stump ball as it drifts in. Extends the arms, flicks it uppishly. Might have wanted to hit it where deep midwicket was, but got it quite square. But in the end, it cleared that newly-placed deep square fielder"
"good length at off stump, punched back hard to the bowler's right. He gets a hand on it, but can't hold on. Parries it towards extra cover"
"another one over deep square! Gets a bouncer  at his chest. He's outside his crease and still pulls this off the front foot. Too late on it, gets a top edge, but that flies"
"good length outside off stump, punches on the up to mid-off and calls early"
"offcutter, good length at off stump. Stride forward, open face, turned away to short third man"
"anticipates the offcutter, walks down the track and reaches out at this back of a length ball. Uses his wrists to flick it with the angle, but Washington gets to that to his left at short fine"
"bouncer at off stump, tries to pull off the front foot again. This time it's even faster than before. He gets it off the sticker, doesn't complete the shot, gets it down to long on"
"offcutter, good length at off stump, dropped with soft hands to steal a single against extra cover"
"runs in nicely, leaps gorgeously like on Shane Bond, but misfires this. Good length, way down the leg side"
"nice. Good length, just outside off stump at 145 kph. Simmons walks at the ball and pokes, beaten on the outside edge"
"back of a length at off stump, stands tall, drops it in front of extra cover and takes off. Just about makes it at the non-strikers, where Tripathi threw and missed"
"<b>shot!</b> Finally gets the pull shot right. This is graceful. Back of a length, doesn't quite lift off the pitch. He's hanging on the back foot and he swivels as he whips this flat to deep square's left"
"short and just outside off stump, gets behind the line and slices this nicely, but Ajinkya pulls off a superb diving stop at backward point"
"good length outside off stump, aimless waft at this with half a stride, beaten"
"goes for the yorker outside off stump, just gets it wide of the marker, left alone. Why wouldn't you, for a free run?"
"short and wide outside off stump, Simmons shoulders arms"
"good length, angled across the left-hander. He throws his hands at this, hits through the line. Doesn't connect too well, but he was looking to go over mid-off and therefore gets it wide of him despite the bat turning in his hands"
"<b>this goes high</b> and just evades Unadkat. Beaten by a slower ball outside off. Wants to go over mid-off, this time the bat turns and it goes way over mid-on where Unadkat runs well back, leaps and misses it by some distance. Good effort, and good recovery to stop the four"
"<b>runs him out with his fingertips.</b> Parthiv is beaten by yet another slower ball at a good length. Wants to drive on the up, bat turns and it comes back down the pitch. Shardul gets low to his right to stop it, just about gets a fingertip on it before it hits the stumps. Simmons has the bat in his right hand, which is the wrong hand in this situation, and is lazily lingering outside his crease. Poor technique, poor presence of mind."
"good length, angled into middle stump. Whipped to deep square's right"
"that sits in the pitch. Good length, just outside off stump. Looks to drive on the up, gets it uppishly to mid-off's right. He shies at the stumps at the strikers end and gives Parthiv a shock with the direct hit"
"good length, angled into the pads. Gets on his toes, watches it closely, flicks it past short fine leg"
"we have a match from here, folks. This is a regulation offspinner, good length, aimed for off stump. Rohit plonks his foot down, more across than forward, to try and paddle this past short fine leg. He's looking at the intended destination a tad bit earlier than he should and the ball pings him in front of the stumps. Although it did seem like there was inside edge there"
"good length at middle stump, pushed to midwicket off the front foot"
"good length at off stump, stays deep in the crease and plays a late cut, straight to short third man"
"what is happening here! This is a flat ball, back of a length outside off, skids through quickly and hurries Rayudu on the pull. It dips to Steve Smith's right at short midwicket, but he's down quickly with the dive to hold on. Good catch."
"back of a length at off stump, stands tall and punches it back at the bowler...really hard"
"good length, flat at off stump, spins in sharply and takes the inside half of the bat as Pollard pushes in front of his body. Big gap between bat and pad there, got the bat down just in time"

"good length at middle stump, goes deep in the crease and pushes it off the back foot to deep square"
"full at off stump, driven past the bowler, straight to long-off"
"good length, fired in at a length at middle stump. He goes on the back foot to try and flick this, but it straightens a tad. He has to check his shot and defend it back down the pitch"
"<b>another for Smith, another for Washington.</b> This is flat and full at leg stump. Pollard doesn't put in a stride, but he has the reach for this flick. Unfortunately this time, he's a little early on it and he hits it aerially with hard hands. Straight to Smith at short midwicket"
"back of a length outside off stump, chopped on the up to sweeper cover"
"short and wide outside off stump, the bat face closes on this as he looks to cut. He gets it to mid-off"
"back of a length outside off stump, angles back in after pitching in line with the wide marker, Parthiv lets it go on line"
"lovely shot. This is good length and outside off. There's pace on this and he uses it. Throws his hands at it, makes connection on the up, and then uses his wrists to lift this over point. Superb."
"good length, angled in at middle stump, whipped off the pads to deep midwicket"
"oh that's superb from Hardik. This is a short ball angled down leg side. It's prime for a pull, but Hardik shows great composure after noticing the pace on it. Gets inside the line, gets his bat down on the ball, taps it fine"
"full ball at middle stump, gets to the pitch and flicks it to deep midwicket"
"clean. Tossed up at off stump, right up near his stride. He gets half of it, makes room for himself and lifts this over the long-off boundary"
"back of a length at off stump, punched back at the bowler off the back foot"
"good length, full at leg stump, turned off the front foot to long leg"
"picks the googly, waits for it to land at a length, and flicks against the turn to get a single to deep midwicket"
"uff, some power on this back foot punch. Short ball outside off, he drills it into the square, but Smith gets his left hand up high and hols on to it on the bounce at extra cover"
"<b>leading edge</b> lands safely. This is angled in at Parthiv at a good length. He looks to flick with the angle, but it's an offuctter that straightens on him and takes the leading edge to go into the covers"
"full outside off stump, driven straight to mid-off"
"good length at middle stump, shuffles across and taps it to deep square's right"
"full at middle stump, mistimes the drive to long-on, looks to capitalise on that fact as he calls for two, but he underestimated his own power there"
"full at middle stump, flicks, finds deep midwicket"
"offcutter, full outside off stump, driven into the pitch, back at the bowler"
"this is a great looking shot, but he's picked out long-on to perfection. Good length, angled in at off stump. He's nicely balanced to get under the bounce of this and wants to hit it on the up, over the bowler. But the angle of the ball and the angle of the bat takes this flat, straight to Christian"
"shuffles across and exposes the leg stump as he looks to flick this, but it is down the leg side"
"ooooh nearly gets the outside edge. This is fast and in the corridor, climbing up from back of a length. He looks to open the face on this but it flies past the outside edge"
"full at middle stump, hurriedly flicked to deep square leg"
"fires this off a length, well down the leg side"
"back of a length at middle stump, thuds him on the thigh guard as he looks to glance this"
"good length at off stump, mistimed drive on the up to mid-on"
"keeps firing them down leg side from around the wicket, this one is fuller than the last one, but the direction is the same"
"and again. This time there seemed to be a bit of sound before Dhoni held on to it. Parthiv was looking to flick this overpitched ball outside leg, might have got pad on it"
"good length, drifts in at middle stump, climbs away sharply as he looks to turn it into the leg side, gets it to short third man"
"full at off stump, gets to the pitch, lifts it uppishly, just wide of long-off"
"flat, good length at off stump, he looks to open his arms and slash this through the off side. Quickly realises it's coming in and awkwardly slaps it back to the bowler"
"<b>nearly throws it away.</b> Steps out at this good length ball outside off stump, not to the pitch and feebly punches this check-drive. It lands just short of long-off"

"offcutter, back of a length at off stump, stands tall and slaps it wide of long-on"
"smart. Waits for the offcutter, doesn't commit onto the front foot, and gets it slightly wide as a reward. Just dabs it past short third man"
"Shardul misjudges this at deep midwicket. It's a slower ball, short at and at his chest. He gets great connection on this pull shot and it flies flat to Shardul's right. But he runs in from the boundary and that is hit too fast for him to even think of a recovery. Sticks out a hand and dives, lands awkwardly on the back of his head in the process, but can't take that"
"<b>fifty for Pathiv.</b> Doesn't pick the slower ball outside off. It's good length, he wants to punch through the covers on the up, but it takes ages to come to him. He skies it over the bowler, but well in front of both long-off and long-on"
"shapes to ramp, adjusts to try and beat short third man, finds him. This was full and slow outside off stump"
"Dan Christian doesn't hold grudges. Holds on off Thakur's bowling at long-off. Another slower ball, good length outside off stump. Another lavish shot attempted on the up. Through it too early. Was looking to go over extra cover, finds long-off with some accuracy"
"slower ball, good length, slides down leg"
"slower ball, back of a length at middle stump, forces him to check his pull shot and tap it to short fine's right"
"slower ball, short at middle stump, looks to pull but this goes above the stumps and under his slash, beaten"
"he's an opener, not a finisher. Another offcutter, back of a length outside off stump. Walks at this and casually looks to lift this over extra cover. He isn't in a position to do that, and he lobs it up for Christian who runs in from long-off this time and takes it low in front"
"slower ball, full outside off stump, no feet as he drives at this and is beaten by turn...oh he's called it a wide. Harsh, so harsh."
"good length, offcutter at off stump, opens the face and pushes it to backward point's right"

"good length, flat at middle stump, pushed back down the pitch"
"back of a length outside off stump, looks to dab this past short third man, beaten on the outside edge"

"steps out at this slower bouncer, wants to hit behind square, gets it in the region of deep midwicket instead"
"slower ball, back of a length at off stump, climbs up too quickly for his pull shot and he skews it to where a catching point fielder might have been. Dhoni runs all the way there and takes it on the move"
"legcutter, back of a length at off stump. Follows it with his hands, pushes it to backward point"
"<b>dropped</b>. Tripathi at long-off. This is an offcutter, good length outside off stump. Gets a solid connection as he clubs this on the up. It's flat and to Tripathi's right. He got behind it, but couldn't hold on"
"legcutter, good length at middle stump, slogs across the line, lifts it between and in front of deep square and deep midwicket"
"<b>another drop?</b> 50-50, but he wasn't too far away from that. Skews an attempted pull in the direction of backward point, where Shardul runs in, follows the trajectory nicely, dives forward and misses the ball completely. Poor Christian"
"back of a length at middle stump, stands tall, swings across the line. Gets a rare quicker one, so this flies over deep midwicket"
"full at off stump, driven down to long-off"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off stump, mistimed pull to deep midwicket"
"shot. But straight to long-on. Waits for the slower ball, stays deep and nails this on the up with a pull, hard and straight to the fielder"
"good bowling. Slower ball, but this one is full. Pitches and spins away as Bumrah is brought down on one knee, beaten for pace. Climbs past his attempted half-sweep"
"another offcutter, good length outside off, this one skids through instead of turning, beats him on the sweep again"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off, dabbed to short third man"
"<b>has he taken that? Oh no!</b> He says it's six. What a stunning effort that was. This was a slower ball, slightly short. He swung across the line and barely got it over the midwicket boundary. Rahane ran to his right, reached outside the boundary and held on to it, but he stepped on the rope before he could flick it back to Smith who had come across from long-on"
"full at middle stump, bunted down to long-on"
"back of a length, angled into middle stump, misses the pull, cops it on the thigh"
"taken at short third man. Offcutter, full at off stump, he swings across the line and gets a leading edge that goes straight to a very fine short third man"
"the perfect yorker, Malinga brings the bat down, the bowler and batsman look at each other for a split second and smile as the ball bounces over Shardul and goes to long off"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off stump, steps out and drags it with a flat-bat to long-on"
"<b>looks like another drop.</b> Drops the slower ball short at middle stump, Malinga swipes across the line and gets great connection. This flies flat to deep midwicket's right and he puts in a last ditch attempt to his right to parry it over the boundary"
