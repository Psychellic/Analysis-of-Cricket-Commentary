Does that mean he hasn't got an edge? Certainly looks that was on the first replay. This pitches on leg, rips away and gets him on the knee roll before hitting his back thigh. Right in front of middle as he looks to flick...<b>oh it's going over the stumps!</b> Wow. Didn't see that coming but a prudent review in hindsight. Mendis survives."
"<b>oh no no no!</b> Sri Lanka have got in a terrible mix-up and Oshada might be run out at the striker's end. Miller with stunning work at midwicket. Sprinting to his right and diving, then getting his balance right and chucking it in on the bounce to QDK. Top class work. But terrible, terrible running from Sri Lanka. It was a googly, picked from middle stump, flicked to Miller's right. Mendis takes off, Oshada in doubt as he does. They're both looking at the ball. Then Oshada decides to run as Mendis thinks of getting back into his crease. By now Oshada had committed to the run - but Miller is taking aim at this point. He has no chance. Terrible end to the innings. Didn't sound like either batsman let out a call for or against the run. A thing of beauty, that innings, but it ends in ugly confusion"

shot. They're pinging nicely off the bat today for Faf. This is a comfortable length though - just short of a good length and up at off stump. Skids on nicely and he opens the face to get it between cover and point
and now he puts the pressure on the bowler! Runs down at the length ball and punches it wide of mid-off
<b>spanked away!</b> Length ball with a lot of width outside off. Faf is right on top of the bowler. Crouches and taps it on its head to get it in front of point. Holds the shape too. Regal.
"<b>dropped!</b> Oh dear! Sri Lanka. Sandakan has dropped a sitter at short third man. This short of a length ball rises up at Faf as he looks to punch another one through the line. Was it an offcutter that took a bit of grip in the surface? It draws the thick outside edge and lobs harmlessly towards Sandakan who is caught napping. He was brought in and cover pushed out before this ball. Faf looks deadly now, this could be costly. It was at his chest, he didn't have to move"
