"angles this full delivery down leg in search of some swing first up, through to the keeper"
"<strong>mix-up in the running</strong> as he taps it to midwicket, direct hit from Mark Wood at the striker's end but Thiri manages to make it back in time. He blindly took off for the run"
"nice and full on the stumps, defends with his bat close to the pad with soft hands"
"nips back in off a length to cramp Thiri for room, he's hustled for pace too as he hops back and defends awkwardly"
"turns this incoming length delivery into the leg side, looks for a single but is sent back"
firm push off the front foot to mid-off. Maiden to begin the tour
"struck on the pad, but it came off a thick inside edge. Hint of away movement off a length to begin with"

right on top of the bounce as he bunts it back down the pitch
"solidy defended to mid-on, good length on middle from Curran this time"
"<strong>huge shout for lbw</strong> as this nips back in off a length to beat the inside edge. England are thinking about a review, but they don't take it in the end. Going down leg? Perhaps. I think that was very, very close. Would've come back as umpire's call at best. Worth a shout really."
struck high on the thigh pad as he looks to work it through square leg. Two maidens to begin the Test

"drifting into the pads and Kusal clips it to fine leg, off the mark"
neatly flicked away to long leg as Broad drifts down leg
"in there slot and KJP belts it over the bowler's head, first boundary of the Test"
"squirted off a thick inside edge to fine leg, Curran bowls length on the body, hint of movement to get the inside half of the bat"
"off a thick inside edge to mid-on, the late movement is causing a bit of discomfort to both batsmen. This was much fuller as well"

"length outside off, left alone"
shows the full face of the bat as he defends back this length delivery

"uppish but one bounce to mid-off. This was right in the slot, Kusal didn't go through with the stroke and <strong>gets lucky</strong>"

driven through extra cover! This was a half-volley and KJP thumped it into the gap.
"<strong>top-edges a pull, but fine leg completely misjudges this</strong>. Maybe he lost the ball. Oh, Jack Leach. He just didn't see the ball and ran in the opposite direction. Two lucky runs. <b> Definite opportunity </b>"

gets besides the line as he stabs this length delivery into the off side
tucks this down to fine leg
"angles one in full on the stumps, pushed back to the bowler"
"<strong>the leg slip was there exactly for that! </strong>Good captaincy from Root. Broad angles a short of length delivery into middle and leg, Thirimanne tucks it off the face of the bat down leg and Bairstow stays low and pouches this one nicely."
"length outside off, nips away off the deck, left alone"
"<strong>nicks him off! Fourth duck in a row for Kusal Mendis</strong>. Goes full, this is a well-disguised leg-cutter from Broad that deviates enough off the pitch, Mendis pushes forward without any conviction, gets a thin edge and Buttler does the rest."
"starts with a bouncer, Mathews ducks under this one"
"goes for a big shot down the ground,<strong> toe-ends it and just about eludes mid-off.</strong> Intent but no execution that time. He's playing a high-risk game like he does always"

"another short-pitched ball, <b>smashed into the body!</b> Not sure about the technique, trying to duck/evade at the last minute, and he wears the blow"
"round the wicket to the lefty, tossed up and tapped away"
"<b>goes for the reverse-sweep, plops a top edge straight to slip!</b> Maybe off the glove, actually, but either way Bess is immediately amongst the wickets on his first bowl in Asia! England's morning gets better, there's spin and bounce for their offie and Root gleefully accepts the catch"

"lobbed up slightly wider, comes forward and defends"
"flatter, Chandimal stays back and tucks to leg this time"

"shorter, <b>93mph/149kph as Wood continues to hare in</b>, defended square on the off side"

again it's back of a length and Mathews can rock back to cut for one to the sweeper
"<b>finishes with a peach</b>, looped up and ragging past the outside edge as Chandimal plunges forward! Slightly rusty start but that's perfect from Leach"

"pushes this in a touch straighter, defended to the on side"
"gives this plenty of air, Chandimal is forward to tamp down in defence on middle and off stump"
"<b>skips down and clouted through mid-off!</b> Too full from Bess and Chandimal is in the market for a boundary, pouncing to lace it past extra cover"
"tossed up, again he's driving, Broad dives across from extra cover to get a hand on this one"
"full on the stumps, bunted back and Bess moves across to prevent any further damage"

tossed up and punched into the covers
"flighted, around off stump, tapped back to the left of the bowler"
"<b>dropped!</b> Shouts of 'catch!' as Chandimal goes hard at one tossed up wide, sails at a good catchable height to the debutant Dan Lawrence, <b>but he shells it going to his left!</b> Nervy grab, and the chance goes begging"
"flighted, straightening a little, gets forward to defend"
tossed up and tapped away coming across his stumps
"full and flighted, Chandi taps this into the covers and commences some gardening... a let-off in that over for the SL skipper, five minutes away from lunch"

"flighted, Mathews it well forward and steers this for one more"

"<b>jaffa!</b> Clears the top of off stump! Dip and sharp turn for Leach, pitching around middle as Chandimal looked to close the face on it, beaten all ends up but misses the timber, too"
"flighted, he is forward and covers the line this time"
stroked into the covers coming forwards - and that will be <b>lunch</b>
"nice and full on the stumps, Mathews is well forward as he defends"
"leg-cutter that he squirts to gully, good stop"
punches this to short cover
<b> 6000 Test runs for Mathews </b> and it comes courtesy a thick edge that rolls all along the ground past the cordon. Played it with soft hands. He's the fifth Sri Lankan to get there.

driven into the covers to end a very good over first up after lunch
"drifting into middle and leg, nicely worked past short fine leg"
eased wide of cover for a quick single
rocks back to steer to cover

"fuller, outside off, gets it to jump off the deck, left alone"
"squirted into the off side, another cutter from Broad"
"full and moving away from outside off, left alone"

"drifting into middle and leg, Mathews is well forward as he smothers this"
well forward as he defends back
defends this into the covers

"floats this full outside off, Mathews looks to defend but lets it go at the last moment"
gets on top of the bounce and defends
works this length ball on the pads to midwicket
"huge strike and it's that man again, Broad! What a big moment in the game. The big fish is gone. Looks to cut but this isn't as short as he thinks it is, slashes at that to get a thick edge and Root takes an excellent catch at slip. It was flying to his right but he took it very well."
"full on the stumps, defends back"
"got him! Sri Lanka are crumbling here. Should've had him in a similar way before lunch, but he has his man now. Tossed it up nicely, Chandimal sees the flight and goes after it but gets no timing or power behind that and the cover fielder dives forward to take an excellent catch."

defends as he gets half-forward

"shorter in length but pushed through quicker, looking to get some bite off the pitch, defended"

"nice timing, leans forward and strokes it into the gap between cover and mid-off"
nudged off his hip to deep square
"hops back, taps it into the off side and scampers a quicks single"

lunges forward and blocks
"tossed up outside off, gets well forward and blocks"
"drifting into the pads, worked to short fine"
"<b>that's not great, from all parties, but Bess has another!</b> Starts with a long hop from round the wicket, Dickwella completely flumps his cut shot, weight going back and the ball looping to backward point... where Dom Sibley barely sees it but manages to hold on as he falls to his haunches!

tossed up on off stump and Shanaka works it leg side for one

"dobbed on off stump, patted back along the turf"
"tossed up outside off stump, Shanaka is across"
defended on the front dog
"flighted, better lengths from Leach, again he plays forward watchfully"

tossed up and nurdled from the crease through the midwicket region
"flatter outside off, bunted into the covers"
"tossed up on the stumps, nudged to mid-on"
"flighted, Shanaka tucks it back to the leg side"
"<b>sweeps hard, the ball loops up... and Buttler claims the catch!</b> Looks like this might have come straight off short leg. Shanaka is going to hang around while they check, but yes, replays confirm he has <i>nailed</i> his shot into Jonny Bairstow's ankle, the ricochet providing a simple take for the keeper! Not quite <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GV-EUzFFj4#t=6m57s target=_blank>Marcus Trescothick lodging one in Russel Arnold's jumper 20 years ago</a>, but similar fortune involved"
pushed through and dabbed back watchfully
"<b>bowled 'im, Bess has four-for!</b> No luck involved this time, nicely flighted and Perera plays all around it, off stump pegged back! Not sure about the shot selection from the new man, who ought to know a bit about playing offspin at Galle"
"round the wicket, tossed up and defended propping forwards"

"slightly short outside off, cut firmly to backward point"
tossed up and pushed to mid-on
"<b>creams a drive into the stumps at the non-striker's</b>, and Leach reckons he's got a touch on it! Looks like Hasaranga's aggression has taken out his team-mate! Lyndon Hannibal is the TV umpire and he's satisfied there was a deflection from the fingertips of Leach's right hand - and Embuldeniya is run-out backing up! It's all coming up clover for England today"
"pushed through outside off, bit of extra bounce as Hasaranga dabbles at it"
"lobbed up from over the wicket, Asitha gets into line"
"flighted, props forward to block"
tapped into the off side coming forwards

"bit of width, bottom edges an attempted cut"
tossed up and tapped away into the off side
<b>flashes an edge wide of slip!</b> Hasaranga throws the hands and slices a couple beyond the reach of the diving Root
"<b>Oh crumbs, is this going to end in another run-out...?!</b> Hasaranga wanted two and is full length like Superman trying to regain his ground, it <i>looks </i>like his bat wasn't quite grounded as the bails were broken. It was certainly over the line, having bounced up. <b>Not out says the TV umpire!</b> It was incredibly tight, though I thought it was going to go the other way. SL probably need a bit of luck today"
lobbed up and prodded into the covers
"flighted, draws him forward, this grips and zips through into the gloves past the outside edge"
"<b>bowled trying to reverse sweep, Bess has his bag of five!</b> Clearly Hasaranga had no faith in Asitha clinging on while he eked out a few more... but that's the second player dismissed reverse-sweeping today, on day one of the Test. Bess has definitely bowled better for less reward, but he'll still be applauded off by his team-mates. England make the perfect start to their subcontinental marathon"

makes room and punches this into the gap at extra cover
works this to short fine leg
goes right back into the crease and defends
"<b> what a royal mess from Sri Lanka! </b> They appealed for an lbw, but should've run out Crawley at the bowler's end. The ball struck him on the pad, rolled to the leg side. Crawley was more than halfway down the pitch when he was sent back, Shanaka took ages to retrieve the ball and by the time the throw came in, he was already in with a dive. Chandimal also wasn't up to the stumps and was a few yards away, so he had to underarm lob to the stumps"
"drifting into the pads, tickled to fine leg"

gently pats it into the leg side
"drawn forward by the flight, defended"
"they appeal for a catch at slip, not given. But it could be a close lbw shout. <strong>Sri Lanka review.</strong> They've gone up for a catch. So we have to see if there's bat. The ball drifted in and spun away ever-so-slightly. Sibley prodded forward to defend, the bat was very very close to the ball. Yes, Ultraedge confirms a spike, which means there was definite bat as it then hit the pad and lobbed to slip where Mathews took a comfortable catch. <B> Sri Lanka get a wicket through a review. </b>"

"straightens as it drifts in, defended back"
"has he chipped it to mid-off? Oh, dear. Yes. What have you done, Zak? Steps out but doesn't get to the pitch of the ball, ends up chipping it in the air. Hasaranga runs back and keeps his eye on the ball to pull off a very good catch. Would've definitely cleared the infield had he gone through with the stroke"
edged but rolls to gully. Lovely rhythm from Embuldeniya
"<strong>edged but lands short of Thirimanne! It's all happening.</strong> Drifts in, breaks away sharply as Bairstow prods forward to get a thick edge. So close to another wicket."

eased with the spin past cover for an easy single
"<b> oh, another stumping chance missed, catch missed too! </b> Big turn for Embuldeniya from the rough outside off, Lawrence steps out to go inside-out over long-off, doesn't get to the pitch and misses it completely, Dickwella can't grab the ball either. Flies off a deflection over the slip fielder. Given runs so there was a bit of an edge too. Lawrence was completely off balance, lost his shape too. He would've been kicking himself had he thrown it away. Can't have a better opportunity to make a hundred"

"steps out to swing this over the ropes but holes out to deep midwicket. I suspect Root was looking to hit it a lot straighter so he ended up dragging it a little courtesy the sharp turn.

"tossed up, Thirimanne is down on the sweep and picks up one to deep square leg"
"flighted and spinning, Perera jabs it down towards short leg... did that carry? Couldn't tell on first view, but would have been a split-second reaction chance. <b>It did reach Bairstow on the full</b>, but straight into the leg guard"

tossed up and met with a straight blade
"full and flighted, gets across and blocks"
looped up and bunted to cover to finish an immaculate session from the SL openers - and that's <b>tea</b>

"length and angling in, defends with his bat close to the pad"
"attacks the stumps again by bowling full, defended carefully once again"
steered behind square in the off side for an easy single

He throws his hands at that in glee, strikes it well but picks out the lone man at deep point. Leach makes no mistake and there's the wicket England have been waiting for."
right behind the line as he defends
"right behind the line of this short of length delivery as he defends back. Oversteps, so he'll have to rebowl"

"sharp turn, rips off the deck and bounces as Kusal aborts a cut shot"
nicely forward as he keeps this out
right back into the crease as he defends confidently
"huge appeal for lbw as he's struck on the pad trying to sweep against the turn. Not out, perhaps height. <b> England don't review.</b>"

"shapes to pull but is beaten by skiddy pace, bails out awkwardly in the end"

"goes full on the stumps from wide of the crease, Kusal solid in defence"
"angling into middle and leg, turned towards short mid-on"
"good delivery, in that off-stump channel, much fuller to see if there's movement Kusal lets it go. There was an opportunity to drive if he wanted to though"
solidly defended back
"tossed up and straightening on middle and leg, into the pads, Jack Leach likes it but umpire Palliyaguruge shakes his head. England <b>review</b> and this could be close, definitely no bat before it thumped the front pad, the question is whether it turned enough from round the wicket... In fact, <b>it's turned too much!</b> Fantastic decision from Palliyaguruge, missing the stumps so England lose that one"

"pushed through, short outside off and Mendis cuts to the man in front of square"

"massive, massive wicket! Leach's persistence has paid off. Draws him forward by tossing it up, getting it to turn and bounce off the rough, Kusal gets a thin edge and Buttler follows the ball nicely to take an excellent catch. It was the previous delivery that caused some doubts in Kusal's mind so he had to play at this, or so he thought."
"full outside off, defended back"

full and flighted outside off spinning away and he leaves alone
"gone! Soft dismissal, and England strike in the second over of the morning, <b>Embuldeniya chipping straight to short cover!</b> Low-key celebrations but that is the perfect start, the nightwatchman not tarrying long.

"gives this a bit of air, dipping towards off stump, again he's forward to block"
"<b>crashed uppishly through the off side, just beyond the reach of short cover!</b> Sibley was the man hurling himself to his left, couldn't quite get a paw on it - would have been a screamer if taken, but Thirimanne instead gets four"

"tossed up on off, props out to defend"
"drops short, Thirimanne slots another cut for four, <b>there's his long-awaited second Test hundred!</b> You heard the roar of relief as the ball skipped away - eight years after he scored his maiden ton on this ground against Bangladesh, Thirimanne has another.

"conventional sweep, can't get it away"
"flight and dip from Leach, suddenly he's finding a bit of action on the ball"
"another reverse sweep from Dickwella, who is unnerved by the puffs from the rough. This time Buttler can't gather as the ball flies down the leg side"

"<B>first ball and he's struck again!</B> Back of a length, outside off, a hint of turn, and an indecisive prod from Dickwella, unsure whether to leave alone or run it through third man. Buttler snaffles the edge, there's an anxious wait for the decision then a fist-pump of triumph from the bowler. He's now got eight for the match, and England have got a very, very big breakthrough!"

"a wild appeal, as Root lines up the sweep first-ball, and deflects it off his knee-roll to slip. Outside the line for the lbw"
"back and across, as Root reverts to his first line of defence. Play from deep in the crease unless you can safely smother it"
"swept, nailed. His second attempt at the shot, and no mistake this time, rifled through midwicket"
change of angle to test Bairstow's defences
"calamity for Root, who collides with the bowler, and <strong>looks to have been run out!</strong> Oh my, forget Colombo 2000-01, more shades of Trinidad 1993-94 here! A headless chicken single, into the covers, no need to take such a gamble. Ball-watching all round, and the skipper clatters into the bowler, and never has a prayer as the shy comes in!"
"<B>pops into the covers, off a leading edge, and another madcap single!</B> Gully can't get close, but they set off for a reflexive single. A direct hit would have been curtains for the second time in as many balls!"
"firm drive from Lawrence, into the covers as Embuldeniya targets his stumps"
"firm contact once more, pushed into space in the covers to get off the mark"
"tossed up, dipping on the crease, and well dug out"
"a hint of width, and Bairstow gratefully accepts, with a slap to deep cover"
"outside off, slides through on a tight line, but that's a better leave than Sibley's!"
"round the wicket, restrictive angle, attacking the wickets, as Bairstow defends on the back foot"
nudged off the hip to backward square
"fenced around the corner once more, as Perera finds some bite, another welcome single"
tapped back to the bowler
"tucked off the legs, another single to the cause. Perera's line a fraction too straight on that occasion"
"better line and length for the angle, leaning out of the crease to defend on middle and leg"
"tapped into the covers, on the front foot, a fumble gifts the single"
"awkward length, dipping on middle and off, and demanding a defensive prod. Bairstow gets far enough forward to smother"
"driven, uncertainly, out towards point off a leading edge. Dicey..."
a more firm poke back down the line this time. Embuldeniya the absolute pick of these two bowlers so far
"strretching forward again, impeccable line and length on off stump"
"head over the ball, open stance to crush the spin on a full length. Slip, gully and a short leg lie in wait"
nurdled to the leg side
"aggression on the slog sweep, but that was a calculated risk, foot outside the line of off and never a danger of lbw"
"pressed into the off side, Bairstow looking to get forward whenever possible"
"lines up the sweep, but gets in a tangle on a very full length, just about gets bat on it to blot it into the crease"
"<B>rocks back for the cut and is beaten by extra bounce!</B> Bairstow wants to be proactive, but every now and then, these balls are popping!"
"strides forward, and smothered with more solidity this time"
<B>turn and bounce past a firmly planted edge!</B> Those areas again ...
"back and across, and poked to point"
"<B>leaping bounce into the glove!</B> Lawrence does reasonably well to keep it down into the off side, past a phalanx of three slips"
"back and across, steered to cover"
"<B>big turn!</B> Shaping in towards off stump, and biting past the edge! Lawrence was back on his stumps, so survived snicking it"
"oohs abound as Lawrence plunges forward in a flurry of determined defence. Zoinks, this is gripping! Literally..."
"round the wicket, but fired down the leg side, no stroke there"
stabbed out to point
"<B>reverse sweep, <strike>flicks the pad</strike>, safe!</B> Big turn and bounce, and that actually leaped off the pitch, down the leg side. priceless boundary!"
"orthodox sweep this time, and a misfield gifts the single"
"jammed into the leg-side, kneeling forward as short leg tumbles to intercept"
"advancing to the pitch, whisked back towards the bowler"
"round the wicket, metronomic from Embuldeniya, on and around off stump, with sharp turn from a good length. No stroke"
""
"fuller length, and poked out to cover, finds the gap to nibble away at the target"
"solid on the front foot, stabbed back to the bowler"
"good leave from Bairstow, decisively onto the front foot, then shouldering arms when the line was clear"
"attacking the base of off stump, Bairstow plunges forward with an open face, and picks off the single to cover"
"attempted sweep, as Bairstow gets outside the line to negate the lbw"
"clipped off the front pad, out to the leg side"
"solid on the front foot, nudged to point"
"probing line and length, turning back into the stumps, Lawrence is forward with solid technique to block"
"flicked in the air, but with power. That was close to short leg, but wide enough to be safe enough, through midwicket"
"zippy off the pitch, and fizzing into Dickwella's gloves, a more round-arm delivery imparting overspin that time. Bairstow plays inside the line"
"onto the front foot, head right over the ball"
"picked off well, into the gap in the covers, as Lawrence presses forward then rocks back to cut"
leaning out of the crease to smother the ball on off stump. Composed from the youngster
"<B>grief, that has detonated!</B> Back of a length, straightening and climbing, as Lawrence hangs back, and drops the hands as the ball thuds past his chest, and the keeper too!"
"fenced into the covers, who have dropped five yards deeper to tempt the loose drive"
"outside off, more good judgement as Bairstow thrusts his hands out of harm's way"
"pushed through on the stumps, Lawrence is forward and clips this towards midwicket"
"tossed up full, bunted back to the bowler"
"tad slower, drifting towards middle and leg, Lawrence pats it away watchfully"
"flighted, Lawrence attempts to reverse-sweep and is struck on the pad... Dharmasena declines the appeal, but SL will <b>review</b>, and why not? Not point in dying wondering out there, though it's a difficult one to win with Lawrence planting his front foot and quite possibly outside the line. Ah, and there was also bat involved, according to UltraEdge. So not much going for that one"
tapped down towards short leg back in the crease
flat delivery on the stumps and Lawrence is happy to block out a maiden. He's got all day
"first run of the day, tossed up a fraction too full outside off and Bairstow punches to the deep cover sweeper"
"flighted, he's forward on off stump, close enough to the pitch to thrash one more through cover"
"<b>slashed wide of gully playing back!</b> Mendis had no time to react, a lusty blacksmith's blow from YJB and that's a boundary to settle England nerves. They're one sixth of the way to their requirement this morning"
"<b>tight leave, skidding through just outside off!</b> Got his angles right, but that was close!"
"tossed up in the channel, no stroke once again, this one slides through more comfortably to the keeper"

"props forward and plays this softly, opens the face for one wide of slip"
"length ball, turn for Perera, raps Lawrence on the pads... again Dharmasena shakes his head, possibly outside the line and, if not, there's the question of it doing too much"
tucked into the leg side and a misfield gives them one
shuffles across and paddles a single
"tossed up on off stump, Bairstow is low and laps up another"
"quicker, goes back and punches away from in front of his stumps"
"this takes a chunk out of the surface, teasingly bowled and spinning away but Lawrence watches it well and shoulders arms"
poked into the covers half forward
"darted on the stumps, turns the wrists on one to leg - <b>brings up the England 50</b>, these two whittling away furiously at the target"
"off-stump line, flighted, met on the front and blocked"
"on the stumps, worked away behind square on the leg side, more unfussy accumulation"
"bowling round the wicket to Bairstow, who forces one more away via the inside edge"
strays leg side and Lawrence whips in front of the fielder in the deep for a couple more
"uses the feet, covers the turn and drills through mid-on"
"back round the wicket, lobbed up on off stump, tapped back"
pushed through on the stumps and nudged to leg

"flighted, he's forward and smothers this"
"gets a bit straight and this is clipped wide of mid-on, who dives to cut it off but can't prevent one"
"tossed up nice and full, he's down and paddles another sweep away behind square"

"floated up and he's out to meet it, blocked calmly"
tossed up and clipped to midwicket
"flighted, he's forward, shows this plenty of the maker's name in bunting to long-on"
"lobbed up from round the wicket, Bairstow strides out and prods it away, does some gardening in his no-nonsense Yorkshire style"
"walks down and flicks at this one, skims an inside edge past the diving leg slip and he'll scurry back"
"pushed through, turning on the stumps and tapped down to leg"
"full and flighted, reverse-swept for one out to deep backward point"
floated up and twocked through the covers for a couple

"tossed up, drifting a little on to leg stump, YJB pokes into the leg side and they scamper through as the bowler gives chase"
"spinning away outside off, Lawrence goes back and cuts behind point... almost there now"
"flighted, gives it a wristy slap to extra cover"
