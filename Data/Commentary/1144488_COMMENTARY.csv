"wide outside off stump, Imam lets it go safely by"
"similar line and length, cut away to third man, and Imam is up and running"
"less room this time. Short and straighter, but Fakhar shoulders arms"
"sliced away to the offside. Looked too close to cut, and there was no timing, but surprising misfield in the covers lets the ball squirt through to the boundary. Morgan the man who misfielded"
driven to mid-off
"<strong>slashed away</strong> by Zaman. Got just a bit more room, fuller delivery angling away from the left-hander, and a slice gets it just wide of the man at point."
"immediate threat from Archer. Straighter, squared Imam up, an outside edge trickles through to third man"
"too straight, almost legsid-ish, and Fakhar flicks it off the hips to the fine leg boundary. This is a <strong>good start for Pakistan</strong>"
"shorter and wider, left alone this time"
"beautiful bowling. Good length, at pace and swinging away from Imam's outside edge"
beats the inside edge this time. Bit of swing for Archer. This has been a challenging over
wide ball prompts a rash swing from Fakhar. Bat nowhere near ball. Better over from England
"on a length but wide of off stump, left alone."
similar length and Imam locks to the offside. No swing for Woakes at all
"slightly straighter and quicker from Woakes, defended"
"attempted drive on the up and <strong>nearly cost him</strong> his wicket. Missed the line of the fuller ball, perhaps too far away for a straight drive. Whizzes past the outside edge"
attempts to cut away and beaten again.
excellent over from Woakes. Ball might not do much for him but he's ensuring Imam isn't allowed to get away like Fakhar was the previous over. England coming back after a sloppy first ten balls or so
"movement for Archer, but it's short enough for Fakhar to let go"
"whipped off his pads, this is the ball Fakhar dreams of receiving. Good length on his pads, and Fakhar swivels and dispatches to the midwicket boundary."
"kept low, and Fakhar lets it go through, but a misfield from the keeper allows them to steal a bye"
"has that short stuff finally begun? Shortest ball of the innings, and Imam ducks hastily"
defended to the offside
"tapped to the onside, and Imam keeps the strike"
"driven nicely on the up, but straight to the man at mid-off"
defended back to the bowler
"<strong>disdainfully struck over long</strong> on for six. I suspect he might not do that to Archer, but charges Woakes, picks up a ball pitched on a length and absolutely biffs it above the long-on boundary"
"edged away to third man, just the place from where the fielder was taken away. Pakistan looking to pick up the pace now"
tucked away to fine leg
"Fakhar plays outside the line of the ball. No damage, though, as it ,misses the inside edge and goes through."
"glanced down to fine leg, but a leg slip placed presumably specifically for that shot prevents it from going for four."
you think you're fast and short? Fakhar doesn't care. Plants the front foot and creams it to square leg for four
"fuller, Fakhar slightly messed up his footwork but defended to cover"
"swings for the fences again, but a connection was never on the cards"
"well bowled, and fast. 88 mph, short and popped up off the top of Fakhar's bat, might have been the glove. Balloons over the slips and goes through to third man"
defended to the onside
"that's a gimme from Woakes, that's poor bowling. Short and wide, and the easiest shot Fakhar's had to play all innings. Stayed inside the line and cracked it through the covers."
"got down on one knee and scooped over fine leg! It's not the type of shot you expect him to play, but the good length delivery was perfect for that shot. Woakes is taking a but of a pounding here."
"short, pulled away to square leg again, but deft fielding from Bairstow mean they only get one."
flicked off the pads to fine leg and the pair cross twice
guided to third man
"tried to run it past point, just misses out"
"wicket-to-wicket, Imam gets a thick outside edge and goes to slip on the bounce"
"that's a lovely shot by Imam. Fuller onto the pads, and Imam takes full advantage with a flick of the wrists to midwicket. <strong>Pakistan bring up their fifty </strong>"
"ooh, that looked very close. Swinging back into Imam and striking up around the knee roll. The umpire turns the shout down, but we'll have a review. The review shows a clear inside edge, and the decision stands. England lose their review"
"angled in to him, thick inside edge to fine leg"
"that was far too short, and Buttler just about prevented it going to the boundary. Well above head height, and Buttler's fingertips saves some runs"
"baseball stance, baseball shot. Heaved to the onside, not much timing to go with it, though"
"87mph again. Short and well-directed, or so I thought, but the umpire rules it was a tad too high, and he'll have to do it over."
straighter and Fakhar spoons it past mid-on and the pair run another two. Expensive over. Pakistan going along very nicely
"dragged to leg stump, flicked for one"
"too far down the leg side from Moeen again, and a faint edge sees it race through to fine leg. Slightly sloppy start from the spinner"
"better line, and Imam only finds the square leg fielder"
"straight, defended on to the legside"
"fuller, more flight, worked away to deep midwicket"
"good length, even a hint of turn. Good over from Moeen after all"
"starts well, full slightly outside off at 87 mph. Defended to the offside"
"beautifully driven but a hand from the extra cover fielder prevents any more than just the one run. Wood looking good with his rhythm though, and his pace his high"
Fakhar opens up his stance but it's just too close for him to really have a go. Decided to defend it to the offside instead
"slower ball, edged away to third man"
"short and pacy. The 89mph delivery isn't quite as well directed though, and even though Imam ducks, he was never in any discomfort"
"lovely ball, just beats the outside edge. Good start from Wood."
Moeen gets this full ball to drift in from round the wicket. Fakhar can't put it away with a flick and instead wears it on his pad
"another non-turner, slides in and catches the pad as Fakhar plays all around it and falls over"
Fakhar stretches out and drives this full ball from outside off to long-off. Smoothly pushed away through the line
"dragged shorter and outside off, 88ks, Imad stands up tall and forces the ball down to long-on"
"Fakhar ventures down the track, Moeen tosses it outside off. Driven through the line once again, down to long-off"
"fuller and straighter, Imam presses forward and picks it away to wide long-on to close out the over"
"on a good length and nipping away outside off, <b>offcutter, beats the outside edge</b>"
"much fuller, another offcutter, which is run down to deep third man"
"lifter outside off, Fakhar is late onto the hook, this <strong>143kph rocket flies through to the keeper</strong>"
"full and wide, Fakhar loves it there, doesn't he? Flashed away to sweeper cover"
"chest-high short ball on middle, hooked away to long leg"
"yorker on off, Fakhar keeps it out"
"dropped short and outside off, stands up tall and punches down the ground to long-on"
"skids on middle, backs away and punches down to mid-off"
"short and breaks away outside off, grip and turn, sliced away in the air but wide of backward point and cover"
stretches out and drives up to the covers
"slides in with the arm from round the wicket, prodded to the leg side"
"flighted and outside off, eased down to long-on off the front foot"
"good length and hunting for off stump, Imam's forward defence intervenes"
"shorter and angling across off, rides it down to deep third man"
"back of a length and outside off, possibly another offcutter. Fakhar simply throws his hands at the ball and <strong>under-edges it behind to the keeper</strong>"
<strong>Mix-up between the wickets</strong>! Morgan throws to the wrong end - effects a direct hit at the non-striker's end. But Imam is in. He didn't want the single. It was Fakhar who wanted a risky single after slapping this full ball to cover. Morgan swooped down on the ball but threw to the wrong end
"dug in short, spliced away behind square on the leg side"
very full and veering down the leg side for a wide
"short on off, fended off"
"<strong>Moeen finds grip and turn</strong>! Buttler takes the bails off and thinks he has his man. This was a beauty from Moeen. Drifts in from round the wicket. The flight draws the batsman out of his crease. The ball dips, creating distance between the bat and the pitch of the ball. The turn takes it past the bat and Buttler does the rest. Fakhar closes his bat-face and prods at it limply. The TV umpire has been called in to have a look at this. Fakhar can't drag his back foot back in time. Moeen provides England with the breakthrough"
"shorter and spins in, forced to midwicket off the back foot"
shuffles across and works a single to midwicket and gets off the mark
"on a length and holds its line outside off, knocked into the leg side off the back foot"
"skids on outside off, short and outside off, hauled away to long-on"
"pushed through on and around off, defended"
"bouncer at 142ks, aimed at the head of Babar, he rocks it out of the way and evades it. <strong>Wood runs in hard and hits the pitch harder - that's why Morgan picked him </strong>"
"<strong>another lifter outside off, 140kph</strong>, rushes Babar into a hook. Spliced in front of mid-on"
"the short-ball attack continues from Wood, Babar has his eyes locked on the ball before bailing out of the hook. We ll done, Babar"
"wide of the crease, <strong>short at the body (what else?)</strong>, 144kph, Babar swivels on the back foot and pulls it behind the square on the leg side. Even better from Babar"
"short at 145kph, the ball hits the bat as opposed to bat hitting ball. Blocked to the covers"
"back of a length and outside off, sweetly punched through the line to sweeper cover - and that's time for drinks"
"shorter and slides on outside off, leans back and punches up to the covers does Babar"
"good length on off, a bit of turn, tapped to the covers"
"fuller and on the pads, nurdled away through square leg"
"on a length and breaks in, poked past the covers and Babar hares back for the second"
"back of a length and outside off, punched on the up to sweeper cover"
uses his feet and push-drives this to cover
back of a length and zipping outside off past the outside edge
"Babar shuffles across off, gets inside the line, and pulls this short ball in front of square"
"back of a length and too close to cut, chopped away behind point"
"pitched up and outside off, punchily driven to sweeper cover. So stylish from Babar..."
Imam allows this length ball to come onto him outside off and steers this down to third man
Babar rides the bounce of this short ball outside off and dinks a single down to third man. <strong>100 up for Pakistan</strong>
"back of a length and outside off, punched down to mid-on"
uses his feet and drives this offbreak straight of mid-on
"slides on off, tip and run to point"
Babar steps out and drops it with soft hands to where an orthodox midwicket might have been. Morgan has a man at straight midwicket
forced down the ground to long-on
"Moeen tosses it outside off, full and right in Babar's hitting arc. He gets underneath the length and hoists it over mid-off. One-bounce four"
"fuller and on middle and leg, off the pad and rolls away to square leg"
"bouncer outside off, Babar swishes...and misses"
chopped down to third man
Imam leans back to this shortish ball outside off and cuts straight to point
"chest-high short ball on middle, Imam swivels on the back foot and pulls to deep square leg. 111-1"
"back of a length and outside off, under-edged behind to the keeper"
"<strong>and gone</strong>! Imam danced down the wicket and looked to have struck it sweetly above extra cover. The shot didn't deserve what happened next, with Chris Woakes running the best part of 20 yards to take a diving catch to his left that sends Imam packing"
defended back to Moeen
delicate late cut that runs it down to third man. Fielder at 45 had a chase and cuts it off
jabbed away to sweeper cover
Hafeez makes his intentions clear. Waltzes down the wicket and tonks Moeen over mid-off's head
guided through the offside
"full, driven to deep cover"
"short ball, but nowhere near high enough to perturb Babar, who pulls to square leg and turns the strike over"
"short of a length again, and Hafeez works it down to third man"
"poor delivery and Stokes gets away with it. Short and wide and slashed away to point, where the man cuts it off"
"another short ball but Hafeez looked like he was anticipating that. Rocks onto the back foot and <strong>whips it behind square</strong>, where a diving Jonny Bairstow finds the ball beating him to the short boundary"
"angled to third man, ends a productive over for Pakistan"
"starts with a short delivery, guided to deep point"
short again and Babar off the back foot hits a clean shot straight to extra cover
flicked elegantly to cow corner
Rashid sees Hafeez coming and drops the ball in short. The batsman takes a run on the onside
"gets on the backfoot, cut away to deep extra."
"uppish, but well short of midwicket. Good start from Rashid"
poked at one wide of off stump. Close to the outside edge
"full and straight, driven to mid-on"
half-volley and Babar eases it to the offside. Pakistan content with the singles - and even the dots - for now
"another poke at one wide of off stump. Some excitement from the field, but it was just bat hitting ground"
"faster, nippier, straighter. Pakistan sneak a legbye. A muffled lbw appeal, but always going over the stumps"
Good one to finish off. Almost squared the batsman up. Babar just about defends it
"WOULD YOU BELIEVE THIS? England have dropped a sitter. Hafeez skies one to mid-off and it looked the easiest catch in the world. Roy, however, drops it much to everyone's astonishment"
blocked
dragged it down legside
worked through the offside
"flicked to fine leg, and the strike changes hands"
"long hop that Rashid gets away with. Hafeez gives it a smack, but onlt to deep square leg"
"sliced through the offside, straight to the boundary fielder. Seven from the over"
worked off the pads to midwicket
"fuller, straighter, but Babar drives sweetly straight to the fielder. he's found fielders off good shots today, has Babar"
"good fielding from Roy, dives at backward point to save one. Throws the ball away in anger, still seething from that drop"
worked to square leg and the pair call for a sharp single
"slightly shorter, and Hafeez taps straight down the ground for one"
thick outside edge to third man lets Babar keep the strike
"Babar charges Rashid again, he's making a habit of this. Beautifully lofted over the onside field, and races above mid-on's head"
"this one is bigger, <strong>it's better</strong>! Looked to have been done by the flight, but manages to lift it over cow corner, where it sails into the stands!"
defended
blocked
steps out and kills the ball dead again
"and the drag-down makes this a <strong>very dear over </strong>indeed. Babar allowed to get onto the backfoot with all the time in the world, and nail it to the wide midwicket boundary. 14 from this over, and Pakistan have momentum again"
"Hafeez blocks and tries to run, Babar sensibly tells him he's gone crazy, and that he will not be giving his wicket away in that fashion"
Archer's on the money straightaway. Just outside off stump and Hafeez's prod only just beats the outside edge
"slower ball, defended to cover"
"mean from Archer, and is that a bit too harsh by the umpire? Maybe not, on second viewing. Sharp bouncer but well above the batsman's head"
worked away to third man deftly
"slow again, and uppish to backwar point, but evades the man and the pair run two. That's <strong>50 for Babar</strong>. Needs a lot more than that here."
worked off the pads to fine leg
driven down the ground
"drift but it's the wrong line. Babar sweeps it away, but fine leg cuts it off at the boundary"
defended to the offside
"flighted and smashed through extra cover, but that's <strong>a remarkable stop</strong> from Bairstow. Full length dive on the short boundary ensures two runs are saved"
blocked
and Babar keeps the strike with a routine run through the offside
"sharp pace, and Babar's attempt to angle it to third man is unsuccessful"
"slower delivery, and Hafeez smears it with little timing through the legside. Lack of pace means they run two"
"sharp, that one doesn't get called. 90 mph whizzes past Babar's nostrils, and batsman and bowler exchange a respectful smile"
"short again, and Babar cuts on the up above backward point, leaving third man to clear up"
"<strong></strong>that was unnecessarily close. tapped and run, and a direct hit means it's <strong>touch and go</strong> for Babar. He's just made it though, and the third umpire confirms"
short and quick again. Hafeez works it down to fine leg. Here's Deiva again
"looped up on off, Hafeez stretches out and paddles it away towards fine leg"
"back of a length and on off, punched down to long-on off the back foot"
"looped up on off, Hafeez sizes it up, gets underneath this length and <strong>serenely lofts it</strong> over the bowler's head for six"
"Rashid aims for the wrong'un but loses his length. Drops short, Hafeez reads it, rocks back and pummels a pull over midwicket. Finesse followed by violence"
"front-of-the-hand slider, skips away into the gloves of the keeper as Hafeez plays and misses"
"tossed up outside off, Hafeez sweeps flat and hard to deep midwicket"
"pitched up and outside off, Hafeez stretches out, drives to sweeper, and rather gingerly runs back for the second"
"very full on middle and leg, <strong>chipped in the air</strong> to the left of short midwicket"
Babar rides the bounce of this short ball outside off and guides it away fine of deep third man
""
"very full and straight, Babar hangs back, does not connect with a flick, off the pad and rolls away to the leg side"
"back of a length and outside off, Hafeez opens the face and secures a single to deep third man - time for another drinks break"
"pushed through outside off, Hafeez drops down to one knee and sweeps flat and hard to deep square leg"
"starts outside off, turns, bounces, grazes the thigh pad and wanders away to short fine leg"
Hafeez flits around in the crease and runs this offbreak from the stumps to short third man
"short on middle, backs away and chops it wide of short third man"
"flighted just a shade outside off, Babar dashes down the track, but does not quite get hold of this. He lifts it with the break, but can't clear the boundary.  Dragged away in the air. Woakes runs in from long-on and snaps up another fine catch diving forward. Moeen's day keeps getting better"
glanced off the pads to short fine leg. 200 up for Pakistan with 17 overs left in their innings
"bouncer outside off, no shot"
"wide of the crease, Wood hits a hard length. Angling in and straightening past the outside edge"
"chest-high short ball on middle, nearly 140ks, Hafeez takes it on with a hook and beats YJB in the deep to his right and finds the square leg boundary. Superbly played, Prof"
"fuller on off, pushed to mid-off. That was <strong>clocked at 149ks - pace like fire</strong>"
"back of a length and outside off, Sarfaraz gets off the mark with a dink to point"
"full-toss swerves in on off, 146ks, Wood errs in length and Hafeez pounces onto it drilling is straight down the ground past the bowler. <strong>Hafeez brings up his fifty in style</strong>"
down the track and hacked away to deep midwicket
"short and breaks in, punched to the left of straight midwicket, where there's another fumble in the field - and it's Roy again. He now has his hands on his mouth"
"fuller and straighter on middle, tucked into the leg side for a single"
"floated up outside off, worked to midwicket"
"Hafeez steps out, Moeen drags his length back, jabbed from outside off to the covers"
"flighted on off, turns and bounces, top-edged over short fine leg's head"
"slower offcutter outside off, glided to deep third man"
"mighty full on off, not quite a yorker, though. Sarfaraz clears his front leg and hauls it away to mid-on"
"wide of the crease, zipping in at off stump, kept out"
"back of a length and <strong>zipping through outside off at 148ks</strong>, Sarfraz has a jab at this but it's too quick for him. Beaten on the outside edge"
"banged in short at off, 142ks, Sarfraz pulls it away to deep square leg, where Vince the sub fielder fumbles and lets the ball burst through his hands in the outfield"
"wide of the crease, full and veering down the leg side for a wide as Wood searches for reverse-swing"
Sarfraz gets on top of a short ball outside off and bunts a single to cover
"down the track and tucked with the break to deep square leg, where there's another misfield. Stokes this time"
tip and run to point
Sarfraz searches for some turn but this length ball slides on to beat the outside edge
"on a length and bounces outside off, Sarfraz steps back and guides to short third man"
"dragged down on off, pulled off the back foot to deep midwicket. Sarfaraz went so very deep in the crease"
"pushed through outside off, Hafeez ventures a sweep but some extra bounce foils his attempt and hits his pad"
"on a length and outside off, Sarfraz goes deep in the crease and short-arms it over midwicket. Finds the long boundary"
"short and outside off, kicks up and beats the outside edge near the shoulder of the bat"
"on the hips, glanced to fine leg"
"slower ball outside off, guided to the left of point. Roy throws himself to his left and makes a smart stop this time"
"yet another slower ball outside off, Hafeez jumps across off and laps this away to fine leg"
"lifter on middle, flies over the head of the batsman into the gloves of the keeper, wide called"
"dug in short and outside off, Sarfraz splices a pull over midwicket. Fine diving save in the outfield from YJB. He runs across to his left from deep midwicket, dives near the boundary, and swats the ball in"
"overpitched and outside off, Hafeez leans into this slower ball and creams it between the covers and mid-off. So easy on the eye..."
"this isn't as full as the previous ball, Hafeez drives on the up in the gap at the covers once again. He comes back for the second"
"on the pads, clipped away to the man at midwicket"
Sarfraz backs away and toe-ends a slog only as far as mid-on
"<strong>slower yorker from Stokes</strong>, 112ks, dips at the batsman, jammed out. Interesting variation"
"short and outside off, smacked away to deep midwicket"
Sarfraz backs away and drags this to mid-on
"little offcutter, drop and run to point"
"Sarfraz backs away, the bowler follows him, heaved to deep square leg"
Hafeez rides the bounce and guides this to deep third man
"Woakes bangs a slower ball on middle, Sarfraz lines up for a massive blow. He reads the offcutter, delays it, and swats it up and over mid-on. Played, Sarfaraz"
"Sarfaraz backs away again, off-stump yorker, squirted away to the off side"
"full, Sarfaraz slogs, but no timing and goes to mid-on"
"slow, full again, and this time Sarfaraz is prepared. Lifts it over mid-on once more after clearing the front leg. Easy boundary"
followed the batsman down the leg side. The pair scramble a run
"short ball, but the field wasn't quite set for that delivery. Hafeez swivels and pulls it effectively to a vacant square leg"
"full, but dragged down leg side. A diving stop at fine leg from Archer prevents the over's third boundary"
"low full toss, and exquisite timing from Hafeez means it nearly goes all the way to the extra cover boundary, Expensive over, and great start to the final ten for Pakistan"
"full and straight, Sarfaraz mistimes it back to the bowler"
low full toss and the batsman squeezes it into the leg side
"slow and straight, but this <strong>is masterful</strong> from Hafeez. Opens the face of the blade to loft it over a packed offside infield. Once that was cleared, it was always going for four"
"short delivery, Hafeez ducks"
"extra bounce did Hafeez there. Looked like he was expecting a fuller one, but short and wide beats the batsman"
"straighter, but Archer sticks with the short length, Hafeez pulls it to square leg for one"
"slightly legsidish, but chipped from Hafeez. What a chip, though! Excellent timing, right off the middle of the bat. No power whatsoever but struck it so cleanly it goes over the short boundary."
"fuller, and Hafeez picks it up brilliantly once again. The man at deep cover, however, lay in wait"
"thick edge, and Sarfaraz promptly gives the strike back to Hafeez"
"gorgeously struck but it's <strong>straight to Chris Woakes</strong> at long-off! England were desperate for that wicket. Well hit, but failed to manoeuvre the bat face effectively, and as a consequence it goes straight to the man in that catching position, and Pkaistan lose their fourth"
"full and straight, clatters into Sarfaraz's pads. Loud appeal, but the umpire isn't interested. Perhaps an inside edge"
"Short and wide, and Sarfaraz attempts to help it on its way, but beaten by the bounce"
"Asif's first ball flicked to the onside. A suicidal two, and a direct hit would have had Sarfaraz packing"
"too short, and the umpire calls it a wide, much to Archer's anguish"
"attempted hoick, an outside edge means it goes to third man instead"
"guided to the right of third man, and it's a comfortable two"
straight to mid-off. The off side infield is so packed it's always tempting to try and go over the top into vacant green grass
that one was exceptionally slow. Asif had time for a cuppa before he got ready to loft it over cover all the way for six.
"terrific response from the bowler. 90mph bouncer, and this one is especially well directed. Asif scrambles to get out of the way"
"slog, no timing, just falls short of a diving mid-on"
"slower ball, Asif fails to connect as it dribbles through to Buttler"
lofted over mid-off and excellent running. Asif takes advantage of a misfield by Woakes at long-off and allows Asif to come back on strike
"short ball, Asif's swing was in no way designed to connect with it."
thumped down the ground and a diving Stokes cuts it off at long-on. Not before Pakistan scamper another two
"clever ball. Sarfaraz made room and Wood goes wide of off stump. <strong>Excellent over</strong>, just five of it"
"full, slashed to long-on"
"good ball, yorker length. Asif turns it around to fine leg"
"short ball is too quick for the Pakistan captain, who top edges it into no-man's land. They come back for two, and <strong>this brings up Pakistan's 300</strong>"
"another mishit shot pays off. No timing means it doesn't carry to long-on, and the batsmen scuttle another couple. England keeping the boundaries at bay, though."
"smart thinking from Sarfaraz. Picked up what the bowler was trying to do, and only had to clear mid-off"
"oh, dear, what's happening to England?!! They're in a bit of disarray in the field. Sarfaraz sliced the ball to point, who threw it at the stumps without a man backing up in the same post code. It goes all the way to the boundary!"
"and that spells the end of Asif. Cleared his front leg and smeared it to deep cover. It went straight to Bairstow, who lets out a growl of part-joy, part frustration. He'll have to knock off these runs, you know."
"full and quick, Shoaib Malik off the mark with a glance to square leg"
"looking to get it either side of the man at 45, Straight to him, though"
and again. Adil Rashid at 45 is earning his dues right now. Another scampered single
"thumped down the ground again. No timing, as has been the case too often. Goes on the bounce to long-on"
"short, Shoaib tucks it into a little nook into the onside and another two is scurried"
sharp running again by Pakistan. Shoaib takes on the long-on fielder and beat him
"Woakes gets his man at last! Slower bouncer that Sarfaraz unwittingly scoops into the air. Woakes runs the length of the pitch and then some to take a very good catch, and Pakistan are six down"
"slower ball, well wide down the leg side"
"slower ball again, and Shoaib Malik knocks it into the onside to give the new man his first ball"
dragged his line down legside again. Easiest boundary Wahab will pick up. Got a fine touch on it to take it racing away
"and <strong>that was all</strong> she wrote for Wahab! Wild swing, but the ball skied and point gets underneath it. No fireworks from Wahab today"
nudged into the onside
"spooned to long-on, and the pair rush through for two. Hasan needed the dive to make sure he completed it"
"excellent length. The yorker locks Hasan up, and he can but turn the strike over"
"wide, and Shoaib Malik swishes at it with no luck"
"another slower ball, but Shoaib manages to guide this one to third man"
"short and wide. Hasan swings like a rusty gate, to little effect"
"and the final ball of the over ruins what's been a great one for England. Muscled over long-off and absolutely <strong>sails over the boundary</strong>. It's a short ground, but hard to explain how well that was struck. It was bludgeoned!"
"edged into the air, and while it swirled around interminably, Morgan was the man getting underneath it. Took a difficult catch while making it look very simple"
mean. Sharp bounce tonks the batsman on the helmet. Seems to be okay though
unlucky for Wood. Shadab cleared his front leg in an attempt to go to cow corner. Instead found the top edge looping over Buttler's head to an equally desirable outcome
"driven to long-on, and a poor throw by Jason Roy allows the batsman an overthrow"
"brilliant yorker, resulting in a precious dot ball. Can Pak get to 350?"
"not quite 350, but very impressive nonetheless. Smashed to long-on where a diving Roy fails to get a hand on it to prevent the boundary."
"the new ball skids on middle, plopped in the air to the right of the bowler"
"fractionally short and outside off, Roy slinks back and cracks it hard past point for four. Boom"
dirty long-hop from Shadab. He has already lost his length and head. Roy skips back again and hammers a pull to the midwicket fence
"back of a length and outside off, Roy goes on the back foot, stabbing the ball to the covers"
"another shorter legbreak, which is punched to the covers off the back foot"
"an appeal for lbw. Ambitious appeal from Shadab. Back of a length and skids off the pitch, Shadab hit the pad first before Roy got some bat onto the ball, but the impact was surely outside the line of off and that's rounds off the first over"

"<b>Shadab pins Roy in front</b>. The finger goes up, but Roy opts to challenge the on-field out decision. This looks pretty plumb, though. Pushed through on middle, Roy stretches out for a sweep, but this is too full for the shot. Has Roy snicked it? Nah, no bat involved and the UltraEdge confirms it. The tracker returns three reds and Roy has to go. It would have crashed into off stump. Tahir had got Bairstow early in the WC opener. Shadab now gets Roy. The departing batsman, however, isn't particularly happy. He has a word with umpire Erasmus before trudging off. Legspin with the new ball is England's Achilles heel"

"flicked off his pads to get himself down the other end. Good over for England this, so far."

Top innings from a top batsman. Will it turn out to be a match-winning knock?"
Amir fools Buttler with an offcutter and wheels away. Pakistan are still in this. Amir ensures they're still in this. This is the variation - the offcutter that is short and swerves away outside off.
