"slower ball, and full outside leg stump. Gill tries to play it fine, but can only clip it to the man inside the circle"
"rolls his fingers over this one, and that's been flat-batted over the bowler's head. In fact, it comes off the toe end of the bat, and that perhaps, saves him. Lands well short of Finch at long on"
"full on off and slightly swinging away. Gill drives to short extra cover but DK's halfway down the wicket! Ashwin has a shy at the stumps, but misses, which therefore allows them to take the single anyway"
"goes full and wide but it's way too wide, actually. DK pulls out of the shot and earns a free run"
"rolls his fingers over this one again, and this time DK's leg-side heave has been taken in the deep. Deceived by the (lack of) pace, and Tye at deep backward square does the rest"

"full just outside off, and Gill drills this down the ground to long on. They can't take the second, so Chawla's back on strike"
"yes, they can! Full on off stump, and Chawla drives it over the non-striker's head to long off. What an excellent final over from Tye. Can he finish off well?"
"drops the length this time. Good length on off stump, and Gill comes dancing down the wicket. Tapped towards cover, and they complete the single. <b>Knight Riders finish on 191 for 7</b>"

that's the best of the lot. On a length and subtle movement off the deck as he nearly shaves Gayle's outside edge

"full around off, clipped to mid-on"
teases Russell by foxing him into thinking he may come down the track but in reality just backs away to a slower delivery and slaps it away through point
"this one's shorter still and Gayle backs away even further.. Doesn't manage to get on top of it entirely, but manages to cart it over deep backward point"
"ah, how rushed was Gayle there? Rana just fires this in at pace on Gayle's off-stump and the batsman backs away and just about manages to bring the bat down. A fraction of a second late, and he would have been gone. Imagine if the wicket had fallen that delivery! What a strange combination of circumstances that would have been to help KKR"
