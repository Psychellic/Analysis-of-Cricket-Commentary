Pujara then chats with him, and Rahul eventually calls for a review. Is this heading down leg? Length ball, big inswinger from Woakes, catches Rahul in the crease, he plays around it and is rapped on the back pad. Ball-tracking suggests it would crash into leg stump.

"<b>has that carried to second slip?</b> KL Rahul has certainly celebrated like it has. Hard to think the soft signal will be anything other than out, given that. Yes, soft signal is out...it is a legal delivery...<b>oh this will be close!</b> There is possibility of there being a bounce and he can only possibly have fingertips under it...<b>third umpire rules he has fingertips under it!</b> Joe Root cannot believe it. Neither can the crowd. By the rules, that is the correct decision - there wasn't conclusive evidence to overturn an out decision. But it wouldn't have been overturned if it was given not out in the first place. It's that soft signal debate lurking again. That was short of a length and straightening in the corridor as Root defended inside the line. Pandya bowled from wide of the crease. Root never looked convinced, not even before the replay was taken. He was marking his guard as the review happened."

"punched away. Nice connection on this. Short ball outside off, on his toes and neatly tapped through cover"

"full and dipping in at off stump, blocked on the front foot"
<b>defended off the inside edge</b> and a big cheer from the crowd. England have survived. A full ball on middle from Ashwin and he has bat and pad very close as he plays this
"beauty to start. As he's done so often already, angles it in towards off stump, lands it on a perfect length to bring Jennings half forward in defence, and beats his outside edge with late movement"
"back of a length, drifts in too straight. Misses the flick but gets a leg-bye off his thigh pad, into the backward square leg region"
"drifts onto the pads again, a little fuller this time. A favourite area for Cook, who clips it away neatly through square leg"
"full, angling into a fourth-stump line, driven to extra-cover"
"gone, Ishant strikes in the first over. It was always on the cards - he's been testing both left-handers with his round-the-wicket angle and the ability to straighten it away from them. This one lands just short of a good length, close to off stump, and allies extra bounce with that seam away. Jennings prods at it with close to zero footwork, and sends a healthy edge through to Pant"
"length ball, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"shortish, angling down leg. Too far from Cook to connect with the tuck off his hip"
"shortish again, angling in towards off stump. Hops off the ground to ride the bounce and defend it back towards the bowler"
"whoa, how did that miss! Angled into off stump, hits a superb length and squares up Cook by straightening it against the angle. Beats the outside edge, narrowly misses off stump"
"shortish, a bit wider outside off. Jumps up and squeezes it away into the point region"
"back of a length on off stump, defended towards mid-on"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump from wide of the crease. Defended into the off side"
"shortish, angling into off stump. Hops up and defends into the covers"
"lovely. Fuller length this time, straightening towards off stump. Cook is right behind it to defend it back towards the bowler"
"fullish, fifth-stump line, draws Cook forward into a defensive push into the covers"
"a touch fuller still, and this time Cook lets his hands flow through a lovely drive through the cover point region. Wasn't a half-volley at all. Good use of the hands and got his head over the ball"
"nice response from Ishant. Continues keeping it full, along the same fifth-stump channel. Cook reads the length well - it isn't quite as full as the previous ball - and lets it go"
"gone, Ishant is on fire here! Back of a length, angling into the fourth-stump channel, straightening away. The line is so tight with off stump that it's incredibly hard to leave it. Cook plays at it, the movement finds his edge, and KL Rahul takes a comfortable chest-high catch at second slip"
"ooh, past the edge again. Back of a length outside off, but Bumrah's exaggerated inward angle forces Root into playing at it. Jags away and beats the outside edge of his defensive bat"
"and again! Virtual replay of the previous ball, and this one perhaps was angled in from even wider on the crease - no way Root could have predicted it would hold its line and left it"
"a touch fuller and closer to off stump, defended into the cover point region"
"ooh, this is good bowling. Good length, sharp angle in towards off stump. Stays back in his crease and defends into the on side"
"oh man, Root is surviving a sensational over. Good length, draws him half-forward to defend along that fourth/fifth-stump channel, and seams it away to beat the outside edge"
"well left. Fuller still, much fuller, on that fifth-stump line, and Root watches it all the way before deciding to shoulder arms"
"full inswinger on off stump and Pope loves to drive. Comes forward confidently, shows the full face, and sends it running away past the bowler's outstretched left hand"
"excellent response. He knows Pope can't resist the drive, and bowls it full, but not quite as full, and wider outside off. Tempts him into the cover drive, and beats him with the lack of inswing"
"yikes, he continues to play the drive. This was nowhere near a half-volley, and pretty far from his body, on a sixth-stump line. Reaches out and gets a thick edge - high up near the shoulder of the bat - that races away wide of third slip. India should think of bringing someone in at gully"
"back of a length, gets it to swing in quite sharply towards the batsman's hip. Defends with hard hands, gets some glove on it into the leg side - to the right of the man at short midwicket"
"fuller this time, on a good length and swinging in from outside off. Pushes forward and defends with his hands well in front of his body. Gets a thick inside-edge that rolls into the mid-on region"
"length ball close to off stump, a bit of inswing. Good stride forward to defend into the off side"
"back of a length, sharp angle in towards off and middle. Hops up and defends into the off side"
"ooh, there's that movement off the deck again. Angles in towards the fifth-stump line and then leaves Root, who plays at it, jabbing slightly away from his body, and gets beaten"
length ball angling into off stump and Root shuffles across to clip it to long leg
"shortish, fairly wide of off stump. Jabbed away to the right of backward point"
"digs it in short, but the line is well wide of off stump and Root can safely ignore it"
"shortish, angling into the fourth-stump channel. Lets it come and plays it late, with soft hands to the right of third slip"
"full, gets some inswing but starts from too straight and swings down leg. Looks to flick and misses"
"good length outside off, left alone. Swung in but started wide enough for Pope to leave fairly comfortably"
"length ball, extravagant swing into the right-hander. Shaped to play forward, perhaps looking to defend towards mid-off, and has to hurriedly adjust to try and flick. Only manages to make contact with thigh pad"
"length ball, swings in towards off stump, this time he doesn't commit early. Lets it come on and defends to mid-on"
"back of a length outside off. Pope plays it off the front foot, awkwardly, pushes at it well in front of his body and jabs it to the left of mid-on"
"full, swinging in late towards off stump. Gets his front leg out of the way and drives towards mid-off"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended towards short extra-cover"
"shortish, swinging quite appreciably and swinging down leg. Beats the inside-edge of his hurried defensive jab and hits thigh pad"

"back of a length close to off stump, jabbed towards backward point"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"length ball close to off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"back of a length, swinging down leg. Doesn't connect with the flick, rolls off thigh pad into the backward square leg region"
"lovely delivery, and well defended. Perfect length, swinging in towards the top of off stump. Pope gets a good stride in, doesn't get too closed-off with his front leg, and brings down a perfectly straight bat to block to mid-off"
"the full one, meant to be the surprise ball, swinging in towards middle stump. Pope plays it well, gets his head over the ball and flicks it away to long leg"
length ball angling into off stump. Gets on the front foot and opens his bat face to play this to backward point
back of a length on off stump. Lets it come on and defends with soft hands to the left of extra-cover
"length ball, swings in towards off stump. Presses forward and pushes it gently into the covers with soft hands. They scamper a quick single by the time extra-cover can move in"
"back of a length, angling into off stump. Plays this off the front foot, as he tends to do, defends into the on side, off the high part of the bat"
"again comes forward to a short-of-good-length delivery. Slightly wider outside off, defended into the covers"
"back of a length, closer to off stump, defended into the covers"
"length ball, wider this time, wider than a full set of stumps outside off, left alone"
"digs this one in shorter, and Pope is opened up by the inward angle as he looks to defend this on the hop. Bat comes from second slip towards mid-on, and the ball hits the outer half of it and drops down into the off side"
"too straight this time. Short again, angling into leg stump, and he gets off his feet and tucks it off his hip to the fine leg boundary"
"starts with a good ball, good length, close to off stump, and Root leaves it well, watching it warily all the way"
"length ball, a touch too straight. Flicked off a middle-and-leg line to the right of midwicket"
"good length ball on middle, Root defends with stout-hearted grace"
"glorious! He leans into a cover drive, having received the invitation to do so by a ball full and wide outside off stump. Step away, folks. England's captain is getting into this bout"
"full and straight, Root manages to nudge it towards mid-on"
"waits on it, almost to the point that it seems like he's decided to leave this shortish delivery outside the off stump. But then down comes the angled bat and away goes the ball behind point"
"swivels on the back foot, sizing up a short ball coming for his badge and hooking it safely to long let. Root took extra care to keep the ball down"
gets in line against the back of a length delivery on off stump and taps it down by his feet
"141kph, shortish and angled into the body. Pope is quite solid behind it. Physics wins"
"half an appeal for lbw, but even Bumrah knew that ball would be heading down leg. It happens with the angle from wide of the crease - but it would seem, on this occasion, he is disheartened because there is also an inside edge. Nice full length and Pope steps forward to block, falling over a tiny bit, opening himself up to scrutiny"
"good length, outside off, allows it through to the keeper"
"that bat hurries down, starting at gully where his backlift takes it, and ending up in front of his pad, in a way that exposes the leading edge. India won't mind getting a few more balls at Pope"
"flies away at a good length outside the off stump, hardly troubling Root"
judges the line expertly and lets it go outside off again. Root needs to be at his absolute best today and it looks like he's determined to do so
another quick read of the line and length - outside off and good respectively - and so he shoulders arms.
"he's made Shami target his stumps and the bowler, to his credit, doesn't offer the easy ball on the pads. Keeps it full. Targets off stump. Makes Root play. What a battle."
"<b>that's poor</b>. It's short and wide, perhaps that's why he's been sucked into playing away from his body. But he goes half-hearted. It's not a cut shot. It's a steer, for perhaps a single. And he <B>nearly nicks off</b>"
"back of a length and outside off, Root dabs it to third man"
"uses the depth of the crease, and his soft hands, to absorb all the pace on this short ball. It wanders away towards midwicket as Root looks for a single. Pope says no. And obviously that's that."
opens the face and guides a shortish delivery outside off towards cover point
"back of a length on middle, defends"
"appeal for caught behind as and Root tries to carve it behind point, but the attempted yorker sneaks beneath the bottom edge"
<b>beats him</B> as Root strides forward to meet a fuller delivery slanted into the top of off stump. But Bumrah manages to get just enough seam away from the deck to cause problems
"<b>nearly carries to mid-on</B>! And it's off a full toss too. That would have been tame. Root steps into a little flick, perhaps hoping to get the gap to the right of Ashwin."
"shortish and outside off, Pope won't give it his blessing or his bat"
"fullish on off stump, Pope stretches out to meet it with a straight bat"
"<b>inside edge</b> as he comes forward to a back of a length ball, and tentatively at that."
<b>tight leave</B> but he does move his front foot across to protect the off stump so that he wouldn't be bowled by this good length ball
pulls his length back a touch and that gives Pope an extra millisecond to judge that it's outside off and he needn't play
"adjusts to the late seam movement away, and the sharp bounce, that Shami gets on this delivery in the corridor as he guides this ball towards point"
"another appeal, this time only from the cordon, as a full length delivery crashes into Root's pads. They eventually cotton on to the fact that Root has inside edged it as he stretched forward to defend"
"yorker, probing for off stump. Root digs it out well"
"<b>superb catch at second slip</B>! This is a thick edge, with Root pushing hard at a shortish delivery, wide enough to be left alone, but Bumrah's angle lures Root into playing. It always lures right-handers into playing. The outside edge flies to Rahul's right. It's nearly past him as he thrusts out both of his hands, eyes on the ball all the way, and takes it like an absolute boss. Splendid work! Five catches for KL, all at second slip."
"shortish on and around off stump, Stokes defends under his eyes"
covers the line as the ball comes in at his off stump and presents the full face
"pitches it a little fuller, drawing Stokes forward, and quite reluctantly. This is good bowling from India. Their control of line and length. The tiny bit of movement there after. None of it is letting the batsman have an easy time out there"
"<b>another sensational grab</b> This time it's Kohli leaping to his left from third slip, hands in the reverse-cup position, stretching high above his head seeking the ball, and it sticks! Superb reflexes from the Indian captain. And he comes into play because Pope plays a very poor shot. Soon after he sees his senior partner depart, he throws his hands at a full delivery so very wide outside his off stump. The edge results. It was the only thing that could result."
"full, outside off, Buttler does what he should and doesn't play"
"he's tempted into a shot, simply by the fact Shami keeps putting balls in the corridor. Eventually the alarm bells ring and he yanks his bat away from danger"
half-volley on the pads and Buttler whips it away to long leg
"full and outside off, Stokes jabs it into the covers"
"good length on off stump, he blocks it"
"slants into the pads, with the angle from around the wicket, and Stokes picks it away to long leg"
"back of a length and coming in towards off stump, Buttler knocks it down"
"lets it go having judged this ball to be short enough to pose no threat to the stumps, not to mention wide outside off too"
"<b>dropped</B> by Pant, and it's because he moves the wrong way and then has to compensate. Bumrah's angle upsets batsman, we know that. But here it upsets the keeper. Pant moves to his left. Then spots the outside edge as Buttler is forced to play. The line is too close to off stump to leave. A hint of movement  takes the outside edge - a fairly thick one - and Pant, despite a full-length dive, can't catch up with it"
"fuller delivery on off stump, defends into the covers"
"full and outside off, he steps across to defend"
"short and outside off, Buttler leaves"
"pitches it up, gets the ball to swing away, Buttler does well to leave it outside off"
"good length on off stump, keeps it out"
keeps it straight and by virtue of that makes the batsman play. Buttler defends from the crease
"<b>beats him</b> with a lovely delivery, nice and full, around the fourth stump line. Buttler comes forward to block but the seam movement away is just too much"
"shortish and outside off, Buttler lets it run off his open face to point"
"full on off stump, Stokes defends"
"the change in his length is quite heartening. He's only two balls into a spell and it's already right up there, drawing Stokes forward on off stump"
"looks to flick against the angle, and in these conditions that's a risky shot. Stokes checks it a tiny bit and that's why the ball goes back down the ground"
<B>nearly</B>! Pandya hits a good length and the extra zip on the ball fetches movement off the pitch. Stokes lunges forward to block and he's soundly beaten
"<b>outside edge</b> as Pandya plays with the angle across the left-hander, while keeping his length very very full. Stokes defends with soft hands and it goes down to gully"
"full and outside off, Stokes leaves. A fine first over from India's allrounder"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"good length, outside off, Buttler leaves and Pant isn't able to collect it behind the stumps"
"shortish and outside off, Buttler is starting to judge these better. Leave, leave, leave"
he waits for the good length ball to come to him before using his wrists and sending it to midwicket
"good length, and a good distance outside off as well. Buttler's happy to let all of these pass"
"fullish and outside off, Buttler gets that front foot going this time as he blocks to cover"
full on off stump as Pandya goes around the stumps at the left-hander. Stokes defends
"presses forward, as a response to a full delivery outside off, and then leaves it wisely"
too wide outside off to interest Stokes
"fullish and outside off, ignores it"
"makes him play by targeting off stump and Stokes does so well enough, offering the straight bat"
"drifting into the pads off a good length, Stokes flicks it to square leg."
"fullish and in the corridor, Buttler's survival instincts are strong. Lets it go"
back of a length and outside off. No work for Buttler. More work for Pant
"back of a length and outside off, steers it into the covers"
"<b>outside edge</b> and it wanders off unchecked to the third man boundary. Buttler gets the runs but India don't seem to mind. Shami bowling full, and hunting for the off stump, is always a sight to see"
leaves it alone outside off
"<b>beats him</b> as the line forces Buttler to play. The ball starts shaping into the right-hander, so he gets back and across to defend. Then it hits the pitch and darts away"
starts around the wicket to Stokes with a tossed up ball on middle. The left-hander blocks
"loops it up on off stump, Stokes is careful to dead bat it"
"lobs it up onto middle and leg, Stokes defends. That issue with his hip is still preventing him from giving the ball a proper rip"
goes back to a good length ball on off stump and nudges it towards short leg (which has vanished)
"shapes to defend, the bat in front of pad, and that results in an inside edge wandering away to long leg. Ashwin's length here is perfect. It's full, but Stokes can't get to the pitch of it"
"draws him forward outside the off stump, but just as Buttler thinks he is to the pitch of the ball, it dips, turns and swindles his inside edge"
wallops the short and wide delivery with a pull shot and wakes up a sullen crowd
Kohli dives to his right at third slip to stop and outside edge from scurrying away to the boundary
"<b>inside edge</b> and Shami's pace takes the ball away to the fine leg boundary. Buttler might have got no runs had he middled this - he was only trying to defend, but the movement off the pitch helps him out"
"risky, but he fancies this full and wide delivery. Goes after it with a cover drive and Rahane's there, diving full length, his body parallel with the ground, right hand stretching out to coax the ball into it. But it's just that inch too far away. Spectacular effort"
<b>leaves the ball and gets hit on the pads</b>. Too high for an lbw shout. But it is clear England's batsmen are rattled. They're stuck in the crease. They keep being caught out by the late movement. And India's fast bowlers have been relentless with their lines and lengths
"good length ball on middle, defends"
"quicker through the air, drifting into the left-hander. Stokes lunges forward to defend"
"slides it through - at a much slower pace - onto leg stump. Stokes defends, bringing his bat around his pad"
"good length on off stump, the slowest of the three balls so far, Stokes defends"
"loopy delivery on middle, Stokes blocks"
goes back to block a good length ball on off stump
"that's the arm ball, starting well wide outside off, and so Stokes leaves. <b>That's lunch</B>"
"starts with a fairly friendly delivery - well wide of off stump, back of a length - and Buttler leaves it alone"
"and again, hits that seventh-stump line - I don't think it's deliberate, he's probably just getting warmed up. Buttler leaves again"
"not yet. Fuller, and a bit of inswing too, but it finishes on a fifth-stump line and Buttler leaves again"
"beaten. Forces him into playing with his inward angle, into the fourth-stump channel, and then straightens it past his outside edge. Excellent length too, Buttler only managed a half-stride forward"
"length ball swinging into off stump, clipped to midwicket"
"testing stuff this, shapes in late towards off stump. Buttler clips it to midwicket, ensuring he doesn't get his front pad in the way"
"length ball slanting away from off stump, left alone"
"full now, on off stump, Stokes clips to mid-on. He was looking for more swing, I think, and aiming towards midwicket, and ended up playing with the outside half of his bat"
"slants it wider this time, nice length. Stokes ignores it"
"full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"takes a couple of steps down the pitch, probably just to get closer to the pitch of it and narrow the swing. It's immaterial with this ball, because Pandya's slanted it waaay wide of off stump"
"fullish length, pitching just outside off stump and slanting further away, defended into the covers"

"fullish, fairly wide of off stump, left alone"
"back of a length, again very wide of off stump. Buttler ignores it"
"full outside off and Shami potentially saves four runs there. Nice stride forward from Buttler, gets to the pitch of it and drives firmly to the left of extra-cover, and Shami cuts it off with a full-length dive"
"some movement now, from just short of a length. Straightens in towards Stokes' right hip and he doubles up while trying to flick it, hurriedly. Can't connect, suffers a blow to the midriff"
"fullish on middle stump, driven to mid-on"
"full outside off, and Stokes stretches out to drive. Ends up hitting it a touch too early and mistiming it. Rolls gently to the right of mid-off and he picks up his first run in... a long time"
"ooh, beauty. Good length, brings Buttler forward to defend - the angle was in towards off stump - and it straightens off the seam to beat the outside edge"
"and again, gets it to straighten late. Was angling into middle stump this time and Buttler was looking to flick this. Nearly closed his face on it but adjusts and plays it back to the bowler off the outside half of the bat"
"length ball, straightens towards the top of off stump. Defended back to the bowler"
"full, nearly in the blockhole, angling into off stump, defended into the on side"
"fullish, angling into off stump. Stokes drives down the ground and Shami, running to his right from mid-on, doesn't bend down enough to stop this ball. Chases back to mop up, and ends up tripping on his own feet as well"
"on the fuller side of a good length, angling in but not enough to make Buttler play, ends up on a fifth/sixth-stump line"
"length ball on off stump, nice stretch forward to defend into the covers"
"length ball close to off stump, but still offering just a hint of width to Buttler, who gets forward, gets his head on top of the ball, and transfers his weight neatly through a punch to the left of extra-cover, from where Jadeja chases hard but in vain"
"length ball outside off, defended to mid-off"
"fullish, pitching on off stump and slanting away, looking to tempt Stokes into a drive away from his body. Stokes resists the temptation"
"length ball slanting across into the corridor. Stokes gets a big stride forward to defend, plays it into the on side off the inside half of the bat. Played a touch early, I think"
"full on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"nice length, fifth-stump line with the added threat of the round-the-wicket angle, Stokes leaves it alone"
"and again, a nice line - wide-ish, but still angling inwards - and pretty full. Stokes leaves again"
this one's slanted in towards off stump and Stokes steps across to clip to midwicket
"bangs it short outside off, gets up to just under shoulder height, and Stokes can roll his wrists over the pull and keep it down nicely towards long leg"
"a touch too straight for once, from Ishant. Drifts onto the pads and Stokes flicks it away to the left of the square leg umpire"
"full, angling in towards off stump. Good stride forward to block into the covers"
"length ball angling into off stump and Stokes' feet are beginning to move really well here. Gets his head on top of the ball and shows the full face to punch down the ground. Bounces into the pitch, and past the outstretched left hand of the leaping bowler"
"good length again, but marginally shorter than the previous one, homing in on the top of off stump. Ishant has made these small changes of length effortlessly today. Defended to mid-on"
"and again, brings Stokes forward without giving him the option of the drive. A touch further outside off stump and Stokes defends towards mid-off"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, defended to that unorthodox short mid-on fielder"
"full on off stump, driven to cover"
"shot. Into the gap between cover and mid-off. A half-volley outside off, and he makes the most of it with a decisive stride forward and smooth swing through the line"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, clipped to midwicket"
"good ball, excellent leave. Having been driven twice, he continues to bowl it full outside off, but this is well short of a driving length. Buttler judges the length well and shoulders arms"
"back of a length, angling in from wide of the crease towards off stump. Defended into the point region"
"length ball close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"length ball, slants this one well down leg"
"length ball, fourth-stump line. Stokes takes a positive stride forward and punches through mid-off with the full face showing. No one in that area, so short extra-cover has to chase back"
"back of a length wide of off stump, left alone"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, good stride forward to push into the covers"
"change of angle causes him to lose his line, starts with one down the leg side. Stokes makes no effort to play it"
"fullish, slanting across to a fourth-stump line, and Stokes - as he has been doing for the last few overs - gets an excellent stride forward to defend, straight back down the pitch"
"full on middle stump, clipped to short midwicket"
"tossed up outside off now, driven to the left of mid-off"
"tossed up on off stump, presses forward to defend with the turn"
"nice flight close to off stump, big stretch forward to get close to the pitch and defend"
"tossed up slow on leg stump, clipped away into the vacant midwicket region. Mid-on does the chasing. Stokes picks up two and brings up the fifty-run partnership"
"fullish on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"short, angling into off stump. Does this stop on Buttler? Maybe. He's into his pull a little early and checks himself. Gets enough bat on it to clear the fielder at midwicket"
shortish in the corridor. Gets on top of the bounce and defends towards backward point
"back of a length, wider this time, left alone"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, defended back towards the bowler. Looks like Bumrah's overstepped. Not by much, the replay suggests"
"length ball outside off, Buttler is a little late deciding to leave, and the ball hits his withdrawn bat and rolls towards second slip"
"<b>edged</b>, and it falls wide of the keeper and short of first slip. Lovely delivery, fullish in the fourth-stump channel and jagging away off the seam. Buttler plays for Bumrah's angle, looking to drive down the ground, and gets a thick edge. Pant throws himself to his right, and it drops short of him and ends up wide of his outstretched glove too. He did take a step to his left this time as well, as he did when he dropped Buttler a little earlier, but this time it may not have made as much of a difference"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"ooh, some turn and bounce here. Stokes not quite close to the pitch as he presses forward to defend this one outside off. Fairly quick and flat, and he gets sharp turn to beat the edge"
"a bit fuller, defended into the cover point region"
"and again, rips past the outside edge. The pace was fairly quick, giving Stokes very little time to get a stretch in, and then it spun away sharply to beat his edge"
"slower and fuller, driven to short extra-cover"
"ooh, good ball. Good leave too. Angled in and tossed up pretty slow outside off. Stokes leaves it alone, and it doesn't spin as much as the two that beat him, provoking some oohs and aahs from the close-in fielders"
"speared in full outside off, and Stokes shuffles across and defends hurriedly, losing his balance in the process"
"and again, <b>the ball doesn't carry</b>. Back of a length, straightens on a wide-ish line. Could have left it, but ended up playing for the angle and jabbing hard at it. Thick edge, but it falls well short of first slip. Bumrah asks Pujara to come in a couple of steps"
"fuller now, outside off, left alone"
"length ball, straightens slightly along that fifth-stump channel. Buttler leaves this time"
"shortish outside off, left alone"
"short again, a little wider than the previous one, Buttler leaves again. Steep bounce through to Pant, who takes it over his head"
"full this time, and he draws the drive away from the body from Buttler. Only three slips, no gully. The ball straightens and causes him to slice it wide of third slip, but probably wide of where a gully might have been too"
"tosses it up onto off stump, Stokes comes forward to smother it, which is good since there are two slipps and a silly point waiting for the edge"
"well, there's something different. For the longest time these two batsmen have been content concentrating on defence. Here, Stokes premeditates a lap sweep, seeing fine leg open, and gets a couple of runs for his benefit. Ashwin, struggling with his hip, has something extra to think about."
goes right back - and has to because he's mistaken the flatter trajectory to mean this is a fuller ball. Just about gets the bat down in time
"flights it up outside off, lures Stokes forward with a prod, and the turn he's getting - even when not 100% - <b>beats the bat</b>"
<b>appeal for a catch off the boot and the umpires are checking on it</b>. It all comes off a good length ball that Stokes comes forward to defend and replays show quite clearly that the ball has bounced over to silly point
it's a touch short and that allows Stokes the easy put-away. A whip through midwicket
"back of a length on off stump, Buttler defends and secures a single behind square leg courtesy an inside edge"
gets forward to a back of a length delivery angled across him - Bumrah's shifted back over the wicket - and blocks
"shortish on the hips, Stokes works it away to midwicket"
"bright sunshine at Trent Bridge, making Stokes look pretty as he flicks to midwicket"
"<b>appeal for lbw</B> but this has surely pitched outside leg. Nevertheless, Bumrah has Stokes in trouble with his pace and as a result, a bit of extra bounce. The left-hander is slow to getting the bat around both his feet, which are stuck on the crease, and is struck on the thigh ans the ball lobs over to Kohli at third slip"
"good length, but it slips down leg as Stokes flicks and misses"
tosses it up on off stump - and when it's in line with the stumps there's no rough for the ball to turn out off. Buttler defends neatly
targets the rough outside off this time and a puff of dust comes out. Buttler manages to control it well with a forward defensive
"good length on middle, clips it to midwicket"
"clatters it to the square leg boundary! What a shot! He gets down low seeing a slow, loopy delivery outside off. The room on offer lets Stokes sweep it away with immense power"
pushes it through on middle and Stokes nearly has to dig it out of the blockhole
"takes good care to keep that front leg out of the way, opening it up so he can flick another near-yorker away through straight midwicket. Stokes, who wasn't happy with Ashwin outside his off stump, is feasting on balls that are too straight."
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"nice and full outside off, Buttler looks for the extra-cover drive, but the ball pings off a slightly closed face onto his boot and then over to cover"
"full and outside off, Buttler pushes into the covers"
"shortish and outside off, from over the wicket, Stokes lets it pass"
"slants across the left-hander, with the length full as well. Stokes tries a drive and gets an inside edge onto his pad."
"walked at a length ball, which angled away from him, opened the face, and it went to the diving third slip on the bounce"
"full and outside off, Buttler pushes to cover"
uses his wrists to turn a full delivery on middle to short midwicket
stays inside the line and forces his hands through a quicker delivery outside off - it's pretty much a half-volley too - and he times it to perfection through the covers
"<B>turn out of the footmarks</b> and it foils Buttler's attempt to back away and hammer what originally looks like a short ball outside off. Instead, it becomes an inside edge to midwicket"
"a touch short and outside off, Buttler thumps it to cover"
"tosses it up on middle and leg, Buttler taps it to short leg"
slashes at a short and wide delivery and gets a thick bottom edge away through the cordon
"<b>extra bounce</b> and it strikes Stokes on the glove. He tries his best to keep it from going to hand, but the ball does travel a good distance in the air towards point"
"back of a length on off stump, Stokes slices it into the covers"
"keeps getting sharp bounce, this one hitting the very top of Buttler's bat as he blocks off the back foot"
"fullish and outside off, Buttler gets forward to block"
"<b>raps him on the pads</b>, but Bumrah knows it would be sliding down leg. Very quick delivery, speared into middle and leg. It's got enough venom to have a set batsman falling over while playing a flick. But that's all it does. Not quite wicket-taking, possibly because it strayed into leg a little bit more than Bumrah wanted it to."
"nice flight on middle, Stokes reaches out to smother it"
"shifts back in his crease, playing off the trajectory, which is is flat. The length, however, is still full. And Stokes is in plenty of bother as he defends"
<b>review for lbw</b> as Ashwin gets a straight one past Stokes' inside edge. Replays indicate there is no bat. And ball-tracking says it pitches on a good length on middle and goes on with the arm. Would only have clipped leg stump and so it is one-field umpire's call.
nudges it towards the vacant areas at midwicket
"very full and very straight, Buttler nearly yorks himself by going on the front foot and whipping to short midwicket"
"full and outside off, Buttler lets it slide off an open face as he stretches forward to meet it. Single to cover"
"serenely driven through the covers to bring up a much needed fifty for both the player and his team. Well played, Jos Buttler. He came in when India's fast bowlers were in menacing form, snatching edges off every delivery. And he's brought some calm to proceedings, with shots like these too, leaning forward to a full delivery outside off and nailing it through the covers"
"good length on off stump, Buttler denies it from getting at the stumps"
spots the line to be outside off very early and lets it go very wisely
"full and outside off, inviting the drive, Buttler's not quite ready to be that expansive yet"
"back of a length on off stump, Buttler defends"
"<b>no third slip</b> and Bumrah can only stare in frustration as the outside edge he wrangles by keeping his length so admirably full skips away to the boundary. It does go low though, almost hugging the ground, so perhaps it might not have been a chance even if a fielder had been there"
"draws him forward into a drive. Stokes is playing away from his body, and he isn't to the pitch of this offbreak from around the wicket"
""
"gets right behind a tossed up delivery on middle and leg. Buttler wants a single as the ball wanders towards square leg but Stokes, rightly, says no. Pant, the wicketkeeper, catches up to the ball in no time"
"goes for the sweep, but there is neither the room to power it away, nor is the length conducive. It's a touch too full and so gets the inside edge onto pad"
puts his bat in front of pad to keep out this offbreak on middle
"lobs it up outside off, Stokes drives to cover"
"gets the ball to curl in the air and off the pitch as well, forcing Buttler to shift himself to the leg side a bit and flick behind square leg"
"goes searching for the drive, and realises that would leave him playing away from the body. Stokes checks the shot and also manages to pick the gap between cover and mid-off. Brings up the <b>100 partnership</b>"
"huge appeal, but umpire Erasmus shakes his head. Kohli and Shami have a quick chat and India go for the <b>review again</b>. Splendid bowling though. <b>Shami is getting reverse</b>, the pitched-up ball swerving into the right-hander, and late, leaving Buttler in a very awkward, closed-off position as he tries to flick. Ironically, the movement that puts the batsman in trouble takes the ball down leg. Ball-tracking says it would miss leg stump. India lose the review"
"fuller delivery outside off, stabs it to cover"
"more reverse, and this time he lines it up on off stump too, making the inswing all the more threatening. Buttler, as he needs to, plays with a straight bat to mid-on"
"good length on off stump, Buttler blocks"
he is very reluctant to come forward the moment the ball is flat in trajectory. Ashwin still manages to send those deliveries right up to the batsman
"angles it into middle and leg, and Stokes opens himself up as he looks to defend, playing for the turn and being beaten on the inside edge"
"loops it up outside off, daring Stokes to hit out through the off side. He does, sending a drive to cover"
""
<b>big turn</b> as the quicker delivery hitting the footmarks outside the left-hander's off stump and darts away past Stokes' defensive prod
"pushes it through on middle and leg, Stokes is quite happy to shift his weight back and flick it to short leg"
"<b>massive swing into the right-hander</b>. Shami is definitely having some fun out there, pitching the ball right up there, close to even a yorker length. Buttler works with the movement and flicks to long leg"
"full and a shade outside off, Stokes defends with as soft hands as possible"
"back of a length and outside off, Stokes leaves"
"goes wide of the crease to get the ball to swing into Stokes, who does well to put a straight bat in front of pad. Lbws become a prime way to dismiss batsmen when the ball is reversing and both Stokes and Buttler are trying to prevent that"
"<b>holds its line this time</b> outside off and Stokes, worried by the reverse, reaches out away from his body to defend it. Lucky not to nick off"
"full and on off stump, defends"
a little too much flight there and Buttler crashes it through extra cover having got to the ball on the full.
"tosses it up on off stump, Buttler gets inside the line to drive to mid-off"
leans into another pretty-looking drive. Buttler's footwork to spin is impressive. He's getting inside the line to open up the off side and he's only going for the drive against the turn after getting ot the pitch of the ball
""
lunging outside the off stump to drive a well flighted delivery outside off to the left of mid-off
"good length on middle and off, Stokes defends gently"
"full on off stump, Buttler drives to mid-off. Commendable cricket from these two. They've sized up the ball is reversing. They know their stumps are in danger. And so they are playing as straight as they can"
"shortish and outside off, lets it go"
he can ignore this one too seeing as its a good distance outside off. Shami's cranking it up though - hits 90 mph - which is quite useful when the ball is reversing
"<b>sensational</b>! The perfect inswinging yorker. And geez, it moves so much! The ball starts well outside off and then changing direction to hunt down Buttler's stumps. Good job by the batsman to keep it out, again by playing straight"
"<b>this reverses away</b> and Buttler, standing quite still in his crease, sends it away through the covers."
"full on off stump, Buttler works it through to the right of mid-on. <b>That's tea</b>, and it's a bit disappointing because the action was properly hotting up"
length ball angling in towards off stump. Stays on the back foot to defend it back towards the bowler
"ooh, looks for the yorker. Gets it right up there on off stump and Buttler responds with a hurried whip. Just about digs it out and sends it rolling through square leg"
"back of a length, pitching on or around leg stump but the angle from right-arm over is so exaggerated that it still ends up as a fairly straightforward leave outside off for Stokes"
"full, slanting away much wider and pitching well outside off. Stokes gets a big stride out to drive to mid-off. Wanted to hit through the covers but played a little early and dragged it with his bottom hand"

"shortish, angling across to off stump, gets back and across to defend into the covers"

"back of a length on middle stump, clipped towards midwicket"
"nice length, pushes it up fuller. Pitching on or around off stump and slanting away with the angle. Good leave"
"length ball slanting across to off stump, may have straightened a teeny bit too. Nicely punched to mid-off, ensured he didn't get opened up too far by the angle"
"back of a length on off stump, hops to ride the bounce and defend back to the bowler"

"length ball, a bit of swing in towards off stump. Defended into the covers"
"back of a length, fifth-stump line. Lets it come on and defends towards backward point"

"full again, this time the line ends up a touch too straight and Buttler clips it away to the fine leg boundary"
"edged, safely wide of second slip. No third slip, but it would probably have gone wide of that fielder too, and fallen short of fourth slip or gully. Nice length, Buttler ends up playing half-forward as this swings in from the fifth-stump channel. Plays with an open face, but doesn't go too hard at it, and it runs away to the third man boundary"

"back of a length, close to off stump. Lets it come on and defends with soft hands into the gully region"

"and there it is, maiden Test hundred! A poor over from Shami, gets worse with a gimme ball on the pads, and Buttler clips it away to the backward square leg boundary and switches on the applause from all corners of this ground.

"ooh, dangled up again but it drops down much fuller, almost a yorker on middle stump. Gets his front pad out of the way and jams his bat down on it"
"full again, on off stump, defended into the off side"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to the left of extra-cover"
"length ball close to off stump, defended towards that man at extra-cover again"
"back of a length outside off, a tiny bit of shape away, left alone"
"nice length, again some shape away from the right-hander, but starts on the fifth stump and Buttler can leave without too much worry"
"well bowled. Plugs away on that fifth-stump line and hopes for Buttler to play away from his body. Leaves it well alone, and wisely so - this one swung away as well"
"shorter now, some width too, punched to deep point"
"back of a length and outside off, Buttler doesn't want anything to do with it"
"holds its line outside off, but the fact that it is wide out there means Buttler won't be flirting with it."
"<b>falls short of mid-off</b> as Buttler goes for a strange punch. The ball is rising on him outside off, but he feels he's set and he takes it on. Just about falls short of Shami"
"shortish and outside off, pats it to cover"
<b>so close to off stump</b> as Buttler leaves! Bumrah's angle from wide of the crease is enabled with some seam movement into the right-hander too. Phew. That was...
"full and tailing into the right-hander, Buttler jams his bat down and sends it to mid-on"
works it off his hips and appears keen on a second too. Proves a bit risky. Forces him to dive. England are feeling a properly adventurous.
"good length, pushed across the left-hander. Stokes is quite content to avoid contact"
"pitches it right up on off stump, Stokes defends warily and gets a thick outside edge to deep point"
"<b>too much movement</b>, beating Buttler's flick and comfortably evading the diving Pant behind him"
"shortish and outside off, pushes to cover"
that's too wide and it's an easy leave. India's lines have been a bit off in this last session
dabs a short delivery angling across him over to point
nice and tight in defence as he waits for the back of a length ball to come to him on middle stump. That's been a feature of this innings. He's not reached out too often. He's not been sucked into playing away from his body
<b>lbw while leaving the ball</b>! Buttler reviews. He has to. But he won't find much joy here. It's very full. It's always heading towards the stumps. Very very strange that he'd leave this ball. Pins him on the knee roll. And ball-tracking says it would clip middle stump. Umpire's call - and Gaffaney had said it was out. So Buttler has to go. India find the wicket they've been looking for all afternoon and the Trent Bridge crowd rises as one to applaud a fine cricketer who might just have fallen in love with Test cricket all over again
"<b>rip-snorting ball of pure awesomeness</b>. Bairstow might have been at his absolute best and he wouldn't have been able to do anything against this peach. It angles into the right-hander, lulling him into thinking he would have to block around middle and leg. Then it pitches and holds its line. Such trickery, Such devious glorious trickery. India have clearly made the right call with the new ball, which has crashed into off stump with a vengeance"
goes for the yorker. it ends up a low full toss and it screams away through midwicket. Can't have everything.
"full on middle and off, Woakes gives it the straight-bat treatment. And that's the end of an over that's perked all of India up"
"shortish on off stump, Stokes pulls, but checks the shot, as the ball wanders off to midwicket"
"ties a rose to this flirty delivery outside off, Stokes refuses to be enticed as easily"
"back of a length on middle, defends"
"fullish on off stump, blocks"
pitches it too far outside leg and Stokes ticks it away to the long leg boundary
"shortish and outside off, Stokes blocks in front of point"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
nails a drive as Bumrah pitches it right up on middle. The fielder at mid-on does quite well to stop it
works it off his hips to deep square leg
<b>caught behind</b>! The inswinger. An outswinger. And now a bouncer. Bumrah's just showing off. He's in a monster mood and he's showing off. Woakes has an issue with the short ball. He fell to one in the first innings. And this time he's faced with the same old scary thing. Except this is quicker. And it's coming right for his head. He doesn't have time to get out of the way. He tries to fend. He tries so hard. But all he does is glove it through to Pant.
"shortish and outside off, Rashid pokes to cover"
"bouncer again, this time a bit wide outside off, allowing Rashid to let it go"
good length - which is fine - but the ball is far too wide outside off to trouble a set batsman
"full and outside off, drives to cover"
"fullish on off stump, Stokes defends"
"<b>beats him</b> with an absolute corker, pitching on middle and leg and going away with the angle, past Stokes' outside edge"
"<b>squares him up and takes him out</b>! Stokes' fight. All of his application. Undone by the new ball. One that pitches outside leg, forcing him to think about playing through midwicket. Then it darts away off the seam to take the leading edge and settle in the hands of second slip. England are wilting in the face of some sensational bowling and this shiny little red thing."
"good length on leg stump, Broad flicks it past short leg"
"looks for the yorker on leg stump. Broad tries to work it through midwicket, but gets a leading edge instead"
punches the back of a length delivery on off stump towards the cover boundary
"taken in the slips again and <B>Bumrah has five</b>. Jasprit Bumrah, who until the South Africa tour was seen as a one-day specialist, is leading India towards one of their most famous Test wins.... Oooh but wait, they're looking on his front foot. Has he <B>no-balled</b>? The third umpire is looking at extremely zoomed-up replays. His foot is practically filling the screen. Well, it kinda is. And the longer it takes to make this decision, the more Bumrah will feel anxious. He's bowled a pretty decent ball - shortish and outside off, drawing Rashid into playing away from his body. The outside edge is pouched by Kohli. But all to no avail as it is called no-ball."
"goes short and at the body, Rashid  works it away to fine leg"
"short and on middle, Rashid blocks"
"short and outside off, Rashid slaps it through point. He's timing em beautifully. And there's plenty of space out there. It's the slips that are packed with people."
goes for the bouncer to end the over. Rashid plays a hook which really was never going to come off
<b>beats</b> the outside edge with Broad stuck in the crease despite Pandya bowling pretty full and outside off
"back of a length on off stump, Broad keeps a little leg side of it and pushes to mid-off"
"full and outside off, Broad drives to mid-off"
"bouncer, down leg though, Broad ducks underneath"
"goes short and angles it across the left-hander. Broad almost ducks into the line of the ball. For a second or so, he was in danger of getting a proper clang on his helmet"
"short on middle and leg, Broad taps it down to short leg"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks to cover"
flirts with a shortish delivery outside off and is beaten
"full on off stump, Rashid gets his bat down in time"
throws his bat at this - loving the width on offer - and hammers the back of a length ball to the cover boundary
"top edge sails away, over the boundary behind him. Rashid's having fun. Or he's making up for not getting to do anything at Lord's"
"goes around the wicket and keeps bouncing him, but Rashid is more than happy to take it on. Hooks to deep square leg"
a hint of movement off the pitch gets Rashid squared up as he plays the angle into him. A little seam away gets the edge. Doesn't carry to gully though
"lunges at a length ball outside off, looking to smash it through extra cover. No luck"
whips it with absolute class to the square leg boundary! This man has first-class hundreds. Plenty of them and he's showing just why. What a flick of the wrists. There's some fight left in this yet...
"full and outside off, Rashid goes after it, and is comfortably beaten"
"searches for a wide one outside off, playing cover drive after cover drive, but he's beaten again"
he's playing around his front pad as he tries to glance a full and straight delivery down to fine leg. No contact with bat. Would have gone down leg after if it hadn't struck pad
"full on off stump, Rashid keeps it out"
"<b>beauty</b>. Rashid slinks towards leg, defending from the crease and is no match for the back of a length delivery holding its line and almost sailing right over off stump"
"shortish and outside off, glides it to backward point"
that bat whirls over the short ball outside off and sends it screaming to deep square leg
"goes around the wicket for a fullish delivery on leg stump, Broad tries to clip it away, but it comes off the pad instead"
"<b>dropped</b> by Kohli, but this ball is travelling, which happens when Rashid is swinging without a care in the world. Sees a full ball outside off and throws his hands at it. The edge flies to the right of third slip and bursts through the hands"
slaps a shortish delivery outside off through point
"bangs it in short and wide, Broad thinks about cutting, but then lets it go"
"goes short, keeping it just outside off, Broad drops his wrists to make sure he survives"
swings it away to the fine leg boundary as Ishant keeps going short
clears the front leg and pulls the banged-in delivery away to the midwicket boundary. He's expecting these. He's set up for there. And he's clattering these. At least when they come at ishant's pace
"backs away, exposing his stumps, and they are only just left standing as Ishant pitches it on a good length and targets them"
looks for the back foot punch but Shami gets some movement away off the pitch and beats the edge again. This innings from Rashid's been thrill-a-minute
slides it down the leg side and Pant isn't quite able to gather it because of the wobble
clears that front dog and goes bang at a good length ball outside off. Only an inside edge onto pad results
ducks in sharply off the seam as Shami hits the deck outside off. Broad manages to tap it to cover
"goes full and straight, Broad continues moving to leg and drives to mid-off"
"slower ball outside off, Broad carves it away to the point boundary and Shami flashes a totally bemused smile, as if he is wondering how this is all happening, wondering how this England batting tallies with the one that keeps losing four wickets in a clump"
"pushes forward to block outside the off stump, but this delivery, the undercutter, just goes straight on, past the edge"
"good length ball on off stump, Rashid pads up"
"<b>breaks away from the right-hander</b>. The one with the seam up, delivered with just one finger behind the ball. Rashid leaves it"
""
lunges forward to the tossed up delivery on off stump and blocks
"<b>there's the outswinger again</b> and it's epic! Angled into the right-hander, pitching on middle, as Anderson is known to do, then curls away so insanely that it misses the outside edge and the stumps"
half an appeal for lbw as Broad shuffles across to flick the back of a length delivery through midwicket. Umpire Gaffaney thinks it would be going down leg
"bouncer, angled into the left-hander. Broad ducks under it"
"shortish and outside off, Broad lets it go"
"good length on middle, Broad defends"
"full and outside off, doesn't bother with it"
"goes for the yorker, swinging into Broad from outside off, but the left-hander does well to keep his eyes on the ball, get in position deep in his crease and slice it behind point"
"good length offbreak outside off, Broad lets it go"
"spears in the arm-ball, swinging into the left-hander. Broad defends tentatively and gets an inside edge through midwicket. And that's the <B>fifty partnership</b>!"
he's dealing almost exclusively in outswingers to the right-hander. Rashid drives to mid-off
tosses it up - think this one's the offbreak though - and Rashid gets forward to block
"good length offbreak, which Rashid reads well, goes back and nudges it towards leg slip, who then moves to short leg"
"loops it up on middle, Rashid keeps it out"
"good length, on the pads, Broad tries to flick, doesn't make contact, but his pad does"
"<B>taken at second slip, and this time, it is five for Bumrah</b>! Pitches the new ball up, on middle, has the left-hander squared up because of the angle. Broad has to defend. The ball takes the outside edge. Rahul is waiting at second slip. How many catches does he have now? Seven, I hear. Meanwhile, Bumrah's leading India towards a dominant Test win, and along the way, he puts his finger on his lips looking at a part of the crowd that is screaming no-ball"
shuffles across and follows a short ball angled across him. Lucky not to nick off
"bouncer, and Anderson chooses to stay in line with it and block. That decision causes the No. 11 a bit of pain though because it strikes him on the left hand. Hard. Then clatters over to hit his grille"
"full and outside off, Anderson keeps to his crease and steers the ball to cover"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"fends it away over the keeper - Anderson doesn't really know too much about this short ball from around the wicket, coming right at his throat. Shami's mean. Very very mean"
"skids in off a good length from outside off. Anderson gets stuck on the pads - but it would be going down leg - and just to be sure, he kicks the ball away before it rolls onto his stumps"
"full and outside off, Anderson drives to cover and finds a single"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"full and straight, Rashid does really well to get his bat down in time"
<b>nearly</b> as Shami keeps searching for the off stump. This one even gets a tinge of away swing to confuse Rashid. He's playing inside the line - playing the angle - and gets an outside edge to point
"good length on middle, Anderson shuffles a long way across and tucks it to midwicket"
"full and outside off, Anderson smears it to cover"
<b>beats the edge</b> and I suspect it's the inside one. Anderson is basically hoping his bat intervenes with this full delivery on and around off stump. The ball <b>only just misses the sticks</b>
"back of a length and outside off, Anderson wafts and misses"
turns a back of a length delivery on middle and off to backward square leg or maybe a deep leg gully
full and straight. Anderson keeps it out
stands tall and thumps a back of a length delivery outside off away to the point boundary. A fine shot to bring up England's 300.

"full and tailing into the right-hander, Rashid manages to keep it out"
waits on it neatly and clips it away to the midwicket boundary. Fine little flick of the wrists and warm applause greets it as it scuttles away

full and swinging away very late too. Rashid keeps his shape and ensures the game goes on
"drifter, pitches on middle and leg, Anderson defends off the front foot and gets an inside edge to long leg"
"big appeal for lbw, but Rashid has lunged too far forward and across as well for this to be out. Impact outside the line"
"loopy delivery, a shade outside off. And it dips sharply on the right-hander. Rashid covers it well though"
"this seems like the outswinger, full and straight and moving away. Rashid blocks"
"<b>appeal for lbw</B>, then there's an overthrow for four. But before that goes on the docket, we'll have <b>a review</b>. It's the carrom ball here. Rashid feels for it and is beaten on the inside edge. Ball-tracking says impact umpire's call, hitting the stumps umpire's call and Gaffaney ruled it not-out"
that's the legbreak and Rashid is lured into playing a shot. He's also comfortably beaten
"bouncer, right at Anderson's chest. And the tailender just about evades it"
"shortish on middle, Anderson defends"
turns a full delivery on middle away behind square leg to get off strike
<b>beats the edge</b> as Rashid stays put in his crease and is done in by Bumrah straightening it off the angle
"looks for the yorker, just misses his mark, which is why Rashid is able to get forward and block"
strides nicely forward to block this full length ball on off stump and that's the day
"length ball close to off stump, gets a stride forward and defends to backward point"
"bouncer, bounces loopily, tennis-ball style, over the ducking batsman and down into the keeper's gloves"
"another bouncer, at a pretty gentle pace. Starts outside leg stump - Anderson moves his back out of the way - and then swings late just as it approaches Pant, leaving him on the ground as he just about manages to grab onto it"
length ball wide of off stump and Anderson has a flash and a miss
"back of a length close to off stump, goes back and across, deep in his crease, to defend, and misses. The angle beats his edge and the ball hits his back thigh"
"fullish, slanting away from off stump. Anderson goes back and across again to defend, and misses by a long way"
"length ball, straightens late towards the top of off stump. This is a good ball, and Rashid plays a lovely shot, gets on the front foot, head over the ball, to clip it away to the right of mid-on. Ashwin gives stately chase - I don't think he's fully fit, and probably shouldn't be on the field"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"back of a length, close to off stump, gets nicely back and across to defend towards short extra-cover"
"digs it in short, angles it down the leg side. Pant dives left to collect after Rashid misses the hook"
"nice length, gets a bit of shape away in the fourth-stump channel. Defended into the covers"
"another bouncer, loses a lot of pace off the pitch as it rises up along the fourth-stump corridor. Waits an age and then bunts it down to backward point"
"tossed up fairly wide of off stump, stretches out and squeezes it away behind point. Ishant gives leisurely chase, willing the ball to roll past the boundary and keep Anderson on strike. It comes to a stop a meter from the rope"
"flat length ball outside off, defended off the front foot"
"floats this one out of the front of the hand, ends up down the leg side, past Rashid's attempted sweep"
"this one's flighted just outside off and Rashid sweeps again, with the turn, to long leg"
"is that it? It is. Ashwin takes the last wicket with a legbreak. Shortish outside off, turns sharply into Anderson and gets big on him as he makes room to cut. Ends up gloving it up over the slips, and Rahane backtracks from first slip to take the simplest of catches"
