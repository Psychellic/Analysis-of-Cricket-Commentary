The ball glances off the glove or helmet and then as the bat swings around it clatters into the top of the stumps. Must have taken the helmet because Paine caught it. Either way, it's out.

"worked off the pads into square leg. Just a hint of reverse, perhaps, for Richardson"
"back of a length outside off, 131kph, defended to the bowler"
"this keeps low! Back of a length and targetting off stump, Mendis has to be quick to get the bat down"
"what's happened here? Full, moving back in, squares him up and beats the edge, takes the back pad but outside off stump"
great shot! Drills a full delivery wide of mid-on with a straight bat. Hold the pose
"round the wicket, good length at off stump, defended"
gets forward and drives on the up to mid-off
"short outside off, he's not in control of this at all, forcing off the back foot and it skews off an edge between the slips and gully"
"much more in control this time, plays back to a short-of-a-length delivery and punches to point"
"very full at the stumps, digs it out"
"back over the wicket, and dispatched! A half volley outside off, flayed through the covers in style"
"<B>almost a stunning catch</b> from Richardson, but always just out of reach as he ran back from mid-on. Mendis came down the pitch, tried to go straight down the ground, got too far underneath the ball"
tucked off the pads to short leg
leans forward and defends
"dragged down short, he pulls and hammers it into Labuschagne at short leg with the ball then rebounding away. That could have been nasty, very close to his throat"
takes the bottom hand off the bat as he defends
"goes for a big slog sweep, the ball was wide outside off, <b>gets a top edge</b> which flies over slip. Doesn't look like they want to do much blocking against Lyon"
"over the wicket, outside leg stump, flicked to long leg"
"a bouncer, he ducks"
"another short ball, doesn't quite bounce as much, as to go right down to avoid it"
worked off the pads into square leg
"a short delivery, defended on the back foot"
"short of a length at off stump, solidly and correctly behind the line"
"a wider line outside off, draws him onto the front foot"
"round the wicket, pushed across outside off, defended"
worked off the pads to the leg side
"goes back and across, deep in the crease, worked to the leg side"
again he's across to off stump and works to the leg side
"outside off this time, tucked into square leg to keep the strike"
"starts full at off stump, nicely tossed up, driven to cover"
"well bowled! That's the perfect leg-break, draws him forward and it spins past the outside edge"
"touch shorter outside off, pushed square into the off side"
"oops, that's a big full toss and it gets clubbed through the leg side"
"much better, back on a good length at off stump, hint of turn"
"<b>dropped</b> after three attempts by Khawaja at slip! A flashing drive, it flew quickly to Khawaja who couldn't grab it first time but nearly claimed it twice on the rebounds before it went to ground"
"<B>brilliant effort at deep midwicket, almost a wonderful team-effort catch</b>...Mendis slog swept, Burns grabbed it, knew he was going over the rope, and tried to flick it back to Richardson who was running round from long-on"
"short outside off, cut in front of square on the off side"
flicked from outside off into midwicket
"that's a meaty blow over deep midwicket, stays in his crease and swings through the line...just short of six"
"back of a length outside off, defended"
almost pops off the inside edge to short leg but taking the bottom hand off the bat means he can just keep it down
"full outside off, driven off a thick outside edge to backward point"
"well bowled again! Just short of a good length, spins sharply and bounces to beat the outside edge. Very nice"
stretches forward and defends this leg-break to the off side
"fuller, brings the drive and he finds cover"
"shorter, on the pads, worked into square leg"
"full, very wide, he has a wild drive and doesn't make contact"
"short of a length outside off, defended on the back foot"
"fuller, brings him forward and he defends"
uses his feet then defends
goes deep in the crease and tucks this around the corner
driven down the ground to long-on
flicks a shortish delivery from outside off to the leg side
"90kph, leg break, good length on off, he defends off the outside half of the bat"
"tossed up higher outside off, he drives firmly with the spin to cover"
"shorter length, 89kph, wide of off, he leaves"
"slider, 92kph, on off, he spots it and defends on the front foot"
"big spinning leg break, wide of off, he leaves this alone"
"<strong>caught at cover!</strong> That was a bit soft. He looped up a leg break full and wide of off, he was tempted into a booming drive, he strides out but doesn't get all his weight over the front foot, and slaps the drive chest high to Patterson at cover! Easy catch."
"131kph, good length but angled down leg, it comes off pad and runs fine to the keeper"
"bouncer, he tries to hook but it's too high for him and it bounces over the gloves"
"137kph, fuller on off, he defends on the front foot"
"<strong>caught behind!</strong> 138kph, good length wide of off, he is lured into a drive away from his body, he flashed hard, but got a thin edge and it flies straight through to Paine. Easy catch."
"137kph, short into the hip, it comes off the thigh as he tries to fend away and it bounces to short leg"

"142kph, fuller angled into off stump, he defends from the crease"
"143kph, good length angled into the top off, he defends from the crease"
"<strong>an appeal for caught behind down the leg side</strong>, given not out, Australia <strong>review</strong>. This was shorter down leg, he tried to glance off the hip. Leg side hot spot has nothing on it. Nothing on snicko. The decision remains not out"
"fuller, 142kph, wide of off, he pushes from the crease opening the face and running it to gully"
"139kph, good length wide of off, he leaves this alone"
"<strong>beaten</strong>, prodding and missing at a 135kph, good length delivery wide of off"
"137kph, good length, fourth stump line, he defends on the front foot to mid off"
"134kph, bouncer, excellent short ball, he has to duck under it late"
"136kph, short into the ribs, he pops this up, pushing off the hip, it lands safely behind square for a single"
"136kph, wide of the crease, angled into off stump, he defends from the crease to mid on"
"136kph, cracking bouncer, he threw his hands up in front of face hoping not to get hit, it flew over his head to the keeper"
"144kph, full outside off, angling in a touch and shaping away, it <strong>beats</strong> the edge as he tries to drive"
"<strong>beats him</strong> again, tighter to off, but leaving the right hander again, he prods at it and misses"
"<strong>beaten three in a row</strong>. Another full ball angled in and tailing away, again he drives from the crease and misses"
"<strong>four plays and misses</strong>. A carbon copy of the last three, angled in and tailing past the edge"
<strong>five plays and misses</strong>. This is getting amusing now. Too quick and again he prods at it outside off
"he makes contact! Fuller outside off, he square drives with an open face to the man in the gully"
"<strong>caught behind!</strong> Perfect delivery. Would have got a lot of top order players out. 135kph, good length, fourth stump line, it wobbles away off the seam, he pushes at it from the crease, gets a thin edge through to Paine. The end is near"
"136kph, good length leg cutter, top of off, he's squared up defending to cover"
"searing bouncer, 134kph, he sways out of the way late but does well to get under it"
"139kph, fuller on middle, he defends popping this in the air towards mid on but it lands safe"
"136kph, he's edging but well short of slip, again squared up by a back of a length delivery seaming away"
"full and straight, he backs away and pokes at it nearly popping a return catch back to Cummins!"
"<strong>beaten again!</strong> Six in seven for Starc. Full angled in, tailing away, beats the edge. Starc is laughing"
"144kph, fuller on off, he defends on the front foot to the vacant point region, they have a mix up but eventually take an easy one"
"146kph, full and wide, feet anchored he waves the bat at it and <strong>misses</strong>"
"<strong>beaten and it just misses off stump!</strong> How did this miss!? He was squared up staying leg side, it beat the edge and just went past the top of off"
"147kph, dragged way down the leg side"
"<strong>Bowled him! Starc gets 10! Australia win!</strong> 146kph, searing yorker, gun barrel straight fired into the base of middle and off, he gets the feet out of the way and jams the bat down but misses and it crashes into the base of the stumps!"
