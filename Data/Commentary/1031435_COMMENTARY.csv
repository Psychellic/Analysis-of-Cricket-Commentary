"good length outside off, played a touch uppishly with a full face, and spliced to gully"
"good nip off the seam, strikes the pad-flap and deflects to slip"
"smashed, high in the air! Where's that gone? Who wants it? The keeper is haring after it, out towards square leg, he gallops and dives, but can't cling on! <B>Dropped!</b> That was utterly stratospheric"
punched out to cover
worked into the off side
"back of a length, pulled firmly out to deep midwicket. Well, that was a lively start!"
"probing length, and that one actually looked to keep low. Was very much anchored on the back foot though, anticipating the lifter"
this one carries through alright! A woolly whoosh as Hales climbs into a pull but the ball is through him already
"backs away, Hales has a slash, clears the slips and fizzes through third man. The man was up, and it was a calculated risk"
"fuller length, on the pads, clipped to leg"
"tapped on the up through midwicket, and what timing! A perfectly straight bat, ushered the ball across the line and away to the rope"
"bends away, attempting the ramp, but the ball is too close to him, and Mosehle gathers the catch, a thin deflection off the gloves!"
"a low full toss, bunted into the leg side"
"outside off, no stroke offered as the ball angles across the left-hander"
"bang! Smashed off a good length, hauled through midwicket for a brutal six! Now <em>that's</em> how to get off the mark for your career!"
"right under the eyeline, punched to cover"
into line
"short, ducked"
"onto the front foot, drilled into the covers. Elegant strike, not quite the same timing"
"slower ball, well executed, rolled his fingers to cut the ball across the left-hander's bows"
"banged in short, and that's good aggressive intent. Not entirely timed, but good placement out to deep midwicket"
"another slowie, and another good dot-ball, hopping over a tentative poke outside off"
"slow bouncer, and Malan is utterly suckered by this one as he climbs into a pull and is pinned on the bicep"
"outside off, tapped to third man, a direct hit could be tight... but the ball goes wide"
"outside off, chopped hard through backward point. Times the pants off it"
"pulled round the corner, out to deep midwicket"
"short, pulled a touch uncertainly round the corner where there's a man lurking at short backward square. Bounces short"
"short, and slammed through backward square! Malan is making a statement debut here!"
"down the track, brimming with confidence now, and crunched out to deep midwicket"
"short, leg-sided. We'll have that again"
crashed out to deep midwicket
"yorker length, but leg-sided, tapped to a diving backward square"
"bashed off a good length, down to mid-off for a single. He had greater designs in the shot than that"
"squelch! That is going to hurt a lot! A roundhouse pull, under-edged into the side of the knee, and Hales is down like a sack of spuds... No protection there. And out comes the physio to give him the once-over"
"gives himself room, and has an almighty mow. No contact, but at least his knee moved..."
"retreating to leg again, but back into line swiftly as Paterson spears in a yorker"
"shuffles across to the off-side, dumps a one-bounce four over midwicket. Malan continues to flourish!"
"short, and pulled out to deep midwicket"
"slower ball, held back a touch. Wristily driven to cover"
blocked down the track
"that was sharp! Unfortunate to be called there, as Malan was ducking into his ambitious pull. But the ball sizzled through him"
"fuller length, bludgeoned down to long-off with a flowing blade. Lively impetus from Malan"
"slower ball and <B>dropped!</B> Oh good grief, that is a desperate drop! Hales got completely underneath a slap over the onside. But Phehlukwayo made a total and utter horlicks of the chance, back-pedalling on the edge of the circle!"
pumped through square leg to add insult to injury
"pulled, one bounce, down to long on"
"smashed! Didn't look at first glance as though Malan had got hold of his pull through mid-on, but the fielder couldn't get close!"
"forward, driven into the covers"
"flashed through third man, down past the keeper's boot, the tight angle beats the fielder"
stabbed back past the bowler to long-on
chiselled out to deep midwicket
"on the pads, out to square leg"
"full length, stroked into the covers"
"yeehar! Outside off, a full length once more. Malan clears the front dog and aims a mow over midwicket. Doesn't make contact"
"stands his ground and delivers in style, a monstrous mow from deep in the crease, straight back over the bowler's head, off the scaffolding and almost certainly into the Taff! Snorkel please!"
short and leg-sided. Malan has a swipe but no contact
"back of a length, chopped to backward point"
no contact this time
"oh dear, can't bowl there! A filthy knee-high full-toss, and Hales swings through the line as if delivering personal vengeance for that hurty knee he received earlier. Into the stands at cow corner"
"another wipe leg-side, bounces short of the fielder"
swept round the corner
"fiercely slammed into the covers, but straight to the man"
"flipped over the leg-side, a cute little dink, just evades Morkel at short fine leg, and there's a very fine debut fifty"
"gives himself room, swings through the line, a screech from the fielders, but the ball skews wide of everyone and bobbles over the rope at deep point. Malan marches on!"
hoisted into the leg side
"cracked off the back foot, out to deep point"
full length but too wide. Hales merely lays bat on ball and the keeper has no chance to intercept a fat deflection
"bottom-handed roundhouse hoick, towards long-on"
"good wheels, through to the keeper, who applauds as he gathers"
"drilled down the track, no cutting that off at long-off!"
swiped into the leg side
flashed out to point for a single
"battered! In the slot for Hales to free his arms, and a hard flat six over long-on! <I>Just</I> skimmed over the head of the fielder"
"crunched to mid-off, de Villiers lines up the shy, Hales has to scamper, and flings himself and his bat straight into the non-striker's stumps! Effective"
"oh, now there's a debutant who's living the moment! A dinky little clip over the leg-side, walking across the crease, inverting his stance, pilfering the boundary through fine leg. Sublime"
"short, leg-sided, pulled, gloved, four! Under-edged through fine leg. Ungainly but extremely effective"
"slow bouncer, Hales lines up a tennis smash to long-on"
picks the gap
"excellent snaffle from Miller at midwicket! A scything pull from Hales, timed sweetly, but Miller tumbles low to his left to make a vital breakthrough"
"width and cut firmly to backward point, Paterson scrambles on the boundary's edge, and just about saves the four"
clipped to midwicket to open his account
"slower ball, dabbed down to the off side to steal the single, and the strike"
"inside-out, and crashed over wide long-off! Picked the wrong'un and belted it!"
reverses the hands but is undone by the full toss. Can't beat the fielder
"high and mighty, but not mighty enough! Malan gets under the ball too much, and long-on trots round to end a tremendous debut innings!"
"well, it's a boundary, but not as we know it! A reverse of the hands to a full-toss googly. The ball beats the bat, the stumps, yorks the keeper, and dribbles to the rope!"
"another attempted reverse, still no contact"
"outside off, and this is delicately played, a long reaching sweep to dab the ball fine behind square"
"tip and run to mid-off, has to scamper, but safely home. Direct hit would have been very tight"
"patted into the off side, down the track but settling for the single"
"on the pads, can't make contact but steal the single nonetheless"
opens the face to deflect a single to third man
"short and sharp, Buttler seeks the cheeky ramp over the keeper but the ball got big on him"
single to the covers
"galloping down the pitch, struck on the pad, very adjacent it has to be said, but deflects through third man. With a review that would have been out!"
smashed through point
"cracked into the off side, and another fumble"
crunched into the off side
"full length, dug out to long-on"
"down the pitch, clipped firmly to wide long-on. Tahir is bowled out. Decent figures, but England in a formidable position"
"a hint of an appeal as the keeper gathers a missed slog sweep. Was there a nick? Nope, flicked the pad"
"holds his nerve, and his line outside off, as Billings seeks a slap but can't connect"
"another wide yorker, Billings connects with a crack to long-on to bring up the 150"
"belted! Fast hands, through the line as the bowler misses his mark, and crashed over long-off!"
"bouncer, Buttler is waiting, hanging back in the crease, and bludgeons a round-house pull through midwicket"
"good recovery, as Buttler tries another wallop but can't pick the back-of-the-hand slower ball. Good joust in that over!"
"very full, Billings can't connect with a planted front-foot slog-sweep. Keeper does well to prevent overthrows as Paterson flings aggressively in his followthrough"
"full toss, dumped into the stands at midwicket! That'll get him going ..."
swept off the front foot to midwicket
"width, slapped, but straight to cover, off the toe of the bat"
"misses the full toss, and Paterson is on a hat-trick! Livingstone tries an improvisation first-ball, turning his stance inside-out, but he's on his way for a golden duck!"
"good ball for the hat-trick! A pinpoint yorker, from wide on the crease. Plunkett is equal to it, but can only dig it out to mid-off. A fine over"
"slower ball, Buttler seems to have picked it, but doesn't middle it. Plugs just short of long-off, and they come back for two"
"very full, stabbed to cover, and that is brilliant running from Plunkett to get his senior partner back on strike"
"another drill into the off side. Good running again, but this is a fine over. Very full once more, no chance to get elevation into the shot"
"oops, spoke too soon, a fraction shorter and wider, and Buttler's ludicrously fast hands send a massive six sailing over point!"
"slower ball, back of a length, crashed to midwicket for the single"
"smashed out to deep midwicket, and taken! Another slower ball, out of the back of the hand. Now then, did the batsmen cross? They really shouldn't have done, with it being the end of the over ..."
"good yorker, tapped to midwicket"
"outside off, crushed to deep cover"
"pounded high in the air, backward point calls, and pockets the catch! South Africa have really closed ranks in these closing overs"
"that is tremendous bowling! Yorker, straight as they come. Willey clears his legs and hears the death rattle. He's on a hat-trick again!"
"good ball, back on a good length outside off, pre-empting the fancy improvisation. Misses the hat-trick but a dot will do as Curran can't connect"
"wide yorker, fenced out to deep cover. That is the end of a terrific spell of death bowling"
"ambles in, full and swinging but behind Smuts' legs for a wide first ball"
"Willey puts this on a length, shaping down the leg side again... and does that go down as a drop? No, just off the pad, Buttler got a fingertip on it but couldn't prevent the ball racing away to the rope"
"touch shorter, Smuts punches on the up to mid-on"
"back of a length, angled across and this doesn't swing, allowing Smuts to free up those meaty forearms and club through cover point for a few"
"good comeback from Willey, gets in a well-directed yorker and Hendricks can only dig it out defensively"
"length, coming back a fraction, comes forward and taps to extra cover"
"pitched up, again a scintilla of inswing and the ball hits the inside edge as Hendricks drives, runs to short midwicket"
"steams in, hits a good length around off, Smuts prods at it and gets an inside edge through the leg side"
"shortish, good wheels, Hendricks swivels to pull and the ball flies off his hip through backward point"
rising to hit high up the bat as Smuts prods at it from the crease
"hits the pitch hard, 85mph and Smuts works it down into the leg side"
"shortish, gets on to the pull, bottom-edged through backward point for a single"
"got him, gift-wrapped to mid-off! Hendricks goes for a laboured duck, chipping straight to the fielder... and Tom Curran is off on his dancing, jinking victory run once again. I have a feeling England fans are going to see that a fair bit as time goes by"
"fullish, drifting in and driven along the turf to mid-on"
"length ball, angled across and pushed cautiously back down the track"
"touch shorter outside off, Smuts goes back and dabs one down to third man"
"back of a length, 85mph and Morris stands tall, blips it tentatively towards midwicket"
"beats the bottom edge, length ball from Willey as Morris aims a golf swing across the line, fails to connect"
"touch short, over the stumps, deflected off the inside edge to backward square leg"
Morris steps forward and defends a length ball on off
"here comes Morris, attempting to slash Curran on the up, not quite timed but it clears two men running back towards deep extra cover and they get three"
Smuts comes across and stabs into a gap
"short ball, Morris leans back and uppercuts deliberately over backward point, well wide of third man and it bounces away for SA's first boundary off the bat"
"back of a length, this is a slower ball and Morris can't generate any power as he drives off the back foot to cover"
"another slower delivery, stays leg side but Morris' agricultural thwack is mistimed to short fine leg"
"puts it on a length in the channel, maybe taking the pace off, Smuts chops an inside edge past his legs"
"short ball, Morris pulls... and sends it down the throat of deep square leg! Well taken by Hales, leaping to grab it above his head a yard or so in from the boundary. A minor Morris contribution, the promotion to No. 3 fails to come off and England have their second wicket"
"tight lines, Smuts stays on off stump and drives, back to the bowler who swoops on it in his follow through"
"back of a length, Smuts attempts to hit it into Llanelli... and succeeds only getting a bottom edge to backward square"
"dug in, this is nailed on the pull but Hales is across and into position to stop it, went so quickly there was only one on"
"drops back to cut powerfully, gets it past point and he's off and running straight away, although Livingstone does brilliant work to reel it in an inch or two from the rope and save a run"
"hard length, rising up over middle and off, de Villiers rides it and tucks one"
"on a length and it bounces more than expected, Smuts fends it away coming forwards"
"short and past the top edge as Smuts heaves across the line... Buttler goes up, so does the bowler, but Tim Robinson shakes his head. No reviews in T20, so England will have to swallow it, but there was definitely a sound"
"pitched up and launched over the stands at the River End! No doubt about the connection on that, in the slot and slogged a mile"
"full outside off, carved over cover and away - four more! Smuts likes it up there, swings like kid in the playground and beefs it to the rope"
"goes back to short stuff, rides it and taps down to leg"
"gives it some air, drifting on to leg stump and Smuts powers a sweep past the protection on the leg side for four to deep backward square"
tossed up and prodded back on the off side
"pushed through outside off, drops back and opens the face for one"
"flighted, de Villiers is back in the crease and flicks aerially through midwicket"
"full outside off, comes forward and drives to long-off"
"dragged down and Smuts rocks on to the back foot to pull, bit of a top edge but it lands short of deep midwicket"
length on the stumps and dabbed through square leg for one
"Plunkett is getting the extra lift off a length, hits the splice and runs through mid-on, not where de Villiers was aiming but they hustle a single anyway"
"short ball, rearing past the top edge as Smuts backs away and smears unsuccessfully"
"good length, 88mph and tucked off the pads through midwicket"
"back of a length, de Villiers can't get this away"
"excellent from Plunkett, spots de Villiers comes down the pitch and fires it into his pads, another dot"
"floated up by Crane, gets a bit of grip as Smuts sweeps and deflects it past Buttler, he attempts to underarm at the stumps as de Villiers races through"
"pushed through, drops back and cuts one"
"flighted, full and straight, this time Smuts gets the sweep away but deep midwicket cuts it off"
"ooh, that's a pristine shot, makes a bit of room and crashes it in to out over cover, just short of the rope!"
"good response from Crane, tossed up and spinning sharply past the bat as de Villiers swings across the line"
"goes for the big shot again, doesn't quite get hold of it and Crane bellows 'caaaaaaaatch!' only for it land a few yards in front of deep midwicket and they get a couple more"
"short ball, Smuts flails across the line, big top edge... taken! Malan circles around under it from fine leg and shows safe hands, ending a laboured stay from the SA opener. Plunkett gets reward for a probing spell"
back of a length over the stumps and worked across the line
"leg-stump line, 83mph and Miller clips one to the sweeper out square"
"good length, de Villiers stays deep and strokes a single through cover"
"diligent lines from Plunkett, nudged through mid-on"
"angling in, taking the pace off, 77mph and de Villiers whisks it away to deep backward square - just singles off the over, to go with Smuts' wicket"
"tossed up on the stumps and de Villiers hammers a flat sweep to the fence, that will pep them up"
floated up full and cleaned out over deep midwicket! De Villiers picks his spot in the crowd and dumps a high-and-handsome sweep for six
"goes again, this is just as brutal, flying into the stands at deep square leg! Effortless hitting from AB, who's decided this is the bowler and the boundary to target this over"
floated up wide of the stumps and driven through the covers
pushed through and worked off the pads for one
"floats the ball up, tempting him again... and taken on the rope! Crane goes bananas in celebration, running around like he's just scored the winner in the last minute of the FA Cup final... But what a huge wicket that is, his first in international cricket, too! De Villiers seemed to hit it pretty well but Hales was again well-positioned on the rope at deep square leg and took a smart catch as Crane stood agog in anticipation"
"short of a length and jabbed off the hips, they get back for two"
"flicked fine and Mason Crane, the adrenaline flowing, scoots around the rope and saves four with a super dive"
"short and wide, slashed... and edged to the keeper! Miller won't be saving SA here, Jordan is the one off a celebratory dash, he angled the bouncer across the lefty, who could perhaps have gone over gully with an uppercut but instead nicked an aggressive swipe"
"short and worked off the body to square leg, who's in quickly and hunting for a run-out"
"short again, rising up to hit the gloves at Mosehle tries to leave, bounces down through to the keeper"
"another bouncer to finish and Mosehle can't do anything with it... Excellent over from Jordan and England well on top now, you feel"
"tossed up straight and worked into a gap on the leg side, a misfield helps them get back for two"
"loops up the googly, that's nicely bowled, wide of the stumps and inside Behardien's wild heave"
"tossed up, this is the legbreak and it spins through past the outside edge as Behardien goes back"
"lovely stuff, slows his pace up, gets the batsman reaching forward for the sweep, spins into the wicketkeeper's gloves again and Buttler then breaks the bails for good measure"
pushed through quicker and again Behardien prods at it and misses from the crease
"tossed up full, slow legbreak to finish and Behardien bottom-edges a heave to short fine leg"
short of a length and flicked away through backward square leg
"dug in slightly back of a length and Behardien swings to leg, not a great connection"
banged in and Mosehle rides the bounce on the pull
"banged in short on off stump and Behardien hooks unconvincingly, sending a top edge limping to deep backward square! Another SA batsman perishes in the deep... They should have brought their armbands"
shortish and whipped away off the back foot for another single
slides this down the leg side as Lucky swishes at it and misses
"angled across, back of a length outside off, swatted towards point from the crease"
"short and helped on its way... all the way over fine leg! Mosehle hung back and connected sweetly, sending it sailing beyond the short boundary, nicely played"
"length outside off, he's hanging back but presses forward to push one square to bring up the SA 100"
"pitched up and leathered through the covers, on the move and rifled in front of deep extra cover"
pitched up and dispatched back down the ground! Phehluwayo sets his base and swings through the line for a first boundary
"slower delivery but it's sent the same way, chipped over mid-off and it bobbles over the rope at long-off!"
"length ball and driven again, down the ground to long-on on the bounce this time"
"dug in short, over Phehlukwayo's shoulder, can't do much with that"
goes full and straight as Lucky walks across his stumps and miscues an attempted scoop for one
"short and flicked off the hip, runs fine but won't go all the way"
"hitting the middle of the pitch once again, swatted through square leg for one"
"well bowled, goes full and wide with Phehlukwayo on his heels and unable to get near it"
"another dot ball, dug in short and the batsman swings unsuccessfully again"
"slower ball, Mosehle was planning a big mow down the ground but had to pull out and can only prod it into the covers"
"back-of-the-hand slower ball, that's superbly done again, dips and beats the bat as Mosehle swings blindly"
"now up to full pace again, in the channel, another swing and a miss"
"taking the pace off, this time he picks it, swivels on the pull and carted into the stands at deep backward square... where it's taken by a punter in the crowd!"
"wide full toss, sliced in the air down to third man"
"goes round the wicket, another slower delivery, slightly leg side and Phehlukwayo tries to reverse-dab... gets an under-edge through to the keeper on the bounce"
"banged in short, Mosehle backs away and blaps it flat over long-on for six! There was a man out there but it <i>flew</i> murderously past him on the full"
"dug in outside off... and Mosehle has plopped this one in the drink! Sort of a forehand, overarm smash and it sailed over wide long-off, beyond the confines of the ground and (in all probability) into the River Taff"
"goes round the wicket, full length, Mosehle thumps it for one through cover"
"full and wide of the stumps, Phehlukwayo checks a drive in front of deep backward point for a couple"
"pitched up, making Phehlukwayo hit to the off side, gets a big top edge down towards third man... but it doesn't carry, just one as the fielder takes it securely on the bounce"
"good finish from Willey, fired in full at the toes from round the wicket as Mosehle tries to make room, bunted back to the bowler"
"pitched up, 83mph and wide of off stump, plinked to mid-off"
"full and straight, goes for the scoop and it deflects away off the body behind square"
"fired in full, Mosehle is deep in the crease, crouched for the big heave-ho... but can only squirt one to mid-on"
"slower ball, out the back of the hand, Phehlukwayo hits across the line but mistimes it for another single"
"slings down a full toss wide of the stumps, nailed over the covers by Mosehle and it clears Livingstone, who was a dozen yards in and had to turn and go haring back, bounces away for four"
"another full toss, flapped into the leg side... and taken by deep midwicket running in! They want to check for the no-ball on height but it seems fine, dipping towards the batsman's waistband as he heaved unsuccessfully for another safe catch in the deep"
"angled across, back of a length, Morkel cloths a back-foot swipe into the covers"
"fast and wide and ramped from practically next to the tramlines over short fine leg! Audacious from Lucky, gets it away as the fielder gives chase, bouncing to the ropes for four"
"nailed down the ground this time, makes room and <i>hammers</i> the ball past long-on for another boundary"
"heaved into the leg side, they come racing back for two although Morkel would have been struggling if the throw to Jordan was better"
"well, there's a no-ball, Phehlukwayo clubbing a high full toss into the leg side"
Jordan makes amends with a good wide yorker that is skewed down to third man for one
"pitched up and humped over mid-off, Morkel finishes with a boundary but it is <b>England who win by 19 runs</b> to take the series 2-1"
