"back of a length at off stump, defended on the back foot"
<b>slight swing back in</b> and nearly breaches the forward block. This is headed for the top of off. He brings the bat down very late and once again the front-foot plant across gets him in trouble
in at off stump again. Once more he's locked on the front foot. It takes the inside edge and bounces past the stumps
<b>struck on the back thigh</b> after being beaten for pace. Lbw appeal is turned down. THis was a length ball climbing and probably hitting him outside off

yikes. This lifts up ferociously outside off and forces Blundell to leap up. Short and just outside off. He was looking to play at that and did well to get the bat out of the way
short and wide. Nicely in place for the cut. He won't take the bait

"stands tall and drives this elegantly. Beats mid-off to his right. Length ball driven on the rise, with a high elbow"
<b>Powell survives a run-out chance</b> as he huffs and puffs and stretches languidly to try and make it at the striker's end. It's a length ball that swings in at Brathwaite's off stump. He pushes at it gingerly and gets it to mid-off's left. It's Boult there and that's straight at his bowling arm. He can't hit the stumps
"<b>gorgeous.</b> Powell has looked so good with the drives. Hit them so straight. This is a length ball in at leg stump and once more, he stands tall and punches it on the rise past his partner. Probably looking to hit him after last ball"

"back of a length, skids and rises to catch him on the inside of his thigh as he leaps to try and flick this. He's on the floor"

"short ball at off stump, defended at chest height"
<b>gloves the pull shot</b> between keeper and leg gully. It's the first instance I can remember of Powell going after the short ball today. This one is short and angled down leg. Wasn't entirely in control
"short ball at middle stump, jumps off the pitch and dead-bats it in front of short leg"
"back of a length and down leg side, clipped to fine leg"
<b>got him!</b> A flamengo fend? A nervous push? An ugly jab? All of the above. Brathwaite was in no position against this short ball. It's at his rib cage. His weight is going backwards and he's going down after being aerial for a bit - perfect recipe for a lob to short leg. Wagner plays to his strengths after two overs of experimenting and makes the breakthrough
good length and slight shape away from off stump. Defended on the front foot
"Powell is still at it. Another straight drive crunched past the bowler. Full and just outside off. Stands tall, bisects bowler and mid-off"

overpitched and into the pads. He can't get bat on the flick. It's very full but it's going down leg. New Zealand withdraw the appeal
"<b>lobs towards third slip and he lunges forward</b> to take it in front of second. Powell's been leaving for line outside off, but this one surprises him as it climbs in the corridor. Fends at it and gets glove as he appears to withdraw from the shot. Raval goes to his right, with both hands, and latches onto this. A solid innings comes to an end"

back of a length at off stump defended on the back foot
"<b>another one with the short ball!</b> A steep one, rising quickly at his throat. He doesn't look to get on top of the bounce. Instead, he's halfway between swaying away and defending. The bat is pointed upwards, the body is arching back and the feet are rooted. Guides it into the slip cordon and it's an easy take"
nicely timed. Back of a length on leg stump. Stands tall and taps it to fine leg's left
"<b>has he got a a feather on that?</b> Yes he has! Glove, it sounds like. And Hope walks back in the direction of the dressing room. A loose ball, really. Short and leg stump, by no means a bouncer. It's the kind of ball you tuck off your hips. Hope goes for the pull shot instead and he's late on it. It takes glove and flies over leg stump, straight to Blundell"

"<b>hit wicket first ball in Test cricket.</b> Oh the sound came straight away after he played a decent shot. The crushing sound of despair for the debutant. Put down another wicket to the short ball. This climbs at his chest. He's deep in the crease and then shuffles back further. Leaps up to tuck this to fine leg off this hips but his back heel lands on the stumps. Fine leg is the first to spot it. Points at the stumps as he runs in to field. The batsman knew straight away. Wagner is amused, can't believe his luck"

"<b>glances it straight to leg slip.</b> That's a loose shot from Chase. This is short and down leg side. His weight moves into the off side, he's moving away from the ball and he pokes out at it. Straightforward catch"
"<b>bowled him!</b> A yorker, an actual yorker from Wagner! Gets some shape in and breaches Holder's defence to break off stump. He's setting up batsmen even before they've come out to bat. He's <b>on a hat-trick again</b>"

"<b>run out at the non-strikers!</b> Oh dear. West Indies are unravelling disastrously. Shoddy stuff. This one is full outside off. He looks to drive but it comes back in a touch. It sits up nicely on the bounce for Santner at point. There seems to have been no calling, from either batsman. But for some reason, Dowrich is four yards down and then looking back at the crease in hope as he realises there's no chance to go back. Santner in the mean time gets his technique delightfully right and hits the stumps on the bounce"

"good length at off stump. Shuffles a long way across and tickles it fine. Holder appeals. It sounded like an inside edge as he played it. But the umpire Rod Tucker has signalled leg byes. So <b>Holder reviews</b>. There is no bat, third umpire Bruce Oxenford confirms. It looks to have struck him in front of off stump. Ball tracking is taking a while to arrive...and it shows the ball kissing the top of middle stump. Which means it remains umpire's call and he survives."

"chipped back to the bowler. And Henry strikes for New Zealand. I have no doubt that the momentum loss from that long break contributed to this. Maybe he was just not feeling right in his new helmet, maybe he lost concentration, maybe he just played with hard hands because that's what he has been doing for the last few overs.
