"lovely way to start! Full and straight, effortlessly timed through midwicket with a perfectly-timed clip"
"keeps it full at the stumps, this time Roy drills an on-drive straight to mid-on. Pinged off the middle"
"comes down the pitch and mows this wide of mid-on, Stanlake had pulled his length back a touch, Roy lost his shape a little as the bat twisted in his hands"
"back of a length at off stump, 84mph, pushed firmly to mid-off"
"crack! Fantastic shot by Roy. Short of a length outside off, he stands tall and square drives it off the back foot through point"
"not quite so short this time, closer to off stump, he opens the face and angles it down to third man"
"round the wicket, starts with a low full toss which is driven to cover"
"uses his feet, Agar has pushed this a touch wider, pushed along the ground to long-off"
"shorter, a flat delivery, worked into midwicket"
"stays a touch leg-side of the delivery, drives a good length delivery down the ground"
"starts to shuffle to the leg side then gets back in line, drives into midwicket"
"a little shorter, he plays back and pulls into midwicket for a scampered single. Good start from Agar"
"starts with a good length delivery at off stump, Roy steps back and drives firmly into the covers. Was a googly"
"down the track, not to the pitch, Buttler drags it through midwicket...done in the air, but it's a boundary"
"<b>Roy has dropped his bat, has he been run out?!</b> He may just have got his foot in! Yes, he's safe. He dropped his bat as he got towards the crease, but his momentum was enough to get him home. Buttler had inside-edge a full delivery to short fine leg. All safe in the end"
"brings out the reverse sweep to a big full toss, finds the gap between short third man and backward point"
goes back to a short delivery and pulls down to long-on. Swepson firing it in to the pitch
"that's a terrific shot! Dances down the pitch and picks this up from outside off, a lovely clean swing the line sending it over long-on. Almost into Australia's dressing room"
"starts with a length ball outside off, Roy drives high over cover, one bounce over the rope...didn't quite come out of the middle"
"gets the yorker in, full and straight, jabbed out to short third man"
"high and handsome down the ground! Another length ball from Richardson, Buttler is able to get right underneath it and launch it straight back over the bowler's head"
"this is brilliant! Now he brings out the scoop. Shuffles to the off side, another length delivery, and this time he sends it back over the wicketkeeper"
"this is a bit more edgy, but the boundaries are flowing...a slower ball, full outside off, Buttler has a swing and it skews in the air wide of short third man"
"opts to try the shorter ball, it's the same result! Banged into pitch, Buttler waits for it then flat-bats it high over mid-off. Not far from carrying for six. An over of wonderful batting from Buttler. His full range"
"back of a length, straight, punched into the covers"
"short of a length, cramps Roy for room, takes an inside edge into the pads and bobbles to the on side"
punches a short of a length delivery straight down the ground
"into the pitch, short of a length, he can't get any timing in the shot as he drives into the covers. Good start from Tye"
"goes fuller, it's a slower ball, Buttler is a fraction early on the shot and almost bunts a catch to mid-off"
"full and straight, pushed back to the bowler. That's an outstanding over from Tye. A chance for Australia to take stock"
"<B>dropped!</b> That's a shocker from Kane Richardson at long-off. Roy came down the pitch, lofts this straight down his throat and it clangs to the ground"
"gives himself room outside leg stump, a short-of-a-length delivery, craves it over cover...mid-off had come up inside the circle"
shorter...flatter...higher! Buttler rocks back and pulls this mightily into the crowd at deep midwicket
"short again, outside off this time and Buttler has to drag it. Gets a toe end to midwicket"
"fired in at leg stump, doesn't give him any width, pushed back to the bowler"
"full and straight, forces a drive into midwicket. Very good effort to finish with three dots in the over"
"gets away with this, it's a slower ball, it gets a big leading edge looking to work to the leg side and it loops over mid-on"
"back of a length, pushed into midwicket, a tight run. Close with a hit from Finch"
"safe! There's a collision. A top edge pull, loops to the on side. Stanlake tries to get across and collides with Roy, while Finch can't get in from mid-on. Think Finch thought about asking for obstruction, but Roy didn't change direction on purpose"
"wonderful strike...six over cover! A full delivery, at the stumps, he gives himself a touch of room and it's a skimming drive into the crowd. What power"
"beats the keeper with a scoop, and that's <b>England's fastest T20I fifty</b>. A short delivery, he gets inside the line and just manages to get it wide of a diving Carey"
"full and straight, defended (yes, defended)"
"round the wicket, full and straight, worked down to long-on"
"a flatter delivery, gets it down the ground"
tucked into the leg side
"down the pitch and another lovely clean strike over long-on, got perfectly to the pitch and the bottom hand whips through the shot"
"moves outside leg stump and pushes a length delivery, angling into him, to cover"
can't beat cover again...Agar's done a good job between the boundaries!
"comes down the pitch and ends up getting to close to the ball, jabs it back to the bowler"
"short, he stays in his crease and pulls to deep midwicket"
"that's a wide long hop, but it's a dot ball! Buttler gets a bottom edge into the pitch"
rocks back to a googly and pulls between deep square and deep midwicket
"that's a massive drag down, but it's found deep midwicket! Swepson gets his first wicket. By accident or design, it's worked for the leggie. Didn't quite come off the surface, Buttler couldn't get the leverage he needed and it's a simple catch near the rope"
pushes this across wide outside off and it's called wide
"a straighter delivery, short of a length, pulled through midwicket and the sweepers can't stop the second"
"a length ball outside off, allows Roy to free his arms and he drives it over mid-off"
"short of a length, takes some of the pace of it, worked to deep square and they take on the fielder in the deep...the throw is miles wide and it's gone to the boundary. IT'S A SIX!"
"gone this time! Banged in short, Roy goes for the pull and gets a top edge it goes high in the air but no further than Finch at midwicket"
"what a ball! That's sharp and nasty. A bouncer at middle and leg, too quick for Morgan, he can't get out of the road and he takes it on the glove"
"short of a length outside off, angled down to third man"
"he goes full, and that was probably a mistake! Morgan is moving around his crease, then gets back into line and clips it out to deep midwicket. Sweet timing. It's all action!"
"short outside off, a bit of a freebie, and it's put away with a powerful square drive through point"
"gets this full at the stumps, dug out through midwicket and that's very good running"
"short of a length at off stump, driven from the back foot to deep cover"
"full toss, wide outside off, flayed over backward point and well wide of third man"
"that's better, back of a length, straight, defended to the off side"
"full at the stumps, clipped along the ground to deep midwicket"
goes back onto leg stump and squares to deep point
"dragged down short, Hales pulls without great timing and sends it to deep square leg"
"fuller, at the pads, tapped into the leg side"
"he's found deep point with a reverse sweep! A shorter delivery from Swepson, means Morgan can't get over the top of it. Takes a big top edge and a simple catch for Tye"
"short outside off, driven to deep cover"
"touch fuller, cut to deep point...well bowled by Swepson"
"round the wicket, good length at the stumps, driven to deep cover"
that's a huge blow down the ground! Stays in his crease and actually goes down on his back knee as he leverages this perfectly straight
"drags the length back, worked down to long-on"
plays back to a shorter ball and pushes it past Agar down the ground
"drilled into the pitch by Agar, bunted down the ground to long-on"
"fuller, at the stumps, takes a thickish inside edge to the leg side"
"lovely piece of touch play, it's a length ball outside off, a slower ball, Hales waits and then angles fine of short third man"
"full and straight, clipped off his toes to deep square"
"back of a length, angled into the pads, worked through midwicket and a fumble in the deep from Richardson"
"keeps it back of a length, straight, steered through point with an open face"
"defeats him with a slower short ball, Root is through his leg-side swat far too early...clever bowling, his trademark"
"he waits a fraction longer this time, it's another short ball at 70mph, pulls to deep square who does well"
"just short of a length, he rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket"
"back into his crease, pulled one bounce out to deep midwicket"
"wide outside off, he can't get any timing as it takes the bottom edge into the pitch. Good stuff"
"more air, it's full at leg stump, shovelled through the leg side and he paced the shot just right for the second"
"brings out the slog sweep, places it perfectly between then men deep on the leg-side boundary. Was a good length, straight, and ideal for the shot"
dabbed to short third man
"full outside off, carved over short third man as he leans back and opens the face a fraction"
"very full, wide, and too wide...Root let it go and got the call"
"when it's not your day, it's not your day...a slower ball, back of a length, Root swings to the leg side and gets a top edge which flies wide of the keeper and fine of third man"
"short of a length outside off, pings this drive off the back foot to deep cover"
"a low full toss outside and it's expertly steered down to third man, the fielder was inside the circle now and he had no chance"
"appeal for caught behind...give not out and they call the <b>review</b>. There was a noise. A very wide ball, Hales move across his crease and drove and it. Did bat hit the ground? Yes, looks like bat hit the ground if anything. Daylight between bat and ball"
"full toss, at the stumps, sliced to third man"
"full length, straight and drilled down the ground. Immense power from Hales! Gave himself a touch of room and forced through the line"
"a short ball, 73mph, Hales doesn't connect cleanly as he pulls one bounce to deep square leg"
worked to deep square
"that's gone many a mile! Offers up a length ball, allows Hales to use all his long reach to swing through the line and launch it into the second tier over long on"
finds long-on this time as he players another thumping drive down the ground...just lacked the placement this time
"and now Root shows what he can do...brings out the reverse scoop to a back of a length delivery, places it fine of short third man"
"full outside off, 75mph, bit of a cutter, chopped into the pitch and finds point"
"short of a length outside off, pulled down to long-on"
"that's brilliant from Hales! Toying with the field. It's a wide full delivery outside off, in fact a low full toss, he goes right across his crease and then sweeps it behind square. Outstanding placement"
"short of a length outside off, takes a top edge down to third man who makes sure he stops the ball rather than gamble on a catching chance"
"pulls a short ball from low down on the bat, straight down the ground"
"and he finishes with a dot ball as Root gives himself a touch of room, comes down the pitch, and plays over a full delivery outside off"
"<B>what a catch!</b> Would you believe it?! A bangs in a slower-ball bouncer, it ballons off the pitch, Hales swats it back towards Stoinis who sticks out his right hand and grabs a blinder"
"off the mark with a six! Stoinis opts to go full and straight, ends up being a length delivery which Bairstow deposits over long-off. Just had the height to get over the fielder"
"goes full again, outside off, thumped along the ground to long-off"
"full outside off, swing and a miss from Root. Precious dot ball"
"full again, a yorker outside off, steered down to third man with an open face"
"short of a length, connects well with a short-arm pull but it's straight to deep midwicket"
"superbly bowled, goes deep in the crease and digs out a yorker to the on side...Tye gets across, then gets into a tangle with Root"
"another dot...moving all over the crease, it's full outside off, 71mph and tries to scoop to third man"
"excellent stuff, a dipping slow ball, swinging across the line...an appeal for lbw, heading leg side perhaps"
"low full toss, can only cloth the drive towards mid-off who is inside the circle"
"all sorts of a mess here! Root is run out. Bairstow is completely defeated by a slower short ball, it loops through to Carey and is aware that Root is charging up for the bye and that's end to aim for. Lobs the ball to Tye to completes the work"
"well, that makes up a little for the first five deliveries of the over! Just can't quite nail the yorker, it's a slower ball at off stump, Bairstow is able to get under it and heaves it miles back over long-on"
"a swing and a miss! Outside off, curling away from the left-hander and through to the keeper"
"a hint of shape away from the bat once more, and this one bounces more. Beats another ambitious swish"
"forward this time, and thumping a drive to mid-off"
swinging down the leg side this time
"on the toes, and bat on ball this time, out to Jordan at deep square leg who does well to keep the ball in play"
"<B>robbed!</B> Right in the slot for the drive, but clobbers it too straight, and straight into the non-striker's stumps"
"well bowled, an outswinging yorker, jammed down late, and that's a fine over"
"well bowled, a wide outswinging yorker, just inside the tramlines. Can't lay a bat on that"
back of a length this time and clipped just past short fine leg for the first boundary of the innings
"on the pads once more, and a similar stroke, slightly finer this time. Freebie runs for Australia"
"<strong>crashed through the covers!</strong> That's a proper cricket shot, but Jordan served up the driveable half-volley. Runs are flowing now"
"yorker length, a better ball, stabbed to point and a sharp single, puts the fielder under pressure and he can't gather for the shy"
"<strong>bouncer</strong>, that's brisk and well-directed. Finch swings into the pull but can't make contact"
"on the pads, following the batsman as he made room, and Buttler does well to gather the deflection"
"on the hip,<strong> a lollipop of a catch to short fine leg!</strong> It was a slower ball, Short was through his pull too soon and Plunkett has the early breakthrough"
reaches for the wide yorker and squirts a drive down to third man
"a thumping drive into the covers, Jordan fumbles and the batsmen cross"
poked to point
makes room and <strong>slices a fat edge through third man!</strong> Any boundary will do
"tighter line from Jordan, back of a length, and<strong> there's a fine shy from the deep!</strong> Nah, the batsman is home, but that got his skates on!"
pummelled high and mightily out towards deep extra cover... two men gallop back but the ball just eludes them!
"a sharp bouncer, but it's been called for an over-step, rather than on height. A <B>free hit coming up</B>"
<strong>tanked over long-on!</strong> A stand-and-deliver wallop. Lovely
"<B>beaten all ends up by the slower ball!</B> Maxwell lined up a chancy waft, and played all round a gently curling outswinger! Oh Glenn ..."
"whoops! A clear run-out chance from midwicket but a wild throw, and it's pinged all the way to the boundary!"
"tapped to the leg side, and another single is the upshot"
"on the pads, nudged firmly to the leg side"
"whipped on the up, out through the leg side, that's a solid connection behind square. Australia keep scrapping"
"back of a length outside off, and thumped into the covers"
"round the wicket, looked like another slower ball, Jordan at backward square leg gathers a wafty pull"
"a whistling bouncer, goes through the batsman and the keeper too! They jog the single as Buttler turns to collect"
"thumped into the deck by Plunkett, and there's an under-edged connection on an ambitious wind-up.Another scampered single"
"a bit of a rubbish delivery, down the leg side. We'll have that one again"
steps out to the leg side this time and connects with a slog to deep midwicket
"short, slow, picked. Boshed through the covers! On the up and ferociously timed"
"well bowled, a sharp bouncer, into the body as Finch gave himself room. At 86mph. Good wheels"
"round the wicket, Finch slaps a cut out to cover. Finch has only faced ten deliveries in the Powerplay, which isn't ideal"
"very full length inswinger, met with a clubbed drive into the covers"
"a low full toss, and pinged behind square with excellent timing. Jordan can't cut that off, and Finch signs off the Powerplay in some style"
"a well-flighted legspinner, on off stump, and flicked square"
makes room outside leg and carves straight to cover
"back of a length, a slower legbreak, and Finch can't pierce the field this time. 47mph ... barely enough legs to reach the other end"
"cracked back down the pitch, on the back foot"
"full length, looped up, clipped back to the bowler"
"tossed up, a low full toss, eased down to wide long-on, that's a fine over to open his spell"
makes room and squirts to backward point
"<strong>pounded down the throat of long-on!</strong> That is an absolute sucker punch. Australia trying to make something happen, picks the wrong stroke for the wrong ball, and cloths a slog to the man on the rope. This isn't going quite to plan for the visitors"
tossed up and turns a touch as it hits the pad outside the line of off
"opens the face, and that's a cleverer shot from Finch, a deft nudge through third man, and it's a rapid outfield"
dabbed once more but straight to backward point
"on the legs, and clipped to midwicket"
"flicked to the leg side, the shy comes in but it looks like Morgan broke the stumps while trying to gather"
"<B>bowled him!</B> This is getting ugly now for Australia. No momentum whatsover for Australia, Carey tries to work a topspinner out through the leg side, but succeeds only in ushering it into his timbers!"
"on the back foot, punched into the covers"
"<B>slogged into the guts of long-off!</B> This is just a non-thinking stroke from Stoinis, planting the front foot, and smashing clean through the line, straight at the man positioned for that very shot. It's unravelling in a hurry now"
"legbreak, and turned to the leg side. Another brilliant over. Rashid is bossing the middle overs"
clipped to the leg side once more
"on the back foot, punched into the covers"
"plants the front foot, and drags a <B>massive flat six</B> over cow corner. That's more like it"
"outside off, chopped to point, and Finch is off strike once more. He's faced barely a third of the balls in this innings so far"
cracked to cover
"tucked off the hip, looking for two but thinking better of it"
a dabbed cut to backward point and a <B>direct hit</B>. But the batsman is home
"outside off, clubbed out to cover, Finch is back off strike"
"googly on the pads, Agar doesn't pick it, and ends up being cramped for room"
"leaning forward, and once again, unable to pick the wrong'un"
"thumped over the leg side, excellently grabbed by Swepson on the bench!"
brings out the slog-sweep but can't connect
full and Agar is stymied once more
"down on one knee, and <B>launched over cow corner!</B> So much height, it challenges the floodlights, but plops safely over the rope"
"wider line, hauled greedily down to wide long-on"
<B>Agar loses his bat as he smashes a drive into the covers!</B> More distance on the bat than ball
"<B>hoisted down the ground</B> A very wide line, tempting Finch to reach for the ball but he connects impressively in the end"
<strong>kaboomed over cow corner to complete a lone-hand fifty!</strong>. If only he'd had more of the strike ...
"wider line, cut through backward point"
"<B>slotted into the stands!</B> Finch hasn't given up the ghost yet ... makes room to leg, and launches over the covers!"
"shapes to leg again, Plunkett follows him this time and it's a push to the off side"
"slower ball, pulled out to midwicket, and Finch drops his bat to deny himself a second run"
"<strong>cracked fiercely off the back foot!</strong> Flogged through the covers, and Australia just beginning to find a belated answer"
"on the legs, clipped to midwicket"
"slower bouncer, pulled behind square to Rashid"
"reaching for the ball, way outside off, and a one-bounce gather for the man at deep midwicket"
"<strong>a flowing flog through the line!</strong> Down the ground, beats long-on. Better from Australia"
"takes the pace off, outside off, and this one is cuffed to midwicket. Well bowled"
"full toss, and <B>battered into the stands at midwicket!</B> Finch is on a roll now!"
<strong>massacred back over the bowler's head!</strong> Stays still at the crease and launches through the line. Moeen is getting some humpty now
"<B>pounded mightily into the crowd once more!</B> Down on one knee, unfurling his levers, and targetting the floodlights!"
"drilled down the ground to long-off, as Sweet Caroline belts out around the ground. Edgbaston is buzzing!"
"full length, shaping into the right-hander, punched along the ground to deep cover, and Finch just about makes it back for two"
"low full toss, effective in the circumstances. Long-off gathers"
"<strong>battered through the covers,</strong> and that's very well timed. Picked the slower ball and the man on the rope couldn't sprawl to reach it"
"yorker, well bowled, clipped to long on"
"full and straight, and punched full and straight. Long-off swoops round to save the boundary, and that over has just restored a measure of calm to England's bowling effort"
"right in the slot, and slapped hard down the ground"
"<B>tossed up, a cuffed slog, and Jordan clings on brilliantly on the edge of the long-on rope!</B> A solid base from a solid pair of hands, reached towards the rope with the ball coming over his shoulder and ends a brilliant captain's knock, and probably Australia's hopes too"
off the mark immediately with a nudge into the gap
"googly, hauled down to long-on"
"<strong>banjaxed into the stands!</strong> Deep in the crease, clears the front leg, and pounds it over cow corner!"
"smashed down the ground, Jordan gathers on the bounce to end a fine match-defining spell"
drilled out to the off side
"wide outside off, but that looks a bit of a harsh call. Right on the guideline"
"very well targetted this time, another wide yorker, half an inch to the good"
"turns his stance inside out in a bid to take on the three fielders on the leg side, but can't get enough bat on the ball"
"swished to the leg side, finds the man at short fine leg"
"wide line once more, a slower ball, clipped down the ground. This has been a fine over, and Australia's challenge is fizzling out"
"low full toss on a wide line once more, clothed to deep midwicket. Australia need boundaries"
"low full toss, but arrow-straight. Morgan gathered at cover, and had time to nail his shy. That would have been out!"
"<B>bowled round the legs!</B> Agar lined up a swish to the leg side, but Jordan responded with an arrow-straight yorker. Put a bow on it, this one is done"
<strong>no he can't! </strong>A grim day ends with a first-baller. A limp drive to mid-off. Sometimes there's no place to hide
"full and straight, but Swepson the debutant responds with a firm defensive push"
"crashed hard into the covers, but just the single"
"low full toss, can't do much with that, punched straight, and Jordan's day's work is done"
"round the wicket, right into the blockhole"
"wide full toss, can't reach with a swing and a miss"
"<strong>... but sixes still keep them alive!</strong> This one is massive, in the slot for a swing back down the ground"
"taking on the rope once more, but <B>picks out the lanky Plunkett at wide long-on!</B> Toe-ended but it had legs on it. Plunkett had to time his leap but did so with aplomb. Nearly done."
a flashing drive to deep extra cover
"wide yorker to finish, he's bowled that line very well. Chopped to point and Willey completes a fine evening's work"
"banged in short, Stanlake ducks"
a swish down the leg side
"another bouncer, another air shot. Stanlake, for all his talent as a bowler, strikes me as a very traditional No.11. And hurrah for that, they are a dying breed"
<strong>in the slot and slogged over cow corner!</strong> Like Devon Malcolm at Sydney 1994! He's got levers you know!
"<B>that'll do it!</B> High on the bat this time, chipped to Morgan at cover, to complete a thumping England win!"
