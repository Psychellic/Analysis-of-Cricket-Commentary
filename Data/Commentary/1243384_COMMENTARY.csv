He had defended the last two balls from the crease, with no real forward stride, and a similar crease-bound response is of no use against this ball, which is a little fuller and tails in sharply, late. Not sure if it's reverse-swing or movement off the seam, but he was an absolute sitting duck, playing hurriedly across the line and missing. He thought of a review, but decided against it.

"hammers the ball, but it goes straight to point. Root is so so good once you give him a chance to get on the back foot and Bumrah does here with a rank short and wide delivery"
<b>su-weeeeetttt</b>. He's on the front foot this time and that makes it almost picture perfect. This is NOT a half-volley. But Root storms forward. His balance is majestic. And then it's the hands. A simple extension of them gives him all the timing he needs to find a very crisp boundary at cover.

rocks back and punches the shortish delivery outside off to the left of cover

"goes for the bouncer this time, but Root is happy to drag it from way outside his right shoulder and to deep square leg. On bouncier pitches that's a risk, here, it's a run-scoring opportunity. Good batting. Good judgment."
slower ball from Bumrah now but Root is up to the task again. Solid defence in front of off stump
"back of a length and way outside off, Root is happy to let it through"

"good length and slanting in at off and middle, pushed to mid-on"
"on a length and outside off, Ishant drags Stokes into a drive. Stokes simply reaches out in the channel with his hands and inside-edges it into the pitch"
Stokes gets right behind the line of this full ball angling in at off and defends back to Ishant
"back of a length and slanting in at off, just no pace off the pitch, Stokes has ample time to defend this back to Ishant"

"tossed up wider outside off, driven to deep point"

"back of a length on middle and off, worked away to deep square leg"
"a touch short, close to off stump, punched to deep point"

"nearly gets another wicket off the reverse sweep! Or has he? India have reviewed this one...  Stokes seemed to premeditate against this one, and it's fired in on a stump-to-stump line. Through his shot early, and the ball strikes his glove and pops up before landing safely behind square on the off side. India thought it hit his pad rather than his glove. That can happen - India lose a review"

"big appeal for lbw, and it isn't given. Nadeem is convinced he has Root, and Kohli agrees to ask for the review... Nicely bowled, he's been hitting some good lengths in his last two overs. Root is forward to defend, he plays for turn, and the ball goes past his inside edge to hit his front pad. It went close to his inside edge but missed. The line is good, but the bounce, according to ball tracking, would have taken it over leg stump. It looked close, though. India lose another review, but this was one they were probably right to take"

flat length ball angling in from wide of the crease and spinning in towards middle and leg. Goes back to defend to short leg
"ooh, that jumped out of nowhere. There are a few footmarks outside the left-hander's off stump, and this probably landed in that area. Jumps up to hit Stokes' glove and then his forearm and fall safely to the leg side. Could have gone anywhere"

"a bit of flight, lands on an inviting length outside off, driven firmly into the covers"
"flat length ball on the stumps, goes right back and clips to square leg"

"goes back to a length ball spinning in from outside off, defends with soft hands"
"dangled up wide of off again, and Stokes brings out the reverse-sweep. Risky shot, he's not quite got his head over the ball, but he hits it hard, in the air, and there's no one in the point region, just a short third man who's too fine to stop this"

Even with this pitch not offering any turn, he has found a way to hoodwink a batsman. Pope is playing for this non-existent, mythical turn. He is playing down the wrong line. And a full length ball pitching on off stump casually drifts past the leading edge of the bat and pins him"
"<B>caaaaatttttch</b> is the cry! And it almost carried to short midwicket! Glorious bowling from Ashwin. He knows with a new batsman in the middle, he has the licence to loop the ball up, dangle it wide outside off and lure him into hitting against whatever turn the pitch offers. Inside edge nearly does Buttler in"

"Nadeem wins an lbw appeal from umpire Menon, Root calls for a review almost immediately. Pushed through flat, straightens just enough from around the wicket, Root has a short stride and plays around his front pad. Struck on the front pad, below the knee-roll in line with middle. If there's no bat, this looks adjacent. No inside edge and the tracker returns three reds. Root's marathon is over. Stunning innings, and he's warmly welcomed back by his mates in the dressing room. From out of nowhere, two in two overs for India"

"darted on middle, defended back to Washington"
"down the track, and punched down to long-on"
"<strong>Washington and Pant go up in unison.</strong> They think they have their man. Umpire Chaudhary, though, shoots down the caught-behind appeal. Washington pleads with the umpire, then goes down on his haunches. On a length and drifts away outside off, draws an iffy prod from a crease-bound Buttler. Did that graze the outside edge? India don't have any reviews left to challenge Chaudhary's not-out call. Washington will wait to wait for his maiden Test wicket at his home ground"
"Washington now overpitches it just outside off, Buttler doesn't need any second invitations, laced to the cover fence"
"tossed on middle, kept out"
goes back to one that slides in with the angle and cramps him for room. Jabbed into the covers
"down the track to the flighted ball on off stump, doesn't quite reach the pitch of it for the lofted drive. Miscues it slightly but clears mid-off comfortably"
"now Bess steps out, this one's straighter, and he punches firmly towards midwicket"
"flatter, goes back to punch this back to the bowler from an off-stumo line"
"ooh, tight leave. Nice length from Nadeem outside off, and this didn't turn"
"ooh, he's not had a great Test match so far but he's bowled some beauties every now and then. Another one pitches on the perfect length just outside off and zips through, going with the angle. Bess's bat comes down at an angle in defence, and it slices into the gap between bat and pad and narrowly misses off stump"
"tossed up on off stump, steps out and drives it back to the bowler"
again Sundar beats the batsman with lack of turn. Presses forward to defend one that dips a lot shorter than he may have anticipated and it beats his outside edge and hits his thigh pad
"down the track now, and again Bess doesn't reach the pitch of the ball. This one spins in, and the inside edge runs away to the right of short leg"
"now the ball doesn't turn as he comes forward to defend, and the outside edge rolls to the left of backward point"

"tossed up full on middle and leg, clipped towards square leg"
"another goes with the arm, close to off stump, but it's short enough for Bess to read it off the pitch and defend into the point region"
"unlucky Ishant. Back of a length outside off, and Buttler goes hard at it with an angled bat, looking to chop it away through point. Ends up inside-edging past his off stump to the fine-leg boundary"
"bowled him, big misjudgment from Buttler. I don't think it reversed - or if it did, it didn't reverse dramatically. May have been inward movement off the seam, actually. But whatever it was, it was too close to off stump for Buttler to be leaving it, and he hears a loud 'tunk' as soon as he takes that decision"
"wow, got him first ball, and that's Ishant's 299th Test wicket. Again, he hits a superb length just outside off, and gets it to nip back in to hit off stump. No footwork from Archer, he's stuck on his crease and jamming down ineffectually in defence as the ball bursts through. May have kept slightly low, perhaps, but not exaggeratedly so"
"keeps it out. This is another top-of-off ball, and he's playing from the crease, but he manages to squeeze it away wide of gully with an open face. And what's more, Ishant has overstepped"
"length ball angling into the pads. Looks to flick, misses, gets a leg bye into the backward square leg region"
"length ball, angling in from around the wicket towards off stump. Defended into the point region"
"edged, but it doesn't carry to wide slip. Rohit was well placed there, he didn't have to move at all, but the ball fell just short of him. Angled in towards off stump, fairly full length, inviting the drive. He goes for it with no real footwork, and gets a thick edge"
"tossed up close to off stump, gets forward to clip watchfully into the on side"
"again he goes past the outside edge. His lengths have been so much better in this spell. Pokes at it from the crease, no feet, and it goes with the arm and beats the outside edge"

"full on off stump, driven to long-on"
"overpitched on off stump, clipped into the midwicket region"
"down the track and Sundar fires it in quicker, at his feet. Clipped to midwicket"

"similar line and length, and Leach thinks about having a poke, before deciding just in time to leave it alone"
"beats him again. A touch shorter in the corridor, invites a back-foot jab, and it straightens to beat his outside edge"

"a bit of inward movement and extra bounce, and Bess is stuck on the crease while looking to defend. Past the inside edge to hit him in the groin. Ouch"
"full, angling down leg. Looks to flick, and gets a tickle of his pad on it to get it past the diving Pant"
"ooh, <strong>nearly another batsman bowled leaving the ball</strong>. Ishant gets this to shape back in again, not extravagantly, but it comes in late, after Bess has made his decision to leave. Doesn't miss the top of off by much at all. Inches"
"big lbw appeal as Bess plays around his front pad while looking to flick. Even fuller this time, big inward movement, probably going down leg"
"<strong>dropped</strong>. Bess steps out and looks to flick Washington, but he hits it in the air, and Rohit Sharma puts down a simple one at straight midwicket, coming straight to him at chest height. Came down the track but didn't get his head over the ball, and met it well in front of his body"

"ohoho, this is just too gorgeous. Full, angling into middle and leg, and yes, most batsmen would put that away to the midwicket boundary, but would anyone else do it as effortlessly? A bit of Mark Waugh in that"
"gone, and Gill will be filthy with himself for that shot. Full, angling into off stump, and Gill gets forward to drive, plays well in front of his body. It's possible the ball stopped on him, but to me it looked like he played that on-drive a touch too early. Spoons it in the air, and Anderson takes a super catch diving to his left at wide mid-on"

"length ball on off stump, defended back down the pitch"

"full on the stumps, defended back down the pitch"
"full and Anderson brings this back into Pujara's pads, picked off through square leg"

"down the track to the flighted ball outside off, doesn't get to the pitch, and he thrusts his pad at the ball with bat hidden behind it. Too much bounce to provoke a proper lbw appeal"

"quickish length ball on off stump, goes back in his crease and defends to midwicket"
"down the track to the off-stump ball, gets close to the pitch of it and whips to forward square leg"

"shuffles out of the crease again, but he isn't to the pitch of this flghted ball wide of off stump. Padded away with bat behind pad"
"tossed up wider again, and this time Pujara gets right to the pitch of it, and he uses his wrists to drive it firmly to the right of mid-off"
"and again. Bess bowls this quicker, on an off-stumpish line, and Pujara is out of his crease in a flash to convert it to a full-toss and smack it between bowler and mid-off. A lot of bottom hand in that shot again, typical Pujara"
"down the track first ball to the flighted ball outsde off, and he lofts it flat, on the bounce, to long-on"
"down the track to the flighted ball on middle and off, drives inside-out to the left of mid-off"
"ooh, some extra bounce. Goes on the back foot to try and work it leg side, and inside edges into thigh pad. Falls safely close to his feet, though"
"bang. Out of his crease to the flighted ball, and he swivels himself through a big slog that easily clears the wide long-on boundary"
"and again. This time he's slightly less close to the pitch of the ball after jumping out, and so he employs a diagonal-bat swat to just clear Dan Lawrence running to his left from long-on and diving desperately"

"fuller, on middle and off, gets his front pad out of the way to defend it back towards the bowler"

"quickish, spinning into the stumps, goes back and defends into the on side"
"nicely bowled, dips onto that perfect length close to off stump where Pujara has to try and stretch forward from the crease to defend. A bit of extra bounce, and the ball hits high on the inside edge but dies before reaching short leg. The difference between this and the Kohli one was the line. The wider line drew Kohli's bat away from his body and made him play with an open face"
"and Pant continues taking Leach on. And why not if he can keep hitting them like that. Tossed up, aiming into the footmarks, and he gets down the track, gets close to the pitch, and swings it away with the turn, over long-on"
"a bit quicker, spins into the stumps, goes back and works it away through backward square leg"
"a touch short, spinning away from off stump, waits and wats and then plays that trademark late cut wide of slip"

"quickish length ball again, a little further outside off, defended into the off side"
"tossed up wider, opens his bat face and steers it to the left of backward point"
"slightly short, spinning in from outside off, Pujara rocks back to pull, but it isn't short enough for a full extension of the arms, so he can't get the power behind his shot to beat short midwicket"
"down the track again, and this time he's just cleared Archer leaping backwards at long-on. Tossed up on that wide-ish line again, and Pant gives it everything, with that big swivel through the hips"
"quicker, gets a good stride forward to push to the right of extra-cover"
"tossed up on middle stump, steps out and whips to the right of mid-on"

"sharp turn and bounce from just outside off, left alone"
"nicely left. Dangled up invitingly outside off, and he gets a big stride forward and shoulders arms"
"flatter, on the pads, clipped round the corner to long leg"
"Do we have a run-out here? Down the track, meets this one on the full, and flicks from outside off, but the man at short leg does brilliantly to stop it and flick it at the stumps. Pujara dives in, but is he home in time? The umpires check  with their colleague upstairs if it's a bump ball first - yeah, it bounced into the ground after hitting the bat, so it's not a catch at short leg. Now they check for the run-out. Nope, he's in the crease just in time. Superb work from Ollie Pope at short leg, though. Direct hit would have probably had him."
"down the track to the flighted ball outside off, clips it to short midwicket"
"quicker, on off stump, goes back to clip to mid-on"
"tossed up outside off, steps out and clips it between the two midwickets"
"down the track and Leach fires in a full-toss at his pads, clipped away to the right of backward square leg"
"a touch short outside off, goes deep in his crease for the late jab to the left of backward point"
this time the line is too close to off stump for the late cut. Chops it firmly to backward point
"tossed up slower, close to off stump, presses forward and defends with soft hands"
"down the track, and that's the shot of the innings so far. Right to the pitch of this middle-stump ball to whip it against the turn, to the right of mid-on"
"tossed up outside off, stretches out and defends with an open face, looking for a single to the left of backward point. The fielder moves quickly and prevents it"
"first show of aggression from Pant against Bess. Down the track, and he gets close to the pitch to play the inside-out lofted drive over extra-cover. Top shot"
"quickish length ball outside off, left alone"
"tossed up slow outside off, and Pant leaves it alone. Sharp turn and bounce again"
"fuller, closer to off stump, driven to short extra-cover. Reached out a little"
"quicker length ball outside off, left alone"
"<b>square turn</b> from outside off, and it's a good thing for Pant that he left this one as well. Excellent take from Buttler, reaching to his left"
"down the track, and Pujara brings up his fifty with another gorgeous shot off Leach. Skips slightly inside the line to drive inside-out, to the left of extra-cover. Superb feet, superb hands"
"tossed up outside leg, thrusts his pad out and kicks it away"
"now he drops a touch short, and Pujara has ample time to make a bit of room and chop to deep point"
"tossed up wide of off, gets a stride forward, head over the ball, to clip to midwicket"
"flat-batted, what a way to get to his fifty. Down the track, and this time he's well to the leg-side of this flighted ball from Leach. Hammered flat, straight of mid-off, and it smacked the boundary boards almost before he had completed his follow-through"
"down the track again, this time he's closer to the line of the ball and he uses his wrists to clip it down to long-on"
"tossed up wide of off, looks for the cover drive but plays too early. Off the inside half of the bat, back to the bowler"
"tossed up fuller, on off stump, blocked into the covers"
"shortish outside off, punched to deep cover"
"flat length ball on off stump, goes back and looks to work it away but Pope throws himself to his right at short leg to stop it"
"skips out to the flighted ball outside off, clips it back to the bowler"
"flatter, goes right back on off stump to defend into the on side"

"pitched up on middle, Pant moves forward to defensively push the ball to the covers"
"overpitched and sliding into the pads, tucked away to long leg"
"pitched up and outside off, Pujara covers his off stump and shoulders arms"
"full and angling into middle, Pujara is right forward - and across - to blunt it to the leg side"
"short, wide, sits up to be thrashed. Pant doesn't need any second invitations. He reaches out for the ball with his hands and flays it away to the left of backward point"
"on a length and sliding in on middle from around the wicket, defended"
"Pant gets right behind the line of this back-of-a-length delivery on off, defensively drops the ball to cover"
"floated full and on a fourth-stump channel, Pant gets forward and drives through the line to mid-off"
"fullish and just a shade outside off, run away to point with soft hands"
Pant stands up tall to this short ball outside off and punches powerfully through the line to ping the cover boundary. Top shot from a top player
"<b>glorious straight drive</b>. All Pujara has to do is punch the ball, it's a full toss, an attempted yorker gone bad, and the batsman simply presents the straight bat with an added oomph"
"oooh, he's aggressive! Spots the short ball outside off and rocks back to try and smash it through the covers. Doesn't quite manage it though"
goes back to basics with a full length ball outside off and Pujara gives it the respect it deserves: a leave
"comes in off the pitch, cramping Pujara on middle and off. But he's solidly behind the short ball rising up above his midriff"
<b>keeps low</b> does this length ball outside off. Archer tries to hit the deck on just back of a good length but it dribbles through as Pujara leaves
"back of a length and cutting in off the pitch, but straight onto the middle of Pujara's back foot defence"
"<b>outside edge</b> flies away between slip and gully. There is no doubt Pant was drawn in to play away from his body, but this pitch is so slow, that there is time for the batsman to realise his mistake and soften his hands so that the ball goes to ground"
tucks a back of a length ball angled into him towards midwicket
"hints of reverse swing into the left-hander, but it's on an overpitched delivery that Pant drives smartly to mid-off. Then not so smartly he wants a single, and he's fortunate Pujara has the clarity and authority to send him back"
blocks a good length ball outside off with extremely soft hands in front of point and now they pinch the single on offer
chops a back of a length ball outside off towards gully
"<b>decks in sharply on Pujara</b> who takes a hit on the gloves. A painful one by the looks of it. <b>He wrings his right hand immediately</b> and then when he goes up to Pant, the pain forces him to bend over with his hands on his knees. Good stuff from Anderson though. Steady diet outside off stump, then suddenly the sharp back of a length indipper, which gains venom on this pitch which is occasionally offering variable bounce. This one jumped a bit on Pujara, requiring him to call for medical assistance"
"back of a length on and around off stump, Pant blocks"
"angles the bouncer into the left-hander, but on a slow pitch, Pant has so much time to get behind it"
"bouncer, this one a little off target, sliding down leg side. Pant avoids it"
"the flashing blade of Pant comes down hard against a length ball very wide outside off stump, but he's tried to hit this one too hard. Loses his timing and finds cover"
"bangs it in, making it rise up to the right armpit of the left-handed batsman. Pant does well to blunt it right by his feet"
this comes down from a bit of a round-arm action. A full length ball that Pant drives to mid-off
steps out of his crease to turn a well flighted delivery outside off into a full toss and he drives to mid-on
"another trip down the wicket, as he gets to the pitch of the ball outside off, and whips it to midwicket"
"third shimmy down the pitch in three balls, and here Bess is for it, pulling his length back just a tiny bit and forcing him to block on off stump"
"<b>and there's how Pujara dominates spin</b>! The threat of a man coming at the bowler makes him bowl too short and this man, this unbelievable batsman, is ready on his back foot, launching a pull shot to the deep square leg boundary"
"flatter and quicker this time on off stump, Pujara goes back and blocks it"
"outstanding footwork again as he races down the track, giving the bowler no chance, no hint of doing so before the delivery is bowled, and whips the full ball on the pads to the right of mid-on. He's so quick when he advances out of his crease"
defends a good length ball on off stump
"short and wide, Pujara calmly taps it through to the cover boundary. There is nothing about this shot that is in anger. All he does is make contact, and find the gap. He is so in control of his game that when the bowler loses even a small fraction of his, he pounces"
defends a full ball on middle and off stump
"rises with the short ball outside off and deftly knocks it down in front of cover, soft hands, quick single."
"bouncer outside off, it's too high for a shot, Pant leaves"
"bouncer on middle and leg, looking to cramp and maybe even unsettle Pant, but the ball just drifts a little too far, allowing the left-hander to get out of the way"
"on a length and spinning into middle, glanced to the right of short leg"
"short and spins away outside off, Pant is right back to crack it to deep cover sweeping the off side"
"Pujara takes a trip down the track, gets close enough to the pitch, and flicks with the break to midwicket"
"down the track once again, Pujara has got too close to the pitch this time, but he adjusts and drills a drive to the left of a diving Anderson at short cover"
"dangled up invitingly on off, Pujara skips out, is beaten in the flight, adjusts once again. Hides the bat behind his pad as the ball rolls towards the covers"
"on a length and turns back in rather sharply, Pujara goes on the back foot and defends it resolutely to the leg side"
"banged in short and outside off, Pant can't quite rise on top of it. Chopped away weakly between point and covers"
good length and angling into a front-foot push on middle to short midwicket
"full and homing in at off stump, Pujara pats it down to mid-on"
"shorter on off, Pujara allows the ball to come onto the bat, then drops it to the cover-point region and rushes across for a single"
"full on off, Pant leans into a drive and sends the ball rolling past the bowler"
"full and outside off, run away to gully, where Burns, I think, makes a tumbling save"
"flighted and outside off, Pujara uses his feel, meets this offbreak early and nurdles it to midwicket"
"on a length and just a shade outside off, blocked back to Bess"
"Pujara uses his feet once again, Bess drags his length back. Pujara hides his bat behind his pad and seemingly kicks it away"
"oooooh, what have you done Pujara? He slaps his bat against his pad. <strong>Bizarre play</strong>. Replays indicate that Burns has snaffled it at short midwicket off a rebound from the shoulder of the man ducking at short leg (Pope). Shorter offbreak from Bess, Pujara sees the length and loads up for a pull. The ball may have stopped on him, Pujara pulls firmly and puts short leg in the firing line. He ducks, cops a blow on the shoulder, the ball balloons to Buns"
"tossed outside off, hint of turn, forward and smothered into the covers"
"tossed up full at leg stump, whisked away to mid-on"
"on a length and pushed wide of off, Pant lets it go"
"on a length and spinning back in, Pant hastily jabs his bat down to keep it out on off"
"on a length and spins back in once again, Pant is caught in the crease and manages an inside edge onto the pad"
"Leach targets the rough once again, funky shot from Pant. Drops down to one knee and scoops it in the air between the keeper and leg-slip for four. He continues to dominate Leach"
down the track and poked back to the bowler
"<strong>muscled over long-on for six</strong>. Leach tosses it up outside off, Pant dashes down the track, does not get close to the pitch, but the hands and hips manufacture all the power. Swung away towards the deserted stands"
"flighted on middle stump, Washington bends forward in defence"
"full-toss just a shade outside off, driven away, Burns, I think, flings to his left at short cover, and deflects it to mid-off"
"looped up on off, Washington stretches out to smother any spin"
"slow, short, wide, cracked off the back foot but straight to short cover"
"flighted on off, Washington deploys a solid stride and defends to silly-point"
"turn and bounce outside off, Washington judges it well and shoulders arms"
"tossed up outside off, Pant has to reach out for a scoop/sweep, he loses his balance, and manages to flap it out of the rough over leg-slip"
"on a length and kicks out of the rough, Washington plays back and somehow keeps it out"
"shot, Washington! Tossed up outside off, but a bit too full. He stretches out and laces it through the covers to get off the mark in style"
"back of a length, flat, and spins back in, Washington goes back and turns it defensively to short leg"
"more spin for Leach from the rough, Washington nurdles it to midwicket"
"flat and spins in, Washington gets on top of the bounce, head over the ball, working it through square leg in busy fashion"
"looped up on middle, full-toss, Washington leans into it and offers a mere extension of a push. Put away to the left of Bess through mid-on"
"fractionally overpitched and outside off, Washington stays leg-side of the line and crunches it to extra-cover"
"dropped short and wide outside off, Washington is right back to it, cracking it to the right of shortish-point for four"
"tossed up outside off, driven through the line, but straight to mid-off"

"tossed up slower and fuller on off stump, defended back to the bowler off the front foot"
"full on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"down the track, and Pant has finally miscued a lofted hit. Well bowled by Bess, shifts his line wider and asks him to take on the fielder at deep cover. Does so, doesn't middle it, and slices it into the hands of Leach, coming in a few yards off the rope and moving to his left"
"tossed up, spinning in towards off stump, good stride forward to block it back to the bowler"
"full on off stump, clipped to mid-on"

"a touch short, goes back to cut towards deep point"
"tossed up just outside off, big stretch out to defend it back to the bowler"
"flatter, goes right back to try and work that behind square. There's a backward square leg in place now, no leg gully."
"once again, goes deep in his crease to work him with the turn, from the stumps. Backward square leg runs to his right and cuts it off."
"nicely flighted outside off, gets it to dip and turn as Ashwin stretches out to defend. Reasonably loud lbw appeal, but that struck him outside the line, I think. Maybe an inside edge too"
"quickish on off stump, goes back and defends it back towards the bowler"

Not the biggest appeal from Leach, but England think about it a little longer and review Anil Chaudhary's not-out decision... Ball-tracking is taking a while to load up... We're still waiting... Big stretch out, and it hit him on the thigh pad. Ball-tracking suggests the ball didn't spin enough to hit off stump, and bounced too high as well"

Flighted nicely, turns in, dips. Lawrence has a short stride and is not close to the pitch of this delivery. Ashwin pins the front pad below the knee-roll.

"full and straight, picked off to deep midwicket"
"on a length and just a shade outside off, stabbed to mid-on off the inner half of the bat"
"back of a length and on a fifth-stump line, stabbed to mid-on off the inside half again"
"on a length and just a shade outside off, Lawrence swishes his bat out of the way and lets it go"
pushed to the left of mid-off to close out the over
"flighted and spins in towards off, swept flat and hard to deep square leg"
"tossed up, full on middle, pumped over the midwicket boundary. He drops to his knee and middles another sweep to the left of deep square"
"flat and Ashwin pulls his length back a bit on middle, blocked off the front foot"
"shorter and sliding across off, Root goes right back and punches it towards sweeper cover. Nadeem runs back and hunts the ball down"
"on a length and angling across off, run away square through the off side"
"floated up outside off, Root lines up the wider line with another sweep. He shuffles across and drills it up and over backward square leg to move swiftly to 21* off 11 balls"
"back of a length and on a fourth-stump line, nicely punched through the line to cover"
"attempted short ball from Ishant, doesn't bounce much, Lawrence ducks"
"<strong>Test wicket no. 300 for Ishant</strong> - the third Indian pacer to the mark after Kapil Dev and Zaheer Khan. Nice and full, swerves back in at off to sneak under the toe of the bat and smack the front pad below the knee-roll. No inside edge involved. It would've cannoned into middle stump, according to ball-tracking. Lawrence's review goes in vain. That seemed pretty plumb. Big moment for Ishant who is arguably the most improved Test-match pacer in the recent past"
"full and angling into middle from around the wicket, Stokes covers the line and defends solidly"
"back of a length and sliding down leg, no shot"
"on a length and kicks up off the deck, Stokes sways his upper body out of the way"
"on a length and wide of off, Root toys with the spinners. Rolls out a reverse-sweep and gets it past slip for four"
"tossed on middle, Root bends forward to dab the ball to the leg side"
"skidding into off stump, Root goes back and clips it through backward square leg"
"tossed up on off, hint of turn for Ashwin, prodded to short cover"
"yorker, drifts in at middle, dug back towards the bowler"
glanced off the hips through backward square leg
"back of a length, angling into the stumps, gets back and across and works it into the square leg region"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and steers to third man"
"full, angling into off stump, defended back down the pitch"
"shot. Full, angling into middle and off, and he just extends his arms through a straight drive to loft it flat, to the right of mid-on. Looks like the slower ball, and Stokes picked it up very quickly"
"length ball outside off, punched to the squarer of the two covers"
"full, angling into middle and leg, shows the full face to drive to the right of Rahane at mid-on"
"number three for Ashwin. Tossed up outside off, drops just short of a driving length and spins away. Drives away from his body, looking to go through the covers, and gets a thin edge through to Pant"
"down the track, doesn't reach the pitch of this off-stump ball, and flicks airily, just to the right of Gill at short leg"
"tossed up just outside off, swept to backward square leg"
"quick length ball on middle and off, straightens, looks like the carrom ball, hurriedly defends from the crease"
"down the track, can't reach the pitch of this dipping ball on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"tossed up on middle and leg, swept to deep square leg"
"fullish outside off, driven with a twirl of the wrists, to the right of the fielder at cover point. Excellent shot"
"in the blockhole on middle and off, clipped to the left of deep square leg"
"full, a bit of swing into the pads, clipped to deep square leg"
"full, angling into the pads, clipped to the middle of the row of three leg-side catchers"
"full, a bit of late inswing towards off stump, punched to mid-off"
"full, this one seems to straighten late in the air towards middle and off. Keeps his eye on it and defends into the midwicket region, from deep in his crease"
"given, and Pope reviews instantly. Looks for the reverse-sweep, and there's a puff of dust and the ball pops up in the air to short leg. Looks like it's off the forearm, but did it flick the bat or gloves on the way? Doesn't look like it. They check for lbw as well, and the ball is shown to be bouncing well over the stumps"
"carrom ball on middle and leg, defended to short leg. And the no-ball siren goes off again"
"down the track now, and Pope launches it high in the air, with the turn. Doesn't really get hold of it, and it seems to go off the inside half of the bat, but it falls in no-man's land to the left of deep midwicket. Sundar does well to keep it in with a diving pullback at the rope"
"tossed up full on middle and leg, clipped to midwicket"
"full on off stump, reverse-paddled to the left of third man"
"floated up full on middle stump, and now Pope reverse-sweeps to the right of Bumrah at backward point. Gives chase, tries to pull it back with his heel, and nearly steps on the ball"
"looks to reverse-sweep from a leg-stump line, and tjhe ball pops up off the back of his bat, but falls well short of Ashwin rushing in off his follow-through"
"a bit of bounce and inward movement from a length, going down leg. Looks to clip it away, and gets a little edge on it that beats Pant's dive to his left. And it's another no ball. Off Root's glove"
"length ball outside off, a bit of late shape in, left alone"
"big appeal for lbw as Root plays slightly outside the line in defence. Not given, and Bumrah is convinced it should be reviewed. India go for it... There's no bat, and Root is playing from the crease. Strikes him in line, above the knee roll, and that's usually a sign that it's bouncing over the stumps. That's what ball-tracking says too, bouncing over and missing leg stump as well."
"back of a length outside off, chopped into the gully region"
"back of a length, a bit wider, and that's punched away gleefully through the vacant point region. With the inswing he's getting, the leg side is heavily protected so there was no one in that area"
"ooh, back of a length in the corridor, and he gets it to spring off the surface and nip away from Root too. Pokes at it, and the ball zips past his edge and Pant collects over his right shoulder"
"beats him again. Fuller this time, and perhaps a slower legcutter in the corridor. Root's feet are rooted to the crease as he pokes at this, and the ball zips past his edge but dies before it reaches the keeper"
"steps out, and is defeated by dip. Plays a checked flick, and the ball loops up but falls just short of Kohli diving forward at short midwicket"
"quicker on off stump, presses forward and blocks"
"extra bounce as this spins in from outside off. Gets forward to defend, and the ball hits his glove and falls short of Gill diving forward from short leg"
goes back to a shorter one close to off stump and taps it into the point region
"beautifully bowled. Now Root is beaten in the air as he jumps out and looks to drive down the ground. Dips, spins, and it's past his bat to hit his pad"
"goes back to this one pitching outside off, and the turn is slow, so he can watch it onto his bat and steer it wide of slip"
"back of a length, straightening towards off stump, steered towards deep point"
"looks for the yorker, middle and leg, gets his front leg out of the way and flicks to midwicket"
"length ball, some inward movement towards the stumps, clipped in the air, but wide of Rohit diving to his left from square catching midwicket"
"full, a touch too straight, clipped off the pads to the right of deep square leg. That brings up England's 100"
"appeal for lbw, immediately given. Nothing Root could do about it, and India's celebrations are muted because, though it's a big wicket, the ball kept low, and that's not a good sign going into the fourth innings. Back of a length, sneaks through low to strike Root's back leg at about shin height as he looks to defend this, right in line with off stump. Okay, maybe it didn't keep <i>that</i> low. Just caught the replay, and the ball came back in sharply, and it hit him on the knee roll"
"ooh, looks for the off-stump yorker, and Buttller jabs at it, looking to push into the covers. Ends up hitting his inside edge and flying down to the fine leg boundary"
"tossed up quite full on middle and off, big stretch out to defend"
"a touch short, spinning away from middle stump, makes room and cuts it away towards deep point"
"tossed up slow, pitching just outside leg, clipped watchfully into the on side"
"down the track, and Buttler's shown his intentions very clearly. Gets slightly leg side of the ball to make swinging room, and launches it way over the long-on boundary. And Nadeem's overstepped again, by a distance"
"quicker length ball spinning away from off stump, defended with an open face towards backward point"
"goes back to one that goes with the arm towards off stump, but it's short enough, and the pitch is slow enough, for him to be able to punch that neatly through point"
"flat length ball angling into middle and leg, stays leg-side of the ball to defend to silly point"
"full, angling into the stumps, clipped between the two short midwickets, and deep square leg runs around to mop up"
"big appeal from Bumrah as he skids one through from just back of a length and strikes the pad again with the batsman trapped on the crease. This one may have done too much, and be going down leg possibly. No review from India. This one hit the front pad, and was definitely going down leg"
"back of a length on off stump, jabbed back to the bowler"
"full, angling into middle and leg, clipped in the air, but again it eludes Rohit diving to his left. So many balls have flown wide of fielders or dropped short of them in this innings"
"well bowled, well played. This one threatens to come in, then leaves the batsman from a good length just outside off. Wisely elects to leave it"
"full, close to off stump, punched firmly but can't beat cover"
"back of a length outside off, goes deep in his crease to chop it away through backward point"
"shortish, a bit of away movement outside off, chopped into the point region"
"again Ishant gets it to reverse away from the right-hander. This is really skillful. Length ball outside off, left alone"
"length ball, closer to off stump, but Buttler picks the away reverse and leaves well"
"a little fuller now, and this one swings in towards leg stump. Very well played by Buttler, stays leg-side of the ball, keeps his front leg out of the way, and defends into the off side"
"full, swinging in towards off stump, blocked to cover"
"wide half-volley, Pope reaches out for it and sends it clattering through extra-cover. Sure, Bumrah erred with his length, but this was stylishly put away to the left of short cover"
"back of a length and angling in at the top of off, quietly blocked to short cover"
"full and slanting in on middle, nudged to the straighter of the twin short midwickets"
"full and largely holds its line outside off, dinked to the left of short cover"
jabbed straight to short cover this time
"nice and full, homing in at the fourth-stump line, Pope is forward to tap it to short cover"
short and drifting on leg stump - or even outside the leg stump - Buttler splices a pull to long leg
reverse-swept from leg stump fine of deep third man
"tossed up outside leg, Pope is ready with his reverse-sweep. Picks it from the rough and swats it away through the covers"
"Pope searches for another reverse-sweep out of the rough, this time he holes out to Rohit at cover. Pushed through flatter and faster outside leg, Pope drops to his knee, but can only get it as far as Rohit as Nadeem finds a bit of extra bounce"
Bess shimmies out and chips Nadeem over Ashwin at mid-on
"wide of the crease, sliding into the pads, nurdled through the square-leg region"

"full on off stump, pushed to mid-off"
"full-toss, tailing in at off, jabbed back to the left of Bumrah"

"darted onto the rough outside leg, Buttler goes low, swatting a sweep and finding short leg"
"another sweep out of the rough, this time struck flat and hard to the right of deep square leg"
"dangled up outside leg, Bess looks to kick it away with his pad, the ball misses the pad, beats Pant as well and rolls away past him"
down the track and chipped in the air to the right of the leg umpire
swept from outside leg to short fine leg where Bumrah runs around to his left to collect the ball cleanly
"nearly a full-toss sliding down the leg side, another sweep attempted (and missed), the ball eventually bounces out of Pant's gloves"
"poked past slip towards third man. Washington runs around, slides, and seems to have hauled the ball in"
"full and floated into the pads, clipped to the right of the two short midwickets, but there's protection in the outfield"

defends a full delivery on middle stump
steps out to block a good length ball a shade outside off stump
"sharp turn from well outside off stump as Bess stays back, perhaps attempting to cut the ball, but then, because of how much it rags, he has to block it instead"
nudges a full ball on leg stump to short midwicket
stretches forward to defend a flighted ball on off stump
sweeps it away to deep midwicket

lets go a good length ball outside off stump
goes back to block a good length ball on middle
"<b>missed stumping</b> as the ball turns and bounces way too much for both Bess and Pant. This is fairly full and fairly straight. Bess runs down at it. He doesn't get the pitch. He swings wildly. He misses. The turn and bounce then completely does the keeper in too, the ball flying past Pant's chest, to his right"
"full on off stump, he defends with an open face, looking for a single behind point. No luck"
turns it towards midwicket
pushes the ball into the covers

"loops it up just outside off, Buttler stretches forward to defend"
blocks a full ball on middle
"goes around the wicket for a full ball on middle, Buttler keeps it out"
"appeal for lbw as Ashwin continues around the wicket. Buttler sweeps a good length ball pitching potentially in line with the stumps, but perhaps the bounce might have been a problem."
"another appeal for lbw as Buttler plays around his front pad to a very full delivery on middle and off stump. Inside edged it, I think"
"Nadeem drags another short ball outside off, Bess rocks back and thrashes it through the covers"
"on a length and spins away outside off, opens the face and guides it towards short third man"
"pushed through outside off, more positive intent from Bess. He goes low and smites it over midwicket. <strong>Slog-swept away to push the lead past 400</strong>"

"skidding just a shade outside off, Bess stoops low to jab it to the leg side"
"slow, short, wide. Bess has ample time to shift back and rifle a cut square through the off side for four"
"tossed-up offbreak, Bess goes for a slog-sweep and may have got an inside-edge onto the thigh pad. No silly-point, just a short-leg in place"
down the track ad whipped to short midwicket
"pushed through on the footmarks outside leg, Buttler can't get hold of the sweep and instead wears it on his pad"
"Buttler dashes down the track, Nadeem drags his length back from left-arm over and finds some turn and bounce. Buttler has a roundhouse swipe to the leg side...and misses. Pant nicely collects the ball over the stumps and takes the bails off. Second wicket for Nadeem this innings"
"back of a length, spinning from leg to off, goes back to punch towards mid-off"
"turn from the rough outside leg, and Archer closes his bat face, looking for the flick, and the ball pops just out of reach of the second slip fielder diving to his right, off the leading edge"
"flighted again outside leg, and Archer sweeps to deep square leg"
"tossed up, spinning into the stumps from outside leg, defended back to the bowler from the crease. Exposed his stumps while doing so"
"lbw playing back to one that skids on quickly off the pitch while spinning back into him. Hit on the back leg. Given out by Anil Chaudhary, and Bess has reviewed... Close, this. The bat gets jammed behind the flap of the back pad as it comes down to defend, and it's hard to say whether the ball hit the flap of the pad first or the bat. Definitely hit both. Pad first is the verdict after a look at ultra edge, and the ball strikes him in line with off stump and is hitting middle stump according to ball tracking. Fourth wicket for Ashwin"
"carrom ball, comes in from a length outside off, watches it well and defends from the crease"
"goes on straight from just outside off, towards the stumps, defended from the crease into the off side"
"a bit fuller, more leg-stumpish, squeezes it out into the off side in defence"
"this one turns, and finds the edge as Leach defends from a half-forward press, but it falls short of Rahane diving left at slip"
"skidder, going towards middle and leg, defended into the on side from the crease"
"hangs back to one that spins across him from outside leg, punches to deep point"
"tossed up fairly full outside off, gets close to the pitch and defends into the on side"
"down the track, and Leach picks up a boundary with a big slog. Possibly wanted to go straighter, but it ended up finding the gap to the right of deep midwicket"
"goes back and this one jumps at him from the rough. Looks to work it leg side, and the ball hits inside edge, then thigh pad, and falls short of Rohit at short leg"
comes out of his crease and jams his bat down as he gets too close to the pitch of the ball
down the track again and has a big slog at a flighted ball wide of off stump. This time he edges it thickly and it flies over the man at slip
"length ball spinning in towards middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, whipped to long-on, was in the air for a while but safely so"
"sharp turn, beats the outside edge. Quickish length ball from around the wicket, pitching just outside off, and Leach is a little late getting forward to defend"

"tossed up quite full, slides on towards off stump, defended off the front foot towards silly point"

"tossed up wider and not as full, left alone"
"full on off stump, punched to extra-cover"
"quicker, slides on towards leg stump, goes back to tuck it behind square"
"five! Quick, just back of a length, and it spins in a long way from outside off stump to bowl Archer, whose feet have moved nowhere and whose bat comes down too late to keep the ball out"
"full, just outside off, and Anderson brings out the reverse-sweep! Into the ground, and it bounces up to Rahane at slip"
"and that is that. Ashwin ends up with a six-fer. Angled into the stumps, hits that length where the No. 11, not really fully forward, looks to play the angle with a closed face. Leading edge balloons straight back to the bowler, and India will need 420 to win this."
"back of a length in the corridor, left alone"
"back of a length, a little wider, Rohit leaves again"
"fuller now, but still quite wide of off stump, Rohit leaves again"
"length ball, a little closer to off stump, Rohit leaves once more"
"short now, just outside off, and it keeps climbing and climbing until Buttler jumps and plucks it out from over his head. Rohit looked to hook it, but it bounced far too much for him to make contact"
"back of a length on off stump, defended towards mid-off"
"quickish, just outside off, goes back to defend to short extra-cover"
"tossed up, angling in and pitching just outside off. Sharp turn from there after Gill leaves it alone"
"leaves again, this one's quicker and a bit shorter"
"fuller on off stump, presses forward and blocks it back to the bowler"
"down the track, gets a little too close to the pitch of this off-stump ball, jams it into his front leg off the inside half of the bat while looking to drive"
"shot! That's a pretty good ball, sliding on into the stumps. To most other batsmen, that's a good length too, but he's gone right back onto his stumps to whip it away to the left of the short leg fielder"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, closer to off stump now and he gets some extra bounce. Rohit hops to defend it, and the ball hits the sticker of his bat. Does well to play close to his body and keep it down by his feet"
"length ball outside off, left alone. Given Archer's pace, he didn't really get on the front foot to leave this one even though it was on the fuller side of a length"
"short and wide, and Rohit shapes to cut but the ball keeps low and sneaks under his bat before dying on its way to the keeper. Raised a big puff of dust too"
"full angling into off stump, presses forward to block into the covers"
"length ball close to off stump, Rohit gets across to cover his off stump and leave it alone"
"tossed up full on off stump, blocked in the direction of mid-off"
"shot. Superb shot. Goes on the back foot to a length ball sliding on towards middle and leg, and punches with a straight bat wide of mid-on. Very few batsmen can play in that direction with a straight bat line that"
"full, angling slightly down leg, and that's a poor ball when you've just moved your fielder away from backward square leg. That's where Gill flicks this"
"back of a length fairly wide of off stump, left alone"
"tossed up full on off stump, nice easy stride forward to block to short cover"

"back of a length outside off, left alone"

"shortish, close to off stump, all the time in the world to ride the bounce and dab it down gently into the cover point region"
"short, and Rohit doesn't control the pull but manages to place it in a gap. Gets up near his left shoulder, and he's through his swivel a little early, hits the toe end of his bat and runs away through midwicket"
"wow, this one is right off the middle of the bat. Only gets up to chest height, and he easily clears the square leg boundary. There is a fielder positioned there, though, so England may not mind"
"short again, at the hip, swivels to pull to the right of long leg"
"length ball tossed up outside off, left alone"
"flighted ball on off stump, presses forward and defends with soft hands. Just lets the ball hit his bat and roll away into the point region"
"bowled him, Leach has bowled a peach! That's a quick length ball, pitches on off stump stump and straightens to hit the top of off! A bit of inward drift, and Rohit's front pad goes towards the leg side, and not a long way forward, and by the time the ball grips and turns, he's in no position to meet that with his defensive bat"
"goes back to a quick one spinning from middle to off, defends solidly with the turn"
"short outside off, and Pujara will put those away all day, rocks back to cut to the right of the diving backward point fielder"

"quickish length ball close to off stump, spins away and Gill leaves it alone"
"back of a length, angling into the stumps, defended to midwicket"
"back of a length, nipping in towards the thigh pad as Pujara looks to flick. Off the thigh pad, and falls short of the man at leg gully. More backward short leg than leg gully, to be accurate"

"stays back to a fairly full ball spinning in from off stump, defends with the full face towards short leg"
"Looks to step out but it's too quick for him to get down the pitch. Angled into middle stump, and he presses forward to clip into the leg side"
"good ball, hangs it in the air, a little slower, angling into off stump. Pujara's bat comes down at a slight angle as he looks to play this into the leg side, and it spins and takes the outside edge, runs away wide of slip"
"quickish length ball outside off, left alone"
"sharp turn outside off, and Pujara leaves it alone again. Quick turn too"
"a touch short on off stump, and he rocks back, makes a bit of room, and punches to short cover"

"nice and full, drifts in, Gill gets forward to smother it"
"drifts in and finds a bit of turn outside off, no shot from Gill"

"<strong>Leach nabs Pujara too!</strong> On a length, drifts in from wide of the crease towards middle, so Pujara has to play at this. He did well not to jab at it, but the ball turns and bounces sharply to catch the shoulder of the bat and loop to the left of first slip. Superb bowling from Leach, superb catch from Stokes at slip. Massive breakthrough for England on the fifth morning. After being picked apart by Pant in the first innings, Leach is stepping up in the second on his first tour of India"

"back of a length and sliding in at the top of off, played back to the bowler off the back foot"

"Gill ventures down the track once again, meets a full-toss and drags it away to the left of deep midwicket. The fielder runs across, slides, but Gill finds the fence"

"nice and full, ducking in on middle, Gill is forward to defensively bunt it to short midwicket"
"<strong>wow, what a delivery from Anderson</strong>. He storms through the defences of Gill as England push for victory. This is even fuller than the first delivery - perfectly-pitched ball - reverses in to add to the incoming angle from over the wicket, Gill has a rather short stride, Anderson shoots past his inside edge and sends the off stump cartwheeling. Great sight for a fast bowler"
"full and hung up wide of off, Rahane doesn't bite"
"<b>Anderson thinks he now has Rahane lbw</b>. Not given by umpire Menon. Root challenges the on-field not-out decision. Another reverse-swinging full ball, bends in at off, Rahane has a short little stride too. But, has he managed to get outside the line? Not bat involved for sure. It would've cannoned into middle, but the tracker returns umpire's call on off stump"
"No problem for Anderson, next ball he <b>bursts through the defences of Rahane</b>. Full again, Anderson goes wide of the crease and gets this to zip back in. Rahane, like Gill, leaves a bat-pad gap, enough for Anderson to sneak through and topple the off stump. Game-changing stuff from the ageless Anderson. Reverse-swinging shooter.

"ooh, length ball, straightens in the corridor outside off. The line is closer to Pant on this occasion and he looks to defend, playing the angle, and the ball <strong>beats his outside edge</strong>"
"gone, Anderson gets his third. A bit of a soft dismissal, but don't discount what the bowler did there. Full, straightening off the pitch on an off-stump line. May have been bowled a bit slower too. Pant looks to play the angle and clip it into the leg side, then realises he can't and tries to adjust, but it's too late, too far in front of his body, and the ball pops up straight to the man at short cover off the leading half of his bat"

"tossed up full on middle stump, good stride forward to block with the turn"
"got him, or so England think. Anil Chaudhury is unmoved, and England have reviewed... Quick length ball just outside off, and Washington looks to defend from the crease.

"goes back to the quick length ball on off stump, not much turn, defended back down the pitch"

"loopy, nearly a full-toss again, at the pads. Gets his front leg out of the way and punches to long-on"
"short, leg-stumpish, he seemed to be shuffling onto the back foot even before the ball was bowled, anticipating this. Gets what he expected and pulls to deep square leg"
"bouncer, angling down leg, does well to step across and get away from the line before ducking"
"back of a length outside off, opens his bat face and stabs to point"
"rising short ball angling into leg stump, and Ashwin's taken another blow. On his right wrist this time, I think. Goes across to try and play it down into the leg side, which he does successfully, but the ball bounces more than expected and smacks him in the wrist"
"yikes, this is a peppering. Short again, and Ashwin shuffles into line and again the ball climbs awkwardly off the pitch. He's in no position to evade this one, smacks the top of his helmet and ricochets over the keeper"

Leach has a chat with his captain Root, and England go for a review. Ashwin has his bat jammed behind the pad as he shimmies out, pings the front pad in line with middle. Ball-tracking suggests umpire's call, and it would've bounced over the stumps. Good call from Anil Chaudhary"

"Archer has pushed Ishant back so much that he has stepped on his own stumps. Hit wicket? The TV umpire has been called in to check. Banged in short at the body, Ishant fends at it off the back foot. Replays indicate that it wasn't Ishant who had stepped back onto his stumps. Strangely, the bails fell even before Archer had delivered. Did the breeze disturb the bails? Deemed a dead-ball"

He will be leaving Chennai with a victory to savour"
