<b>Dropped</b>. Sprayed down leg and that could have been a repeat of the previous dismissal. Stirling this time has got a bat to it. Shahzad dives to his left and sticks out the left glove but ends up not being able to hold on to it
"tucked off the pads and good use of the wrists as the ball crosses the deep square leg boundary. Hamza running to his left probably needed to put in the dive, tries to stick the foot out but the ball gets away from him"
"short of a length ball, rides the bounce before blocking it into the off side"
"short of a length, stays in the crease and keeps it out to the off side, in front of point"

sliding down leg with the arm and he comes down the track and presents a straight bat to push it out to long-off
"appeal for stumping and they go upstairs to refer it. It was pushed across and drifting outside off. Nice, tossed up, loopy delivery, tempting him into the front foot drive. The batsman comes forward and the ball beats the outside edge. His backfoot comes out slightly and Shahzad is quick to take the bails off. He has slid it back in but the question is if part of the foot was inside the line. Seems like they need another angle. Seems like a part of the foot is inside the line from one angle, but the other angle suggests on the line. Who will the benefit of doubt go to? It goes to the batsman"
"flat and short of a length. And that is not the best of efforts from extra cover. The batsman was backing away and uses the depth of the crease to slap it away through extra cover. Man there, he gets down but not quickly enough and the ball goes to the boundary"
"short and wide, slapped off the backfoot through covers"
drift takes it away from the left-hander from a fullish length. Porterfield is drawn forward and attempts a drive but the ball goes off the outside part of the bat to backward point

"good length ball, angling in on middle, defended with a straight bat to the right of the bowler"
"length and sliding further down this time, on middle and leg, kept out"
"lucky boundary. Tries to pull and it does not get up as much as he would have liked. Short of good length and there is not enough room either. Goes through with the pull and the lack of bounce means the ball goes off the bottom edge, misses the stump and into the fine leg boundary"

"good length on off, worked to midwicket"

tucked off the pads through square leg
"oh, what a delivery. That's a dream of a delivery. On a length and spinning away after drawing the batsman forward. The wicketkeeper takes the bails off and they go up in appeal for a stumping. Seems like the backfoot has come up and this seems touch and go. Has he just planted a toe in when the bails are off? Remember, he has already had a life. This is really close. And it seems like the toe has just been put back in, green light comes on and Afghanistan have to wait further to get a breakthrough"
"sliding in with the arm on a fullish length, comes down the track and drills it to long-on"
