"touch short outside off, climbing through and Gayle declines to play at this one"
"<b>dropped!</b> Gayle has a mighty slash and thick-edges to second slip... <b>but Root can't prevent it from bursting through his hands!</b> He then flung himself vainly after it as the ball popped out but couldn't get there. A left off for Gayle! Should have been taken, that"
"length ball outside off, touch wider, Gayle watches it cautiously through"
"shortish, on the hip, Gayle gets the innings up and running with a nudge through square"
"dug in, 86mph and flying through over the crouching Evin Lewis - just one off the over but it could have been so much better for England"
"full, swinging away as Gayle comes forward, no stroke"

"Willey keeps the ball up, allowing for it to swing, this goes on with the arm as Gayle nudges to mid-on"
"full in the channel, Gayle takes the bait and this time manages to clear mid-off! Not the cleanest of connections, hint of a leading edge and it plugs a few yards short of the rope"

"in the channel outside off, left alone"
Lewis waits in the crease and nudges one to leg
"stand-and-deliver pummeling from Gayle, launched over mid-on! Length ball from Woakes, in the arc for Gayle to free his arms and, although it came high off the bat, still nearly went all the way"
"SMASHED! Into the crowd at wide long-on! Not the most sensible line of attack from Woakes, although he tried to push it across from wide on the crease... <b>Gayle just sat back and went blammo</b>, like it was a warm night in Bangalore!"
"shorter ball, again he's crunched through the leg side, not quite got hold of it but the ball flies past mid-on and races away - 4, 6, 4 and Woakes' tidy start has been rumpled"
"bit of shape on this from Willey, curving past the closed bat face as Lewis tries to turn to leg, hit on the back leg - touch high, I think, despite the lbw appeal"
"drops a little short and mini-Gayle tries to grab a piece of the action, pulling in the air but it lands in front of deep square leg"
"fullish, takes the outside edge but runs towards point as Gayle manages to keep it down"

"pushed through from round the wicket, tapped into the leg side and they trot the single"
"flat delivery on middle and leg, worked off the pads for another one"
"dragged down by Moeen, Lewis whirls on a pull <b>but picks out square leg!</b> It's not the danger man but they've broken the opening stand, a bit of dross does the trick as Lewis tries to go boom but instead heads down the gurgler. Decent catch from Hales, in front of his fizzog"
"over the wicket, flighted around the line of off, spinning in and blocked securely coming forwards"
"flat on off stump, punched back to the bowler"
"touch shorter from Moeen, the batsman drops back and works a single away through square leg to get off the mark"
"back of a length, just nibbles a fraction - did that hit the back leg? The deflection was wide of Buttler and short of first slip, think off thigh pad rather than bat, though"
angled in from over the wicket and worked through square leg
"goes back, angles the ball towards backward point... and then there's a moment's hesitation from Gayle as he ball-watches, rather like his run-out at Durham: <b>would have been gone with a direct hit!</b> No dive from Gayle, he ambled into his ground but the throw was wide!"

"back of a length, rising on off stump, punched firmly to extra cover"
"Gayle whumps another into the Manchester sky, it's coming down with icicles on it... <b>and this time Root takes a brilliant running catch over his shoulder!</b> Root redeems himself and the boss is off, for a handy-in-T20-but-not-so-special-ODI-score. Only -37 in the ledger, after that drop on 0"

pushed through and turned short into the leg side
"flat on the stumps, clipped off the pads to short fine leg"
"full length, driven down the ground coming forwards"
pushed through flat and dabbed into the off side for another stolen single
"flat from Bishoo, the ball sits up for a spanking and that's what Bairstow gives it, rocking back to club the ball past mid-on for four"
"four more, this time deftly sliced to third man! Slightly outside-edgy but he squirted it past slip and the pace took it away"
"tossed up nice and slow, spinning away and cut through point for one"
"lovely soft hands from Root, steering it short of backward point and they scuttle through"
floated up full and straight and nurdled around the corner

"short outside off, steered to backward point"
angled in on the stumps and worked through leg

"full, searching for the yorker, blocked back to the bowler"
"touch short and Root slices a cut, a misfield sends the ball through backward point for a couple"

tossed up and Bairstow chops the ball to cover
"dragged down, this is a bit ordinary and Bairstow smushes the ball past deep extra cover for another four"
"drops short again, now Bairstow batters him down the ground to long-on! This is clinical stuff, back-to-back fours as England continue to stroll"
"back of a length, outside off, defended to point"
"Short of a length, short-arm pull to short midwicket.  Short all round really"
"short again,  Root ducks into a measured pull to backward square leg"
"short again, and Root hustles back for two to deep square leg. Up comes his fifty. Yet another one, at better than a run a ball. He's cruising"
driven into the covers for another single ... what... how did that turn into two! Swift running but lazy fielding!
open-faced steer to backward point
banged in on an awkward back-of-a-length. Fenced into the gully
"slower ball, angled out to cover"
crashed out to cover
"short, too short, bobbles harmlessly out of Root's reach"
"gosh, a wicket! Back of a length, Root defends with a hop but the ball gets big on him and deflects straight down into the timbers. Too little too late?"
"on the hips, tucked behind square to get off the mark straightaway"
leg-sided slower ball. Bairstow scampers an instant two. He is lightning between the sticks
defended on the back foot
"angled bat, blocked out to the off side"
"down on one knee, an attractive drill into the covers, but straight at the man"
"banged in short, swayed out of the way. Too short though"
"outside off, punched pleasingly through the covers"
"width, and chased with a full face out to deep cover"
clipped to the leg side

"short and sharp, well directed as Bairstow leaves alone"
tip and run into the off side
"back of a length, squirted to backward point"
"wide of off stump, chopped to point"
"hurries on from a very full length, the dew coming into play as Bairstow defends"
down on one knee for a pre-meditated sweep
"drift outside off, and beats the edge. Well bowled"
"on the pads, tucked to square leg"
quicker ball and Bairstow is beaten all ends up! Just zips past the bat and off stump. Sneaky!
"edged and gone! A fierce delivery from Williams, kissing through sharply outside off and nibbling the edge of the bat. Through to the keeper and Morgan's hunt for runs continues"
"outside off, and a loose pokey drive flies through the gap at gully! Up and running, but not entirely convincingly"
"slower ball, Bairstow waits and pushes calmly to cover"
"another slower ball, but this time Bairstow rolls with it, deflecting into the gap at mid-on and scampering through"
"on the pads, clipped leg-side"
"low full toss, attempted slower ball, thumped back down the ground and England need 22. Bairstow needs half of those for his hundred..."
drilled hard to mid-off
"up on the toes, punched to mid-on"
"defended on the back foot, Stokes doesn't look as though he's in a hurry to win it"
drilled to cover
"inside-edged defence into the leg side, they jog the single"
"a hoick down the ground, dragged from outside off to long-on, Bairstow keeps the strike"
"outside off, punched to cover"
"outside off, a squirty drive, and it's squirted all the way to the third man boundary! That'll help!"
"on the pads, whittled into the leg side"
"full length, full face of the bat, and they scamper the single to mid-off. Stokes wears the shy on his leg as he hustles through the crease too"
"uppercut! Delicately played, but not quite fine enough to beat third man. Didn't carry to him either, mind you ..."
"panned down the ground! Stokes is bored now, and thunks a wide one mightily over long-off! The onus on Bairstow to get a wriggle on now!"
"forward, punched to cover"
"leans back for a swipe through the covers. Could have taken the single, but not sure he trusts his team-mate's intentions!"
"crashed through the covers, is this it? They run one, turn for two, there's a slip, but yes, back he comes, it's a century for Jonny Bairstow! He had to earn his opportunity and how he has seized it!"
"flicked to leg, a fumble at midwicket, and this game is all but cooked"
"tonk! Into the stands to win the match! Stokes had been itching to cut loose, and finally has full licence. High and mighty over mid-on, and England have cruised to a crushing win"
