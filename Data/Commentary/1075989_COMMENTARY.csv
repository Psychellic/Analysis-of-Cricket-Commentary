"walks down and drives to mid-on, use of the wrists."
"some more movement. Back of a length from Tanvir, moves away late. Billings wafts and is beaten"
he was always going to get an edge. This one goes down and trickles towards third man for a run
"lovely end. Good length outside off, some away movement. Smith opts to let this one go"
"on the pads to start, Billings beaten for pace. Misses a flick and is struck on the pad"
"on a length on middle, popped away towards mid-on. Goes uppish. A sign of a slow surface"
"on a length around middle and leg, Smith plays it back. No tim9ng"
"yikes, a low full toss on leg, worked away to deep square leg, should have been more than one there"

"fullish delivery on middle and leg, played away towards mid-off"
"on a length on middle and leg, inside-edged into the pad for a run"
"nice hands again. Billings gets across, gets something full and straight and just flicks away behind square for four"
poor lines. Strays down leg and Smith helps himself to four past fine leg. Deft touch. Can't bowl there
across-the-line mow on a length finds midwicket. No timing
"lucky. Gets in a good yorker on off, Smith drives but gets a thick inside edge which somehow evades the stumps and races away to the fine leg boundary"
"good length on middle and off, thick inside edge into the body. Irfan has overstepped though, can't do that either"
"a thwack over mid-on. Length on middle, Smith clears one leg and clears mid-on. A T20 stroke"
"well played. Length on off and middle, cramped for room, works one to midwicket"
nicely played. Lets the ball come to him and then opens the face to get one to third man
"length delivery outside off, Billings opens the face and guides one down to third man"
"good length outside off, but too much width. Smith misses a cut"
hit from the crease to cover. Cramped for room
"fullish delivery around off, pushed up to mid-off. With the fielder on the edge, a single is easy"

"shortish and wide from Bhatti, Billings this time fails to connect with a cut"
"superb execution. Full from Narine, Smith gets across and executes a fine reverse paddle sweep. Past slip and to the boundary"
"flat on middle, worked away to deep midwicket"
"that will be four more. Short and wide from Narine, Billings cuts and the ball takes the outside edge, flies past short third man for four."
"four more. Narine getting a thrashing. Billings gets down low and plays a high-percentage stroke, clears backward square leg with a sweep. Nice."
worked away towards square leg. Fantastic batting
"this one floats in, swerves in and beats Smith on the inside edge. Hit on the pad"
"some flight to start, tossed up outside off, carved up to deep cover"
"four more. Billings runs down, gets the ball full, he wanted to go over cover but the ball skews off the outside half and clears backward point for four"
"worked away to deep square leg, a flick of the wrists"
pushed down to long-on towards Umar Akmal who lazily and sloppily allows one by fumbling a simple collection. What was he trying to do?
"short and wide, cut to deep point. Good fielding this time prevents two"
driven up to long-on
"flat delivery on middle and leg, clipped to deep square leg"
shovelled to deep midwicket from the crease
"flat on middle and off, clipped to deep midwicket"
"flat again on off, pushed to cover. McCullum concedes an overthrow with an unnecessary throw"
"a leading edge, full. Smith plays too early, a leading edge lands safely, one to long-off"
"cut to the deep point fielder. Exceptional batting, playing out the opposition's best"
"good length delivery on off, some extra bounce. Beats Billings' swipe. Hmm, a rare sight, some bounce"

"goes through again. Back of a length outside off, Billings backs away but can't reach this time."
"well bowled. Fires in the yorker on middle, shovelled to long-on"
"more bounce. Digs this one in outside off, Smith arches his back, looks to go over third man. Fails to connect at all"
"on a length around off, blocked to cover. Good response from Bhatti"
"bowled. Clean through. Full and straight from Elliott, Billings walks across, tries to scoop the ball over fine leg, one of his more productive strokes. If you're playing that shot, you have to connect though. Billings fails to, and the stumps are rattled. Key wicket"
hammered first ball to long-on. Why bother with feet movement? Clears his leg and nails his drive. Umar Akmal saves three
one more. Elliott's doing it all. How about that stroke though? The team has just lost a wicket and Smith looks to clear midwicket with a wipe across the line. Elliott's stump to stump line means you have to make contact. Smith doesn't and the stumps are pinged once again.
driven away to the sweeper cover

"overpitched delivery outside off, a badly-timed heave finds mid-off"
backs away and chops a cut towards point
"on the bounce. A low full toss outside off, bunted down to the fielder at long-off"
"pierces the gap straight. Full and straight, Misbah hammers the ball back from where it came. Over the bowler and between long-on and long-off"
driven away to deep cover
"and another one falls. Full and straight from Elliott, Haddin is too early through his leg-side mow. Gets a thick leading edge which settles in Yasir Shah's reverse-cupped hands at point. Just struggling a bit for timing now"
"low full toss on middle and leg, nudged to deep square leg for a run"
"nice finish from Elliott. Full and straight, blocked. Not much Watson could do with that actually"

"on the pads, whipped to deep midwicket. A lull in play"
"flicked for six. Shot! Gets right back in the crease, waits for a ball in his arc and then sends it sailing over midwicket. Sweet timing"
wants another one. This one is a lot wider outside off though. Badly mis-times his lofted drive to long-on
awful delivery. Strays down leg and all Watson needs is some bat. That he gets. Flies down past short fine leg
"straight to the fielder! Slower delivery, pace off the ball. Watson wants to muscle the ball over long-on but it is never going to be easy on this surface. Doesn't get his timing right, doesn't get everything behind it and picks out Umar Akmal at long-on."
"overpitched outside off, driven to long-off for a run"
"short and wide from Narine, cut to deep point"
"the carrom ball, flat and wide, chopped to point"
"short and wide again, not bowling it straight, thrashed to the sweeper cover"
"slogged away straight to deep midwicket. Is that the best option? Flat delivery on middle, Asif Ali gets across and heaves the ball straight down to the fielder. Elliott takes a sitter."
"bowls this full on off, pushed away towards short midwicket. Narine gets across to cut it off"
pitches this too full. Misbah clears his front leg and launches a muscular drive over long-on. Not the best of timing but his power takes it over the fielder. Not Narine's best day
"a short slower ball down leg, helped along to short fine leg. Good batting, give Misbah strike"
drifts down leg for an extra
good delivery. Cramping Misbah for room with a tight delivery on a length. Misbah opens the face to get one to point
"slower delivery on middle and leg, played away towards short fine leg"

"a slow bouncer outside off, Misbah has time to see it go past but opts not to play a stroke"
"six more for Misbah. Full and straight from Tanvir, Misbah gets across and nails a heave. Hangs in the air for a while but clears midwicket. Vital runs these"
"a yorker on middle and leg, pushed to long-on for a run, good clever batting this"
excellent yorker. Sublime execution. Nothing Misbah can do but jam it out
"four more. Anticipates the yorker, goes deep in his crease. Gets a full toss and swings merrily through square leg for four"
"looking for the yorker again, misses his length and that's big. Goes deep in the crease and a heave clears midwicket. <strong>Fifty for Misbah too. </strong>"
"gets the yorker right this time. Full down leg, Misbah misses his whip and is hit on the pad, one leg bye to point. Sliding down"
"misses the yorker again. Right in the slot for a boundary anywhere in the leg side. Anywhere in the field. A full toss on middle, Shadab misses his scoop and is struck on the body."
"six more. Misbah rolling on and on and on. Goes deep in the crease, converts a yorker into something full and whips the ball over midwicket. Six more"
"oh no, Shadab. There was two easy. Worked away to deep square leg. The fielder's throw is wayward. Misbah was reads for two but the youngster sends him back"
"slower delivery, pace off the ball. Clubbed down to long-on"
"full and wide, hit away to the sweeper cover. Misbah says no, thanks, I'll take the bowling. Refuses the single"
"picks out midwicket. Slower delivery from Tanvir, good change in pace. Slogged away into Roy's hands at deep midwicket. The back foot, though, has touched the back crease and that will be a no-ball. Was always getting close. How costly is this going to be?"
whipped away to deep midwicket for a run. Roy returns a good throw to the keeper. Both batsmen are stuck on the same end. The bails are removed just before the batsmen cross so Shadab will have go to. Misbah is not on strike anyway.
"out of the final ball. A slower ball outside off, Sami lofts the ball, more height than elevation, and picks out long-off"
"fired in on leg, worked away to deep midwicket"
"that is not good bowling. Flat down leg, McCullum helps himself to four to backward square leg."
"fired down leg again, McCullum lets this go through to the keeper"
"over mid-on. A tad too full, McCullum clears his front leg and powers one over the fielder. Very similar to the way he got out yesterday, but got underneath this enough"
hammered back to the bowler
backs away does Baz. Khalid follows him. Baz pulls back in. Wide.
"flat down leg, McCullum goes back and slogs the ball waaay over midwicket. Those short boundaries again. Easy hitting"
"four more. 21 off the over. Backs away, gets a low full toss and crashes a drive through extra cover. Sedate start for Lahore"
"not a great delivery that. On a length down leg, Roy misses a whip. Struck on the bodt"
"runs down, works the ball into his body. One to cover"
advances again in typical style. Gets a low full toss and mis-times a lofted drive over mid-off. Four more.
"full and straight, McCullum swings and gets a thick outside edge which flies down to third man. Sami had dislodged the bails at the bowler's end. He didn't overstep"
"full outside off, Roy mis-times his wild heave and the ball clears mid-off. Four more. Wanted to go over mid-on, but does it really matter?"
worked away to midwicket
"four more. Back of a length on off, Roy was looking at midwicket but the ball flies off the bat straight over the bowler. Looked at one point like it had gone straight up. But he had enough to clear the infield and almost hit the rope on the full. Bounced just inside though"
"beautiful slower ball. Flummoxed McCullum, too early into his shot"
"just enough to clear mid-off. An excellent effort. Full delivery on off, McCullum mis-times his bunt. Sami runs after it and dives full-length but just can't get close enough."
"gone! McCullum picks out the fielder at deep square leg. A length delivery from Raees, McCullum swings but gets it off the toe end. Hangs in the air for a while, Billings is lurking at the square leg boundary and takes an easy catch. Key moment in the game. An over or two more of Baz and this game may have gone out of reach"
"nicely played. Overpitched from Raees on the pads, flicked away through midwicket for two"
driven up to mid-off for a run
"another well-disguised slower ball outside off, Roy is beaten on the outside edge"
"length outside off, played away towards point"
"fullish length outside off, Zaman swings and misses. Beaten on the outside edge. Some movement"
"on a length outside off, chopped away towards backward point"
"not great batting. Play out a few dot balls and then attempt a big shot. Slower ball outside off, slapped over mid-on for a couple. Bad timing too"
driven away towards extra cover from the crease
"one more. Zaman's stuttering, spluttering innings ends. A short delivery on middle and leg, Zaman wanted to pull but got nowhere near enough on his stroke. The ball lobs up off the splice towards short midwicket. Sami gets across and claims an easy catch"
"full and straight, patted towards cover for a run. Good batting"
"nice-looking stroke. Full and wide outside off, crisply timed to cover who parries to mid-off. Akmal's early dot-ball counter is at 1"
played away towards backward point. That's 2
"superb fielding from Asif. A thick outside edge from Akmal, races away to third man's left. He makes sure he is not in contact with the ball and the boundary at the same time while diving. Fantastic stuff"
worked away to deep backward square leg
a wild swing and the ball beats bat. So that's three dot balls and one single from Akmal.
"122 kph, pace off the ball. Length on middle, Roy is early through his pull and is beaten. Hit on the body, trickles by close to the stumps"
"another slower ball, pulled away to short midwicket"
"worked away to long-on, just one"
"a short delivery outside off, beats Akmal on bounce. A cut is missed. Good bowling"
good single. Opens the face of the bat to get one to backward point
"a very wide yorker outside off, too wide, called"
"a low full toss on off, pushed away to mid-off for a run. 50 off the Powerplay. The game in the balance?"
"some flight on off, shovelled away into the gap at midwicket for a couple. Nice flight"
Roy gets low to nail his reverse sweep to short third man. One of his most useful shots
bunted away to deep midwicket for one
"short and wide this time from Shadab, Akmal goes back and cuts in front of point. Finds the gap, finds the boundary"
"the googly on off, worked away to midwicket"
"nicely driven away through cover, superlative timing. His initial call was two. Races away. Lovely stroke"
"flat on middle and leg, Roy misses his flick. Struck on the body"
"flat on the pads, Roy misses a flick. Another one that hits the pad"
"looks for the reverse sweep. Fortuitous. Against Ajmal's extra revs, there is every chance of a leading edge. Gets one here but it clears and is wide of short third man"
"flat on middle, Roy misses a sweep. Sliding down"
"worked away past midwicket for a couple, this is good batting from these two"
"pushed through, flat and quick. Roy goes back and mis-times a drive to long-off. bad timing"
"pushed through again, Roy sits back and slaps a cut to the sweeper cover"
that's tripe. Often happens with a legspinner. Quite a difficult art. Akmal gets down and nails a drive past cover
driven away to deep cover
worked away to deep midwicket
"flat down leg, nudged away for a run to fine leg"
"some more runs. Good fielding by Raees. Tossed up outside off, hammered past cover for a  couple. The fielder at long-off dives to his left to save two"

"poor delivery. A slow delivery down leg, Roy gets low and times his sweep to deep backward square leg. Superb execution"
"flat on middle, worked to midwicket"

"another short delivery. Slightly outside off this time. A top edge to fine leg, on the bounce"
"that's very wide, full and wide, left alone"
"full and wide outside off, Roy toe-ends the ball to the keeper. Looked to go over cover"
worked away towards point for one
"flat delivery outside off, Roy misses his slog sweep. Haddin appeals after taking off the bails. The third umpire is called upon. Roy's bat is not down. His back foot is on the line, and that should be out. Is there something behind the crease? Doesn't look like it. Is there enough doubt for the batsman? Yes, says the umpire. Wow. That was out to my eyes."
clipped away to square leg for a run
a tad short and Akmal rocks back to pull over midwicket. Read the length so quickly there. Went right back and generated enough power
"beaten on the outside edge. Slow through the air, this one drifts through"
nicely nudged to square leg for one. Clever batting
flicked away to square leg to keep strike.
superb start after the time-out. Gets a length delivery down leg and he pulls away merrily behind square for four
"length on middle, defended"
guided away towards backward point
"on a length around off, defended away towards backward point. So three dot balls and a boundary in four balls"
worked away into the leg side for a single
guided away towards third man. Six off the over. Not a bad over for Lahore.
"full delivery outside off, driven up to mid-off"
"short of a length outside off, slapped away to long-on for a run"
what's the need of that? Some lackadaisical cricket from Roy. Gets across and scoops the ball on the bounce to a deep fine leg. Looks for the second but Akmal sends him back. Not good
"superb delivery. Lovely take from Haddin. Bouncer on off, beats Akmal for pace, goes through. Haddin sticks out one hand and clings on"
thwacked down to long-on for a run
"full and wide, Roy backs away and misses the ball"
"straight to the man at deep midwicket. Back of a length on off, Akmal sits in his crease and pulls the ball straight down to deep midwicket. Wasn't short enough to pull in that direction. Islamabad still in this"
"worked away down to fine leg, too straight"
"defended away down towards point. The fielder is quick to it, prevents one"
"shortish delivery, Elliott shimmies down and pulls to deep square leg for a single"
"on a length and straight, worked away to midwicket"
"bunted away over cover. A length delivery outside off, Elliott stayed back and lofted that for a couple"
Roy runs down and works the ball to midwicket. No spin. Slid that one through

"flat outside off, Roy stays back and pummels a flat-batted push to long-off"
"still in it are Islamabad. Flat delivery outside off, Elliott sweeps but gets a top edge which is easily taken by deep backward square leg. Always a risk playing with a cross bat to Ajmal because of the number of revs he imparts."
flicked away to deep square leg for a run
"pushed away towards point for a run. Nice and tight from Ajmal, nothing full, nothing short."
"pulled and clears square leg. Narine doing his batting credentials no harm. A short delivery on middle, Narine sits back and whacks the ball over square leg. Shot"
"a bouncer on off, Narine is beaten trying to pull. Well bowled"
"clears cover this time. Watson delivers this a little wide, allowing Narine the room to drive up and over. Nice timing. Decisive blows these"
"six more. On the pad, Narine stays in his crease and helps the ball over fine leg with a neat swipe. Enough on it. Aided by the bad line"
drilled down to long-off for a run
another powerful muscular drive. Watson errs too full and Roy belts the ball back past mid-off for four. That should be the game too
excellent yorker from Sami outside off. Narine is beaten for pace.
"another yorker on middle and leg, off the pad towards gully"
"on a length on middle, pulled down to long-on. Clever stuff from Roy"
"strays down leg, did it brush the pad? Yes says the umpire. A legal delivery"
"looks for the yorker, misses and that is four. Narine muscles a drive past cover for another boundary"
"short of a length, worked away to midwicket"
"bouncer on middle and leg, pulled away to fine leg"
"that's the game. Narine's superb cameo seals the win. A tad short there was Raees on the pad, Narine stands tall and pulls in the gap behind square for four. A clinical chase. Islamabad were simply outplayed and outclassed in this game."
