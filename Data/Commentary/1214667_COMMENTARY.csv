"length, around middle, and he defends towards square leg"
"length, towards the pads, and flicked away towards deep square leg for two"
"length, but width on offer, and thrashed away past point. Good hands on to it, and ensuring that he kept it along the ground"
"oh, this <strong>jumps off a length just outside off</strong>, and Tamim has to take his bottom hand off in fending it away. Runs it along the ground towards third man"
"length, jags back in a touch from around off, and he defends towards square leg. Again some extra bounce on this, and Das does well to play with soft hands, taking his bottom hand off towards the end"
"length, but down leg side, and he whips it away towards fine leg, who is quite square for Mumba"
"length, jags back in and hits him somewhere around the midriff, as he shapes to flick. They go through for the quick single, but Madhevere effects a <strong>direct hit</strong>! He's in, though, with a big dive thrown in"
"length, and he punches this from the crease towards cover. Crisp stroke, but no runs for that"
"length, straighter, at good pace, and Das defends"
"length, from wide of the crease, angles in, and he defends after getting behind the line"
"length, pegs away at that line just around off, and Tamim gets behind the line to defend"
"length, from wide of the crease, and a bit of bounce as this straightens towards Tamim, who defends"
"flatter, a bit round-arm, as it angles in towards Tamim, and he plays this with a little flick of the wrists towards the left of square leg. They rush through for a single, as Das throws in the dive again"
"length, and he steers this from outside off towards third man"
"length, presses forward a touch, and defends this"
"fuller, but down the pads, and he can flick this away to the left of fine leg. Easy two on offer for Das"
"length, and he plays this with an angled bat towards mid-wicket, allowing the incoming angle for the ball to work for himself"
"gorgeous drive, but straight to mid-off. Typical Tamim, just going with his hands as the ball was given on a length just outside off to him"
flicks a fuller ball away towards deep square leg
"length, around off, and he defends with a big forward press"
"oh, a <strong>good ball</strong>! Just outside off, and moving further away a touch, as Tamim shapes to stretch to defend. Just goes past the outside edge through to the keeper"
"length, punched towards cover-point. Well struck, but cannot find the gap on the off side"
"fuller, straighter, and he plays this towards mid-wicket"
"fuller ball, along the pads, and he whips this straight towards square leg"
"a bit shorter, and he punches this through covers. That made a <strong>great sound</strong> when he played that shot, and then it just hurried away past the man at cover!"
"length, but down the leg side, and he whips it away towards fine leg"
"drops one outside off towards point. Wants a quick single, but sent back by Das"
"fuller, on the pads, and he plays it away towards square leg"
"fuller, along the pads, and whipped away towards deep square leg"
"smacked away! Superb shot to a ball pitching a bit short and offering some width. He allows that to come on to him and then eases it past point. Madhevere chases it, but mistimes his dive a touch, and cannot pull it back from the fence"
"length, around off, and he defends with a little hop to cope with the bounce on that"
"length, around off, defended towards point"
"length, down the leg side, and he shapes to flick. Needn't do, as that has gone well down leg side"
"length, punched towards cover, and fielded well. Another terrific bit of timing, but not good enough to pierce the field"
"length, <strong>rears off</strong>, and takes him by surprise. Plays it well, leaning into it initially, and then taking his bottom hand off!"
"length, around off, and defended"
"width on offer, and he runs this to the left of third man. Easy two on offer"
"length, around off, and he defends this"
"length, around off, and defended with a little forward press"
"length, straighter, and he defends with a forward push"
"length, just around off, and forces him to defend this from the crease"
"length, and defends towards point. Quick and loud 'No' as the batsmen contemplate a quick single to begin with"
"length, steered to third man"
"short, and he swivel-pulls this after getting into position. It hurries along the ground, but Sikandar Raza dives to his right at square leg and cuts this off. Terrific fielding!"
"length, driven towards mid-wicket with the incoming shape"
"length, along the pads, and he plays this away towards fine leg"
"length, down the leg side, and he tries to flick this, and Mutumbami dives to his right to stop it. Was that a <strong>catch</strong>? Might well have been bat, as he shuffled across and played it. Would technically go down as a drop! The replays suggest that was only thigh pad, though. Terrific bit of work from the keeper, either way"
"length, and he shuffles across and plays this towards square leg"
"length, played with the incoming angle towards square leg"
"length, angles in towards him from outside off, and he defends towards square leg again"
"short, and he swats this away towards mid-wicket. This isn't a quick enough track to go halfway down the wicket in length, and he rocks back and makes sure he gets it over the infield. Didn't need it to be exquisite timing"
"change of pace, just around off, and he defends towards point"
"length, angles in, and he defends towards mid-wicket. Wants a quick single, but changes his mind after he takes a couple of steps down"
"length, worked away towards square leg, but Raza is very quick to get across to the ball"
"full, wide, and that's <strong>more like it from Tamim!</strong> Throws his hands through this, and smacks it through the gap between cover-point and cover. First boundary for him"
"length, stretches forward to defend"
"short, and he shuffles across and then flays it away along the ground. Straight to Raza at square leg, though"
"length, flicked away towards the man who has dropped deep at square leg now"
"good start, drifting in from around the stumps. Tamim's forward to defend"
"more drift for young Wes, but not much turn. Tamim steps forward and glances fine"
"<b>too short, cut away!</b> Erred in length, and Tamim rocks back to thump it through point. No stopping that"
"that's better, a good length delivery dips on him to test Tamim's defence"
"tip-and-run single, into the covers. Sharp running"
"Madhevere stays around the stumps to the right hander, who glances to short fine leg"
"full, angled in from around the stumps. Tamim taps to mid on"
"<b>uppish, but lands safely!</b> Tamim was aiming for a flick off his hip, but the ball just got a little big on him, rising sharply off a length. It lands safely in front of square leg"
"<b>nicely bowled, but equally well played!</b> Mumba found a touch of away shape in the channel, Liton waits on it and dabs at the ball with soft hands to run it very fine down to third man. The fielder was quite wide there, and he placed it fine of him"
"just short of a length, and straight. Glanced to fine leg"
"short outside off, and Tamim flings his hands out at the ball, bottom edging his cut straight down. Mutumbami collects behind the stumps"
"<b>yelp of excitement as ball hits pad!</b> Slung down from around the stumps, beating Tamim's poke. He's struck on the pad, but is that outside off? The umpire's not convinced, and Zimbabwe don't want a review"
"delivered from around the stumps, eased down to long on"
"dabbed towards the covers, and he finds enough of a gap for a scampered single"
"flicked into the leg side, no run"
"tapped into the covers, no run this time"
"<b>beaten on the inside edge, rapped on the pads, given!</b> Madhevere hits Tamim in front of his stumps to get his first dismissal in ODIs. Or does he? Tamim reviews the decision. He hasn't got an inside edge on it, and ball tracking shows that it's plumb. Madhevere breaks through, ensuring that the previous DRS error doesn't haunt Zimbabwe. This is a role he has played umpteen times for the Under 19 team, and Madhevere is showing he can do it at the top level too."
"<b>beaten outside off!</b> Madhevere gets this one to dip and grip, zipping past the outside edge"
"he starts full and straight, Liton stepping half forward to defend"
"quick single, tapped into the covers"
"Tiripano keeps it tight on off stump, Shanto presses forward to push to cover"
"just a hint of width, outside off, and it's punched firmly to backward point, who stops it cleanly"
"full and straight once more, pushed back at the bowler"
"Tiripano gives him nothing, aiming for middle and leg. Shanto aims a slightly hurried fend to midwicket"
"Madhevere continues around the stumps to the right hander, and he's clipped out to deep square leg"
"nicely bowled, flight and drift on middle and off. Pushed watchfully back to the bowler"
"paddle sweep from Shanto, and there's some excitement as he doesn't quite keep it down. But the ball bounces well in front of short fine leg"
"<b>quick single!</b> Tapped to midwicket, in front of the fielder, but they take him on and sprint through. The fielder can't quite pick it up cleanly, and they make it. But that could have been tight"
"worked through square leg, with the spin, for a single"
"pushed into the covers, one more"
"Shanto gives him the charge, Tiripano misfiring it down the leg side"
"worked off the pads, just fine of square leg for another single"
"<b>swivel pull goes all the way!</b> Tiripano tested him with a short one at 127km/h, but Liton eyes him up and swivels into a hook shot, not bothering to keep it down. Solid strike, first six of the innings"
"fuller, straighter, and this one is defended"
"flicked off the pads, just the one"
"pushed towards mid off, where the fielder is a little deep, so they take him on with a quick single"
"Tiripano gets away with a leg stump half volley, Liton flicking it firmly but straight down to Mpofu at fine leg"
"he stays around the stumps, pushing this one across Liton, who follows it and taps to cover"
"<b>too full, slotted through cover!</b> Floated up outside off, and Liton doesn't over-hit it, leaning across and threading a drive through the gap. And it has the beating of the fielder at long off"
<b>fifty up for Liton Das!</b> He gets there by glancing a straight one through midwicket
"<b>up, up and away!</b> Shanto gives Madhevere the charge, getting close to the ball and hammering a towering shot down the ground. Fantastic sound as bat strikes ball, good hit"

"offbreak, landing just outside off, pushed back to the bowler"
"firmly flicked through midwicket, just the one"
"slower ball, and offcutter at 113km/h. It's pushed to mid off, and they take the fielder, Chakabva, on. He's quick to the ball, but an under-armed shy goes wide"
"rising outside off, and he hops to crack it to point, who palms it to third man. Misfield"
"again they take on the fielder in the ring, this time picking up a single with a dab into the covers"
"full, worked off the toes, straight to midwicket. No single this time as it went to him too quickly"
"<b>another tip and run single!</b> Dabbed down in front of point, and he's immediately called through. The fielder swoops, throws under-arm, and misses the stumps"
"Liton comes down the track but Wesley spots him coming, pulling his length back. Just the single into the leg side"
"squaring him up a little with some turn, the ball dribbles to point"
eased down the ground to long on
"landing on middle and leg, worked behind square with the spin"
"pushed through a little flatter outside off, a firm drive finds long off"
"<b>another misfield</b>, the cover fielder diving to stop a backfoot push but failing to cut it off cleanly, allowing a single to be taken"
"<b>flat-batted back over his head!</b> Mid off is up, and Liton gave Tiripano the charge even as the bowler dropped short. Swung firmly over the top, the ball bouncing just inside the rope"
"pushed through the off side, one more"
"short again, but Shanto's pull is intercepted at midwicket"
"now it's Shanto who gives him the charge, but Tiripano flings it down too wide outside off"
"straighter this time, and it's glanced down to fine leg for a single"
"full, on his toes, but Liton can't get his flick past a diving Raza at midwicket, the fielder diving well to stop it"
"short, pulled down to fine leg, and not in full control. But no harm done"
"<b>and he starts with a surprise leg break!</b> But it's read easily enough, tapped down to short third man"
"<b>offbreak now, but too full!</b> Liton steps into a handsome drive, lacing the shot to the cover boundary"
"offbreak again, and it's worked with the spin into the leg side, <b>raising the fifty stand</b>"
"another offbreak, nudged to long on"
"speared down flat and fast, stopped at cover"
"Liton bends low into a powerful sweep, but there's protection in the deep"
tapped down to long on to turn the strike over
"angling across him, on a length. They think of a quick single, but Tiripano races across to field it himself and send them back"
"pushed through full and wide across him, beating the drive, but it's called wide"
"<b>beaten on the outside edge!</b> Much better line from Tiripano, landing on off stump and nipping across him, Shanto flings a cut at it, but it's too close for that shot"
"<b>helped over fine leg!</b> Tiripano digs it in short, but he doesn't quite have the pace to hurry Shanto, who swivels on one leg and helps it on its way with a flowing pull. Pings out the middle"
"this time he aims full and straight, and Shanto is kept quiet"
"good lines once again, attacking the stumps. Shanto defends to leg"
"another leggie, and it slips out as a full toss, but Liton can't punish it, driving firmly back to the bowler"

"around the stumps comes Raza, cramping Shanto for room"
"another full toss, but it's cracked hard to midwicket inside the ring"
"pushed through flat on off stump, no flight whatsoever. Tapped back to the bowler"
"just outside off, and he chops down on the ball at the very last moment. Mumba sprints after it, diving head first to stop it just inside the third man boundary"

"Shanto skips out, but places his drive straight to mid off"
"<b>lofted, but short of the boundary!</b> Liton slices under the ball somewhat, but it lands safely near long off. The fielder is up, at mid off, so there wasn't too much risk in the stroke"
"flicked with the spin, into the leg side"
"reverse sweep, the ball bouncing down to third man"
"Raza comes around the stumps, delivering from wide of the stumps and cramping Shanto for room"
"very full, on off, dug out into the covers"
"full again, crunched down to long off for one"
"much too short, but Shanto fluffs his pull and mistimes it into the leg side, the ball landing in front of the fielder at deep midwicket"
"flat, fast and straight, Liton working across his pads for one"
"<b>too much air, a full toss, and it's punished</b>. Well, he dropped short earlier, and this time he's much too full. Shanto bends into a powerful sweep, and there's no protection behind square for the shot"
"<b>but the comeback is immediate!</b> Mutombodzi fires down a quick one, full on an off stump line, to beat another sweep and strike him on the pad. There's an appeal, the finger goes up. The review is not an option as Bangladesh have already used up their quota, so he's got to go! Ah, and in fact replays show it would have missed the off stump. Had he been able to, the review would have saved him!"
"speared in flat, just outside off, tapped to point"
"full toss, drifting in, and it's clipped to deep midwicket"
"<b>big appeal!</b> It was the quicker one from Raza, and it skidded on to beat an attempted sweep, hitting him on the thigh. The umpire turns down the appeal ... and they decide not to review it. Hit him outside off, perhaps?"

"full, outside off, and he skips out to slap a drive out to the sweeper"

"firmly whipped into the leg side, just the one"
"landing full, just outside off, not a great deal of turn and he eases down to long on"

"aimed full, at the pads, and a neat little flick bounces out to deep midwicket"

"quicker one, tapped hard back at him"
"he waits and waits, dabbing down at the ball at the last moment to find a single just to the left of short third man"

"Liton moves to 99 with a watchful glance, off his toes and through midwicket"
"<b>hundred for Liton Das!</b> Tiripano sends down a leg stump half volley, and he steps across to roll his wrists firmly over the top of it. He finds the gap to perfection, and the ball races all the way to the rope. His first boundary in 45 balls, and it gets him to a milestone"

"glanced off the hip, the ball rolls square of the fielder at fine leg and they push through for a second"
"<b>gone!</b> Mushfiqur aims yet another glide down to third man, but he can only place the ball straight into the gloves of the wicketkeeper behind the stumps. Zimbabwe strike, somewhat against the run of play, and the stand is broken. The shot was on, but the ball perhaps just bounced a little more than he was expecting."

"short ball, and he looks to hook this, and gets <strong>smacked on the side of the helmet</strong>!"

"length, around the wicket, and he goes back and punches this towards long-off"

"full, played past short fine leg, and picks up four. Good little trigger movement across the stumps, that helped open up that shot for himself"
"length, driven towards deep point"

"length, and he drives this towards deep point"

"length, and he plays this towards point"
"full length, and he looks to flick this away. There's an appeal for leg before, but not given. Zimbabwe <strong>review</strong> this. It's a fullish ball, and seems to have beaten the bat. There was no response from the umpire, suggesting he thought it took the bat along the way. Replays suggest it went on and hit the foot on the bounce, with no contact with bat on the way. Just a question now of <strong>where it was headed</strong> then. It just hits the base of the leg stump, and that will be a wicket for Mpofu."
"length, plays this towards long-on. Wanted to go for two, but the fielder was about three-quarters of the way to the boundary and attacked the ball well"

"length, driven towards cover, and they pick up a quick single"
"slower, around off, and he smacks this hard, but cannot beat cover. Raza right there"
"Saif looks to skip down the wicket, to a slower ball around off. Mpofu goes wider, and it goes off the toe-end and hurries down to third man"
"slower ball, and he hangs back and then cuts this in front of point. That's a smart shot, and a good way to bring up <strong>fifty</strong>!"
"that's out, no doubt as he raps him on the full with a straight ball! Mithun looks to shuffle across and whip this away, but is taken by surprise by one of the quicker balls in this over. Mpofu searches for the yorker, but overcooks it a touch. All is well, when you trap the batsman in front. Bangladesh have no reviews left anyway"
"length, driven to cover"
"full, around off, and he drives it down to Raza at long-off"
flicks a length ball away towards fine leg
"slower yorker, around off, and he looks to biff this away towards mid-wicket. Toe-ends it away on the off side, and they sneak a single"
"<strong>that's a good connection!</strong> Mumba goes quick, but makes the mistake of bowling length. Miraz backs away and flogs this over mid-wicket. It's gone well enough to clear the sweeper there"
"<strong>holes out this time!</strong> Mumba shortens the length a bit more, and Miraz looks for a repeat of the flog over mid-wicket, but Kamunhukamwe dives forward and pouches this very well, running in a few yards"
"length, driven back past the bowler towards long-off"
"full, wide, and doesn't even land it within the square. Awkward..."
"slower ball, around off, and he looks to swing this over mid-wicket. Misses the ball by a fair distance"
"slower, but this time he <strong>gets a hold of this</strong>! Straight in line, and that allows him to wait on it and then swing this away wide of long-on. Well struck!"
"<strong>what a shot!</strong> This was quicker, and a touch fuller, and Saifuddin picks it up quickly. Drives this uppishly, and gets it over Madhevere at long-on, who leaps but cannot get across to it"
"length, wide of off, driven towards deep point. They scamper back for two! There's a slight sigh of disappointment from the Sylhet crowd, who were looking forward to watching Mashrafe get at least one ball in"
"<strong>straight six over long-off this time!</strong> This is some sensational hitting from Saifuddin, as he is playing correct cricket to some poor bowling. Length ball, quick enough, and he plays that drive and then holds his pose"
"length, driven hard towards long-on for <strong>just a single</strong>!"
"fullish, around off, and a hint of swing back in. Wide enough for the batsman to leave"
"<strong>oh, that's a good ball!</strong> Angles back in from outside off, and Kamunhukamwe is caught in the crease as he tries to whip this away. Strangely, Bangladesh opt not to review this, because it didn't seem to go very high either!"
"length, around off, and he defends from the crease"
"full, straighter, and he tucks this away on the on side. There's square leg in place, though"
"full, wide of off, and he has a swipe at that. Didn't get anywhere near the ball, alas..."
"length, and this time he goes back and whips this away towards fine leg"
"length, around off, left alone"
"outside off, and he leaves again. Dies on its way through to Rahim behind the stumps"
"length, around off again, and he leaves"
"oh, <strong>he's played on to this one</strong>! Plays from the crease, and Saifuddin does a smart job by getting one to hold its line, after having made the first three just move away a touch. The batsman is stuck inside the crease, as he tries a drive, but leaves a big gap between his body and the bat. Inside edge, and that goes back and makes a mess of the stumps. Saif celebrates with his trademark arms spread wide open. Bangladesh have the perfect start with the ball as well!"
"length, around off, and he defends with a slight forward press"
"length, played towards mid-on, and they pick up a quick single"
"full, around off, and he whips this away wristily, but straight towards square leg"
drives a fuller ball towards mid-off
"hint of shape back in from outside off, on a good length, and he defends towards short mid-wicket"
"length, around off, and he defends with a forward press"
"length, nips away after pitching outside off, and he goes chasing a bit. Doesn't make any contact as the ball moves away and dies on its way through to Rahim"
"length, on the pads, and he whips this way towards deep square leg. There's a fantastic effort from Saifuddin, running around from fine leg. He's just about kept this back in. Got a foot to it, and then ran across to ensure this didn't then touch the rope. <strong>Superb work!</strong>"
"length, around off, and he runs this towards point. This was bowled at 131.7kph, by the way"
"fuller length, wider, and he slaps this hard, but cannot beat point"
"length, just around off, and he jams his bat down to defend this as it comes back in a touch"
"length, works this off his hips towards deep square leg"
"length, runs it down towards point"
"length, plays this away off his hips towards square leg. Off the pad"
"length, a hard and crisp drive to cover"
"length, around the pads, and he plays this away towards fine leg"
"cutter, goes across him as he looks to come forward and defend. Past the outside edge, and goes through low to the keeper"
"fuller, wider, and he looks to drive this straight. Off the outer edge, and flies away on the bounce towards third man"
"oh, <strong>where did this come from</strong>? Chakabva skips down the wicket, and looks to tonk the lacquer off this with a firm straight drive. Ends up hitting it hard into the ground, back towards the bowler"
"length, straight into him, and he uses the pace on the ball to whip this away towards long leg"
"fine shot, but no runs! Length, a bit of width, and Chibhabha cracks a gorgeous cut, but cannot get it past Mithun at cover-point"
"length, along the leg stump line, and he shuffles down the wicket and looks to go downtown towards long-on. Misses the ball, and the ball also <strong>bounces just over</strong> the leg stump!"
"shorter, quicker, and he looks to go across the line. That moves away from him after pitching, and he ends up missing out on contact again. This was <strong>just 125kph</strong>, actually, but the movement away from him fooled Chibhabha completely"
"yorker, and he keeps it out after getting behind the line"
"off cutter, around off, and he drives towards cover-point. Chakabva wants a single, and is sent back. There's a shy at the non-striker's end, but misses"
"length, on to the pads, and he whips this away towards deep mid-wicket. There's two on offer for this shot, before deep square leg can run around and send in the throw"
"gentle loosener outside off, and he drives this just to the left of cover. There's a shy at the stumps, but they go through comfortably for a single"
"length, jags back in a touch from outside off, and he is forced to block this"
"<strong>smart shot!</strong> More than the width on offer, there's some short length on offer, and he just runs this down to the left of point, placing it to perfection wide of third man. The man down there puts in a dive, but cannot hold this back"
"short, and he whips this away towards long leg. Wanted to get this finer, but will only pick a single for that"
"fuller, on the pads, and he has put this away to long leg. Fine leg inside the cirlce, and Chakabva is well aware of that when he plays this shot"
"slower ball, sliding down leg, as he tries to flick this past short fine leg yet again, and misses"
"length, and he comes forward to defend. Given out leg before, and he has <strong>reviewed this immediately</strong>! He was walking in to this, and seems to also have gotten an inside edge, looking at first glance. Even if this is pad first, the impact could well have been outside off. The umpire was quick to give this out, but I have a feeling this could get reversed. The ball trickled away towards cover-point and they refused a quick single. <strong>Given not out</strong>, as a result of the inside edge"
"length, straightens into him at good pace from around off, and Chibhabha has to defend"
"fuller, around off, and he drives past cover to pick up a single"
"<strong>this could be close again!</strong> Chakabva steps across to paddle this down, and it runs down to fine leg for four. But Saifuddin is convinced that this has hit the pad in line. He has walked a <em>long </em>way across the stumps in trying to whip it away, and has also missed the ball. That's a close one. Could well be given out! Three reds, and a perfect review from Bangladesh this time"
"length, outside off, and left alone as it nips away a touch"
"length, just around off, and he defends from the crease"
"length, around off, and defended"
"length, a bit of movement back in off the seam from outside off, and he looks to drive. Off the inside part of the bat, on to pad, and they cannot go through for the quick single they want"
"length, and he plays this towards short mid-wicket"
"Chibhabha <strong>holes out to mid-on</strong>! That's the benefit of bowling wicket-to-wicket and without great pace. This was straight, and on a good length, and Chibhabha sets himself up for a lofted straight drive. Just skews the bat a touch, and the ball goes to the edge of the circle straight back over the bowler. Mid-on gets around and accepts the catch gleefully"
"length, but down the leg side, and he just helps it along to fine leg. Deep backward square leg puts the dive in, but cannot reel it back"
"full, outside off, and he leaves"
"length, down the pads, and he flicks to square leg. Cannot pinch runs, though"
runs this down to third man
"length, goes past the outside edge with some bounce and seam movement away from him. <strong>Great bowling!</strong>"
"length, around off, and he drives towards point. Keeps a bit low along the pitch. The variable bounce is something Mithun alluded to in the chat between innings"
"good shot, but <strong>straight to cover</strong>! A bit of width on a length ball, and he drives this crisply"
"length, outside off, slower through the air, and driven to mid-off"
"<b>fortunate!</b> Mashrafe pitches an outswinger right up to him and Madhevere throws a drive out at it, but the edge flies straight between the keeper and the solitary wide slip"
"this one nips in off the seam, but he's right behind it to defend"
"nervy stuff, <b>a play and miss</b> as Madhevere drives inside another away swinger"
"targeting the pads with a length ball, and he whips across it to find a single to long leg"
"full of length, outside off, and it's chopped behind point for a single"
"on a length, in the channel. Madhevere gets half a stride in and pushes to cover"
"floated up outside off, Taylor aims it back at him with a firm drive"
"quicker, flatter and Taylor dabs at it from the crease. Not much in the way of foot movement, but his eyes are over the ball"
"full, eased down to long off for a single"
"round-arm, and rushing straight on, Madhevere keeps it away from the stumps with a hurried jab"
"full, outside off, and it's pushed to point"
"a touch flatter, on off stump, and Madhevere guides it to point"

"full, attacking the stumps, and he pushes firmly to mid on"
"rising up at him from a length, tucked off the hip for a single"
"just outside off, and he runs it off the face down to third man"
"<b>crack!</b> Mortaza drops short, Madhevere rocks back and hammers his pull over midwicket. The fielder inside the ring was interested, but he couldn't jump high enough as the ball whizzed over him"
and he follows that up with a guide down to third man to keep the strike
"a touch short outside off, and he cuts out to the sweeper"
"<b>bowled him!</b> Taylor was eyeing up the midwicket boundary, where there is a big open space, but the ball skids on with the arm, through his slog sweep, and rattling into the stumps. Zimbabwe lose another one, and they're sinking rapidly now. <b>Drinks</b> come out onto the field, with Bangladesh right on top."
"floated down outside off, Raza thrusts out at it, inside edging into his front pad"
"full, dug out just wide of mid on for a single to get off the mark"
"arm ball, rushing on straight, defended back at him"

"Madhevere makes a little room, but his drive is stopped at cover"
"full, on his toes, tapped to mid on"
"arm ball, honing in on leg stump before it's kept out, into the leg side"
"<b>just past a diving mid on!</b> Madhevere set himself for a slog sweep, but the ball wasn't quite there to hit. All the same, he went through with it, and though he didn't hit it as cleanly as he'd have liked, he gets it past the diving fielder"
"generous flight on this ball, dipping as it gets close to him, Madhevere drives out to the sweeper"
"<b>huge, emotive appeal</b> for lbw as Raza skips out and wears a full one on the pad, but the umpire's not interested. He was way down, and possibly outside the line"
"<b>another appeal</b> as this one shoots down the leg side. They're asking about a leg-side strangle, but it seems to have come off the thigh pad"
"full, angling in to leg stump, and he tucks it behind square for one"
"worked off the hip and into the gap, and they hurry through for one"
"in the channel, outside off, and he guides it quietly down to third man"
"full and wide, outside off. Raza thrashes a drive, but doesn't middle it and can't beat point"

"looped up, just outside off, and he eases a drive down to long off"
"full and straight, pushed back to the bowler"
"he starts full, angling across him. Wesley is forward to drive into the covers"
"quick single, the ball is dabbed towards cover and they set off straight away. Raza is lightning between the wickets and Madhevere, despite his cramps, is keeping up with him"
"<b>beaten on the outside edge</b>, Raza flirting with one that leaves him off the track"
"<b>well placed, subliming timed</b>, Raza waits on another cutter that goes across him, lifting the ball up and over backward point and beating third man on his right. Zimbabwe need a few more of those"
"straigher this time, and Raza is back and across to defend"
"pushed through full, shooting across Raza, who steps across and then raises his bat to leave it alone. Echoes of Steve Smith in his technique to let that go. Some flair on the leave"
"Madhevere pokes at it from the crease, the ball shooting off the inside edge onto his front pad"
"aimed at the off stump again, and it's fetched into the leg side for one"
"nicely flighted, landing just outside off and drawing him forward, Raza defends to cover"
"arm ball, quicker and flatter through the air to hurry Raza's defence"
"landing just a little short, Raza makes the most of it by stepping deep into his crease and forcing it out to the sweeper"
"<b>lifted cleanly over mid on!</b> Madhevere skips out to get to the pitch, and then flows through a smooth lofted drive to send the ball well over the man at mid on and skidding to the boundary"
"he spears one in very full, close to a yorker. Dug out into the leg side"
"<b>short, and pulled!</b> Raza's eyes light up as Mustafizur drops short, he swivels back to pull powerfully through midwicket"

"full and straight, tapped back to him"
eased down to long on
"flicked with the spin, into the leg side"
"<b>top edged, and caught!</b> Mustafizur sends down another short one, but with a little more vim this time. Raza leapt into the air to play the pull, but the ball got big on him and he couldn't keep it down. The ball balloons off the top edge, and is safely snaffled near the deep midwicket boundary by Mahmudullah. That's his 61st catch in ODIs, the most for a Bangladesh fielder. After a brief rally, Zimbabwe sink further"
"short, and rising up at him. Madhevere jumps and fends to keep it down"
"<b>sublime timing!</b> Madhevere certainly looks the part at this level. He spots just a hint of width, and then waits on it to time a checked push behind square on the off side. It races all the way"
"pushed across him, in the channel, and this one is left alone"
chopped down to third man to turn the strike over
"<b>big swing and a miss</b>, Mutumbami throwing his hands at one that darted across him, and hitting only fresh air"

"nudged with the spin into the leg side, midwicket charges across to cut it off"
"<b>sliced to cover, another one goes!</b> The ball was looped up outside off, and Madhevere, perhaps a little frustrated by a string of dots, aimed an expansive shot through the covers. It's hit well, but he couldn't keep it down, and the ball flies straight to Mashrafe, who makes no mistake"
"aimed full, at the stumps, and it's nudged softly back at him"
"turned into the leg side, where there is a fielder waiting, and <b>that's a wicket maiden</b>"
"not a great deal of flight, and breaking in slightly off the track. Defended to leg"
"flicked with the spin through square leg, just the one"
"a touch short, and spinning down the leg side, but he gets away with it as Tino works it straight to short fine leg"
"speared down just outside off, pushed back at him"
"more drift than turn on this one, Tino's back and across to defend"
"speared down leg, he helps it on its way to short fine leg for a quick single"

"length, skips down the wicket to defend, pressing forward"
"length, defends with a forward press"
"length, plays with an open face of the bat towards cover-point, and the fielder <strong>effects a direct hit</strong>, almost! Out by a quite a distance, at the striker's end, as the batsmen take a needless chance. Some chatter from around the stumps perhaps egging them on to this indiscretion, and Rahim whips the bails off from a flat throw right by the stumps. Good work there by Bangladesh"

"short, and he looks to swing this away, and holes out to short fine leg. That's that! Length ball, and the swing across the line is always a difficult one to put away on a pitch like this, and he perishes with a gigantic top edge. That's 700 wickets in all formats of the game for Mashrafe, and <b>Mohammad Isam</b> reminds me that he becomes just the fifth bowler to take 100 ODI wickets as captain.
