"<B>dug in, a leading edge, and Rashid is in the action at last!</B> Trying to work this into the leg side, the ball climbs into the splice, catches in the breeze and loops all the way down to the third man rope. Here endeth a fine stand ... and England have their opening!"

"short and wide, slapped away dismissively through point for one - <b>the Boss has his hundred</b>, of course he does! Saunters up to the other end and takes off his helmet, then balances it on the bat handle as he raises both aloft. Cricket's greatest hype man lives up to his own hype once again"

cut away into a gap
"more humpty, <b>Bravo clears cow corner again!</b> Tossed up straight and fair blootered into the leg side!"
"goes again, <b>on to the roof!</b> A 98-metre six over midwicket, that's not coming back either! Bravo's fourth six from 20 balls faced so far, making his demotion to No. 6 seem a little odd"

"lobbed up outside off, Gayle works to the on side and Rashid hares after it"

"slower ball, Holder waits in the crease and clips through backward square"
"dances down, turn for Rashid, <b>and Buttler completes the stumping!</b> Well, just about, having missed with his first swing of the arms...! But I don't think Holder got back in time as Buttler had a second crack. They do just check, but there's no reprieve, Buttler gets away with his lackadaisical first attempt"

flighted and clipped into a gap
"<b>reverse-slapped over deep point!</b> That equals the record for the number of sixes in an ODI innings! Extraordinary shot from Bishoo, on a day of extraordinary hitting"
"full and straight, he reverse-swipes across the line again, hit on the pad - and the finger goes up! Bishoo <b>reviews</b>, though, and he seems to have hit it. There's a delay with UltraEdge, which then shows wobbly lines everywhere, but the pictures are pretty clear that he got some bottom edge on it and <b>the decision is overturned</b>. Bishoo doesn't get his run, though, and has to return to the striker's end"

"a quickstep down the track, and <B>pumped over long-off!</B> No messing from Bairstow, flat and hard, thumping the boundary rope on the half-volley"
"on the back foot, flicked to the leg side"
"down on one knee, <strong>and make that 24 sixes for the match!</strong> And once again it's clean over midwicket, the right-hander's version this time. If Windies can clear the ropes at will, then England can do likewise!"
"a muscular short-arm pull ... at thin air. Too full and straight for the stroke, and skims past the timbers"
a straight-arm pump to long-off
worked to the leg side
"fast and straight, solid connection in a hopping leg-glance, out to no-man's land at backward square"

"<strong>sizzling lifter,</strong> but too short and wide this time!"
flinched to the leg side
"worked off the pads, out to square leg once again. Thomas trusting in pure stump-targetting pace for the moment"
"<B>too straight this time</B>. In the slot for a sweetly timed nudge off the hips, and away through midwicket"

"back of a length, just a touch too short to be effective. Roy rocks back, <B>slaps through the covers</b> and times it to the rope"
"<B>dragged from outside off!</B> Not perfectly timed, but placed to perfection into the gap at cow corner"
"fuller, straighter, a punch to mid-off"
"full face, nudged on the up to the off side"
cut into the cordon
"a knee-high full toss, but he gets away with it, as a flick ends up going straight to short midwicket"
"outside off, back of a length, and <B>spanked back through the covers!</B> That's outrageous stroke-making, who cares about the pace...<B> 148kph!</B>"
worked out to point
swishes through to the keeper
"<B>pounded through the leg side and up comes the fifty!</B> This is ridiculous hitting as well, stiff forearms and pure timing, clean through midwicket"
"back of a length, crunched on the up to point"
<B>a roundhouse pull through backward square!</B> Zoinks. This is lively
flipped to the leg side
"back of a length and too straight, Roy rocks inside the line and helps the ball round the corner with a crouching pull"

worked into the gap once again at backward square leg
"fired down the leg side, but clips the pad on the way"
"pull down the leg side, misdirected and too short. Helped round the corner as Brathwaite winces"
"full-faced push through mid-on. Ten overs gone, and England very much in the hunt"

"<B>rapped on the gloves!</B> That just popped from a good length, as Holder uses his height well with a cutter. Roy removes a glove and gets a bit of treatment, but he's okay"
"angled bat, pushed out through backward point"
"bottom-handed tonk to mid-off, very full length"
"<B>banged in short, a top-edged pull, and snaffled by the keeper!</B> That's the breakthrough that West Indies desperately needed! Bairstow has played his part, but played the wrong line that time, just a thin deflection and a good leaping take from Hope"

"short and sharp, hits the seam and Roy grimaces after being suckered into a rash swipe"
tucked to midwicket for the hundred. Just 12 overs to reach that mark... which means they are comfortably ahead of the rate for now

"clipped to the leg side, much fuller and straighter"

fired down the leg side
stays back and dabs into a gap behind point
"flat outside off, Root plays this very late, almost crouching in front of the wicket... Roy declines the run to short third man though"

"full on off, Roy punches the single coming across"
"crunched down the ground, <b>goes to his hundred with a six!</b> Hit straight back over the bowler's head! Exuberant celebration from Roy, his seventh ODI ton, and from just 65 balls - <a href=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/wi/content/records/211608.html target=_blank>his fastest for England</a>"

goes back and swipes into the off side
"swing and a miss, Hope whips off the bails... He seems confident, it goes upstairs to the TV umpire! He had certainly stretched out of his ground, but did he get back? <b>Just a bit of boot behind the line</b>, concludes Bruce Oxenford, so Roy survives another chance"
