"on a length, pretty straight, swinging towards off, and defended from the crease"
"full and straight, and this defensive push goes for four. This outfield is lightning quick. He pushes this wide of mid-on, and Ashwin can only escort it all the way to the fence"
"short of a length, on the pads, tucked away for a couple towards deep square"
"<strong>where has this kicked off from?</strong> Short of a length, on off, jumps at him. Warner does well to not follow it with his hands. Head high for Saha. Is this because of the early moisture that Lee talked about at the pitch report?"
"down the leg side, off the pad to Saha. <b>Half a shout</b>"

"full and straight, Renshaw right behind it in defence"
"full again, Renshaw shapes up to drive, but then stays inside its line. Allows it to go through to Saha"
"<strong>big big lbw shout</strong>. Is this full enough to pitch within the stumps and hit the stumps? Called not-out, and India don't review. There is no swing, and is hitting him in front of middle. Replays show it pitches clearly outside leg. Ishant has done well here by telling Kohli not to review it"
"on a length and straight, solidly defended this time by Renshaw"
"gets a touch too full and on the pads, and Renshaw has clipped this between mid-on and midwicket for four more. Don't bother chasing these on this outfield"

"straight, short of a length, Warner right behind it"
"fuller, on off, pushed wide of mid-off, and hares through for a single"
"full toss, just a push from Renshaw, and Ashwin at mid-off is surprised by the pace of the outfield again. He has to put in a dive to save four runs. Well done in the end"

"on a length, on off, Renshaw in two minds whether to play or leave. Ends up being squared and guiding it to the slips. On the bounce"
"short of a length, tucked away off the hip, and is that outfield quick or what? Pujara has to put in the long chase, and they take the third on the throw. On another outfield this would have been just one"
"short of a length, outside off, gets a bit of bounce and Renshaw stays inside its line. He looks for a glance fine, but is beaten"
"good carry into his armpit. Renshaw is beaten again, but gets a leg-bye this time"

"tossed up, just outside off, Warner defends off the front foot"
"nice dip from Ashwin. Slow too, at 79ks. Defended off the front foot"
<strong>short but stays low</strong>. Warner does well to cut it in time. It has hit a dark patch and not bounced much. Gets a single
"Renshaw continues to deal in fours. Ashwin slightly too full, slightly too straight, and he clips this off his toes. Beats midwicket, and the chase from Pujara and Vijay, who has run to his right from fine leg. This is a really really quick outfield"
"length ball, angling in, pushed wide of mid-on for a single"
"now they have a deep forward square leg to deny Renshaw the boundary. Tucks this length ball away, and gets a couple to deep midwicket. <b>His first non-boundary runs</b>"
"on a length, outside off, and he runs this to third man for a single"
Warner's first boundary. Umesh bowls full. Too full. And he crunches this through cover
"short of a length, angling in, defended off the back foot"
<strong>this length ball stops at him</strong>. Played uppishly towards square cover
"<strong>slow off the pitch</strong>. Renshaw looks for a repeat of the last ball of the last over, but this one doesn't come on and takes the leading edge. No gully, though"

"tossed up wide, and Warner drives it with an open face. Easy pickings for Warner there"
"what a catch from Jadeja. This is such a weird wicket. The little bit of luck India needed. A full toss from Jadeja, Warner should be hitting this for four, but ends up slicing this back at good pace. The thing about this catch is, after you bowl such a fullie you are looking at which part of the ground is this being dispatched to. Jadeja, though, is alert and pouches this"

"full, middle and leg, defended back to him"

"down the wicket, gets too close to the ball and plays it back to Ashwin"

"<strong>big big shout</strong>. More for lbw than catch, but there is a double play here. Not given on the field, and India don't review. Full, Renshaw looks for the drive, the ball beats his drive, hits the pad, and goes to slip. There is an explosion off the pitch, baby. Impact outside off, but the ball still turning enough to miss the stumps"

"as in Pune, Umesh produces a breakthrough after a good start from Australia. Renshaw has played a poor shot twice in a row. Almost slips catching practice here.

"wider length ball this time, and Marsh lets it go"
"<strong>what is happening here?</strong> Now Marsh plays a ball he should not be playing. Short of a length, outside off, straightens a touch. Marsh is squared up, gets an edge, but this one doesn't carry. Kohli does well to dive to his left and save runs"

The ball pitches middle and leg, the drift making him play not under his eye. The ball turns but only a touch, and straightens to take the inside edge. It flies off the bad, and Pujara dives to his left to take a sharp catch. Really good offspin bowling, really good catch, and a really good review"
"half-volley first up, and he drives it beautifully between mid-off and cover"

"what a shot, and I mean it genuinely now. Plays this reversing ball really late, closes the bat face at the last moment, and manages to beat the man at square leg. Great timing and quick outfield"

"good shot, and a great chase from Kohli, showing his team-mates you can catch up with these balls. Handscomb down the wicket to push this wide of mid-on. Kohli puts in an excellent chase on this quick outfield. In the end Kohli puts in a dive too to save the boundary but <strong>seems to have jammed his finger into the turf</strong>.

"Umesh produces a wicket. Full late-swinging yorker. Handscomb is hit on the toe, and he walks off once given. The bat of Handscomb is coming down the right line, but he fails to get the front foot out of the line in time. This is unlike Smith who doesn't get his front foot in the way to avoid these lbws.

"<strong>what a scene this is</strong>. The ball is lodged between Smith's pads after hitting his inside edge. It is dead ball but Saha looks to pull it from there and take catch. Smith tries to take it away, and he tumbles in the process. Presumably to make sure the ball hits the ground but without looking to do deliberately. Saha keeps chasing the ball. <strong>Guys it is a dead ball</strong>. In the end they end up in a position that cannot be described on Cricinfo comms. Correction: <b>no edge there</b>"

smothers the turn on this full ball
"Ashwin places this expertly between the keeper and the leg slip. Full, outside leg, and it turns away sharply. Asking too much of Saha there"

"fuller, angling in, runs off the inside half of the defensive bat for a single"
"on a length, on off, defended from the crease"
"full, just outside off, defended to leg"
solid defence to end this day with a stamp of his own. The first session of the series where Australia haven't lost a wicket. Only the second such on either side
"<strong>the bat has broke</strong>. Maxwell is left with just the handle in his hand. Maxwell defends a length ball - 137ks - properly. The ball hits the upper third, and the bat is gone. Even his bat is not used to being used for so long"
"short of a length, on off, defended with an open face"
"bouncer, middle and leg, he sways inside its line"
"short of a length, stays low, is accurate, but Maxwell equal to it, and keeps it out. Hazlewood will be interested in these deliveries"

"wide length ball, driven on the up, straight to cover"
"short of a length, middle and leg, pushed to mid-on"
"short of a length, straight at him, defended back to Umesh"
"bouncer, just outside off, Maxwell ducks it. Reminiscent how on the first of the England series, India didn't bounce Moeen, and then on day two they started it. Players not thinking on their feet? Why should it take overnight to use a tactic?"
"<strong>bouncer that stay low</strong>. Headed for the rib cage, but because Maxwell's first instinct is to go for the pull he can get the bat up in time and pull down on this for a single"
"wide length ball again with no third man. Not a smart tactic. Maxwell plays with an open face, but it runs off the edge for four. Maxwell into his 90s"

"on a length, outside off, opens the face, plays with soft hands, and comes back for two even as the man at deep point fields"

"slower ball. Smart bowling. Maxwell watching it like a hawk, though. Defends off the middle of the bat"
"good bouncer. Aimed at his throat, and this one too doesn't get as high as it should from that length. It also follows him as he sways out of its line"
"<strong>draws the loose shot</strong>. The sucker ball after the bouncer. Maxwell tries the big drive, and the edge flies wide for a single. India have a third man now"
"down the leg side, and Smith misses out on runs there"

"on a length, middle, defended from the crease"

"Maxwell has cut this fiercely to bring up a superlative maiden Test hundred. Short of a length, wide, and he has lashed this between the two slips. It has flown away. He is pumped. Smith is overjoyed for him too. Maxwell removes his helmet and kisses the badge on it"
"full, outside off, driven to extra cover"
"on a length, outside off, driven square but can't beat the fielder at point"
defends one with an open face
"slower in the air, straight, defended back to him"

"on a length, on off, defended to cover"
"and Maxwell falls soon after getting to a hundred. And it's that man Jadeja again. Jadeja this morning: 20 balls, no runs, and now a wicket of the centurion. This is short of a length, Maxwell shapes up for the punch, but there is a puff of dust where it pitches before it turns away to take the edge. Good catch by Saha"
"short of a length, defended to short leg"

Wade moves across to clip one off the pads for a single to long leg

"short of a length, outside off, defended back to him"

"short of a length, angling in from round the wicket, defended off the back foot"

"full, on the pads, pushed to short straight cover"

"what a beauty from Jadeja. This is sensational bowling. A left-arm bowler's dream ball, but this will worry India too. This is on a length, on middle and leg, drawing a forward-defensive from Cummins. The ball then turns away to beat the outside edge and hit the top of off. No puff of dust here"

"short of a length, wide outside off. Left alone. Consecutive maidens for Cummins"
"down the wicket, drives, but off the inside half of the bat"

forward-defensive
"down the leg side again, and this time Wade makes a good collection"
"<strong>turn and bounce there</strong>. From just short of a length, just outside off, and Pujara does well to not follow it with his hands"

"on a length, middle and off, no turn, and hits the inside edge on the defence"
"drift into the pads, some dip too, and again he is hit on the inside half of the bat"
"<strong>big appeal for lbw</strong> but the inside edge seems to have saved him. Smith, though, goes for the review. Again a ball with no turn. Pujara has played for turn but has been done in. Smith is gambling on pad first here because bat and pad are too close together. On the Ultra Edge replay there seems to be a bit of a spike before it hits the bat, especially on the side-on view, but the umpire goes by the front-on replay and sees the bat first. It might well be bat first, but the umpire seems to have jumped the gun here"
<strong>appeal for bat-pad and this is not out</strong>. Turns past the inside edge and lobs off the pad alone. Hang on. <b>Clear inside edge there</b>. Australia have no reviews left. India getting the rub of the green here

"nice shot. Short of a length, outside off, he steers it fine of square third man for a couple"
"slower offcutter, on a length, defended back to him"

"offcutter again, and Pujara defends off the front foot"

"lovely shot now. Down the wicket, moves away from the line of the ball so he has room to swing his arms, and he lofts this over mid-off"

"flat, on a length, no turn, defended off the back foot"
"bottom hand takes over again. Hazlewood pitches this too far up, and he drives it straight. Doesn't get all of it, but the quick outfield carries it past the dive from mid-on"
wide length ball from wide on the crease. Pujara is not tempted into a shot
"<strong>shout for a catch at short midwicket</strong>. Not given. This is a brute of a short ball, headed for the melon, Pujara throws up his arms to protect his face, and the ball flies off his arm guard"
"short again, loop bounce now, defended towards slip"
"slower offcutter, but he is equal to it. The weight still coming forward after that bouncer, and guides this to third man for one"
"<strong>huge huge lbw shout</strong>. Wide on the crease, Vijay stuck in the crease to a full ball, oh that looks really close. Not given on the field, and Australia have no reviews left.

"full, outside leg, defended back to him"
outside leg and kicked away
"oh what has Vijay done here? He jumps out of his crease, in this, the last over before lunch, and misses it. The ball sneaks between his pad and bat. The expected turn doesn't arrive.

"short of a length, punched to deep midwicket for one"
"on a length, just outside off, defended to mid-on"
full toss. Meat and drink for Pujara. Flicked away off the pads through midwicket. This is yorker gone wrong
"lovely shot again. Short of a length, into the pads, tucked away off the hip, between midwicket and square leg. Maxwell gives it a mad chase. Dives in. Just like Kohli. And keeps it in. And his shoulder is fine"
"Kohli is gone. Sharp catch at second slip. Pin-drop silence in Ranchi. He is walking slowly. They are checking for a no-ball. He is well in. A loose shot. Wide half-volley, no feet, he drives at it, and the edge flies to second slip, who has crept up because of the low bounce. This one flies at him, giving him little reaction time. He leans back, absorbs the momentum of it, and takes it clean as a whistle. How about that Maxwell chase that brought Kohli on strike? Kohli in the field tried to do the same, and injured himself"

"down the wicket, hit straight to mid-on, but good calling and they take the single"

nicely played. Punches this wide of cover for one

"on a length, middle and off, no turn, defended back to him"
"length ball, outside off, defended solidly. Australia need to do more of this"
"bouncer it is, and Cummins gets him. Rahane looks to ramp it. This is too high, but the loopy bounce means it is still in Rahane's sight and he looks to ramp it almost as an afterthought. Too high to reach it. Would have been called wide had he not nicked this, but he nicks it. Off his feet as he connects"
"goes for the yorker, bowls a full toss, defended to cover"
"full and fast, outside off, 144ks, dug out by Nair"

"short of a length, just outside off, defended back to him"
"wide on the crease, angles one in, defended to mid-on"

"good shot, driven wide of mid-off, and gets a single"
"on a length, angling in, there is half an appeal for pad first but that's all it is. Not given and no reviews. It's bat hitting pad, and not ball hitting pad"
loose drive from Ashwin to a wide full ball. The inside edge goes to mid-on
straight length ball that stays low but Ashwin's bat comes down in time
pads away the first ball
and he kicks away another delivery
this one turns less than expected and Wade has to collect down the leg side

"tossed up outside leg, he kicks it away after stretching a long way"

"closer to leg this time, and he defends this back to him"
half an appeal for lbw but O'Keefe knows he has been pitching outside leg so he aborts it
"on a length, angling in, pushed to cover-point's right, but Ashwin and Pujara are not the ones for quick singles"
"short of a length, angling in, Ashwin defends off the back foot"
"wide length ball, luring Ashwin into a loose push, but he manages to middle it even though he is not close to the ball"
"short of a length, doesn't rise too high, and he defends this comfortable"
"<strong>drops a bat-pad catch off his own bowling?</strong>. Reverse swing, Ashwin plays a loose drive, gets an inside edge onto his pad, the ball lobs up towards the non-striker. Cummins changes his direction in his follow-through, and flies to his right. He gets a hand to it, but with so momentum acting against him, it is really difficult to make it stick"
<B>more reverse swing and a shout for lbw</b> but it has swung too much and is headed down
"closer to leg, makes him play, and turns it past the bat. <strong>So close to that edge</strong>"

"on leg now, and Pujara defends off the front foot"
"on a length, pitches leg, turns to off, defended"
"as O'Keefe goes outside leg, Pujara kicks it away"

"wide sucker ball, Ashwin goes after it, but shanks it to mid-off"
"good drive on the up, Maxwell puts in a dive at cover, but they get a couple"
"they are appealing for a glove, and they review it after it has not been given. Brute of a bouncer. Right at his head, Ashwin looks to sway out of its line and throws his hands in front of his face. And it takes the glove as it passes the hand. What amazing bowling this is. This has to be reversed. A nasty bouncer. Ashwin is not happy, but if he watches the replays in the dressing room, he will see the evidence"
"on a length, outside off, he defends off the front foot"
"full outside off, driven, but straight to Maxwell at cover-point"
and Pujara kicks away another delivery outside leg
padded away again

"nicely tossed up, slightly expansive drive from Pujara, manages to keep it down, sending it to short cover"
"flighted outside off, defended with an open face"
"<strong>given on the field but Saha reviews it</strong>. Cummins bowls on a length, gets shape back in, Saha hits his pad with his bat, and there is no bat involved. It has swung too much, and is missing the leg stump. Saha continues to bat"

"short of a length, outside off, defended to short cover"
"Cummins has bowled a short one, and has Wade dropped it? This one moves back in, between the bat and the stumps, might have got a feather, but doesn't matter because Wade hasn't caught it clean. Ultra Edge confirms no edge on it"
"on a length, now, pushed uppishly towards short cover"
"well done by Lyon. Keeps him on strike. Saha looks to steer this length ball to third man. Lyon is at forward point, runs to his left, puts a desperate dive in, and saves one run"

"swing first up, Pujara plays with soft hands as this length ball bounces at him. He has managed to place this wide of point for a single"
"some outswing, but Saha stays beside the line, and drives this. Less feet, more hands. Places this between point and cover. This is a good ball, but Saha is well in and has hit him for an undeserved boundary"

"pulls the length back, and draws a forward defensive. India trail by one seven"
"outswinger, Pujara gets a stride in to drive, but straight to short cover"

"sharp bouncer from wide on the crease, and a lovely leave from Saha. He breaks his back leg, moves his head out of its line, and drops the bat under it"
"another amazing delivery, but he just can't hit the edge here. Short of a length, holds its line outside off, Saha pushes at it but doesn't edge. Wade collects it head high"
"short of a length, defended off the front foot"
loose shot is drawn through the raw pace earlier in the over. Short of a length but not short enough to cut. Saha just pushes at it with a horizontal bat. Lucky not to edge it

"Saha won't pad these away. He jumps out, swings against the rough, in the air, but misses short midwicket"
"<strong>and Saha running with his luck now</strong>. Beaten in the flight as he jumps out of his crease, and the ball turns to take the edge, but it clears mid-off. Warner puts in the big chase and saves one run"
and Pujara pads one away to end the over
"<strong>grubber now</strong>. Short of a length, outside off, and it squeezes under Saha's bat"
"on a length, pretty straight, defended to short midwicket"

"short of a length, on off, punched back to Hazlewood"
"edged down the leg side but wide enough of Wade who flies to his left. This is a touch too straight, and even though this has hurried him, Pujara gets enough bat. Actually he gets an inside edge that is headed to the keeper, but the <strong>deflection off the thigh pad</strong> takes it wide"
into the top-five longest innings for India. Pushed to mid-off
"bouncer, on off, Pujara ducks it"
"<strong>big big shout for a catch off the inside edge</strong>. Not given, and Australia don't review it. This one nips back in, goes past the inside edge, and hits him high on the back pad. Great take by Wade"

padded away as O'Keefe stays outside leg
"outside leg again, and left alone"
"short of a length, punched to square leg"
and kicks one away again
this forward-defensive makes this the third-longest innings by an Indian

"bouncer, Pujara under it and sways out of its line"

"flighted outside leg, and kicked away again"
this time he finds the gap with the short ball and takes a single to deep midwicket
"short of a length, outside leg, placed in front of short fine leg for a single"
bouncer again. This is a big effort from Cummins. Keeping the runs down
"another bouncer, into the body, and he ducks it"
and another bouncer. These are not to high so he can keep going. Saha ducks it
"short of a length, into the ribs, hits the bat hard. Defended to short leg. His bottom hand comes off the bat"
"<strong>hits him on the chest</strong> as Saha looks to move outside the line of it. Desperate review taken by Smith. Saha does really well to drop his wrists out of the way, and lets it hit him in the chest. Lobs to Smith at slip, and he wastes the review"
yorker to end the over. Another maiden
"full, outside leg, pushed wide of O'Keefe for a single"
"down the wicket, beaten in the flight, defends to short cover"

"full, on off, driven to long-off for one"
"flat, outside leg, defended by Pujara"
"bouncer again, Cummins giving the umpires every chance to ask for the light metres"
"bouncer, into the body, he gets under it"

"full, on leg, defended solidly. <strong>Longest innings by an Indian now</strong>"
"full, outside leg, turned around the corner for one"

another defensive shot after shaping up for the sweep

solid front-foot defensive now

inside edge as this is a rare mental error from Pujara looking to whip a length ball to leg
"tossed up outside off, looks to defend, is hit on the pad, but outside the line of off"

"full, middle and leg, defended"
"short of a length, middle and leg, punched to midwicket"
"into the pads, defended around the corner"
"flat, middle and leg, angling towards off, punched to mid-on"
whipped away off the pads for one
"down the wicket, reaches the pitch of the ball, drives it to midwicket"

"on a length, no turn, hits the inside half of the bat"
"on a length again, angling in, worked past short leg for one"
"full, outside off, driven in front of deep cover, and they come back for two now"

"short of a length, worked away to long leg"
"down the wicket, and he beats short midwicket, as he invariably does"
"Saha keeps enjoying his luck now. Down the wicket, beaten completely in the flight, he just swings, and it somehow clears mid-off. And Renshaw puts the big chase in to save one run"
"full, on the pads, clips one to deep midwicket to reach 199"
"down the wicket, gets too close to the ball, and he digs it out back to him"
"tossed up outside off, defended"
"flat, offbreak, defended to short leg"
"down the wicket, lets it turn, flicks it past square leg, and <strong>brings up his third double-century</strong>. He lets out a rare show of emotion, pumping his fist. The whole ground erupts. Smith among those applauding"

down the wicket to defend this back
"fired outside leg, Wade does the rest"

"lovely shot. Counters O'Keefe's defensive line, makes room, and chips this over extra cover. Really really difficult shot"
paddle-swept but straight to short fine leg
"slogs towards deep midwicket, gets a couple"
"and Lyon finally gets a wicket after the first day of Bangalore Test. And that has come because Pujara has finally agreed to play a loose shot, looking for quick runs. Looking to punch a short ball away, but the ball stops on him and is chipped to short midwicket. What a great innings. Everybody applauds him. All the Aussies too. Great great display of discipline and mental strength"

"outside leg again, defended back to him"
"on a length, on leg, defended off the front foot"
drives a full ball to long-off
Jadeja has found the gap between long-on and deep midwicket. Skips down and chips this with the turn. India's lead gets close to 100
goes deep into the crease and bunts this shortish delivery for one
"short of a length, on off, punched to deep point"
"wide length ball, loose defensive shot outside off. Doesn't edge it, though"
"<strong>dropped at mid-on</strong>. Would have been a sensational catch for someone who has bowled 71 overs. Umesh slogs, lobs one straight of mid0on, O'Keefe flies, gets a hand to it, but it pops out on impact as he comes down"
"straight, on off, defended off the back foot"
"slower ball, Jadeja swings, and he misses. Hazlewood unlucky he misses the off stump"

Jadeja rubs it in with a skip down the wicket to loft him into the sight screen
"full, middle and leg, defended to leg"
"short, outside off, cut away"
"is Jadeja stumped? Wily old customer, he has got back in time. Jumps out of the crease early, O'Keefe pushes one wide, but he aborts the shot and rushes back into the crease"

"spin from outside off, but Jadeja gets outside the line as it turns past the inside edge"

"full, outside off, defended back to him"
"length ball, on off, defended to cover"
"short of a length, gets width, and he expertly steers this between the slips and gully"
"as expected, the fast bowler's response is to bounce him. Umesh looks to help it along, but is beaten by the bounce"

"goes for the yorker, but Umesh's bat comes down in time"
"bouncer, and Umesh brings up his bat horizontally in self defence. Gets a single to deep square leg"
"slow, on a length, on off, defended off the front foot"
"Ishant will come out to bat now. Umesh jumps out of the crease, looking to clear mid-off, but gets too close to the ball  and slices it low to mid-off. O'Keefe has a third wicket for one short of 200 runs"

"bouncer outside leg, left alone"
"lead goes past 150. Short of a length, into the ribs, Jadeja gets inside the line and guides it fine for four"

<strong>nearly bat-pad</strong>. Ashwin finds his length. Drift too. No turn either. Just falls forward of short leg
"nervous desperate shot. Looking to hit Ashwin off his length. Makes room and jumps out of the crease, beaten in the flight, still goes ahead with the shot. The think outside edge just sails over mid-off"

"flatter, quicker, goes deep into the crease to defend one"

defended off the front foot
"fired in, Renshaw deep in the crease to defend a full ball"
"turn and bounce, beats the inside edge, hits him high on the pad"
no turn now. Renshaw is going through a torrid time here. And Jadeja is not giving him any breathing space
"oh you need some luck to survive this. Some are kicking and turning, some are skidding and going straight on. No way to tell which one will do what. Beaten on the outside edge"

"the non-turning offbreak, runs off the inside edge as Renshaw defends"
goes back to defend a length ball in front of middle and leg
"wide on the crease, and Jadeja produces a beauty. Uses the angle, pitches this smack in the rough, Warner plays back when he should be forward. Perhaps it is the flat trajectory. There is an explosion in the rough, the ball turns past the inside edge, stays a touch low too. Cleans him up"
"full, middle and leg, hits the inside half of the bat as Lyon defends"
"<strong>big big lbw shout</strong>. No turn as Lyon pushes forward to defend. The ball doesn't turn. Natural variation. This is headed down leg, though"

"solid forward defensive, off the inside edge onto the pad"
"full, on off, defended back to Ashwin"

"nice dip, on off, Renshaw defends"
"really full, dipping on his toes, defended by Renshaw"

"tossed up, middle and leg, and he stretches forward to defend"
"tossed up, and good to see India have the mid-off up to deny him that easy single"
"short of a length, down the leg side, Saha is a little tardy, allows a bye"

"fuller, Smith is on the crease, and defends off the back foot"

"full, pushed towards mid-off, but now a short straight cover is there after that uppish drive last over"
"slower in the air, middle and leg, and Smith is forward to push this wide of mid-on"

"nasty. Marsh is looking to leave alone one short ball outside off, but it hits the pitch and jags back in to hit him in the rib cage"
"Smith pads up to one outside leg, but it spins past the pad to flatten the off stump. This is an inverted replay of what Jadeja did to Smith four years ago in Delhi. Bowled when shouldering alone. So what has Smith done wrong here? This is outside leg, so it is okay to pad it away, but it is slightly half-committed padding. Doesn't cover the line enough, leaving the ball a chance to spin past the pad. Pujara used to stride forward when padding up. Smith has only half a forward movement. And Jadeja rips it from the rough. This could be over for Australia"
