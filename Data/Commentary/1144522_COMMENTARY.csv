Kohli takes 10+ seconds before <strong>calling for DRS.</strong> Looked like it was missing leg live. Will be very hard to overturn with Shami coming around the stumps. There's also some doubt as to whether Soumya has sandwiched this off an inside edge into his pads. Third umpire Aleem Dar deems there has in fact been an inside edge and doesn't even proceed past Ultraedge onto ball-tracking. <strong>India lose their review and Kohli is furiously remonstrating with Marais Erasmus on field.</strong>"

"good length ball on middle spinning into leg, goes back to flick but can't get it away."
"short on fourth stump and spinning back in, chopped off the back foot to extra cover."
"full and wide on sixth stump, Sabbir reaches a long way across to sweep this on length against the spin and hammers it along the turf through midwicket for a crisp boundary."
"short on the stumps, scorching pull in front of square screams past the leg umpire to the rope."
"<strong>missed runout off his own bowling!</strong> Short of a length on the stumps, goes back to tap this into the covers, Hardik pounces moving right, scoops, spins around and fires from 14 yards at the non-striker's end. Saifuddin was a dead duck by three yards but the ball bounces over the stumps."
"short of a length on the stumps, clipped behind square for a very long one. Rahul denies the second."
"slower bouncer wide on 7th stump at 127 kph, tries to uppercut this but misses."
"fullish length ball follows Saifuddin backing away down leg, can't get it away off the pads."
"slower bouncer on fifth stump, left alone by Saifuddin."
"full, looks for the sweep, but misses"
"goes down the leg side with a flatter one, bowled at 91kph, will have to rebowl this"
goes back to tap a length ball back towards short midwicket. Chahal is first to it
"floats this one wider of off stump, and Sabbir wants to go hard at it. Misses, as the ball creeps under his bat, and he falls over. Just about stays inside the crease, as Dhoni lurks looking to effect the stumping"
pushes a length ball away towards sweeper cover
"googly, and he allows it to turn into him, and plays it away towards square leg. They want two, but Chahal gets there first. Superb commitment, as he puts in a dive to throw this to Dhoni"
"flighted, outside off, and he drives this down to long off"
"fuller ball, angles into him, and he plays this away to the left of square leg"
"around the wicket, full, and he <strong>smacks this inside out</strong>! Saifuddin with a more than sufficient sting in the tail today!"
"length, angles into him, and he pushes this back down the pitch"
"walks closer to a ball outside off, and whips it away towards long leg. <strong>Targets the shorter boundary, and that's where this goes!</strong>"
"short, and he plays what Kapil Dev had popularised as the Natraj shot! One foot up in the air, as he pulls it away towards deep square leg"
"short, and he swings away to the on side. Goes off the underside of the bat towards square leg, and they pick up a single"
"length, a bit wide, and he slashes hard, but gets it towards a protected fence at deep point"
"fuller ball, and he digs it out towards deep midwicket"
"tossed wide. Too wide in fact, outside off, as he leaves"
"nails the yorker. Bowled at 136kph, and Sabbir plays it on to his boot. Wants a quick single, but it fell far too close to the wicket, with Bhuvneshwar running in quickly"
"slower ball, outside off. He advances, but misses on contact. <strong>Wide called again!</strong>"
"length, and he looks to run this down towards third man, but gets it too close to short third man. A change-up again from Bhuvi"
"length, outside off, and he looks to play the steer towards third man again. This time it was 122kph, as he is beaten by the pace of it. A bit early, in fact"
"full toss, on middle and leg, and he flicks it away but gets it to deep midwicket"
"<strong>GOT HIM!</strong> Fullish, and a change of pace at just <b>118kph</b>. Sabbir swings free, but cannot make any contact with this. It goes on to just brush the leg stump after missing his flashing blade. That has the ring of 'game, set, match India' all over it!"
"yorker, on off stump, and he digs it out. That went at <strong>142kph</strong>"
"full ball, and he flicks it away towards midwicket"
"full ball, and he flicks this away towards deep midwicket"
"full, and he plays it away towards square leg"
"goes wide with a slower ball, but too wide of the tramlines on the off side"
"yoker, and he has timed this beautifully through the on side. Deep midiwcket has to trudge to his right and get this. <strong>250 up for Bangladesh!</strong>"
"<strong>SMACKED HIGH AND STRAIGHT!</strong> Change of pace from Bhuvi, and Mortaza gets a lot of height as he targets the straight boundary, but only just clears the man there"
"<strong>ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST!</strong> Goes for another straight thwack, but the outside edge sends it flying to the right of Dhoni, who takes it safely. Bangladesh's campaign is approaching its end, but they aren't going down without a fight here"
"slower ball attempted, ends up as a leg-side full toss, but Rubel can only play it away towards square leg"
"short, and he backs away and looks to swipe this straight down the ground. Gets the outer edge as it flies to the right of third man"
"slower ball, just down the leg side as Saifuddin looks to play the flick. Called a wide again"
backs away and pumps a full ball through extra cover. <strong>What a super bit of timing!</strong>
"off cutter, change of pace, and he can flick this away towards midwicket and pick up a single to retain strike"
"slower ball, a full toss, and he is surprised by how high it comes to him. Tapped away to point. He's looking for the full toss above waist height, but it isn't called"
"full ball, and he drives this down the ground to long off"
<strong>DRILLED BACK DOWN THE GROUND!</strong> I think Rubel will get the broadcasters to give him this clip for his archives. Gets down on one knee and slaps a full ball outside off back past Bumrah
"backs away from a short ball, and sends it flying towards point. Rishabh Pant decides not to attack the ball"
"full, angles across Saifuddin, who flicks this towards midwicket, and gets an easy single"
"yorker, and he jams his bat down just in time to keep this <strong>143kph</strong> ball away from his stumps. Runs it off the inner part of the bat down to fine leg"
"full, just outside off, and Rubel looks to go down the ground, but misses out"
"full toss, and he puts in a lot of effort to whack this away. Eventually off the toe-end and back past Saifuddin at the non-striker's end, and goes towards long on"
"short, and Saifuddin lets this pass. Too short, and is called a wide"
"short, follows him as he backs away, and he can still connect and get it down to long leg. <strong>Terrific shot!</strong>"
"full ball, and he drives this down towards long on"
"full ball, just outside off, and he tries to slap this away after backing away to the leg side, but cannot make contact"
"full again, and he gets an inner edge in trying to thrash it down towards long on. Limps down the leg side, for Dhoni to take"
"full, and he whips this off middle stump towards midwicket"
"backs away and gets a bit of bat to a length ball angling into him, goes towards midwicket"
"<strong>WHAT A SHOT TO BRING UP FIFTY!</strong> It's a full ball, on the stumps, and he backs away and smacks this straight back down the ground. Long on gets around and dives to his right, but Virat Kohli can only just miss the ball there"
"fullish ball, at the pads, and he gets some bat to it and runs it along to square leg"
"<strong>YORKED HIM!</strong> Full, fast, and gives no chance to Rubel Hossain. He backs away yet again, but this time the angle of the ball gives him no chance to jam the bat down in time. Bangladesh are running out of wickets, but what an absolutely fantastic rearguard action it has been since Shakib fell!"
"<strong>THROUGH HIM!</strong> That's how it's done, says Jasprit Bumrah. From one exponent of great death bowling to the other! That went through Mustafizur before his bat could even contemplate its descent down to meet with the ball. Goes through between the bottom the bat and his toe, and goes on to hit the base of off-stump."
