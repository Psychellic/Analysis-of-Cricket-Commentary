"good stop. Full and wide, swinging away. Parthiv goes chasing and hits the ball nicely but finds short cover. Actually, that has just carried to Hooda, to his right. The ball bursts out. <b>Dropped!</b>"
"on the pads from Sandeep, a hint of away shape. Worked away to midwicket"
"<strong>the umpire stops four!</strong> Ump S Ravi. A full delivery on the pads, Parthiv flicks right into the knee of the square leg umpire. He just could not get out of the way."
"yummy! A full delivery outside off, Kohli walks down to negate the swing. It's full enough and he nails a delectable off drive. Past the bowler, past mid-off. Lovely shot."
"good single now. Back of a length outside off, tapped down towards point and Kohli calls his partner through."
"125 kph. Sunrisers strike early. A good catch from Kaul at third man. A back of a length delivery outside off, moves away too and may have bounced a tad extra. Parthiv heaves across the line, felt like he was there a touch early too. The ball takes a thick leading edge and goes very very high - more elevation than distance - and carries down to third man, who runs to his right and takes a good catch."
"that's a fantastic start for AB. He loves it when he starts with four. A short flat delivery outside off, AB hurries back and nails a cut through point."
"just the start he had against Daredevils at this ground earlier in the season. He played the same shot against Nadeem and didn't look back. A flat delivery outside off, chipped over cover for four. Too good."
"excellent bowling. Slows the pace up outside off, <b>AB checks his shot</b>. Takes a thick leading edge towards point, does not carry. Lovely flight"
"full and flat outside off, pushed to mid-off for a run"
"lots of spin actually already. Flat and wide, it takes plenty of spin and Kohli cuts away into the off side"
"still shortish, can go a tad fuller and try to get AB out playing a lofted drive on this surface. The short length allows AB to go back and cut towards cover for one. Excellent over from Shakib, but well played too."
"wow, it's so easy for him. It's not even wide, a good length delivery on the fourth or fifth stump channel. He makes room and carves a cut through point, that's a shot Warner has owned."
"nailed! 18 off 7 now is AB. This one is full outside off, he clears his front leg and nails a lofted drive over cover. This is glorious, free stroke-making"
"doesn't want to overdo it, so he blocks a full delivery just to show he can."
"another slower delivery outside off, carved to short third man. Loud call of 'nooo' from Kohli."
"full and straight, he has the runs in the over so why take another risk? Too experienced for that so a checked drive to long-on."
"full and straight, may have been a well-executed legcutter, defended back."
"the same shots he played so well against Daredevils, bad news for Sunrisers. It's full outside off, he walks across and doesn't bother about the spin because it's a cross-batted slog with so much elegance over midwicket. What do you do?"
"a good defensive ball, flat and wide, hit to cover."
"nicely bowled actually. Very slow outside off, bowling to his field. AB drives to deep cover and gets off strike."
"flat and straight, some more spin but Kohli is an exceptional player of spin. Goes back and works to wide mid-on, against the spin"
"flatter through the air around off, chipped to deep cover again"
"too much flight there, overpitched and Kohli chooses the safer option to drive with the spin to deep cover."
"the wide yorker, going defensive from the outset. Excellent execution, goes under the bat"
"the googly on middle, worked to midwicket. Kohli comes down, AB says get back. And Virat does. Good early communication because it was the wrong call from Kohli"
"Williamson saves four. Flat and wide outside off, Kohli flat-bats that towards KW at mid-off. He races away and dives to his right"
"races away. Rashid drops short, Kohli goes back and pulls over midwicket for four. Just read the length quickly."
"cleaned 'im up. You can't really say that often but that was poor game awareness from Kohli. He just got four against the opposition's best bowler, and went for six this time. It's a tossed up googly outside off, Kohli backs away and slogs across the line. He misses, the ball doesn't, hits off and middle stump. Maybe it was instinct or his determination to attack the best, but that wasn't the best decision he's made."
pushed away to long-on
140 kph yorker on off. The ball that got Moeen in the 2015 World Cup against New Zealand from Southee. This time he jams down and taps to point.
"a full delivery around off, not much swing, none at all. Pushed to point."
"on middle and off, worked to deep square leg"
"AB's picking them before the bowler knows what he wants to bowl. As soon as he sees it's full and straight, he knows where he's going - over mid-on because the field is in. And even though it's not AB's best timing, it's good enough because his decision-making is so quick. Awesome. Just lands inside? This is taking an age from the third umpire. The 147th replay goes on screen. Woooohooo, a decision at last: it's four."
"full and straight, driven to cover."
"excellently bowled, a yorker on middle, jammed out to mid-off. Very good over from Kaul."
"a googly on off, tapped to cover for one. He read that well did Mo Ali."
"it's all in the head. He premeditated that. He stayed low, got his pad outside the line in case he missed it and reverse-paddled that past slip."
"a tad short. That's the AB 1-2. Forcing a short delivery after a good shot of the full one, pulled to square leg."
"the googly outside off, goes past Ali's cut."
"the legbreak, flat and straight. Inside-edged into the pad and then back up towards the keeper."
"a clear sign he has no sign which way it's spinning. A lovely T20 slog sweep, inside-edged to fine leg."
"smashed for six! That's good, clear, proactive batting from Ali. Doesn't want to leave all the scoring to AB, so when he gets a full delivery outside off, he lofts a lofted drive over mid-off."
"six more. Slightly shorter, he may have anticipated that length because of the errant first delivery. So he stays back and pulls nonchalantly over square leg. The 1-2 play, 12 runs off two balls."
"good batting, a slower ball outside off, tapped to point for one."
"that's pummeled. That's his decision making again. That's why the timing is so good, that's why it's right in the gap. Digs that in short on leg, and smashed over midwicket."
"<strong>on the bounce</strong>! A slower delivery on leg, 98 kph, may have been too slow for AB. Pulled to deep square leg"
"a slower ball outside off, punched away to the sweeper cover from the back foot."
"flight outside off, Ali flat-bats a slog to long-on. This is new-age T20 cricket, going after pretty much everything early in the over"
"slow on middle, AB backs away and pushes to cover."
"very wide outside off, forcing Ali to drag a sweep, to deep midwicket"
"flat and straight, de Villiers drives back to Shakib. Well bowled again"
"signs of a slow surface, but it's very slow from Shakib too, on middle and leg, wants to hit to cover, hits to the bowler"
"flat and straight again, punched to cover. Excellent over from Shakib."
"a slower delivery outside off, tapped to short third man. A throw at the batsman's end misses, resulting in an overthrow."
"a slower ball outside off, Ali's wild heave is missed."
a length delivery outside off is slapped to long-off
"127 kph, length outside off, punched to the sweeper cover"
"a great catch from Dhawan at long-on, but he backtracks into the boundary cushion. Slapped with fierce power from Ali, flat and hard. Dhawan takes an overhead catch but goes back into the boundary for six. This is a lovely cameo"
"length outside off, slapped to long-off"
"he's taking Rashid down too! Superb batting. Runs down the pitch and goes through the line. It's the googly so he hits the ball over long-off, with the spin."
"flat and wide, carved past point for a couple."
"flat and wide outside off, 96 kph, very quick through the air. Hit to long-off"
"AB misses a sweep, gets right outside the line for just this. The googly hits the pad, but outside the line"
"another googly down leg, he misses a swat. AB asks why is that not a wide with his expressions at the umpire."
"flat and quick again, on leg, reverse-swept away to third man"
"full on off, swatted away off the inside half to deep midwicket. In the gap and two."
"whew, what power! My word, what a shot.A shortish delivery outside off, but not too wide. He arches his back to make room, sounds weird I know, but that's what he did and sliced a cut through point."
"another fifty for AB. And what an innings too. Just a tad short on middle, he stays back and pulls through midwicket for four. So easy..."
"a full delivery on middle, pushed to long-on. That may have been six if he decided to attack it, but the runs in the over are there so no."
"Moeen on faaaya! A short delivery on off and middle, Ali pulls fiercely and beautifully over square leg for six. A front-foot pull, that's how much T20 batting has changed."
"a shortish delivery outside off, 122 kph, slapped to long-off."
"what timing. A low full toss and Moeen this time drills a drive through cover <b>to move to fifty</b>. His maiden IPL fifty, first-pumps from Kohli too."
"<strong>superb effort from Man Pan at long-on</strong>. A full delivery on leg, swatted away into the gap, but Pandey doesn't give up on it. Runs in and almost gets there, on the bounce."
"drifts down leg, wide. Free run."
"it's the shot he plays when he feels at the top of his game. Remember him sweeping Steyn or Rabada or Holder? He tries it again, it's a slow delivery, he waits and pull-sweeps over short fine leg. <strong>AB at his best</strong>"
"wow, that's stunning batting. A full toss on middle and leg, de Villiers gets low again like the previous delivery and sweeps the ball over backward square leg for a <b>humongouuuuuus six</b>. OUT THE GROUND! 105 metre six."
"well bowled, a yorker on middle, pushed to long-on"
"full and wide, carved to deep point. Timing is extraordinary."
"squeezed away towards short third man. Good stop from Thampi, to his left. A wide yorker is jammed away"
"that's what he does, forces you to bowl wides. Just outside the tramline and wide. But that's a good option from Sandeep"
"a very similar delivery, a slow wide delivery outside off. AB goes from bottom to top and carves the ball over backward point."
"127 kph, a low full toss on middle and leg, chipped to long-on"
"well bowled, 104 kph, a gutsy slower ball outside off, right in the slot, but it's the pace that deceives Moeen. Swing and miss"
"107 kph, how has that gone for six? YIKES! A slower ball outside off, a very good one. A wide knuckle ball that's just inside the tramline, it's the perfect line. But a deceived slap carries all the way over long-on"
"full on leg, flicked away to deep midwicket"
"a shortish delivery on off, pulled over long-on"
"for all the pyrotechnics of RCB batting, that is spectacular from Dhawan! Stalls this innings, quietens the crowd with a typical T20 play. Events such as this change games. And all it needs to be is a catch. A flat delivery on middle and leg, AB stays low and sweeps towards deep square leg It seems like it's lobbing over Dhawan, but he stays calm, takes the catch and ensures his balance doesn't take him over by keeping a strong centre of gravity. Awesome catch. Not as good as Boult's, but very close."
"Moeen doesn't care much. A legbreak outside off, flat-batted over the umpire for four. Straight and quick."
"two in three! Rashid pulls things back. A flat googly outside off, Moeen reverse-paddles the ball from the back of the bat. It's a significant deflection, but Goswami gets his gloves to it, and parries the ball up and takes the rebound. Not the worst shot from Moeen, but another fantastic catch."
"the googly down leg, ricochets off the pad into the leg side"
"a googly outside off, patted back."
"full outside off, swatted away into the gap at midwicket for two. RCB have runs 150 and 151"
"CdG too going after everything. Full and wide outside off, a thick outside edge over short third man."
"a slower delivery outside off, carved away to backward point. Carlos Brathwaite misfields and allows a second. Sloppy."
"<b>that's Thampi's fifty</b>! And what a shot to take him there. To be honest, that's a plain awful delivery. Full and straight, right in the slot. And CdG lofts the ball over long-off with a full face. Beauty!"
"keeps low, a back of the hand slower ball outside off. CdG waits and waits and swings, but the ball goes under"
"edged, but short of the keeper. Well bowled to finish. Another slower ball outside off, CdG gets a bit of bat on his swing."
"flat and quick outside off, pushed to cover for one. Good single, good awareness from Mandeep"
"flat and quick again, outside-edged to short third man"
"same line and length, but Mandeep plays a different shot, a flick into the gap at midwicket for two."
"flat outside off, a tap to short third man."
"wow, has he stopped that from six? The standard of fielding today is exceptional. A slog sweep looks to clear deep midwicket. Hooda is right on the boundary, sticks out his right hand and stops the momentum of the ball, his hand on its downward trajectory then pushes the ball back into the field of play."
"finished with six. Flat and wide outside off, CdG lofts the ball nicely and cleanly over cover. No stopping that, into the stands."
"Dhawan takes the catch at long-off. A shortish length delivery outside off, hoicked away but with bad timing. The bat turns in his hands as well, taken by Dhawan. Easy catch."
"clears midwicket! A badly-judged catch from Rashid. <strong>That should have been taken</strong> by tonight's standards. A full delivery outside off is skewed away off the inside half. Rashid runs in, then backtracks after misjudging it. The ball then just clears him and clears the boundary"
"a good short slower ball, CdG misses it. Goswami fumbles and Sarfraz runs through. Good from him."
"misfield this time. A short and wide slower ball, cut away towards short third man. Thampi runs to his right but falls over the ball."
"full and straight, worked away towards square leg."
"good stop from Goswami. Another slower ball outside off, tapped away towards the keeper, who dives to his right and stops three."
"that's tripe from Thampi. 97 kph, a very very very very slow delivery outside off. CdG says I can play that, slapped over cover for six. Huuge."
"gets away with that. Another poor ball, actually much worse than the previous delivery. It's a full toss on the pads, CdG picks out deep midwicket"
"squeezed past backward point for four. That's more awful bowling. It's full and straight, right in the slot for a nice T20 heave away over midwicket, but Sarfraz opens the face and guides the ball past the fielder. Nicely done."
"140 kph, a straight full toss. Sarfraz shows AB how to play it. Opens the bat face and just lets the ball hit bat, over short third man for six. Lovely hit."
"a slower delivery on off, Sarfraz tried to play the same shot but all he can do is tap the ball to backward point"
"a good yorker to finish. A low full toss on off, pushed to long-on. Thampi <b>finishes with 4-0-70-0</b>"
"a wide slower delivery outside off, it goes up towards Williamson at cover. The ball swerves and swirls and Williamson drops it."
"Rashid takes that! He misjudged that as well but <strong>he's taken a one-handed stunner</strong>! Much like Trent Boult, Rashid misjudges this, comes in, and backtracks late. He then goes back, but this is much flatter so all he can do is stick out his right hand take the catch nonchalantly. It was a flat-batted swat from CdG."
"dropped by Sandeep! A slower ball on leg, Sarfraz top-edges his hoick, it carries to a very fine fine leg. Sandeep runs in but puts the catch down, he had too much forward momentum."
"a quick delivery on leg, Sarfraz is beaten for pace, off the thigh pad into the off side."

"looks to go over mid-on but gets a thick inside edge that just about clears midwicket. Lucky boundary, but he'll take the runs"
"<strong>the helicopter has taken off.</strong> The wristy whip from outside off to the deep midwicket boundary. Sensational from Hales. Not much wrong with the delivery, Umesh has an exasperated look."
"through with the pull even before the ball arrived, beaten."
"punched but can't beat mid-off, refuses the single."
"Southee pulls off a stunner at deep square leg! This was pulled flat, but the ball was dying on Southee. He could've so easily looked to save the boundary, but he dived low and pulled it off inches from the ground. <b> Soft signal is out. </b> Understandable this time that the third umpire wants to look at multiple replays. <b> Oh, wait. Has he pressed the wrong button? </b> Not out flashes the big screen. Southee's face was in the firing line too, if he got a bad bounce, that could've so easily smashed into his face. <b> Oh, dear. Third umpire says not out. </b> He's overturned the decision. Kohli is shocked, Southee is shocked, shakes his head in disbelief. <b> Michael Clarke on air goes: 'I can't believe that!' </b> The third umpire in question is <b> C Shamsuddin </b>"

"<B> hit straight back! </b> Dhawan steps out to go over the top, can't get to the pitch and ends up chipping it back. Big wicket for RCB. Dhawan checked his shot because the ball gripped the surface and spun back in, may have been able to just clear the bowler had he gone through"

"steps out and works this with the spin to deep square, Umesh is a busy man"
"<B> today is a day of catches, physics-defying from AB! </B> It's that superman AB de Villiers. The catch is so good that Kohli and his mates do a 100 metre dash to run towards their mate. Magnificent, incredible. Hales steps out and muscles this length ball over deep midwicket, he thinks he's cleared it but doesn't know what's to come. AB leaps high, but realises the ball was swirling away. Instinctively puts his right hand out and pulls off a one-handed stunner even as it continued to curl away. Mind you. he was airborne when the ball lodged in his hand, so there was still a simple matter of having to land, keep control and be mindful of the ropes. All items checked. Wow"
