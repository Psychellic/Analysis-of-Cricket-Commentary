"<b>is that dropped?</b> Sound when the ball goes past Fakhar's drive, but Seifert hasn't taken that simple grab. The sound could have been the bat jamming down into the pitch. Zaman stepped out and was beaten by angle"
"outswinging yorker just outside off, jammed into the pitch"
"length ball shaping away outside off, blocked on the front foot"
"<b>leading edge</b> down to third man. It's a full toss swinging away outside off, closes the face early on it"
"short of a length just outside off, jabbed off the back foot to cover's left. Phillips puts in a leap to parry that to his left"
"full inswinger at off stump, brings the bat down with the full face and opens it at the last moment to guide this to short third man"
"length ball on the pads, looks to flick but can't get bat on it. Pings down the pitch"
"length on the pads again, and once again  he can't get enough bat on it. Just an inside edge. Runs into the covers off the pad, and they steal a single"
"full and on leg stump, deflected to the keeper as he looks to flick"
"length outside off, mistimed drive on the up to extra cover"
"<b>just past cover's hand</b> and it's through the infield. Length ball with some shape away, he taps it on the up with minimal feet. The fielder was diving to his right and it seems like his knee got stuck in the ground and impeded his movement. Nearly got to that one"
"<b>whacks the stumps</b> after picking it up in his follow through. Slower ball from Southee, lobbed up at off stump and it's driven back at him with the batsman outside the crease"
<b>misses another one on the pads!</b> Third full ball on the pads that he's missed out on. This one swings in and makes connection with him before he can get the bat down
"slower ball ball met on the full at leg stump, leans into it and flicks to deep midwicket"
nicely timed. But finds mid-on. It's full on middle stump and he drives sweetly to find the fielder
"yorker length outswinger just outside off. Opens the face and uses the pace, but he can't get this past Sodhi at short third man. The legspinner slides to his right"
<b>full toss</b> outside a leg stump line. Zaman is backing away to make room but ends up cramping himself. It's a mistimed chop into the covers
"<b>shot</b> but straight to midwicket. Short ball rising up generously for Babar, who pulled off the front foot with full balance"
<b>full toss outside leg</b> and he drags it to mid-on. It's not easy living for Zaman who has been jumping around and giving himself little chance. Down the pitch and trying to make room again
"<b>inside edge</b> past the stumps and down to the fine leg boundary. Another yorker from Southee, in the corridor. Zaman wants to carve this with his front leg down leg side."
"attempted yorker met on the full outside off, punched straight to mid-off"
hoicked to mid-on's right. Length ball outside off and it's an impatient heave with little connection
"short and just outside off, chops it to sweeper cover's left"
slower ball floated up at off stump. Gets behind it and turns it to midwicket with soft hands
"<b>gets it past short third</b> this time. Another attempted yorker, but this time he overdoes the length. It's swinging away and he uses that trajectory to make the decision to open his face and carve this behind square"
"length on off stump, dabs it into the off side with soft hands"
slower ball at a length on leg stump. Flicked with soft hands through the open square leg area
"length on middle stump, flicked to midwicket's right"
follows him down leg side with a full ball and cramps him. He finds mid-on
"length on leg stump, flicked out to deep square leg"
"full ball on off stump, driven into the off side towards mid-off"
length ball follows him into the leg side. He can only jab it towards mid-on. That was 147.4 kph
"<b>gets him at cover!</b> Superb setting up of this wicket from New Zealand. It's a short ball in at his chest, rising sharply. He wants to pummel it over midwicket with a pull but he gets under it and slices into the off side instead. They gave him no room at all for any of his favourite strokes and after a bunch of yorkers, they get him with the first short ball"
"length in the corridor, gets forward and defends to backward point"
<b>149.4kph</b> yorker at middle stump. Hafeez jams it into the leg side
poor ball to finish. It's full and onto the pads. He allows it to come on and flicks it fine

"length on middle stump, clipped through midwicket off the back foot"
"short of a length and turning away outside off, backs away and punches to sweeper"
"<b>nicely done in the deep.</b> Chapman runs to his right at long-on, dives full length and slaps at the ball. It ramps up and goes behind him and to his left. He immediately tuns around and pulls it back in inches from the rope. That was a short ball at middle stump, pulled hard to long-on's right"
"short at middle, pulled to long-on's right"
"short of a length outside off, cut through cover point"
"full on middle stump, driven down to long-on"

"slower ball at leg stump, flicked to deep square off the back foot"
<b>lifts it over midwicket</b> but it's off the inside half of the bat. Deep square covers up to his left. He ran down at this length ball

"slower ball, short of a length outside off. Allows it to come on and opens the face to run it past short third man"
"full slower ball on off stump, flicked to midwicket's right"
"yorker at middle stump, watches it on and gets the flick in front of deep square"
"short ball in the corridor, allows it to come on and runs it to third man's left. The fielder there, Rance, makes the ground and puts in a slide. But his knee gets jammed in and he loses his alignment as a result. Parries it into the boundary"
"short of a length just outside off, run down to third man"
<b>gets him jumping</b> for safety. That is nearly 146kph. A bouncer and Hafeez has lost balance as he looks to duck this
"short of a length just outside off, guided to third man with an open face"
"short ball in the corridor, lets it come on and guides it to third man again"
"tossed up on middle stump, driven inside-out to short extra"
"flatter and this one slides on with the angle towards leg stump. Makes room, but is cramped by the lack of turn, and he just knocks it gently into the cover region and calls his partner through for a single"
"flighted ball on off stump and Hafeez jumps out, gets just where he needs to be in terms of the pitch of the ball, and frees his arms to hit it high and handsome, back over the bowler's head"
"down the track again, this time making himself a little more room since Sodhi had straightened his line and flattened his length. No difference to Hafeez, who lofts it cleanly, back over the non-striker's head on this occasion"
"short now, the googly, midwicket is back on the rope to keep this pull down to one"
"big legbreak, pitching quite short and turning from middle and leg to outside off. Uses his wrists to whip it down to long-on"
"pitched up, outside off, squeezes it out to backward point"
"slower yorker, clipped to deep square leg"
"back of a length, angling into leg stump, tucked away to deep backward square leg"
"shortish outside off, stops on him slightly as he shapes to cut. Ends up dragging it straighter than he'd like, in front of point, but it's far enough to the fielder's right to enable him to scurry across to the other end and bring up 1000 T20I runs in a mere 26 innings. He's the quickest to the mark, ahead of Virat Kohli by one innings"
"in the blockhole on middle and leg, clipped to long-on"
"shortish, angling into off stump and cramping Babar up as he steps back and across. Tucks it quietly to midwicket"

"fuller now, outside off, driven to extra-cover, who's deep enough to allow a single"
"full on middle stump, clipped firmly back to the bowler"
"back of a length on middle stump, flat-batted past midwicket's left hand to the fielder at long-on"
"shortish again, on the stumps, pulled in the air and on the bounce to deep midwicket. Not too much pace or hitting room to work with here"
"back of a length, angling into leg stump to cramp Babar, who jabs it softly into the point region and picks up the single that gets him to 50"
"full, angling into middle and leg, and it's the slower one too. Looks to swipe it down to long-on but can't get any timing on it, and ends up inside-edging into his front pad"
"shortish, gets up to chest height over middle stump. Pulled round to deep square leg"
"full, close to off stump. Looks to clear his front leg and slog down the ground, can't make contact"
"down the track now, makes a bit of room against the stump-to-stump length ball and chops it away into the point region. Again, no timing"
"short ball over off stump, gets up to chest height. Pulled to deep midwicket"
"in the blockhole on off and middle, whipped down to long-on"
"no trouble this time, though. Gets one full from Munro and he clears his front leg to hit it clean and flat, back down the ground for six"
"and another! Shorter this time, but still in his hitting arc. Clears his front leg again and launches it over the leaping long-on fielder"
"back of a length now, makes room and slaps to deep point"
"full on off and middle, clipped to deep square leg"
"down the track now, goes a little early and Munro bowls it into his legs. Clipped in the air, on the bounce to deep midwicket"
"on the pads, clipped to deep square leg"
"full on middle stump, clipped to long-on"
"well bowled. Hafeez had given himself a lot of room and Ferguson spears it in full, angling it into his feet. Taps it into the covers and hurries to the other end"
"slower ball, but that's a terrible lapse in line. Ends up bowling a short offcutter than turns down the leg side. A no-no with fine leg inside the circle. Babar puts it away with a one-handed pull to the right of the fielder"
"wide yorker now, good response. Babar tries to steer it away through point but can't put bat to ball"
"ooh, nearly. Bangs it in short this time, angling into the batsman to cramp him for room. Uppercuts to the left of third man, and Rance, sprinting round quickly, can't quite reach the ball with his tumbling effort. Drops short of him and spins past him to the boundary"
"full now, whipped down to long-on"
"slower ball, and he strikes first ball. Saw Babar looking to make a bit of room and followed him with a full, slow offcutter. Looks to hit it down the ground, but he has to manufacture all the power himself. Difficult to do with an outfield as big as this, and Tim Southee sprints in from the long-on boundary and takes a good, low catch"
"back of a length on off stump, chopped down to backward point"
"short, angling down leg, helped away gratefully by Malik, who swivels and puts it away very fine, to the fine leg boundary"
"short again, outside off stump this time, and Malik jumps and slaps it away. Maybe a bit of a bottom-edge, but that helps the ball run away really fine and beat short third man easily"
"down the track now and Malik is... <b>dropped</b> by Glenn Phillips, running to his right from deep midwicket. De Grandhomme followed Malik with a full ball, forcing him to go leg-side, and Phillips put down a sitter - got both hands to it, at waist height"
"down the track again, clipped along the ground this time to deep midwicket"
"in the blockhole just outside off stump, stabbed away gently towards backward point"
"low full-toss outside off, and that's a gimme ball for Hafeez - the line gave him enough width to hit through the line, and just chip the ball over extra-cover, into the wide open spaces at that boundary"
"full outside off, Hafeez drags a drive to long-on with a lot of bottom hand"
"shortish slower ball wide outside off. Reaches out and chops it to the left of short third man, where Ferguson makes a good diving stop"
"Hafeez steps across his stumps even before Rance delivers, shaping for the fine scoop/sweep. Rance goes full and hits his front foot on the full"
"full again, and Malik lofts it down the ground, on the bounce to the right of long-on"
"oh, gorgeous timing, as is often the case with Hafeez. Steps out and CDG bowls it very full, but he clears his front leg and just meets the ball with a full face, hardly any follow-through, and easily clears mid-off"
"shorter now, heaved away to deep midwicket"
"slower bouncer, and it sticks in the pitch and takes ages to reach Malik. It bounces high and it's actually on its way down, towards Malik's head, when he swats it away past short fine leg"
"fuller now, another slower one, and Malik swings hard and hits it maybe squarer than he intended. Down the throat of deep square leg"
"Another offcutter, short, and this one spins down the leg side as Hafeez misses the pull"
"full, at Hafeez's pads, clipped to deep square leg"
"slower ball again, full and outside off. Asif looks to launch it back down the ground, but swings too early and misses"
"shot! That's brilliant from Hafeez. Shuffled across once more, looking for that scoop past short fine leg. Southee saw him move and bowled it full and wide. Ended up as a low full-toss, but he had to reach a long way across for it, and he still manages to use his wrists and flick it to the left of short fine leg"
"full again, outside off, driven to extra-cover and he picks up one to get to a well-crafted half-century"
"oh my. Asif shuffled a long way across, ended up inside-edging the wide yorker and sent it rolling to Seifert. Sets off for the single, and Hafeez would have been run-out had Seifert managed to roll it onto the stumps, but he missed by a decent margin"
"again looks for the short fine leg region, again Southee bowls a wide yorker, and he uses his wrists to whip it to deep square leg"
"and again, the wide yorker against the big, premeditated front-foot stride across. Clipped to deep midwicket, didn't really middle it"
"in the blockhole outside off, and all Asif can do is squeeze it out towards extra-cover. Pakistan finish on 166"
"length on leg stump, flicked to midwicket off the front foot"

short of a length and skidding into middle stump. Punched to long-off
"full at middle stump, hurriedly turned to midwicket off the inside half"
"<b>top of middle stump!</b> 140kph and through Munro's ungainly swipe. It's a length ball, there for a leg side hit, but it needs a straighter bat than that. Munro has looked to go over midwicket and missed comprehensively"
short of a length outside off and he mistimes a pull to find midwicket

"length on leg stump, dragged on the rise to deep square leg"
"length ball outside off, drilled on the up to extra cover"
<b>close to the stumps</b> as he gets into the off side and looks to sweep. It was full at middle stump. But he gets bat on it and finds short fine
length and just outside off. Mistimed cover drive into the covers
"<b>big appeal</b> for lbw, but that might be sliding down leg. He swings at this incoming length ball and is caught in front of leg stump on the knee roll"
"length ball fired down leg side, can't connect on it"
full and angled into the pads. Stays tall and uses the angle to flick it between fine leg and square leg
"full outside off, drilled past the bowler but can't beat mid-off to the right"
"short of a length just outside off, sliced into the point region"
"length ball on leg stump, looks to clip it over square leg. Gets an inside edge to short fine. It trickles through to that fielder...<b>who gets a direct hit.</b> De Grandhomme slides on his pad as he reaches back in and <b>he is caught on the line.</b> He's gone! Usman the fielder. He was running down instinctively and had to get back in the rush of the moment"

"short of a length outside off, off the inside edge as he looks to punch through cover"
"length on leg stump, flicked into the leg side"

"length ball on off stump, steps out and mistimes it as he tries to lift it over mid-off. Manages to clear the infield"
"length ball on leg stump, back and across and deep in the crease as a result. From there, he flicks aerially to bisect fine leg and deep square"

"short and wide outside off, cut straight to sweeper cover"
"short of a length just outside off, finds short third with the cut"

"short ball on off stump, gets back and down low as he looks to get power on this pull. Long-on cleans up to his right"
short of a length and hurrying him at off stump. Mistimed punch rolls back down the pitch
slow and at a length on off stump. Through the sweep early. It goes into the off side off the toe end
"glorious. Length ball outside off, doesn't step out but gets a lot of power on this drive. From the crease and drilled wide of deep cover"
"full and angled in at leg stump, inside edge to short fine as he looks to sweep"
"<b>clears deep midwicket!</b> Another top shot. He steps out and hopes for Imad's natural angle in, but this is lobbed slowly and is turning away outside off. But Williamson still manages to get under it and launches it high to clear the boundary"
"yorker length just outside off, driven to long-off"
"whoa, that's huuuuge! Down the track to Shadab's flighted ball pitching around off stump and turning away. Not quite to the pitch of it, but he still goes through with it and sends it sailing high into the night sky and over the sightscreen to bring up his fifty"
"flatter and straighter, clipped away through square leg"
"pow. Now Phillips joins in. Pretty full wide of off stump, the googly, and he uses the hitting room to power a flat hit back past the umpire's head"
"shortish, cut away to deep point"
"googly, turning towards middle stump and keeping slightly low. Goes back and whips it with the turn to long-on"
"flatter and shorter again, works this legbreak against the turn, from outside off, to long-on"
"Shot! Not that short, not that wide, and he doesn't make himself extra room or anything. Just lets it come on and times it perfectly, with a roll of the wrists on top of the cut, to easily beat third man to his right"
"shortish, angling in and looking to tuck up Williamson. Whipped off the hip towards deep square leg"
"back of a length, and the ball sneaks under Phillips' attempted whip/pull and hits the back thigh before ricocheting past the right hand of the diving Sarfraz behind the stumps. Bit of an lbw appeal, but it probably struck him outside the line"
"fuller now, angling into a fourth-stump line. Swipes hard with a flat bat and inside-edges it along the floor to Sarfraz, who tumbles to his left to stop the ball"
"back of a length on off stump, pulled away to deep square leg"
"shot! Fullish, angling in towards off stump, and Phillips clears his front leg and thumps this over the wide long-on boundary"
steps out a touch early and Shadab pulls his length back a touch. Waits and dabs towards backward point
"gone! Big boundaries make limited-overs cricket so much more interesting. They allowed Shadab to bowl another over after his previous, expensive one, and they allowed him to flight this ball enticingly outside off stump. Williamson takes it on, but he can't clear the man at long-on. Hits it straight to the fielder"
"floated across, pitching just outside off. Clipped away through midwicket"
"bowled him, Shadab's turning it on here. Flat legbreak pitching on off stump and turning marginally away. Looks to work it through midwicket, plays too much across it, and only manages to bottom-edge it into his stumps"
"nice flight just around off stump, presses forward and pushes into the covers, looking for one, but Shadab moves quickly in his follow-through to cut it off"
"tossed up wider, driven to sweeper cover"

"skips down the track again, to one floated across him and pitching outside off, clips it to long-on"
"full-toss, whipped away firmly with a lot of bottom hand, leaving long-on with a lot of work to do. Malik sprints to his right and stops it with some nifty footwork at the rope"
"length ball wide of off stump, flat-batted to the left of extra-cover"
"cleverly done. This has gone up to the third umpire. Saw Chapman stepping out - he left his crease too early, and fired it down the leg side. Swung hard, in desperation, and missed, and Sarfraz does the rest, though he takes a bit of time moving down the leg side to collect. Chapman was a long way down the pitch, and there was no way he was getting back in time"
"bowled him, this is stunning stuff from Pakistan's spinners. This is like the classic arm ball, which swings into the right-hander and skids off the track, imperilling anyone who deigns to play back to it. Tim Seifert goes back and across to cut, and he's taken by surprise by the direction and pace of that ball, and is late on the shot. Only manages to chop it onto his stumps with a bit of back pad along the way"
"full on leg stump, clipped towards deep midwicket, and oh my word, what are New Zealand doing here! Southee comes back for the second, Taylor sends him back, and Southee slips as he turns back towards the striker's end. Tries to dive back into the crease, but he's too late to beat the throw and Sarfraz's glovework. That's five wickets in eleven balls. Wow."
"short outside off, cut to point"
"tossed up wide of off stump, driven to sweeper cover"
"tossed up on middle and off, whipped to deep midwicket"
"full on off stump, stabbed to the right of point"
"is that a top edge? Sarfraz thinks so, and the umpire thinks so. Quickish outside off, more topspin than sidespin, and perhaps not enough room to cut. Taylor is one of the better cutters in the game, and he doesn't really need that much width, but on this occasion all he manages is a thick edge, which Sarfraz does very well to hold onto because it deviated quite sharply"
"length ball, clipped towards midwicket"
"wide of the crease, angles this one in towards off stump, pretty full. Clipped away through square leg, off the inside half of the bat"
"ooh, skiddy. Back of a length, angling in towards off stump. Looks to half-pull, half-flick, but mostly it's just hurried stabbing at the ball, because he's been beaten by pace off the pitch. Hits the back pad and rolls into the short third man region"
"full now, clipped to long-on"
"full, close to off stump, driven towards mid-off"
"back of a length, angling into the stumps, and Sodhi swipes it away and gets enough power on it to beat long-on sprinting hard to his right"
"and the birthday boy strikes! First T20I wicket for the debutant. Back of a length, slanting across the stumps, and Ferguson, making room and looking to guide it down to third man, only manages to edge it, and Sarfraz takes a good catch diving to his right"
"back of a length on middle stump, punched to the left of extra-cover"
"length ball slanted across the stumps, and he makes room and flat-bats it over extra-cover. Shot!"
"back of a length on off stump, and Sodhi eases it to sweeper cover off the back foot"
"bowled him, and Pakistan have wrapped up a 3-0 series win. Slower ball, fullish, with a bit of offcut taking it away from the right-hander and hitting off stump after Rance makes some room for the big hit down the ground but fails to make the requisite contact. Two wickets for the debutant Waqas Maqsood."
