Seems resigned to his fate. <strong>Ball-tracking shows it was going down leg!!! Da Silva was almost at the boundary rope and now has to turn around and come back with a sheepish grin on his face.

Huge appeal for caught behind denied. <strong>Brathwaite goes for the review of umpire Brathwaite's decision. </strong>Live it sounded like it was out. He played way away from his body and the sound couldn't have been anything but bat. Replays look like he played through the shot too early and the ball rolled off the back of the bat blade to Da Silva. Ultraedge is showing no spike and a gap when he plays the shot initially on the front of the bat face but a spike appears when the ball passes the back of the bat blade on the bowed portion. The third umpire is having some doubt because Dhananjaya's body is obscuring the bat from the side-on replay angle on the point/off side. And now it appears the spike is possibly happening when the bat is not near the ball. <strong>They've decided it is not out. </strong>"

<strong>oh my goodness! Lapse in concentration by Dhananjaya!</strong> Blackwood just fired this in very quick and flat full on middle and off stump. Innocuous delivery in the grand scheme of things but looks like De Silva was expecting just a gently flighted lollipop and is slow getting the bat down in defense as it turns sharply from fourth stump into middle/leg. Big appeal upheld by Joel Wilson. It was turning quite sharply but <b>De Silva doesn't even consider going for a review and replays indicate ball-tracking was turning it past leg stump! He'd have been saved had he opted for a review. Mickey Arthur is doing Mickey Arthur things on the Sri Lanka balconly. </b>
