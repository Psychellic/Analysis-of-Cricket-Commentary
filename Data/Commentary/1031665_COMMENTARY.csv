"fuller, at off stump, again a hint of swing at 80mph and defended to point"
"touch straighter, on middle, clipped to the left of mid-on"
"that's wild down the leg side, Buttler dives to collect it...swung very early from the hand"
"full and straight, pushed firmly to mid-off"

"shortish again, pushed off the back foot back to the bowler"

"more air on this one, floated up outside off, Lewis gets a stride forward and drives in the air over cover"
"quicker, outside off, driven to cover"
"and he leaves one alone! Outside off, he's looking for the wide but it's not given. Handy over from Root"
"full at off stump, defended carefully back to the bowler"

"low full toss, straight, clubbed down the ground to long-on...he's up and running"

"good response, a slower ball, straight and it's tapped to backward point"

"full at middle and leg, clipped to deep square"
"pulled just wide of midwicket, didn't get this out of the middle, Hales tries to flick it back running round the boundary...was he touching the rope at the same time? Good effort, but four"

"another slower ball, full toss outside off, Lewis flays it through the covers"
"short of a length at leg stump, 85mph, pulled to deep square leg"
"not quite six, inches short of the long-off boundary...drives through the line of a full delivery, easy pickings at the moment"
"he misses out here, outside leg stump, clipped the pad through to Buttler"

"he's short! Gayle is run out. A short-of-a-length slower ball dabbed into backward point, Roy collects, turns and throws towards the non-striker's end. Plunkett gathers and has time to get the ball back to the stumps as Gayle doesn't bother with a dive. His fun is over. Lazy from Gayle...he wasn't sure over the run, was watching the ball.

"full at leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
"he's not really middled that, but it's carried for six more...a lofted drive, clears long-off"

"shortish, at the body, Walton works it away into the leg side and takes a couple"
"length on off, Walton stays in the crease... and <b>hammers six over long-on!</b> That's some pwnage, a bit like his treatment of Kesrick Williams in the CPL (without the exaggerated note-taking celebration)"
"bit of width, guides down to third man on the back foot"
"dug in, following the batsman, <b>who scoops it to wide mid-on!</b> Two in the over for Plunkett, he cramped Samuels for room, who departs for a slightly underwhelming 10 off 13"

tossed up on the stumps and worked to the leg side
"flighted, gripping on off stump as Brathwaite <del>smashes another six into the Kolkata night</del> defends"

"goes for the yorker, a touch full but pretty effective as Nurse bottom edges a chop on the back foot"
"full and straight, clumps a drive down the ground, just a single on offer"
