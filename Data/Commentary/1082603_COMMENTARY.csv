"nicely bowled. Good length outside off, some movement. Nibbly away movement. Left alone"
"Raina has taken a stunner. Suresh Raina, you beauty. Last season, it was Dwayne Smith. This season, it is Praveen Kumar. Good length delivery comes back in, Rahane looks to get off the mark with a dab to third man but gets a thick outside edge. Flies to Raina, who is at wide slip. Flies to his left. He sticks out a left hand and clings on. He looks quite perplexed he held on, too"
can't bowl the same way to this man. Full and wide outside off but keeps on swinging. Wide
"spongy bounce. Good length outside off, pushed away to mid-off"

"a misfield. Full outside off, pushed away towards cover, who parries the ball and allows a run."
"full outside off, driven away to cover. McCullum fields"
"Raina again. Good length around off, flicked away through backward square leg but Raina dives to his right to save runs. At least two of them"
"enough of hitting along the ground. Hit it over. Full outside off, Smith walks across and flicks the ball over square leg with enviable, nonchalant ease."
"good length outside off, just a dab-slap to point. Beats the infield and races away. Sensational timing"
change in pace. The slower one outside off. Just inside the tramline. Left alone

"good length delivery outside off, pushed towards mid-off"
"legcutter, pushed towards extra cover, a quick run. The throw deflects of Tripathi's bat, but Tye saves the boundary."
"a low full toss, swinging away. Smith runs down and bunts one to mid-off for one"
"superb from Smith. Flat delivery outside off, Smith knew his area and then swatted the ball through midwicket. Saw that vacant area"
"flat outside off, chopped away towards point"

worked away through midwicket for one
another nice stroke. Gets to the pitch and flicks through midwicket for a single.
"another six. Tripathi runs down, gets a legcutter and then slaps the ball over midwicket. Hardly hit that. Sublime"

"full and straight, Tripathi gives himself room and lofts the ball in the gap through cover. That's Pune's 50. Sneaked up on me"
"full and straight, hit down to long-on"
"this is great batting. Full and straight, Smith picks his bat up, and then with one swift motion, lifts the ball straight past the bowler. Four more"
"four more. Drifts down leg, a low full toss, and flicked through backward square leg. Rubbish bowling, undone by the pressure created through the previous deliveries"
"fullish delivery on leg, pushed to mid-off. Good result for Tripathi"
"there is the slow dipping full toss, pushed to long-on."
"fullish delivery outside off, pushed away towards cover. An overthrow as midwicket isn't able to clean up at the bowler's end"
well bowled. Sees Tripathi coming and follows him. Stabbed into the pad
"not enough elevation. A slower delivery on middle and leg, the knuckle ball. Tripathi lifts the ball, but can't hit it over mid-off. Hits it to mid-off, where Finch takes a simple reverse-cupped catch. <strong>A wicket in his first over on IPL debut</strong>"
"good length outside off, defended properly to mid-off"

"<b>through the pull too early</b>. Yikes, he is writhing in pain. But it will only reduce with such body blows. Back of a length outside off, Smith misses a pull and is struck on the rib cage. Oh my. Whack. Take in some deep ones. The physio is out there"

"not good. Back of a length down leg, Stokes pulls comfortably over short fine leg. Easily done."

"short delivery outside off, Tiwary misses a swat. Wrong shot selection. Had to drag the pull from well outside off"
"confounds Stokes with a slower ball. That's Tye's specialty. Another knuckle ball on off and middle, Stokes misses a flick and the ball goes through between a big gap between bat and pad. Knocks into the off stump. An inside edge into the pad and then the stumps"
"back of a length outside off, Dhoni watches it go past"
"slower ball down leg, off the pad towards square leg"
"a floaty knuckle ball on leg, clipped to deep square leg. Wickets just stalling Pune again"

"flat and wide outside off, scythed to deep point for one."
sliced to the sweeper cover. This is some clever batting considering not much to come
"pushed away past short cover. As soon as he did, he knew there was two because McCullum had a lot of ground to cover from long-off"
gets to the pitch and dinks the ball into the leg side for a run
"flat on off, pushed towards cover where Jadeja gets across"
"Dhoni gone. Jadeja gets 'im. Was that skidding down leg? Maybe not. Full and straight from Jadeja, the ball skids on and beats Dhoni's attempted lofted stroke. Strikes him in front of leg, would have gone on to hit leg stump."
"flat and straight, blocked"
"lovely batting. Flat and wide, Ankit stays low and dabs the ball through short third man for four. Clever batting"
nudged away towards deep midwicket. Went deep in his crease

"superb batting. Fast, quick, outside off. Tiwary lets the ball come onto him before angling the bat to get the ball in front of point for four. Delectable"
"just short of deep square leg. Superb effort from Kishan. Slower ball and straight, Tiwary flicks towards deep midwicket. Kishan gets across, <strong>goes for the catch</strong> but the ball lands short. Picked up cleanly"
"good single. And they'll get an extra. Length on leg, Sharma wants to dab to third man. Cramped for room, he plays it towards silly point. Thampi gets across and misses the stumps at the bowler's end. out if he hit, an overthrow ensues"

"another slower ball, back of the hand. Tiwary picks it but can't get bat on his dab to third man"

"good adjustment. Flat and quick on off, the length dragged back. Ankit can just work one to point"
pushed away quietly towards point
"overpitched, a yorker on off. Hit down to long-on"
"finishes the over with six. Calculated batting. Fantastic execution. Planning is one thing, but being able to do this to one of the best in the world is something else. Flat outside off, Tiwary just lets his hands through the line and lofts the ball over long-off"

"beaten again by the slower ball. 109 kph, short outside off. Tiwary misses his pull"
clipped to deep backward square leg. Full and straight from Tye

"another slower ball outside off, slapped past cover for a couple. Placed that well."
looks to follow Ankit but drifts down leg for an extra
"slower ball, picked that early and boom. The slower variation sticks in the surface, sits up and Ankit slaps the ball over midwicket. Massive six. Great timing on that"
"shovelled into the gap at midwicket. Full and straight, on leg. Can't get underneath. Long-on and deep midwicket clean up"
"gets the yorker right this time, on leg, worked to square leg"
"hits the yorker again. Tiwary looks to play this through midwicket but the bat breaks into two. Tiwary comes back for the second and dives, knowing he won't have the full length of the bat if he needs it. Willow everywhere, much like cricket in the recent past"
"excellently bowled. Tiwary backs away, Praveen fires this full and wide."
"superb finish from Praveen. Another yorker on off, jammed back to the bowler"
"a superb catch from McCullum. Full on leg, Ankit gets underneath but gets more elevation than distance. Goes straight up, swirling around but McCullum gets underneath and takes a quality catch at long-on."
"another wicket. Tye on a hat-trick now. Slower ball on middle and leg, Tiwary flicks. Can't quite get enough power behind that because of the slower ball. Kishan takes a good catch near the backward square leg  boundary."
"another hat-trick. <strong>Two hat-tricks in one day. </strong>The first five-for of this IPL. Tye is on a roll. Gets the yorker right, and Thakur misses a flick. The ball sneaks through and hits leg and middle stump. Tye and the Lions go berserk."
"fullish on off, inside-edged towards square leg for one."
"good length outside off, worked away towards deep point for one."
"oh no. Jadeja has dropped a clanger. Shortish delivery on off, pulled to deep midwicket where Jadeja gets across and the ball bursts through. Concedes an extra couple of runs."
goes for a slog straightaway. Does not make very good contact. Gets it off the inside part of the bat and away through square leg
"short of a length, punched past the bowler for one"
"gives it a lot of air outside off, too full to do anything, squeezed out down to long-off"
"back of a length, outside off, stands tall and punches it to the right of the bowler who gets down to his right and fields it"
"in the slog and slogged away. That was a mighty blow. On a length, outside off, does not try to get too close to it to give himself enough room and absolutely shovels it over long-on"
"back-to-back boundaries to end the over. Short, width on offer outside off, Smith hangs back and crashes it through covers"
"McCullum skips down the track and it is back of a length and angling in to him, stabs it to the off side"
"hurries him with pace. On a length and angling into him at 149.3kph, McCullum tries to flick off the pads but gets hit on them"
"that has been thumped. This one was slower, a lot slower, just 121 clicks. Shortish, outside off, McCullum stays leg side of it, opens up his shoulders and whacks it over long-off"
"fuller length, drilled hard past the bowler and down to mid-off for one"
"good length, outside off, 144kph, Smith blocks into the off side with bat close to pad"

"comes down the track and the bowler drags the length back, McCullum slaps it out to sweeper cover"
"short of a length, outside off, stays in the crease and flays it hard to point who gets down to his left in time to cut it off"
"beats him with pace. Good length ball, comes on straight at 143 kph. Smith tries to flick across the line and wears it on the pad, having been beaten by pace"
errs in length this time. Drops it short and McCullum pulls it between midwicket and long-on. Hit extremely hard
"<b>dropped</b>. But hit extremely hard. To full and McCullum drills it hard back to the bowler, does so uppishly and Thakur tries to get his hands around it but the ball does not stick on. That must have surely stung"
"slower full ball outside off to end the over. McCullum moves nowhere towards it, stays rooted and wildly swings and misses"
"drifting on the pads, clipped away to deep midwicket where Imran Tahir tidies up"
"too full and angling in, outside leg, McCullum has backed away a long way and pushes it out to long-off"
"short, angling in, bounce is too steep and called a wide"
"good length, angling in on off, punched crisply back to the bowler"
"full, outside off, lots of pace from Ferguson, fires it at 147 kph but needed to get it closer to the stumps. Offers up too much width and Smith goes at it with hard hands. Flashes and gets a thick outside edge that runs down to square third man"
"well-bowled. Searing yorker at 151, on leg stump, Smith jams the bat down and keeps it out"
"full, that is the downside of bowling at that pace. This one comes on the pads at 149 and all the batsman has to do is make contact with the ball. Clipped off the pads through the region between deep midwicket and wide long-on"
"back of a length, angling in, McCullum backs away and carves it out with a flat bat to backward point"
"good length, outside off, stays leg side of it to give himself enough room and stabs it to backward point"
"slower full ball outside off, just 114 kph, Smith does not pick it,swings hard looking to go big over the leg side, plays the shot too early"
"short, on the stumps, ducked under"
"fullish length, just outside off, stays in the crease and pushes it out into the off side for a quick single"
"too full, outside off, a yorker, McCullum jams the bat down and has to reach out for it. Gets it off the outer part of the bat to the backward point region"
"starts off with a full toss, Smith pushes it down to long-on. Didn't try to hit it too hard"
"pitched up, outside off, can't be bowling there. Too full to do anything and lots of room for the batsman. McCullum launches it straight down the ground"
"comes down the track and takes it on the full, drives hard to the right of the mid-off fielder, game himself room as he was charging down and gets it wide of the fielder at mid-off running to his left"
pushed back to the bowler
that doesn't matter. Mid-off dropped back but he goes over mid-on. Comes down the track and swats this after getting to the pitch of this delivery
"full toss, pushed back in the direction of the bowler"
"short of a length, width on offer outside off, slapped hard off the backfoot through backward point and Imran Tahir does superbly to run across to his left and field in front of the boundary"
"back of a length, punched to covers"
gets a little bit of turn this time and Smith defends in front of the pads
"splits the field with laser-guided precision. Shortish and some width on offer as it spins away, Smith slaps and finds the gap between point and backward point. It is packed there but that does not matter"
can't be bowling this short to either of these batsmen. Sitting up nicely and Smith has all the time to swivel around with the pull to deep midwicket
swings wildly outside off and gets beaten. Could have lost his off-stump there
"spinning away outside off and McCullum gets down to sweep, has to fetch that from outside off but plays it hard and between long-on and deep midwicket"
"similar shot, this time he has to fetch it from even more outside off. Bowled wider and spinning away but McCullum reaches out and cracks it through the same region. Beats the two fielders converging"
"and now he goes down the track. This kind of hitting can throw off the best of bowlers. skips down the track, meets the pitch and lofts it straight down the ground for the cleanest of sixes"
tucked off the pads to midwicket
"oh, goodness. How's that for timing. Did not try to hit it too hard. Full, on middle and leg, pushed off the front foot past the right of the bowler. String bottom hard gives him the late power he is looking for. Beats long-on"
"length ball, picks the length early and gets down to powerfully sweep. Man there at deep midwicket and it goes on the bounce straight to him"
"shortish, on the stumps, Smith arches back and lets it go"
"full, on the pads, drilled hard to wide long-on"
"fullish length, outside off, slower, just 117kph, McCullum swipes across the line but is through with the shot early"
"sprays it down the leg side, McCullum tries to flick what should have been a full toss and misses"
"not great contact but fortunately for McCullum it drops short of the two fielders converging from long-off and long-in. Too full, outside off, McCullum has to reach out for it and lofts it off the bottom part of the bat"
"seems like a slower ball. Drops it short, outside off. Smith reaches out and tries to flay it over with an uppercut. Goes too hard at it and makes good contact but sends it down the throat of third man who takes it comfortably"
closes the face of his bat early and gets a leading edge that goes towards the bowler
"angling into the pads, McCullum misses the flick and gets hit on the pad. Heading down leg"
is that an edge? Optimistic appeal by the keeper. On a length and angling in. McCullum misses the flick and the ball goes to the keeper. Must have brushed the pad
tries to get the front leg out of the way but Ferguson follows the batsman with a fuller ball and McCullum gets an inside edge to backward square leg
"short of a length, angled across outside off, Raina stays in the crease and drops it to the right of covers for a quick single"
"comes charging down the track and the bowler does well to take this away from the batsman. McCullum is forced to reach out and misses, ball misses off stump but not by much"
"short of a length, angling in, McCullum was cramped for room and makes no contact on the cut"
"short, Raina crunches a pull but straight to midwicket"
"short of a length, tucked off the pads to deep backward square leg for one"
"oh, what an effort at the third man boundary. That was an absolutely stunning piece of fielding by Chahar. Runs across to his left from third man and leaps up in the air just in front of the boundary. Takes the catch and sees that he is nearly crossed the boundary. Throws it back and lands on his two feet. Coming to the delivery, McCullum moves across and gets down to scoop this fullish length ball. Makes good contact and that seemed like six"
runs it down to third man
uses the pace on this delivery and runs it down to third man for one
"walks across and swipes hard, gets an inside edge to midwicket"
nicely done. Great bowling. McCullum has sort of thrown it away here. Comes down the track in a pre-meditated move and the bowler drags the length back. Gets it to spin away from McCullum who tries to slap it away. Does not make contact and the wicketkeeper does the rest
"full, outside off, comes forward and pushes it out to sweeper cover"
"googly, shortish and spinning away from Raina, cuts it square of the wicket for a brace"
"full, Raina gets down to sweep and gets it away to deep square leg on the bounce"
lovely bit of bowling. Draws Karthik forward with a length ball and gets it to spin past the outside edge. Dhoni has the bails off in the blink of an eye. He had just marginally dragged the foot forward but has slid it back in
short of a length and gets it away off the outside part of the bat to the off side
comes forward for the turn and the ball slides in and takes the inside edge towards square leg
"pushed across full, on off, driven out"
"fuller, outside off, Raina flicks across the line between mid-on and midwicket. Good call to come back for a quick second"
"short of a length, tucked off the pads through midwicket"
"googly, sends back Karthik. Not picked by the batsman. Shortish and Karthik shapes up for a cut. Pitching outside off and coming in, Karthik chops it on"
"sliding in on middle and leg, clipped away to midwicket"
"short of a length and spinning away, waits for it before whipping it away towards mid-on"
tries to back away and slap it away but he fires it quick and gets beaten
"sliding on leg, gets down on one knee, moves towards off and then scoops it over the keeper and through the fine leg region"
"shortish and spinning away, reaches out and stabs it to backward point"
"back of a length and turning away, punched off the backfoot to sweeper cover"
that's a superb shot. Raina breaks the shackles with a six over long-on. Comes down the track to meet the pitch of this one and lofts it clean
"fullish, outside off, tries to push it through the off side and gets beaten"
"short, gets big on him, hurriedly pulls it away to deep square leg"
"short of a length, does not time the pull too well to midwicket"
"full, angling in outside off, lofted over the in-field. Gets it between sweeper cover and long-off and comfortably beats the latter running to his right"
gets down to slog this one away but it is sprayed down the leg side and he misses
"back of a length, outside off, slapped off the backfoot and to backward point"
"short of a length, outside off, punched uppishly and just how well has he played that. Superb timing and even better placement. Beats sweeper cover running to his left"
"short and spinning away, stabs it to point"
"on a length, waits for it to turn and knocks it to covers"
hit extremely hard and beats long-off running to his left.  Finch uses the depth of the crease and shifts back before carving it through extra cover. Shovels it hard and no chance for the fielder
punched to long-on off the backfoot
"look at that for placement. Pitched up outside off, gets a good stride out to meet the pitch of the ball and lofts it over extra cover. Splits sweeper and long-off"
"and he overcompensates with the line. Tries to not give him any room but Raina gets down and sweeps through deep backward square leg, beats the man in the deep to his left"
"short and wide, jumps up to ride the bounce and swats it away to sweeper cover for one"
"full, wide, driven superbly off the front foot to the left of sweeper for a couple"
"low full toss outside off, flicked out to deep midwicket"
"slower short ball, good change in pace, Finch picks it, waits for it and watchfully pulls it away to deep midwicket"
"short of a length at 119kph, knocked back to the bowler"
"short ball, goes over leg stump, ducked under"
"short, angling down leg, Finch tries to pull and misses"
"<b>dropped</b>. Imran Tahir with a shoddy effort at deep backward square leg. Fullish length, angling in, flicked off the pads uppishly and Tahir is slightly late in reacting to it. Puts it down and to his horror, watches the ball go past the boundary"
"full, pushed to mid-on for a single"
"full, outside off, pushed down to mid-off for a single"
"too full, drilled hard past midwicket who runs to his left but fails to get down completely"
"that's a biggie. Powerful wrists. Angling in at pace, 145 kph, on the pads and Finch flicks it off the pads, a long way into the stands over deep square leg"
and this time he targets long-on. Uses the depth of the crease and shifts back in the crease. Lofted off the pads with a straight bat and he pummels it clean and straight over the boundary. Seals the game with back-to-back sixes.
