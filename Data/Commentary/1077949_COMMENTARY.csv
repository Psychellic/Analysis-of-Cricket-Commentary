"length ball on middle, Kamran has deposited that deep into the stands at deep midwicket. Imperious pull, connected cleanly. Couldn't have asked for a better start upon return, could he?"
"punched well, but an excellent stop by Bishoo at cover point, throwing full-length to his left and effecting a one-handed stop"
"<b> dropped. </b> Ashley Nurse puts down a rather difficult chance. This flew off the edge, that he got his hand on it was because of his height. He instinctively went full stretch with his right hand, and could only manage to stop it. Those kind of catches stick sometimes, not today though. Full marks for the effort"

"good length, angling in, misses the ball as he tries to nudge it into the leg side. Height perhaps a factor as he is struck on the pad. Shehzad had moved across and was looking to play into the leg side. Given a leg bye, so definitely no bat. Might have just clipped leg stump"

As his gloves make contact with the bails, the bat is on the crease but he seems to have just dragged it over the line as the time the bails come off. This is extremely close, but seems like Babar may have sneaked in. Not out it is. Maybe Hope should have tried to throw the ball rather than reaching out to the stumps with ball in gloves"

"full and tailing away from middle, squeezed to the off side"

"squeezed into the gap at deep point. They hare back for the second. <b> Scenes of unadulterated joy at Providence. </b> Tremendous moment for the squad, the coach. Everyone in the balcony ran down the stairs and onto the pitch to hug Mohammed. What a knock this has beem"
