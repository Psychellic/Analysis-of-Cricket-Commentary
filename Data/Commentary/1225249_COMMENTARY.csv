"full, angling into off stump. Jams his bat down on the ball and it squeaks away through square leg off the inside half"
"the line to start, though, is wide outside off, and full. Left alone"
"once again, full and very wide. Left alone"
"once again, wide outside off, though the length is not quite as full. Went wider on the crease, and angled it in slightly, but again it's far too wide to play at"
"now he does make him play, with a full one swerving in towards off stump. Blocks it into the on side, and they think of running one, but John Campbell swoops quickly to his left at midwicket to deter them"
"big appeal, slanting in from wide of the crease, and it's given! No review from Sibley either, and Kemar Roach has struck in the first over of this Test match. Lovely delivery, angling into the stumps, hitting a good length, and straightening just a touch maybe. Sibley defends after shuffling across his stumps, not having gotten any sort of stride in at all. He faces up with his shoulders open, and perhaps as a result his attempted defensive push slices across the line of the ball, which beats his outside edge and thuds into his pads. Plumb as plumb can be."
"back of a length, angling into the stumps, tucked off his hip to short leg"
"length ball, fairly wide, left alone"
"fullish, angling into the pads, clipped to Brooks, who's deep enough at short leg to stop this with his shin pads"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"Gabriel's taking a little bit of time to get his radar warmed up. This one's full and slung down the leg side, well away from the attempted flick"
"short, wide, stops on the batsman a little and he slaps it away through cover"
"in the blockhole, angling in towards off stump. Jams his bat down to keep it out"
"overpitched outside off, driven sweetly, but straight to the man at short extra-cover. No one at mid-off"
"too full again, angling into off stump. Clipped away through midwicket"
"full, very wide, swings away into an even wider line. Left alone"
lovely delivery. Angling into the fourth-stump channel and veering away late. Burns keeps a wary eye on the ball and does well to leave it
"a touch fuller, a touch closer to the batsman, not as much away swing. Defended into the off side. Played that nice and late"
"full, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"similar line, a touch fuller still. Root leaves again"
"back of a length, nips in a little bit but not enough to make Root worry about his off stump. Jumps back and across and shoulders arms again"
"beauty. Having seamed one in, he gets this one to hold its line on a line not far outside off stump. Root has to play, and it zips past his outside edge"
"big shout for lbw, but Root has got some sort of stride in, and may have been struck outside the line of off stump. West Indies <b>have reviewed</b>, though... it was a nice fullish length, angling in from wide of the crease and nipping in just a touch off the pitch. Root's bat was stuck behind his pad as he looked to defend, but the impact, as suspected, is outside the line. Not by much, but quite clearly outside"
"back of a length, veering into middle and leg. Tucked away to fine leg, or may have just been thigh pad, as the umpire indicates"
"lovely, lovely delivery. Gabriel went past Root's edge with a similar ball in the previous over. This one was fuller, and delivered from wider of the crease. Straightened sharply, and Root does well to ensure his bat remains close to his pad and doesn't go feeling for the ball"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"once again seams away from Root, but this time the initial line is wider, and he doesn't really play at it, just withdraws his bat away from the line"
"full, he's looking for the yorker, but ends up slanting it a fair way down leg"
"nicely bowled. Angling in, hits a fullish length and gets it to straighten a little towards off stump. Gets forward, head right over the ball, and allows the ball to hit his bat and run away gently into the leg side"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"first bouncer of the day, from round the wicket to Burns. He's kind of mid-shuffle as it arrives, but it's short enough for him to see it early and evade it with a half-crouch"
"nicely bowled. Angling into off stump and straightening a touch, fractionally short of a length. Defended off the back foot into the covers"
"back of a length, this one nips the other way and slips down the leg side, forcing Dowrich into a diving save. The initial line wasn't bad, but the wide-of-the-crease angle and that bit of seam movement took it down the leg side"
"length ball on off stump, once again straightening slightly off the seam. Burns looks to work it leg side, though not too forcefully, and the leading edge rolls along the ground towards gully"
"back of a length, angling into the fourth-stump channel. Worked to square leg"
"shortish, down the leg side, and Burns simply steps across and lets it fly away for four byes, past the right glove of a desperately diving Dowrich"
"beauty to start. Seam movement and bounce from the fifth-stump channel, after bringing Root forward. Zips past his otuside edge"
"a little fuller outside off, left alone"
"length ball, starts tight on off stump and curls away just a touch, late. Defended with soft hands to gully"
"length ball straightens towards off stump. Defends with head right on top of the ball, into the covers"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"fullish, angling in towards off stump and getting that late away shape again. Defended with soft hands into the point region"
"length ball wide of off stump, left alone"

"angled into the stumps from round the wicket, tucked away through square leg"
"back of a length, straightens from just outside off. Left alone"
"gets closer to off stump now, similar length. Burns plays nice and late in defence and the ball drops by his feet"

"length ball slanting across to off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended towards gully"
"length ball on off stump, defended to short square leg"
"length ball, top of off, defended into the covers. This one ended up around the top of off after slanting across the left-hander. The previous ball ended up there after straightening off the seam. This is top-class, probing bowling"
"length ball close to off stump, defended into the gully region"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked back to Holder"
"back of a length outside off, slows down off the pitch. Wanted to punch through the off side, ends up playing it back to the bowler off the inside edge"
length ball nipping in towards off stump. Stays in his crease and blocks it back towards the bowler
"shortish, jags in off the pitch towards Root's hip. Tucked away into the square leg region, drops his bottom hand while playing it"
"the batsman didn't have much clue of what happened there. Brought him forward with his length, and then got it to nip back in slightly. Hung his bat out in front of his body in defence, and the ball runs off the inside edge towards fine leg"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, fairly wide of off, left alone. Seemed to keep slightly low"
"fullish, lets it come on and defends with soft hands towards point"

"superb. Back of a length, straightens in the fifth-stump channel to beat Root's defensive prod"
"a little shorter, lots of bounce, left alone"
"wide-ish outswinger, left alone"
"nicely done. Dangles up the full, drive-me outswinger outside off. Root goes hard at it, and he's lucky to miss it and not edge it"
"length ball, curves away slightly outside off, left alone"
"full this time, and Burns leans into a good-looking drive through the vacant square cover region. Not a huge stride forward, but he gets his head over the ball"
"length ball straightens towards off stump, defended towards mid-on"
"back of a length on off stump, defended with soft hands, close to his body"
"length ball straightening towards off stump, defended towards midwicket"
"floaty, low full-toss wide of off. Burns is taken by surprise, and reaches for it a little while driving. Ends up toe-ending it towards mid-off"
"full on fourth stump, left alone"
"length ball, Root looks to tuck into the leg side and is <strong>struck on the pad</strong>... relatively loud appeal from West Indies, but always sliding down and possibly too high, as well. They decide against the review"

"good bounce from a length, Burns plays it late in defence. 53mph"
"decent turn but too short, slashed hard to point on the bounce"

"<strong>sharp turn</strong>, flies some way past Burns' outside edge as he presses forward"
"banged in outside off, Root sways inside the line"

"decent turn from a length, strikes Root on the pad as he looks to work to leg but a strangled appeal from slip is the only shout. Would have gone down leg"
"short and wide, from very wide on the crease. Punched out into the covers on the back foot. <strong>80mph/129kph</strong> to start, pretty gentle"
"length outside off, times the on-drive sweetly but Roach flings himself to his right to cut it off. Great fielding, something that we haven't seen enough of from WI in this series"

"banged in on a hard length, clipped towards square leg for a sharp single, the throw comes in but is wide of the stumps and they'll steal an overthrow, too"

"good turn, Burns is forward to defend"
"scuttles down the wicket late, working it straight back to the bowler"
"<strong>got 'im, surely! West Indies are celebrating, it looks like a run-out to me</strong>. Burns got back to steer towards third man, Root wanted a quick single that wasn't on, Chase threw at the keeper's end, and his throw just flicked the bail out of its groove. Root would have been safe if it hadn't been a direct hit, but Chase got round brilliantly and Root has to go!"
"length ball, good bounce as Stokes defends on the back foot"
"goes deep in the crease to a full ball, steering towards long leg for one"
"length ball, a touch short as Burns jumps back to <strong>carve through the off side</strong> for four"
"wide on the crease, fullish down the leg side, and late movement wrong-foots Dowrich. It wobbles cruelly to his left as he shuffles across, and his half-stop won't prevent the boundary"
"banged in short, miles down the leg side as Stokes leaves alone"
hooping outswinger which Stokes leaves alone. Good diving take from Dowrich this time. Gabriel's pace up at 87mph/140kph
"edged, and <strong>just short of third slip</strong>. Pushed across Stokes , arriving on a fifth-stump line. It flew to Campbell at third slip, who <em>might </em>have got there with a dive forward but it only reached his outstretched left hand on the half-volley"
tucked off the pads into the leg side

"short ball at the right shoulder, ducks under it"
"short again, ducks underneath it"

"length on the pads, tucked down to long leg to keep the strike for the first ball of the afternoon"
"back of a length, slanting away from the left-hander and providing plenty of width. Jabs it away and finds the gap to the right of the diving backward point fielder. Confident start to the session for Burns"
"full, a little floaty, on off stump. Punched to mid-off"
"ooh, lovely delivery. Full again, similar line to the previous ball, but it seems to grip and move away from Burns like an offbreak as he pushes at it with hard hands. Thick edge, but falls well short of gully"

"nice bowling, this. Having slanted the previous two balls into the stumps, he bowls another full one but this one's outside off stump. Goes hard at the drive and the ball passes the outside edge"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"

"now the blockhole ball on off stump, gets his front foot out of the way and jams down to defend. Excellent use of angles right through the over"
"after that over of round the wicket, Holder floats a fullsh length ball across the left-hander, pitching on off stump and slanting away. So many different angles to contend with. Left alone"
"back of a length on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"back of a length, no difficulty leaving this one because it's veering away towards the slips, and Dowrich has to fall across to collect it"

"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"length ball on off stump, defended to midwicket"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, a tiny bit of outswing. Burns allows it to pass"
"full, angling into off stump, punched firmly back to the bowler"
"too full on this occasion, fairly wide of off. Burns drives with an open face through point"
"ooh, lovely delivery. Roach really knows what he's trying to do here. Having drawn his front leg across to drive, he slips in a quick, stump-to-stump ball, and Burns pulls his pad away from the line in a hurry to defend it"
"there's the bouncer, and Burns hurriedly gets under it"
"good finish to the over, asks Burns if he wants to try another drive with a wide-ish length ball. Some swing again, and Burns leaves it well alone"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"fullish, close to off stump. Stokes jabs it away through the covers. Didn't get his front foot across at all, just played it with his hands"
"shortish on off stump, doesn't quite come on for the full-blooded pull, and he adjusts to help it along the floor to deep square leg"
"short, gets up to chest height this time, and Burns swivels through a pull through the square leg region. Not the quickest of outfields, this one"
"full outside off, gets down low for the drive and short extra-cover half-stops it with a dive to his left"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"

"length ball skidding on towards off stump, defended from the crease into the covers"
"short ball attacking Stokes' ribs, gets behind it and defends into the on side. Not a lot of pace off the pitch"
"not a lot of pace off the pitch? Roach follows up with the Andy Roberts quicker bouncer. Hurries Stokes into a hook, and he misses and the ball pings off the top of his helmet and loops up to the keeper. Half-appeal for a caught-behind, but they knew there was no bat or glove in it. The physio runs out to check on Stokes, who seems okay at first glance"
"another short ball, gets up to around shoulder height, and Stokes gets right on top of the bounce and hooks it away between deep square leg and fine leg. Super shot"
"length ball angling into off stump, gets forward and defends with his head over the ball"
"length ball, not too far outside off stump, good leave"
"what a delivery, and what a spell this has been from Roach. Most of the swing he's derived in these last few overs has been away from the left-hander, and he'd just seen Stokes leave one not too far outside off. Then he produces the perfect inswinger, out of the blue, and Stokes leaves a big hole in his forward defence for the ball to burst through. Stunning. Replays suggest it's seam movement rather than swing, and that's even harder to deal with"
"nicely tossed up on off stump, gets forward and defends towards short leg"
"on a length and outside off, defends it off the front foot to leg side"
"length ball outside off, gets forward and blocks to cover"

"full, not quite driving length, close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"length ball, fairly wide of off, left alone"

"nice length, spins in towards off stump, not much of a stride forward to defend"
"a bit more air on this, and Pope steps out of his crease to get to the pitch and defend"
"flatter, spinning in towards off stump, stays back and defends with soft hands"
"goes on the back foot once more, gets across to off stump, and defends right under his eyes"
now he steps out and doesn't quite get to the pitch of this one flighted outside off stump. Blocked into the on side
"shot! Flatter, a little wider outside off, and he steps right back to late-cut to the left of backward point"
"short, and he hurries Pope into a hook now. The ball keeps following him, and hits him on the helmet. the physio comes running out again for a preliminary check on Pope. He looks okay, though, seems to be having a laugh at something"

"length ball angling into off stump, clipped to the right of deep square leg"

"goes wide of the crease, digs it in short, and  Burns steps across, tucks it off his hip through backward square leg, and moves to a hard-earned fifty. Well played"

"skips down the pitch, driving to Gabriel at mid-off this time for a quick single"
lunges forward in defence out to Holder at silly mid-on
"variation from Cornwall, who drops short and gets one to turn into the left-hander. Burns punches away off the back foot. Looked like a legbreak to me"
"clipped off the pads, Blackwood flies round to his right to stop the two in the deep"

"hard length, angling in, Buttler defends with soft hands and continues to dig his trench"

"oh no. Dowrich has had a difficult day behind the stumps, and now he fumbles one. Hits the edge of his glove and runs away for byes after Pope leaves a wide-ish length ball. Might be some late swing as it approached him"

"ooh, that was so nearly an outstanding catch from Chase. An awkward short ball that only got up to stomach height, and Pope is caught between pulling and working it off his hip. Ends up playing a half-half shot, which balloons over midwicket off the top edge, and Chase, running back towards the boundary, throws himself at the descending ball and can't quite reach it"

Was on the back foot against one that nipped back in sharply from just outside off. Was looking to punch down the ground with a straight bat, and it went past his inside edge and hit him just above the knee roll. Clipping the top of the bails, says Hawkeye, so Pope will bat on and West Indies will retain their review."

"edged, <strong>put down by Cornwall at slip!</strong> He got plenty of praise for his slip-catching yesterday but this was a sitter.

"speared down the leg side, good take by Dowrich"
"nips in off the seam from outside off, inside-edged down to fine leg. Bess was on another planet at the non-striker's end, but eventually woke up in time to get through for a single. <strong>Another front-foot no-ball</strong>, and it looked like Bess was speaking to the umpire about that"
"width outside off, Bess <strong>cuts uppishly</strong> through backward point for four! Not out of the middle, but more than enough on it for it to race away"

"edged, and <strong>Holder takes it at slip again!</strong> West Indies are <strong><em>flying </em></strong>this morning with the second new ball.

"lovely shape on the inswinger, Bess is slightly squared up as he presses forward, and accepts the single off a leading edge into the covers"

"over the wicket again to the right-hander, sliding past the pads"
"up on the toes, tucked off the hip to the leg side"
"a teasing line, shaping across the left-hander, arms gangling like Courtney Walsh. A regulation snick, scuffs the edge and <strong>flies clean through the gap in the cordon!</strong>"
banged onto a good length outside off once more. This time Broad pulls his bat inside the line. He's digging in for the long haul now!
"up on the toes, <B>walloped through third man!</B> Once again, Broad latches onto the back-of-a-length delivery, that's the benefit of expecting the short ball every time. This one is wide, and so he has a wipe!"
"<B>pelted high over extra cover!</B> This is classic post-nose-swish Broad! He's still got the eye, and the semblance of a technique. And if the ball is in his slot, as this one was - short and wide outside off - it will travel!"
"out comes the 'not-the-face!' pull! Ducking into a swat off his brow, like a mirror-image of Botham on this very ground in 1981. But instead of clearing the man at backward square, it trickles to him for a single"
"squirted into the gully off the back foot, a fine diving grab cuts off the runs"
"anchored on the back foot again, a wild heave across the line, and a decent enough connection to mid-on"
"slower ball, very full length outside off. Broad reaches for it, but his legs are so far outside leg, he'd need a fishing rod to reach that"
"a windy wipe, across the line, can't connect with the outswinger. But if he had, it would have been picked up in Macclesfield"
"pressed down the ground, to long-off. Just a little bit of head-scratching for West Indies now. They've still had a fine morning, but this is taking the gloss off"
"very full and wide once again, a toe-ended connection back to the bowler"
"<B>blatted through the line!</B> Shades of Graham Gooch now (sort of, in a mirror etc) ... heavy footwork, thumping bat, clumped to the edge of the rope where Roston Chase does well, in the end, to drag it back with one hand"
"back of a length, starting leg, shaping to off, Broad responds with a measured push to the man at short cover"
"<B>a humungous spiralling top-edge!</B> Broad pirouettes twice in his followthrough, as Holder's short ball sails high, high over the vacant fine leg and away for more runs!"
"<B>clear the dog and tonk it!</B> Too full from Holder, in Broad's arc, and pounded with power and timing back past the non-plussed bowler!"
"fuller still. Broad is on the back foot again, and blocks with solidity back to the bowler"
"attempted yorker, comes out as a slow, loopy full toss, patted back past Holder's outstretched hand in his followthrough"
firmly pressed back to the bowler. Bess provides the two veg option to Broad's meat
"patted off the pads, to square leg. Broad trots into the 40s!"
a probing line but Bess won't be drawn
"outside off, left alone with circumspection"
"squeezed with an open face, into the off side"
jabbed off the back foot to rotate the strike
"round the wicket, sliding past Broad's pads. A quieter over there, which will suit the Windies for now"
it's a different game with Bess on strike. Solid and dependable in defence
"a touch shorter, jabbed with high hands into the cordon"
"full and gentle, on a length outside off, dry as dry can be. Short cover gathers a compact drive"
"pushed back onto the stumps, Bess squeezes the single to leg, and scampers through"
"<B>flogged off the back foot, clean through the covers!</B> There's the Garry Sobers drive I was waiting for! He's playing all the classics now! It'll be Stairway to Heaven before we know it"

"nudged behind point, there's the single to keep things ticking. Broad has one ball to face this over"

"zipping through outside off, Bess has a flirt as it goes past but doesn't connect"
"good leave! Just back of a length, shaping in, probably passing the top of off in the end"
"tucked off the legs, to midwicket, for another jogged single"
"thumped into the covers, off the back foot"
"<B>short, honked over backward square for Broad's fifty!</B> There's a man back for that shot, but he can't get close. That's a 33-ball fifty, <B>the joint third-fastest in England history!</B>"
tucks the single to keep the strike
"on the back foot, and tapped into the covers"
"stretching forward this time, thumps the pad but missing leg"
"<B>swept, and clean through the man at short backward square!</B> The ball rattles to the rope, and Broad marches onwards!"
"hustled out to the leg side again, Broad clocks it is Gabriel coming round the rope to gather, and rushes back for the second"
"leaning into the covers, pushed into the gap, and his innings rattles onwards"
"head over the ball to defend, Bess does the needful once more. And that's another over ticked up"
"tossed up, but Broad is seeing it like a comet now, nimble footwork to the pitch of the ball, and a compact drive to the edge of the cover boundary. Flawless!"
"on the front foot once more, solidly pressed into the off side"
"cracked firmly to the cover sweeper, Broad is settling nicely into his role now. Runs on the board, and no prospect of getting his nose rearranged with these bowlers against him. Hmmm ..."
"advancing to the pitch, clipped off the legs, another misfield at midwicket allows an easy single"
"outside off, signs of turn, Broad waits with a raised bat, full of intent, and slams the cut off the back foot for another single"
coolly milked off the legs for another single. This is rattling England's way now ...
tapped to the on-side

head over the ball in defence. A more solid finish to a slightly sketchy over
"lots of air from round the wicket, dipping on the crease-line, blocked"
"low full toss, <B>Broad has another wipe, but it's straight to deep midwicket!</B> He connected superbly, but almost too well given the bear-trap that had been set in the outfield. The end of a rollicking, momentum-changing knock"

"nudged off the pads, no way through there"
"round the wicket, tailing into the stumps, Anderson responds with a flat-footed back-foot waft"
"a hint of swing, but straight into the pads, and Anderson clips that sweetly past square leg. A long chase, and a successful one, limits the damage to three"
"firm in defence, on the back foot. Solid block"
"flashed out to the leg side, Holder probes the blockhole with a fuller ball, but Bess's swing through the line is timed well enough"
"<B>edged and straight into Cornwall's bread-basket!</B> A firm drive, off the back foot, feet stuck as Holder unleashed a subtle outswinger, straight to first slip, and well, that was a lively session!"

"slightly full of a length, tailing in, and Brathwaite clips to midwicket to get West Indies up and running"

"fullish outside off, wide enough to leave alone with a Smithian swish"
"outswinger on a length, inside-edged into the leg side looking to punch defensively towards cover"
"edged, and <strong>gobbled up at slip by Root!</strong> Early wicket, and it's Brathwaite, who has been by some way the most reliable of West Indies' top three to date in this series. Good length ball which might have clipped the top of off stump. Brathwaite pushed at it defensively, and it flew at a comfortable height to first slip. Root made it look harder than it was, clasping it between his wrists almost"
"fullish and straight, hits the pads and there's a <strong>big shout</strong>, but it looked to be going down leg. No review. Hope was looking to work towards wide mid-on, and Hawk-Eye confirms it would have missed leg"

"length ball angling in towards the top of off, pushed into the covers for a scampered single"

"Anderson repeats the trick, holding a tight line outside off and beating Hope's defensive push"
"straighter this time, with a hint of tail in, and Hope defends towards mid-on"
"hard length outside off, Campbell steers towards point and sets off for a single before Hope barks 'NO!'"
"wide on the crease, angling in. Campbell defends, working towards square leg as the bat turns in his hands"
"fuller this time, and pushed down the ground. Not quite out of the middle, and cut off by Woakes at mid-on"
"ooft, <strong>two types of leaves, John</strong>! Broad is wide on the crease and gets this tailing in. It whooshes just past the top of off, and Buttler dives to his right to make a smart stop behind the stumps"
"fuller again and pushed down the ground once more. Woakes gives chase, and cuts it off"
"fullish in the channel, nudged out to cover for another sharp single, keeping him on strike"
"left on length, and it flies over the top of the stumps"
"length ball, defended towards wide mid-on"
"length ball, pushed across him and pushed out into the covers. Campbell calls for two early, and they scurry back"
"length ball, defended to mid-off with a full face"
"slightly full of a length, stifled appeal from behind the stumps. Apart from the fact it pitched outside leg, took the inside edge and was going over the top, it was a pretty decent shout..."
"edged, and <strong>shelled by Stokes at second slip!</strong> Anderson looks even grumpier than usual. Nipped away off the seam to take Campbell's outside edge as he waftily pushed forward, and flew at Stokes at a nice height. But he got into a strange position, crouching very low, and shelled it, much to England's collective frustration"

"speared down the leg side, Hope can't connect as he looks to work into the leg side"
left alone outside off with another exaggerated leave
"length on the hip, Hope jumps to fend it round the corner to long leg and gets off the mark in the process. Not entirely convincing, with one hand coming off the bat"

"holds its line outside the off stump, left alone"
"hooping outswinger at 84mph/135kph, left alone"
"tight to the crease, nips back in and Hope inside-edges down towards fine leg, jumping back to defend. Utterly unconvincing innings so far"

pressed to mid-off defending. 85mph/137kph
"jeepers, tight leave from Campbell again. Left it on length and trusted the bounce. It flew just past his back thigh, and over the top of off stump"
"comes forward, pushing to mid-on as the bat face turns in his hand"
"82mph/133kph to start, defended into the off side"
"hits the pitch with a back of a length ball. Hint of movement in as Hope defends down the pitch, 85mph/137kph"
"ooft, <strong>beauty </strong>from Archer! Hard length, edged onto the back thigh pad and just short of second slip! Think there was a bit of bat on it before it before it flicked the back pocket. Yep, Ultra-Edge confirms it. Hope in all sorts"
defended off the back foot
"short ball, speared down the leg side and late swing makes it impossible for Buttler. Up at 89mph/144kph. Called wides for height"

"beaten outside off stump, that's a lovely lifting line, full length but rising off the deck, past the outside edge"
"<B>huge appeal for a leg-side strangle!</B> Umpire Kettleborough is unmoved, and after a long ponder, so is Joe Root. A flick of the backside, maybe"
solid block into the off side
"stretching forward to meet the full length, compact in defence"
"back of a length, Woakes swings into a pull but can't connect as he's thumped on the thigh pad"

"nipping off the seam, outside off stump, another judicious leave"
"full length and onto the front foot again, wicket-to-wicket line, defended to mid-on"
"slightly wider on the crease, shaping in on off stump, firmly behind the line"
"86mph, on the pads, back of a length, tucked square for another single"

"very full, tailing into the blockhole, solid in defence"
poked to mid-on as Archer probes away on off stump
"looking sharper than the speedgun claims, another 86mph delivery, lifting from just back of a length into a firm defensive block"

"outside off stump, swinging away as Campbell leaves well alone"
takes a bit of a toe-end to the cordon as Campbell attempts a leave-alone
"an authoritative block on the front foot, with a loud 'no!' for good measure"
"<B>banged in short, and that's perfection from Archer!</B> Campbell's weight was premeditated to be on the front foot, but that's a mistake when you're facing a bowler who can slip in the bouncer with barely a tell in the action. Right into the rib-cage, leaping off the splice as Campbell got in a tangle, and swallowed in the gully!"
flicked off the legs as Woakes aims a touch too straight
"a snorter in the channel outside off, lifting past the edge and dipping late as Buttler attempts to gather. That's rattled his fingertips"
forward and pushed to cover
"wider line, an easy leave as Brooks sizes it up and lets it be. Nipping off the seam once more"
probing again on a fifth-sixth-stump line. Another leave
"Woakes has settled into a comfortable rhythm outside off now, as Brooks takes his time to gauge the pace of his innings"
closing the face on a leg-stump line. Solid contact but nothing on offer there
"<B>loose and wafty!</B> Too wide to demand a stroke, but gets one anyway. Lucky not to make contact"

"sharper delivery, just back of a length, blotted to the on-side as Hope rises onto his toes"

"head over the ball, pushed to cover"
"lovely shape through the air, curling past an upraised bat on a very full length"
"right up to the blockhole as Woakes slides wider on the crease. A firm drive, through the angle, as the ball ends up at mid-on"
"<B>a perfect off-drive!</B> That'll make Hope feel so much better. He's been rehearsing that stroke with some of his exploratory drives in recent overs, but this time it's right in the slot and races to the rope"
"shaping into the hips, Brooks hops into a very fine clip"
"a closed-face nurdle off the pads, out through square leg"
"<B>drive that!</B> A whistling bouncer, as Hope sinks to the crease"
"still looking to come forward, poked into the covers as Archer aims fuller this time"
"<B>through him like the Curry Mile's finest!</B> So full, fast, and beaten on the inside-edge as Hope plays too late"
"a squirted drive out to point, a diving stop to intercept"
"full, outside off, tucked to the leg side"
shape on the outswinger. No stroke offered as that starts a touch too wide
"curling away, the lacquer's off the new ball now, and Anderson is maybe getting it to talk a little more already in this spell"
"through to the keeper, more movement but too wide to snag the edge"
"back of a length, solid block"
"more shape through the air, but Anderson's line in this over is a touch too defensive to draw much of a response. Left alone again"
"full again, drilled straight, and <B>Brooks</B> is so nearly stuffed in his followthrough at the non-striker's end! A deflection off Woakes as he dives, and he wouldn't have been in the picture"
drilled to mid-on as Woakes aims full and straight
"short, rising into the hip, tucked behind square for the single"
"leaning forward to drive again, solid in defence, and just threatening to attack too ..."
"tapped into the covers, a bit of hesitation as Pope swoops from behind square. But safe enough in the end"
"pulled, top-edged, safe ... two men back for the shot, but he didn't connect well enough to bring either into play"
"outswinger on a full length, and a tighter line. Lures a compact drive into the covers"
"<B>unplayable from Anderson!</B> That's the one he's been working towards since his return to the attack. Nipping away once again, but this time from a merciless full length and middle-and-off line, angling in. No option but to stick the bat in the way, but the movement and bounce licked the edge through to Buttler!"
"banged in short, welcome to the game, Mr Chase"
"zippy full length, climbing off the seam past a tentative but uncommitted edge"
"lifting off the crease, through to the keeper, another well-judged leave"
"fourth-stump line, nipping away again. Chase shoulders arms, as well he might"

"tapped out to backward point, angled bat taking the ball down"
"inswinger from Woakes, on a wide line and through to the keeper with an upraised bat"

"outswinger, left alone outside the off stump"
"fullish outside off, left alone"
"cut in half, little inside edge on it? <strong>Big shout and given!</strong> And no review from Brooks, so England have their man. Nipped in off the seam, skimming Brooks' inside edge, onto his back thigh and through to Buttler. Nightmare start to the evening session for West Indies"
"length ball, nips in to hit Blackwood on the pad. No appeal as it was always sliding down"
"length outside off, back-foot punch to point from Blackwood. Positive intent early on"
"length in the channel, no foot movement from Blackwood who steers it towards point"
"length in the channel, Chase gets in line to defend"
"hangs an outswinger outside off, left alone. 81mph/131kph"

"back of a length outside off, Chase isn't sure whether to leave and dangles his bat in the line of the ball"
"back of a length on fourth stump, punched to mid-on on the back foot"
"tight to the stumps, strays a little leg-side and Blackwood tucks off the pads for the first runs after tea"
"trapped in front, <strong>given!</strong> Blackwood <strong>reviews</strong> immediately. This was the inswinger, didn't look like any bat as Blackwood worked to leg, and Ultra-Edge confirms no bat involved. Umpire's call on impact, and <i>just</i> missing leg, so Blackwood survives. Michael Gough gets one wrong - unusual, to say the least"
"length ball in at the pads, thuds into them and balloons up towards point"
"length ball, dead straight. Blackwood is back in his crease to defend. 84mph/135kph"

"tight to the stumps, Chase thinks about having a nibble at a ball in the channel then withdraws"
"wider on the crease, nips in off the seam, Chase nudges towards midwicket"
"length on fourth stump, forced out into the covers. Good licks from Anderson, up at 85mph/137kph"
"length ball, Blackwood jumps onto the back foot to defend"
"fullish outside off, Blackwood has a <strong>wild slash outside off</strong> and swipes at thin air! Broad stares at him for a good three or four seconds as if to say 'Really, mate?'"
"full on off stump, driven firmly back down the pitch to Broad on the bounce"
"length ball, angling in with a bit of nip off the seam. Blackwood defends towards mid-on with a big stride forward"

"length outside off, 86mph/138kph with some movement in off the seam as Chase lets it go"
"<strong>beaten!</strong> Slightly fuller in the channel after Chase had been parked on the back foot, he jams the bat down on it late, after it had gone past. Buttler lets out a howl of anguish"
"fullish on off stump, the bat comes down late as Blackwood punches through cover. 82mph/132kph to start"
"edged <strong>short </strong>of second slip, through Stokes and down to the third man boundary. Root gives chase, but they get back for a second. Scrambled seam, just a hint of movement away. Chase played it late with soft hands, which meant it fell short of Stokes"
"slightly full of a length at 86mph/138kph, clipped off the pads out to square leg. Broad puts in the full-length dive to his left to keep them to three"
"back of a length, fended awkwardly off the hip but it lands in front of the man in close - Pope at short square leg/leg gully"
"length on fifth stump, forced defensively back to Archer who flicks it up with his boot in his follow-through"
"back of a length, 86mph/139kph, Blackwood jumps onto the back foot to defend"
"length on fifth stump, driven out to short cover"
"trapped on the pad, <strong>celebrappeal from Broad and the finger goes up!</strong> Chase drags himself off, doesn't bother with a review. Nips in appreciably off the seam, traps him on the knee roll as he jams the bat down late, and Broad has his second. Might have been worth sending upstairs with three reviews left, but it looked dead to the naked eye"

"short ball, takes evasive action and it thwacks him on the back before flying down to the fine leg boundary for leg byes"
"length ball in the channel, up at 88mph/142kph and Holder gets in line to defend"
"full and straight, <strong>whipped elegantly</strong> off the pads through straight midwicket for four. Pope gave chase, but it just about reached the toblerone after slowing up in the outfield. Lovely wristy flick"
"length ball on fourth stump, defended to short cover. Blackwood set off for a single but was firmly sent back"
"chance of a run-out, direct hit... Blackwood nudged it to short midwicket and set off, Bess threw the stumps down and flicked one of the bails out of its groove, but Holder's bat was down just in time with his long reach. And it ricocheted off for four via the stumps, so five in total"
"length on fourth stump, defended towards mid-off"
"shuffles across, driving a half-volley sweetly but straight to mid-off"
"length on the pads, struck in front and a big appeal... but the umpire doesn't like it. Root <strong>decides to review</strong>, slightly reluctantly. Jagged in off the seam, hit Holder above the knee roll as he looked to defend towards mid-on. No bat, but height will be an issue. Impact in-line, but going over the top of the stumps. Kettleborough's decision is vindicated"
"length outside off, left alone. Late movement away on its way through to Buttler"
"shuffles across, leaves alone outside off"
"tight to the stumps, 85mph/137kph length ball which thumps Blackwood on the pads as he looks to work to leg. No appeal, going over the top and sliding down"

"back of a length, punched out to cover point on the back foot. Bess scampers after it and keeps them to two"
"short and wide, <strong>carved through point for four</strong> with a flashy cut shot. 86mph/138kph from Archer but too much room, and Blackwood tucks in, extending the arms and flaying it away to the rope"
"length outside off, nudged to cover. 88mph/142kph"
"full on off stump, Blackwood unfurls the on-drive and <strong>times it exquisitely down the ground for four</strong>! The money I would pay to watch this man bat... lovely shot, right out the middle, and he's taking the attack to Archer"

"back of a length, Blackwood flinches as the ball gets big on him off the deck, but controls it well enough into the covers"
<B>a thumping straight drive!</B> In the slot for the hard-handed clump down the ground. The umpire does a soft-shoe-shuffle to avoid being hit as the balls whistles beneath his toes
squared up in defence as Woakes maintains that stump-threatening line
"a touch of width, cracked off the back foot past a diving short cover, they pause to make sure the ball is clear, then pick off the single"
"firmly blocked, up on the toes on the back foot"
"shaping away, outside off, through to the keeper"
a compact drive into the covers
"probing line, back of a length, Holder slides back and across to defend"
blocked to the on-side
"<strong>nibble off the seam!</strong> Perhaps half a yard too short to snag the edge, but Holder is well beaten, and Buttler does well too as the ball swings late"
worked off the legs to complete the over
"fractionally leg-sided, whipped on its way behind square"
"right in behind the line, blocked back down the track"
"<B>splat!</B> Blackwood stays too leg-side of the full-length ball, climbs into another hard-handed thump through the line, but there's enough nip off the deck to burst through a vast gate, and fell the middle stump! A combative but insubstantial effort is rudely ended, and now Windies are in a pickle"
"outswinger, an inviting shapely bun of a ball, straight from the hand, and drawing Dowrich into a what-the-hell thump through the covers! That'll do!"
"squared up on the back foot, and blocked back to the bowler"
"curling away, and through to the keeper. The end of another successful over as England's fourth seamer gets in on the act"
"fenced off the edge, down through third man. Mostly deliberately played, as Archer shrugs with a touch of disgruntlement"
"over-pitched, as Holder thumps the half-volley back through the line. Not perfectly timed, but it's a long chase to the edge of the rope"
"opens the face once again, another boundary! It's a torrent of runs!"
"zippy seamer, back of a length, and ripping through to the keeper. A bit of intent in that one!"
"back on a good full length, drawing the block"

"anchored in the crease, Woakes keeps the ball right up to the bat as Dowrich presses the ball into the covers"
"sliding onto the legs, and <B>Dowrich unfurls a languid pull into the gap behind square!</B> Lovely pick-up, and deposited for valuable runs"
"leaning forward, and blocked into the covers"
"steered down to third man with an open face. Surely an easy three as there's a long chase for point, but they take it easy"
"banged in short, Holder picks it early and ducks"
"banged in short, but Holder sways"
tucked off the hip to the leg side
"<B>hopelessly played by Dowrich!</B> That was the most telegraphed bouncer of all time! He knew it was coming and leapt like a snagged salmon, but the ball actually only got up about midriff height! Burns in the gully backpedalled, but couldn't cling on!"
"banged in short, even Woakes wants a piece of the action! Dowrich ducks this time"
"short again, Dowrich swings into another woeful pull... he's lost his bottle against the bouncer and no mistake. The ball strikes his body as Buttler hurtles in but can't reach it"
"on the hip, and he almost steps on his stumps this time, as he retreats so deep into his crease! This is fascinating..."
"flicked off the legs with another pull, a better one this time, as Dowrich gets off-strike"
"full length, attacking the stumps, Woakes reverts to his usual approach now that Dowrich is no longer in his sights"
"zipping past the outside edge. Now then, decision time for Root... another over for Archer? You'd think so..."
"thumps the deck on a leg-stump line, Dowrich plays that one slightly better as leg gully tidies up"
"starts with a blockhole ball around off stump, and Dowrich jams down and keeps it out"
"back of a length outside off, defended with an open face into the gully region"
"oh, shot. A good-length ball outside off, and he leans forward and meets it with the straightest of bats to punch through cover"
"Back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"fullish, just outside off, nice stride forward to block to mid-off"
"length ball not too far outside off, blocked into the covers"

"short, too wide of off stump to attempt the pull, and Dowrich swats at it and misses"
"this is not as short, but closer to off stump, and Dowrich plays a controlled pull out to deep square leg"
"full, a bit of away swing. Too wide to make Holder play, though"
"fullish outside off, Holder leans forward and eases an open-face push through cover point"
"short, angling into middle and leg. Jumps to ride the bounce and work it through square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, clipped to midwicket"
"gorgeous. It was up there for the drive, on off stump, and he finishes with a high left elbow and strokes it to the left of the diving mid-off fielder"
"bouncer, rises steeply over off stump or thereabouts. Holder keeps his eye on it and bends his back to let it pass over"
"back of a length outside off, and that's good footwork from Holder, gets back and across and close to the line to punch it away between backward point and cover. It slows down in the outfield, but keeps the fielder chasing for long enough for an all-run four. Kept it in with a largely pointless dive"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched firmly to cover"
"back of a length, fifth-stump line, jabs at it and plays it down to gully"
"length ball close to off stump, stays in his crease and stabs it out to backward point"

"back of a length on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"bouncer over off stump, ducks down low to get under it"
"shot. Short ball, sits up at waist height on off stump, and Dowrich pulls it dismissively through midwicket. Wide mid-on, in fact. No fielder at midwicket, so he had a vast area to whack that into"
"back of a length on middle and leg, tucked away to the right of deep square leg. They take the second run, and Pope fires in a flat throw straight to Buttler. They check with the third umpire, but Holder is well in"
"length ball nipping in slightly towards off stump. Presses forward to defend, and the ball rolls off the inside half of the bat to deep square leg"
"bouncer over middle stump, and again Dowrich gets in a weird tangle to evade it - eyes off the ball, feet up in the air, shoulders hunching down low"
"ducks low this time, and quickly gets out of the way of another bouncer. Not sure he kept his eyes on it all the way, though"
"short of a length on off stump, jumps to ride the bounce and keeps it down by his feet"
"well left. Dug in short again, in the corridor outside off. Drops his hands and wrists and lets it pass"

"short, attacking the hops. Looks to work it into the leg side, on the hop, only gets some thigh pad on it, loops towards leg gully"
"short, angling across to middle and off. Jumps and tucks it away neatly to fine leg to bring up the fifty partnership. Yet another good stand between these two"
"short of a length on off stump, jumps and gets on top of the bounce to block it back towards the bowler. There really isn't much pace off this pitch"
"short again, rising steeply and angling over leg stump. Lifts his bat high and lets the ball pass his left hip"
"length ball on middle stump, clipped to the right of mid-on, where Broad puts in a diving save"
"fullish on off stump, straightens a touch. All those short balls have rooted Dowrich to his crease. Pokes at it with no feet, and a thick edge runs away wide of gully"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended towards backward point"
"<b>what a catch that is!</b> Ollie Pope at midwicket, throws himself to his right to pull off a two-handed grab. Drifts into the pads, Woakes, and he flicks it crisply, but fatally in the air. Hang on, though. They're checking Woakes' front foot. It's incredibly close, and you can't say there's anything behind the line. Yup, <b>no ball. Wow.</b>"
"back of a length, close to off stump. Defends with soft hands, and the ball rolls away towards gully without Holder having opened his bat face. Kind of like Kane Williamson"
"full now, just outside off, nice stride forward to block into the covers"
"beauty. England haven't bowled this sort of ball enough today, I think. Good length, in the corridor, seaming away just a touch, and zipping past the outside edge as Holder props forward to defend"
"length ball on off stump, angling in from a wide-ish position and straightening slightly. Defended from the crease"
gets much closer to the stumps this time. Another length ball with a slight curve away from off stump. Defended into the covers
"length ball angling into middle stump, straightens a touch. Jabbed out to cover, staying a little leg-side of the ball"

"full, angling into the stumps, clipped to the left of fine leg"
"length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"drifts onto the pads, Dowrich clips to Broad at long leg"
"big inswinger, big appeal for lbw, but I suspect that swung too much and would have missed leg stump. No review. Great length, pins Holder to the crease as he looks to flick, but it's surely missing leg, and probably going over the stumps too. Wouldn't have gone past leg stump, according to Hawkeye, but it would have gone over"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"lovely. Length ball in the channel, and Holder is a little late getting onto the front foot to defend. Zips past his edge with the batsman's weight still on the heel of the front foot"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"fullish on off stump, gets forward and defends towards backward point"
"full, some swing in towards off and middle. Clipped to the right of mid-on"
"a bit of width on this full ball, and Holder leans forward to stroke it between cover - who's quite square - and mid-off. Nice way to bring up 2000 Test runs"
"beautifully bowled, and it's given. Holder's reviewed, but I don't think he's surviving this. Masterful follow-up to being driven through the covers. Length ball, seams in and strikes him around the knee-roll as he looks to work it into the leg side. His weight is falling over slightly to the off side, possibly influenced by the shot he played off the previous ball, and it's crashing into a good chunk of leg stump according to Hawkeye"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"length ball on off stump, gets a stride forward and blocks to mid-on"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched to mid-off"
"back of a length on middle stump, tucked to midwicket off the back foot"
"good-looking shot, but he mistimed it. Back of a length just outside off, and he leaned back and carved it away through point - or so I thought - but the ball stopped on him a little, and then dribbled towards extra-cover"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched to mid-off"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched crisply to mid-off once more. Just a hint of inward seam"
"ooh, there's that seam again, in from just back of a length, and it sneaks past the inside edge as Dowrich looks to punch off the back foot. Kept a bit low too, and he's lucky that missed off stump"
"nice length, angling into middle and leg, clipped to midwicket"
"full on fourth stump, driven to mid-off. Broad lingers in his follow-through to send a few verbals in Cornwall's direction"
"half-volley on fifth stump, <strong>full-blooded drive, dead-straight down the ground</strong> past the stumps! Lovely shot, out the meat of the bat and away to the fence"
"length in the channel, jams the bat down to push towards extra cover"
"length outside off, Cornwall drives again, the bat skewing in his hand as the ball flies into the covers. Cornwall isn't the quickest between the wickets, but saunters back for a second"
"tests him out with an 83mph/134kph short ball at the left shoulder, Cornwall ducks underneath it"
"length ball, pulled off the hip elegantly with a raised leg out to the sweeper to keep the strike"
"straight length ball, 84mph/135kph, worked to short midwicket"
"length on fourth stump, <strong>flays a drive over cover-point</strong> but it won't quite reach the fence. Bess catches up with it, and Cornwall ambles back for two. Looked to go straight, over extra cover, but the ball skewed away as the bat turned"
"length ball, forced back to Anderson on the bounce"
"picks up the length early, swiping off the thigh out to Broad at deep square leg. 85mph/136kph, good licks from Anderson"
"slightly full of a length on fourth stump, squeezed out to Bess at point with an open face"
"length in the channel, pushed back to the bowler on the bounce"
"length on fourth stump, defended to mid-on with a full face"
"full, straight, <strong>struck dead in front</strong> on the pad and Kettleborough raises the finger. <strong>Cornwall reviews</strong>, but this looked plumb. Struck on the knee roll, looking to work a full-of-a-length ball into the leg side. No bat, and hitting the top of middle-and-leg. The Rahk Attack is short-lived."
"length on fourth stump, gets forward to defend with a full face"
steered defensively into the leg side
"edged, and gone! <strong>Broad has a five-for</strong>. Good low catch by Root at first slip. Slightly full of a length, nipping away off the seam as Roach was drawn forward, and Root did the rest"

"back of a length, cross-batted nudge to mid-on"
"short ball, Dowrich ducks underneath it"

"back-of-a-length outside off, Gabriel sways inside it"

"beaten! This is a <strong>jaffa </strong>which nips in off the seam sharply. Length ball, flies past Dowrich's inside-edge and through to Buttler, swerving late"
"back of a length in the channel, jumps onto the back foot to defend. <strong>88mph/142kph</strong>, Broad has his tail up"
"length outside off, Dowrich stands tall and carts Broad through extra cover for four off the back foot! <strong>What a shot that is</strong>, carving the man with a five-for away for a sweetly-timed boundary"
"rides the bounce to fence out to point, straight to the man"
"back-of-a-length ball, Dowrich backs away and has a wild slash. It flies up in the air, looping up past the stumps at the bowler's end, and Woakes gets round from mid-on to take a simple catch. <strong>Broad has six, England lead by 172</strong>"
"outswinger, good bounce but too straight, and Burns nudges towards straight midwicket"
"outswinger again, slightly fuller this time, and Brathwaite leaves with a little swish of the bat. 82mph/132kph"
"edged, but <strong>falls short of Holder at second slip</strong>. And it looks like he might have done himself some damage, as the physio comes running on. Looks like it's banged him on the end of a finger. Slightly full of a length from Roach, with good shape away to take the edge. Burns played it with soft hands, Holder stuck his hands out to his left, and it struck the end of his thumb on the bounce, I think. Never really a catching chance, some way short of him"
"full, tailing in towards the pads with Sibley on a pair, and he clips to short midwicket"
"length ball on fifth stump, pressed towards mid-on"
"yorker, 82mph/132kph, and jammed out to square leg. Vicious ball, tailing in late"
"length on the pads, clipped to short midwicket"

"length in the channel, 86mph/138kph, Sibley leaves on length"
"length in the channel outside off, Burns shoulders arms"
"very full on fourth or fifth stump, dug out towards point by Burns. Roach's third attempted yorker already, I think"

"length on fifth stump, steered out to gully on the bounce"

"shuffles across his stumps, Gabriel sprays it down the leg side at 84mph/136kph and Dowrich takes it cleanly to his left"
"full on the pads, <strong>clipped through square leg for four</strong>! Sibley is off his pair, and lets out a wry smile while punching gloves with Burns. That's a freebie for him, and he tucks it away on the perpendicular"
"hard length on fifth stump, 86mph/138kph, defended towards midwicket"
"length on leg stump, clipped to Brooks at square leg with soft hands"
slightly full of a length on fourth stump. Sibley jams his bat down unconvincingly and it squirts away down to third man with more than a hint of outside edge on it. The ball skews away past gully and away for Sibley's second boundary
"starts by drifting into the pads, and Burns clips it away to fine leg"
"back of a length, not too far outside off, left alone"
"full, angling into off stump, defended to mid-on"
"length ball close to off stump, defended to backward point"
"lovely. Angling in from wide of the crease, hitting a good length in the corridor, drawing a half-forward poke from Sibley, and straightening it <b>past his outside edge</b>"
"<b>and again</b>. That angle from wide of the crease forces Sibley to play, and for the second time in a row, he's lucky not to edge it. It didn't move all that much either"
"length ball on middle stump, clipped to the right of midwicket, who's stationed quite square"
"short, angling a long way down leg, and Dowrich has to dive to his left to stop it"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, clipped to midwicket"
"ooh, that's the ball that got him in the first innings. Angling into the stumps and straightening ever so slightly. Was shaping to play towards midwicket with a closed face, and the ball <b>squirts off the leading edge</b> into the covers"
"shortish, angling into middle stump, defended into the on side"
"wide of the crease, angles a short-of-length ball into the fourth-stump channel. Shoulders arms, lifting his bat high overhead to ensure the extreme inward angle of the ball doesn't clip something on the way"
"full, angling down leg. Misses the flick by quite a long way - the angle from wide of the crease took it a fair way down leg"
"full, some late swing in towards off stump, gets a good stride out to defend it. Hit the inside half of the bat, though"
"again, inswinger attacking off stump from wide of the crease. Good stride forward to defend into the covers"

"back of a length, angling into off stump. Uses the angle well to tuck it through backward square leg"
"short ball, and Burns sinks to his knees and sways his upper body away from the line, but the ball keeps following him with the angle, and it hits him hard on the back shoulder. <b>Ouch</b>"
"another short ball, outside off, and this time it's wide enough for Burns to leave alone safely. Dowrich, however, struggles with some late swing as the ball approaches him, and the ball <b>smashes into his left cheek</b>. He's trudging off the field now. He's had a really difficult Test behind the stumps, and this one wobbles as it reaches him, hits the top of his glove, and smacks him in the face"
"back of a length, angling into middle stump, tucked away square on the leg side"
"oh my. Gabriel welcomes Shai Hope with a bouncer that keeps rising and swerving towards the leg side after Sibley ducks under it, and he has no chance of stopping it. Gabriel's overstepped too"
"short ball in the corridor, manages to gets on top of it though it gets up to chin height, and defends into the off side"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"length ball, angling into leg stump, clipped to backward square leg"

"length ball close to off stump, lets it come on and defends with soft hands. The ball rolls down to gully"

fullish outside off. Goes too early at the attempted cover drive and inside-edges into the midwicket region
"back of a length close to off stump, defended nice and late, under his eyes, towards backward point"

"down the track to this leg-side-ish ball, flicks it away to the left of long leg"
"tossed up nicely outside off, clipped gently to the right of mid-on"
"short, some width, chopped to cover point. Too little pace off the pitch to really go after that"
"length ball, a bit of swing in towards off stump. Presses forward and defends to midwicket, off the inside half of the bat"
"full, angling into off stump, flicked away to the square leg boundary. There's a square midwicket and a backward square leg, and he bisected the two perfectly"
"short, angling into the ribcage, tucked away to fine leg, past the man at backward square leg"
"fullish, pitching on off and continuing to slant away, left alone"
"length ball slanting away from off stump, gets forward and dabs to gully"
"ooh, nicely bowled. Burns has looked a little more eager to attack over the last couple of overs - instructions from the team management? - and Holder tempts him into the cover drive with one that isn't quite full enough, and is slanting away from him. <b>Past the outside edge</b>"
"again, not enough pace off the pitch to cut. Spins in sharply too, and he plays it back to the bowler off the inside half of the bat"
"full, turning down leg. Misses the flick and the ball rolls into the short fine leg region off the pad"
"down the track, gets too close to the pitch, drills it hard back to the bowler"
"flatter length ball on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"ooh, that was <b>nearly his fourth dismissal of Burns</b>. Down the track, and it dips and spins sharply away from his jabbing bat. Spun too far for Da Silva to be able to collect and have enough time to stretch back and take the bails off. Had to almost dive to the stumps, and in the end he missed taking off the bails entirely"
"tossed up outside off, lots of turn once more, left alone"
"short, angling down leg, lifts his bat overhead and lets it go past"

"short gets up to chest height around off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"full on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"

Very full, pretty straight, hit the pad on the half-volley. Not sure what this is missing. No bat. <strong>Impact outside the line!</strong> Sibley survives"
"lunges forward with hard hands, working to straight midwicket. Campbell has an optimistic shy at the non-striker's end, but Burns is comfortably in"

"length ball angling into off stump from round the wicket, straightening a touch. Blocked to mid-off"

"fullish, angling into off stump, defended back down the pitch"
"drifts onto the legs, glanced fine, but fine leg is extremely fine and they only get one for it. Rare to see such a fine fine leg these days"
"back of a length on off stump, and that's great wristwork from Burns, whipping it away on top of the bounce to find the backward square leg boundary. That brings up England's first century opening stand <i>in 94 innings</i>. That stat comes to you courtesy Bharath Seervi"

"back of a length outside off, chopped to backward point"
"full on off stump, whipped flamboyantly but straight to backward square leg. West Indies have set a good field for Sibley here, five fielders on the leg side"
length ball nips in towards the top of off. Looked like late swing rather than seam. Defended off the inside edge and then into the pitch and then back pad
"fullish, not far outside off. Goes for a hard-hands drive, aiming to hit through cover probably, and the ball slices off the outside half of the bat and runs away quickly to the right of backward point"

"back of a length, nips back in pretty sharply and produces a big lbw appeal. Not given, and <b>Holder's reviewed.</b> Looked to work it with a closed face, with both feet behind the crease. Struck him in front of middle and off, and it's <b>umpire's call</b> on height. A good on-field call. You could never have been sure that's hitting the stumps given the length and the fact that it hit Sibley above the knee roll"
"fuller, another lbw appeal, and this time it's given! Sibley wasn't too far forward, and was looking to work it leg side once again. <b>He's reviewed it</b>, and I think he can only be saved if this is missing leg stump. Was actually looking to punch this through mid-on, I think, but got his front leg too far across and had to play slightly around it. A bit of inward movement, and the ball is hitting a big chunk of leg stump according to Hawkeye. Holder gives West Indies their first breakthrough"

"fullish, angling into off stump, punched back to the bowler"

"back of a length outside off, looks to dab into that third man region again, and gets a thick edge that falls just short of the diving Hope at slip. <b>Or has it carried?</b> They're going upstairs, and the soft signal is not-out. It's bounced short for sure. Difficult catch, had to fall forward as the ball descended steeply"
"flat length ball on off stump, blocked back to Cornwall"
"another reverse-sweep, from an off-stump line this time. Was a little shorter than he'd have liked, and it bounces and takes his glove and loops over the man at slip"

"full, swinging in towards off stump, clips to the right of square midwicket"
"bit of an appeal for lbw as he shuffles across to work it leg side and misses the flick. Height was the issue, I guess. Hit him on the thigh pad"
"short on off stump, and that's a super shot. Lots of fielders on the leg side, but there's a gap between backward square leg and square midwicket. Root pulls it firmly between the two of them"
"bouncer angling in over middle stump, and Root does well to get out of the way, leaning towards the leg side"

"tucked out to midwicket off the hip for one, Keon Harding fields in his wide-brim sunhat"

"tossed up, Root uses his feet to skip down the track and <strong>whack him over mid-off</strong>. Just about lands over the rope, even though he didn't quite connect with it"

"clipped to short midwicket, half-stopped by the man in close and away for a single"
"swept from outside off to Blackwood at deep square, Root moves to 49*"

"back-of-a-length, Root backs away looking to reverse-flip it over the slips but misses it"
"back of a length, hoicked from outside the off stump out to deep midwicket for four more. Not out of the middle, but more than enough on it. Very deep in the crease, almost a tennis-style pull"

"wide on the crease, bangs in a length ball halfway down, carved out to deep backward point"
"in the slot, dead-straight, and <strong>mowed over straight midwicket for four</strong> after a couple of bounces. Dropped deep in the crease, giving himself some room and heaving over the leg side"

"booming outswinger, pretty wide and Brathwaite doesn't deign to play a shot. 84mph/135kph"
"that's the inswinger, traps Brathwaite on the bottom of the thigh pad in front. Half-baked appeal from behind the stumps, but always over the top"

"lunges forward, steering to point. 81mph/131kph to start"
"nips in from a length, Campbell jams the bat down on it late"
"draws the edge, <strong>simple catch for Root at slip</strong>! Broad, round the wicket to the left-handers. It's almost too easy for him. Tight line, angling in then nipping away, draws the outside edge high on the bat as Campbell comes forward to defend, and Root takes a comfortable slip catch to leave West Indies 0 for 1!"
"short ball, plays it very awkwardly and strikes him on the glove. It spills through the slips, and they get the innings up and running. Good bounce for Broad"

It flicked his bat on the way through and Buttler completed the formalities. <strong>Broad moves to 499</strong>, West Indies are deep in the mire"
"length on fourth stump, worked into the leg side"
"hung outside off, Hope shoulders arms. Some late wobble on its way through to Buttler. Up at 87mph/141kph from Broad"
"ooft, <strong>how did that miss?!</strong> No real movement, just a hint of nip in off the seam, but it's an immaculate line from Broad, and just misses both the bat and the top of off stump"
"edged through the cordon! Hope was jumping in his crease, and it dropped well short of Sibley at third slip on the bounce"

"slightly full of a length on fourth stump, Hope gets forward. Checked drive, out the middle but straight to short cover"

"fullish on fourth stump, driven firmly to mid-off"

"back of a length close to off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"back of a length, nipping in slightly from outside off, lets it come on and defends into the covers"

"back of a length close to off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"big appeal for lbw as Brathwaite presses forward to defend. Only Broad was really appealing, that seemed to bounce quite a bit. Nipped in sharply and hit him on the back thigh"

"ooh, bit of late inswing. Full, veering in towards off stump. Clipped away through square leg off the inside edge. Was probably looking to aim towards mid-on"
"ooh. Now this one goes past the outside edge in the corridor outside off. Pokes away from his body a little, and he's lucky not to edge it. Keeps slightly low too"
"length ball close to off stump, jabbed into the point region"

"back of a length, a bit of inward seam to hit Hope on the back thigh after nipping past the inside edge of his hopping defensive shot"

"full on off stump, punched firmly back and Broad stops it with his right hand"
"big shout for lbw, and it's given! That's Broad's 500th! No review, and why would he? That kept very low, and snuck under his attempted defensive shot from the crease, and struck him on his back pad. Unfortunate for Brathwaite. Probably struck him in line with off stump and would probably have crashed into middle. Brathwaite is now Broad's 500th victim as well as Anderson's"

"back of a length on off stump, defended into the on side"
"back of a length, nips in sharply towards off stump. Hurriedly jams his bat down and squeezes it into the square leg region"

"length ball, nudged to mid-on off the hip"

"very full on fifth stump, dug out to mid-off. 84mph/135kph"
"length outside off, Hope unfurls the cover drive again and <strong>creams it to the fence</strong>. Gorgeous shot from Hope, who holds the pose, but the question is whether he can press on towards a substantial score for the first time in a long time"
"length ball, worked off the hip through midwicket"
"length on the hip, nips in off the seam, clipped out to deep midwicket"
"slightly back of a length outside off, Hope pulls and <strong>skews it straight up in the air</strong> off the toe. Guess who's under it? Broad of course, running in from mid-on and taking a fairly simple catch running in. He had to steady himself as it swirled in the breeze, but did the job. Hope throws away another start and his dire run in Tests continues. Wonder if this will prove to be his last Test innings for a while?"

"wide on the crease, angling in. Brooks strides forward to defend down the pitch with a full face"
flicked to square leg on the bounce
"inside edge on the way through and <strong>Brooks is gone!</strong> Loose waft outside off, just a hint of nibble in off the seam, a fraction back of a length as Brooks rocked onto the back foot, jumping slightly as he pushed at it, and it flicked the inside edge on its way through to Buttler"
"fullish in the channel, driven firmly to mid-off"
"strays down the leg side, Chase looks to flick it off the pads but can't get anything on it"
"full and straight, whipped down to fine leg. Bit of late tail into the right-hander"
"full and down the leg side, 86mph/139kph. Blackwood looks to work it behind square and isn't far away from getting a tickle on it - half-hearted appeal from Buttler"

"length ball outside off, left alone"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"full outside off, driven firmly to mid-off"
"oh, what a ball to start with. Length ball, angling into off stump and then curving away gently, late, forcing Chase to push at it without too much footwork, and beating his outside edge"
"length ball on off stump, defended to midwicket. Again, not much of a stride from Chase, his front knee seems a little locked"
"full on off stump, pushed firmly to the right of extra-cover. No mid-off in place"
"back of a length, not too far outside off, jumps across to cover the line and leaves it alone"
"back of a length, not too far outside off, nibbles away a touch. Not sure if Chase was beaten or simply played inside the line, allowing the movement to take it past his outside edge"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"length ball on the stumps, tucked away past midwicket"
"short ball rising quickly and skiddily over leg stump, ducks quickly out of the way"

"full on off stump, clipped to mid-on"
"fullish outside off, gets a good stride forward to drive to mid-off"
"short, wide, but this may not be the pitch for the angled-bat slash. Doesn't come on, and he inside-edges it into the ground and then down to the keeper. Missed off stump by quite a distance, but on another day..."
"do you really need to run quick singles in this situation, West Indies!?!?!? back of a length close to off stump, pushed into the cover point region and they set off, with a moment's hesitation. And that's enough for Bess, who sprints quickly to his right from backward point, picks up, turns smoothly, and throws down the stumps at the striker's end, with Chase well out"
"full, close to off stump, defended towards backward point"
"length ball outside off, presses forward and blocks into the point region"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"full outside off, driven smoothly but short cover dives right to rudely interrupt the ball's journey to the boundary"
"full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, straightens off the seam to beat Holder's front-foot push. Was playing well in front of his body there"
"back of a length close to off stump, and that's nicely played, works his wrists on top of the bounce to place it to the right of mid-on"
"looks for the bouncer, but bowls it well outside off and Blackwood simply watches it through to the keeper"
"back of a length angling into off stump, defended back to the bowler. He tends to stay a little leg-side of the ball"
"shortish, rising to around chest height over off stump. Stays a little leg-side of the ball and uses his wrists to keep it down on the on side"
"shout for lbw as the ball, angling down leg, clips something on its way to Buttler. Not given, but <b>England have reviewed</b>. Length ball, and to me it seemed that Holder was a little late on the flick. Yeah, only the edge of his pad. They're checking for lbw, but there's no way that's hitting the stumps. Impact outside leg as well"
"ooh, a little loose from Holder. Fullish outside off, and he drives away from his body and is beaten by a little bit of seam"
"fuller this time, a bit of outswing, but it's full enough for Holder to reach out and slice a drive to the right of gully"
"back of a length on off stump, steps across and works it to the right of midwicket, nicely played"
"full, angling into middle stump, and Holder clips it neatly to the left of long leg, leaving the fielder far too much to do to stop the boundary"
"length ball, off-stumpish, and Holder looks to work it leg side and Woakes has a huge lbw appeal upheld. <b>Holder's reviewed immediately, though</b>. Is there an inside edge? Nope. Nothing on UltraEdge. Nice length, nips in from just outside off, and that's hitting leg stump according to Hawkeye. Holder's front pad slightly got in the way of his bat there - he wasn't looking to play across the line, but to punch towards mid-on, but he ended up having to play a little around that pad"
"full outside off, and Blackwood has a drive at it and misses. Wasn't quite a half-volley, and it straightened past his outside edge"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"shortish on off stump, gets on his toes, rides the bounce, and blocks it back to the bowler"
"yikes, he was in an awkward position there. Tends to stay leg-side of the ball, as mentioned previously, and this short ball was rising over off stump or thereabouts, towards Blackwood's back shoulder. Tries to almost flick it away into the leg side, and he gets a bit of bat on it and it rolls into the backward square leg region"
"shortish, rising towards the ribcage, rides the bounce and tucks it leg side"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"shortish outside off, punched firmly but short cover gets in the way"
"full on middle stump, flicked in the air, just high enough and just far enough to midwicket's left to pick up a couple"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, defended into the on side. Was on the hop there, and then the ball kept slightly low"
"bouncer, was a reasonable distance outside off but Dowrich still took his eye off the ball while ducking"
"fullish, angling into off stump. Shows it the full face and drives it to the on side of the stumps. Was leaning back slightly, and was probably looking to hit it more towards mid-off, but he made good contact with the inner half of the bat"
"bouncer, much straighter in line than the previous one, ducks safely underneath"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched towards mid-off"
"shortish outside off, punches with hard hands and an angled bat, and the bounce beats him. Did he get a top-edge on it? <b>England think so, and call for a review</b>. Straightens a touch off the seam, with a bit of extra bounce. No edge spotted by UltraEdge, and England have burned through two reviews in a short span of time"
"shortish, angling towards leg stump. Looks to work it off his hip, gets a bit of thigh pad on it"
"length ball close to off stump, hops across to defend into the cover point region"
"short, rising ball over off stump. Jumps to ride the bounce and keep it down in front of short leg"
"bouncer over leg stump, hops and ducks at the same time and manages to let the ball pass over his left shoulder"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched back to the bowler"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump. Defended to midwicket"
"back of a length, a bit of width, punched away through point"
"shortish, angling into middle and leg, hops across and tucks it to fine leg"
"short, angling down leg, and Blackwood, who's been getting into awkward positions because he isn't getting back and across, flaps at it and helps it down to fine leg. Reasonably well controlled"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"back of a length outside off, punched away to the left of cover"
"full outside off, driven to the fielder at short cover"
"shortish on off stump, rides the bounce and blocks it back to the bowler with a bit of wristwork to keep it down"

"shortish, a bit of width, jabbed away to the right of backward point"
"bouncer over middle and off, Blackwood crouches down low and evades it"
"struck on the pad, dead-straight, <strong>and the finger goes up!</strong> Woakes has four, England have eight. Doesn't bother reviewing, since this was about as plumb as it gets. Dowrich is only a small man and was struck on the knee roll right in front. A bit of nibble in off the seam, Dowrich went back instead of forward, looked to jam the bat down but got nowhere near it"
"length outside off, stands tall and crunches it through wide mid-off. Sibley gives chase, and Cornwall ambles back for a couple"
"length outside off, 84mph/135kph, left alone with a flourish. Late movement on its way through to Buttler"
"full on leg stump, looks to whip into the leg side but inside-edges into the pad"
"and <strong>Woakes has five!</strong> Another plumb lbw, slightly full of a length. Pitching off, hitting leg. No foot movement from Cornwall who looked to work into the leg side, and he doesn't bother reviewing. Slightly bizarre decision not to, with two left, but it looked as out as it gets"
"a fraction full of a length, pretty straight, struck on the pad but only a stifled appeal. Looked like it was too high, striking Gabriel on the thigh pad."
"unfurls an on-drive, but can't beat mid-on"
"outswinger on a length, punched to short extra cover while jumping onto the back foot"
"short outside off, sways inside the line and ducks underneath it. 86mph/139kph"
"back of a length, outside off, punched out to the man running round from deep point to cover. They don't take the single, with two balls left in the over"
"short ball at the left shoulder, fended awkwardly behind square on the leg side. 85mph/137kph"
"slightly full of a length on off stump, Gabriel jams his bat down just in time"
"length on leg stump, clipped out to square leg and they don't take the single"
"slower ball, slightly full of a length, Blackwood waits for it and pushes to mid-on. Down at 69mph/111kph"
"back of a length outside off, Blackwood shapes to upper-cut and steers it straight over Buttler's head via the top edge"
"length outside off, <strong>punched hard off the back foot</strong> through the covers for four more. Bess threw himself at it but Blackwood nailed this, and beat him to his left"
"length ball, sits back and punches to mid-on off the back foot"
"back of a length, punched down the ground to long-off. Anderson jogs half-heartedly after it, but it won't reach the boundary and Blackwood will retain the strike."
"strangled down the leg side, <strong>10 for Broad!</strong> His first since 2013, would you believe? England win by 269 runs and take the series 2-1. This was dug in halfway down the pitch. Blackwood shapes to pull, got a fair bit of bat on it - or maybe some glove - and Buttler took a sharp catch down the leg side to finish things off"
