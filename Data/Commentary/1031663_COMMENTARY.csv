"fuller length, attacking the pads, squirted off a leading edge into the covers"
"edged and <B>dropped!</B> And it's Cook again! His third in two games. A fuller length, that familiar curling full length, kissing off the edge and floating low but very catchable to first slip! clips the heels of the hands and bobbles up and away. Whoops"

"that's a good-looking delivery, jagging away from a tight line. Could it be a foot fuller though?"

"straightens the line, Powell misses his flick and takes the pad to the leg side"
"full outside off, 82mph, left alone"
gets across outside off stump and defends to the leg side
"499 for Anderson! On that full length outside off, late away movement, Hope in two minds whether to play to leave and the ball takes takes the toe. Bairstow doesn't risk leaving this one for Cook, dives across and takes it very nicely"
"that's the shot of a confident batsman, gets forward into a full delivery and plays a very well controlled punched through the covers"
"this one comes back in, on a full length, defended to cover"

"attacking the stumps from round the wicket, blocked"
"punched into the off side, full face of the blade"
pushed out to point
"good delivery, pitches on off and straightens to take the edge. But there's very little carry and third slip gathers the edge on the bounce, and throws it in the air to get the crowd over-excited"
"forward and that's a sweet strike! Clean through mid-off, all timing, minimum of power"
"a yawning leave-alone, through to the keeper"
forward and punched through point. Another good connection to keep the runs flowing
"curling back into the pads, defended"
"that is beautiful! Hope is starting to tick now, foot right to the pitch of the ball and a sweet punch along the ground through the covers"
"absolute jaffa! That rips like a legbreak from a middle and leg line, bursting past the edge and into Bairstow's gloves! Play that if you can!"
"banged in short, no stroke this time as it holds its line past the edge. Getting closer..."
"outside off, round the wicket, no stroke offered. The usual fare"
onto the front foot to push into the off side

"well bowled again, another awkward stab outside off as the ball nibbles through to the keeper"
"nudged off the hip, into the leg side"
driven on the up to mid-on
"on the pads, worked to square leg"
worked square once more. Tightening the line to cramp the left-hander
forward and pushed back to the bowler
on the legs and whisked behind square with a fine connection. More runs to the impressive Hope
"nipping back and a big appeal! Broad is interested but it did look high to the naked eye, and Root declines the review. Yep, a good six inches too high"
"onto the front foot, firmly struck back to the bowler, and a fierce shy as well. No real need for it, but I'm sure Broad feels better"
"wide line, swinging away, it's not really happening for Broad just yet"
"on the back foot, defended into the off side"
"very full, and oddly slow from TRJ, swinging in under the batsman's nose and punched firmly down to a chasing long-on"
hops onto the back foot to defend
"good nip this time, jags up the slope and past the edge. Wel bowled. That's the line that's got him Test recognition"
"that, on the other hand, is not. On the pads, and clipped firmly down the slope to the Tavern rope"
"fuller length, wider line, no stroke offered"
outside off and through to the keeper once more
"angled defence, definite hint of swing, but takes a low edge through the cordon. Interesting start..."
more clear signs of swing but starting on the leg stump and drifting in late to off. Clipped hard to deep midwicket
"angled defence, picking the swing and deflecting it down into the gully"
"outside off, left alone as it swings past the stumps. Useful movement from Stokes, if he can harness it"

a decent first over
"keeping it tight to off stump, left alone with an upraised bat"
"outside off, no stroke once again"
"inside-out drive, not entirely convincing, but an effective enough connection on the up and through midwicket"
"through to the keeper, a bit more dart off the seam. Well bowled"
"gosh, that one really leapt from a good length! Not quite<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dmk2aDKkTU' target='_blank'> David Saker proportions</a>, but along those lines! Outside off, fortunately, and left alone"

"good lift off the pitch, defended into the off side"
"banged in short, on the back foot, pushed to the off side"
dabbed into the off side
"that's a cracking drive! Just a tiny bit over-pitched, and Hope leans into a sumptuous drive, clean through the covers"
"nice take down the leg side by Bairstow, swooping with one hand as TRJ strays onto the hip"
"Cook has only gone and caught one! And he is delighted, as Roland-Jones bangs one into the splice of Hope's still-vertical bat, for a thin deflection to bobble through to first slip! Was it straight in ... hmm... more or less, but those weren't the liquid mitts of old! A timely strike, as Hope was beginning to purr..."
"outside off, left alone"
"curling from back of a length, through to the keeper"
"in the channel outside off, straightening off the deck and through to the keeper"
"drilled straight back to Stokes, who bends at the knee and scoops a fine catch in both hands! Powell's resistance ends at precisely the wrong moment for West Indies, who now have two players yet to face a ball ..."
"outside off, swinging back in from a wide line. No stroke"
through to the keeper once more
"very full and TRJ is almost up for a raucous lbw shout, but reckons that that grazed the bat first. I think he's right, and the umpire agrees as the ball flies through fine leg"
"very full again, leg-sided, and clipped very firmly on the up through square leg"
"through to the keeper, and left alone"
""
"full and straight, pushed back down the pitch"
"wide outside off, no stroke needed this time"

"yeehar, careful now! Wide of off stump and a wild hard-handed drive at nothing. Stokes looks askance in his followthrough"

"well bowled, tighter line, fuller length, squeezed to safety on the back foot"

"full and straight, pushed into the covers"
"has this carried? Yes, Dowrich is off! Good length outside off, more outswing, he has a nibble and Cook grabs it very low. Now, though, Dowrich has stopped. Going to check it's carried. It goes straight in, neat take from Cook after his recent problems"

"back outside off, short of a length, he pulls the bat inside the line"
"full and straight, defended back to the bowler who throws and the stumps and hits them"
"and another! On off stump, beats the outside edge and he's not reviewing. Short of a good length, it's umpire's call on impact and hitting so good call not to ask. Enough seam movement to square him up a touch, excellent bowling"

"and he's done him again with an off-cutter to the left hander, nips away sharply off the seam from a good length"
"what a moment! Root goes, Powell clings on at firsts slip. Short of a length outside off, Root forcing off the back foot, Dowrich starts to move but, unlike at Headingley, doesn't fully dive and Powell holds his nerve. Not one of Root's best shots given the circumstances"

"very full, he latches on and drives wide of mid-off"
"onto the front foot again and drives, finds mid-off this time"
that's a beauty! Turns Stokes around with a delivery on off stump

"off-stump yorker, dug out to the bowler"

"angled across outside off, seams away further, left alone"
"back of a length at middle, takes a thick inside edge through square leg"
"an appeal for lbw, but this was quite short so surely pitched outside leg and looked high as well. Well outside leg"
"on leg stump, clipped off the pads down to long leg"
"nicely played, more timing than power, gets well forward and drives it straight of mid-off who is quite wide"
"stays round the wicket, full and wide outside off, left alone and another that Dowrich doesn't glove as he dives across in front of first slip"
"full outside off, Malan well across his crease and defends"
"wide outside off, left alone"

"gets a bouncer first up, from wide on the crease, angles back and Bairstow sways out of the line"
"on the stumps, defended to the off side"
"round the wicket, not far from dragging on, playing forward at a full ball and takes the inside edge through square leg"
"short of a length outside off, left alone"
"angling into the pads, punched confidently into space on the leg side"
"edged and <B>dropped!</B> A fizzing delivery, bursts off the pitch, into the splice and high and hard to Kyle Hope's left at second slip! In the end, to be fair, he did well to save runs. But Holder had just moved his third slip away one ball earlier... he's back now..."
"a fraction over-pitched, and Stokes drills a punchy on-drive straight back past the bowler. That'll smart..."
"in the channel outside off, but Gabriel has over-stepped"
pushed into the on-side. So nearly a perfect resumption for West Indies
"onto the front foot, pushed into the covers"
"oh well bowled. Wider on the crease, angling the ball in towards the off stump, down the slope and tight past a flinching edge"
"a carbon copy! Swings late after it passes the bat too, lovely shape, perfect area. Bairstow survives"
"sliding down, as Bairstow strides a long way across his stumps. Deflected fine as his head falls away to the off side"
"good delivery again, fuller length, on a wide line and dug out on the crease"
"outside off, ghosts away late. This is good probing bowling from West Indies, letting the conditions do the hard work"

"pushed into the off side, dancing at the crease"
"whipped off the pads, down the slope towards deep square leg"
pushed into space at mid-on

pushed hard on the back foot to cover
"punched into the off side, still from round the wicket"
lets this one go by on a good length outside off

"confidently driven, into the covers"
short and climbing through to the keeper
"on the pads, clipped with sweet timing down to the Mound Stand rope. A productive area since the resumption"
"on the back foot, fenced back down the pitch with a touch of late adjustment to ride the bounce"
more front-foot issues for Gabriel as Bairstow defends on his back foot
flicked uppishly to the sweeper at deep midwicket
"well wide of off stump, a bit of a sighter, and Stokes does well to reach it with a toe-ended pull"
"that's a crushing pull! But straight to the deep midwicket sweeper. He didn't have time to move, so was perfectly positioned to cut off the boundary"
"outside off, keeps a touch low. Through to the keeper"
chopped into the off side
"back of a length, whipped to the leg side"
"not quite there for the drive, but Bairstow has a go anyway, toe-ending a loose steer into the covers. A touch of swing in that delivery too"
"fully forward, punched to cover"
"clipped back down the pitch, half-stopped in the bowler's followthrough"
"outside off, and dabbed into the covers"
a loose drive from Bairstow. Outside off and climbing past a wild slash
into line to defend
"a swing and a miss! Drifting away at the last second, as Bairstow aims another hard-handed drive in the direction of Maida Vale"
"panned through midwicket! A short-arm pull, picking the length with ease and cashing in on the fractionally wider line"
forward and defended
"round the wicket, fenced into the leg side"
"short, and pulled through midwicket. That's a more confident blow from Bairstow, back of a length and crunched through the gap"
"well bowled, a good yorker, zeroing in on leg stump and just about dug out"
"onto the front foot, punched to cover"
"wide outside off stump, no stroke"
another judicious leave-alone
"edged, but always safe. A wide ball from Roach, Stokes chases it and snicks low past gully"
thumped with purpose to deep cover
"a toe-ended cut, down into the gully"
firmly driven to mid-off
left alone outside off
"wow, that is some timing! Nothing more than a defensive push through mid-on, but the first sign that he'd nailed it was his urgent call for a single as it raced through the gap. In the end, it kept racing all the way to the rope!"
"width, cut, fifty. Easy pickings for a player in quite some form at the moment"
"tight defence on off stump, head right over the ball"
pushed into the gap at mid-off
shoulders arms to complete the over
"wide outside off, no stroke offered"
chopped into the off side

pushed to the off side

punched into the off side
firmly tonked into the acres of empty space in the covers
"wide line, nipping back in sharply, punched hard off the back foot in a defensive gesture"
"that's another snorter! Genuine pace and exploding off a good length, Bairstow came forward to meet it then beat a hasty retreat as the ball took off past him"
"bosh! Bairstow's most confident shot of the day, though it looked to be entirely powered by adrenalin. A bent-knee crunch through the covers"
"big appeal, and <strong>given out lbw! </strong>Bairstow calls for a <B>review</B>, as well he might, it nipped back sharply and took off as the batsman retreated into his crease. But nope, that is crashing into leg stump. Roach has earned that!"
"low full toss, seeking the yorker but a touch over-pitched. A well-timed clip to midwicket but an even better stop. West Indies are On It Like A Bonnet"
"outside off, swinging away, left alone"
"onto the front foot, pushed back to the bowler"
back and across to defend as Stokes gets right behind the line
"down on one knee, crunched to deep cover"

"wide of off stump, no stroke this time"
"round the wicket, angled in, left alone"
"drilled on the up, to mid-on"
a curious leading edge through the covers. They all count
"bowled him! That is a huge moment, round the wicket, a hint of inswing, and despite an immaculate forward defensive ... <strong>oh hang on ... he's over-stepped!</strong>"
"round the wicket again, drifting in, and worked into the leg side"
"wow! He's bowled an absolute carbon copy replica! Stokes once again stretches forward to defend, but the angle, the length, and the late inswing makes for an unplayable combination!"
"slips onto the pads, nicely clipped but straight into short leg"
"aggressively, by the looks of it, as he drives at a wide delivery that moves further"
"full outside off, extravagant movement away after it pitches"
"touch closer to off stump, left alone"
"that's a good one, a shorter delivery, draws Moeen into having a poke and it seams past the edge"

"goes after the short ball this time with a good pull shot, well in front of square"
defended at the top of the bounce
"full outside off, left alone"
"short of a length, defended"
"grabbed in the gully! Roach has five. Keeps it full outside off, Moeen can't resist going after it, drives on the up, and it's a sharp catch by Kyle Hope"
"that's a sharp short ball! Skims over Broad's head as he barely has time to move, wasn't expecting that"

"short of a length outside off, he crunches a pull but straight to mid-on"
"full outside off, driven to cover"
"again he pulls the short ball, finds deep square leg and it's another no-ball as well"
"ends up getting this through cover, moved onto leg stump, exposes all his stumps, then drives the full delivery"
this time he tries to swing a short ball from well wide outside off over the leg side but only finds fresh air...not sure he heard the call of no-ball from the umpire (was a big one from the crowd)
"now he's over the wicket, beats him with a full delivery outside off, not far from off stump"

"back of a length, played back to the bowler"
"over the wicket, angled across, plays inside the line"

"short ball outside leg stump, swung away backward of square, bisects deep square and long leg"
"that's a heave, swinging across the line of a length delivery, gets a bottom edge to deep square"

"a leg-stump yorker, dug out as he shuffles outside leg stump"
"over the wicket, length ball at off stump, heaved to mid-on and in the end they get a single as a needless throw from Holder is hurled towards mid-on"
"backs away, then upper-cuts a short delivery just over backward point...actually, was more of a straight bat than a cross-bat shot"
another wild swing and a miss to a ball outside off
"full and straight, he just about stays in line and drives to mid-off"
"carved over the off side, moving to the leg side again, not sure he was even looking at the ball, skews high over backward point"

"straightens the line, gets across and tucks it into square leg"
"over the wicket, full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"strikes through the line of a length delivery, goes miles in the air, clears mid-off, then plugs in the outfield...Gabriel hadn't even started chasing it, and Broad was barely running to start with. Good cricket"
"seams away outside off, Dowrich dives across in front of first slip"
"fuller at off stump, defended and it runs off the face to point"
"into the crowd again! Broad making merry. Short of a length outside off, gives him room to swing his arms, flies high over backward point"
"that's a sharp bouncer, Broad fends it off the body behind square...Dowrich chases it then slips. What a day for him!"

"outside off, tight line but keeps low through to the keeper"
"dangled outside off stump, nothing alarming on offer so far"

into line again and defended
"tapped into the covers, meeting the rising ball outside off stump"
"round the wicket to launch Broad's spell, in the channel outside off"

"outside off, jabbed into the covers for a quick single"
worked into the leg side with a flick of the bat
"through to the keeper, curling away from the left hander from a tight line. That was closer to the off stump than Powell bargained for!"
"solid poke into the covers, up on the toes and good quick calling"
"<strong>bowled him for his 500th wicket!</strong> What a way to get there! A big inswinger, the first he's served up in the innings, demolishing the base of middle stump as Brathwaite plays all round it! A standing ovation for England's greatest wicket-taker, and a Kodak moment to cherish as well!"
through to the keeper outside off stump
"banged in short, climbing through to the keeper, no stroke offered"
<B>edged and dropped!</B> Stokes of all people at fourth slip! It's missed his hands and hit him in the chest ... he simply didn't sight that one...
"banged in short, outside off, Powell resists the nibble"

worked into the leg side
"Broad knows! That's plumb lbw, he doesn't even turn to look as he begins his celebrations... but <B>Hope has reviewed</B>.. was there an inside-edge? Nope, not a sausage!
