"this time he's walking back. Played for the turn when there was none, hit on the pad as this drifted back in a long way and held its line. Didn't have too much distance to the leg stump. He was also deep inside the crease, perhaps why Warner didn't review this one."

"absolute hara-kiri this. What was Khawaja thinking? He dabs this away gently with his pad towards short cover, looks for a single and is halfway down the pitch when he is sent back. Mushfiqur does superbly to hare across the turf, takes his glove off and fires a throw on the turn to the keeper's end, where Soumya Sarkar collects the wayward throw and then dives forward and flicks the ball back onto the stumps.

Flight on middle and leg, Smith advances, gets to the pitch but rather inexplicably misses the ball. Hits the leg stump. He tried to whip the ball with as little of the bat as possible, which resulted in a big bat-pad gap. The ball found it, and introduced itself to the stumps."

Umpire Dar reverses his decision and sends Tamim on his way. What a prancing delivery! Good overhead catch from Wade - he just rose with the ball, which had brushed the glove of Tamim.

driven firmly but straight to cover
"skids on outside off, keeps a touch low, Wade sits deep in the crease, and inside-edges it onto the ground. Fortunately for Wade, it did not roll back onto the stumps"
"pushed through on off, full, Wade had a short stride as he defends it to forward short leg"
"spins in on off, defended with the spin just wide of leg slip"
"<strong>It's that man Shakib again</strong>! Wade has been trapped in front. He challenges the on-field out decision - though this looks plumb. Pretty full and skids in on middle from over the wicket. A crease-bound Wade is beaten on the inside edge, having played around his front pad. The tracker suggests it would have gone onto crash into leg stump. Dar gets it right again; Australia have exhausted their reviews"
"Shakib draws an lbw appeal straightaway. Tossed up and spins in to catch the front pad, but this would have broke past leg"
"straight ball on off, inches forward and blocks"

"tossed on middle, toe-ends a drive to mid-off"
"nice dip, defended on middle"
"length ball, drifts in and breaks away, <strong>catches the back thigh of Cummins</strong> as he plays inside the line. Bangladesh have reviews, so why not take it! Impact in line but this seems to be missing off stump? The tracker, though, returns umpire's call on off stump. Umpire Llong's not-out decision is upheld. Both sides have lost their reviews"
"drifts in from wide of the crease, then breaks away viciously with loads of extra bounce. Cummis did well to play inside the line. Mushfiq is beaten as well as the ball jumps into the hands of slip"
"got him first ball after lunch. <b> That's a five-for, Shakib you beauty. </b> Maxwell goes back to cut, this ball pitches on middle and spins away a wee bit, keeps a touch low, the thin inside edge crashes into the stumps. The man who stood int he way of Bangladesh and victory is gone. And he's walking back ever-so-slowly."
gets a good stride forward and defends

"another brave sweep, this was full on middle from around the stumps, down to Mustafizur at deep backward square leg"
"no reviews left. Big, big appeal. Cummins is struck on the pad as the ball drifts back into middle. May have gone down leg, height may have been an issue as well."
right behind the line of the ball as he defends to the off side
"nice flight on the stumps from around the wicket, blocked"
gets to the pitch of the ball and eases this to the off side

"<b> played all around that in-drifter </b> but umpire Aleem Dar isn't convinced. Another appeal, a big one at that. May have been sliding down leg. Cummins was better off trying to play straight rather than try and whip through midwicket"

"fired full outside off, Cummins gets forward and blocks"
"once again too full, not doing enough to get the ball to deviate. Kept out easily"
"thrashed into the point boundary. Tracer bullet stuff. Rocked back, freed his arms and slapped this between cover and point"
tentative forward push to this full ball on middle
<b> dropped! </b> Soumya couldn't take it on the rebound this time. Cummins lunges forward but the ball dips on him and takes the glove. Reared up dangerously. Soumya anticipated the move to his right but timed his jump wrong. Could only get his fingertips on it the first time as he palmed it up.

looks to play a premeditated sweep. The ball kicks up from length and <strong>hits his back protection that flies off the helmet.</strong>

"tossed up and dips on off, Lyon aims a sweep, hits it along the ground to backward square leg"
"Mehedi returns and provides Bangladesh the breakthrough. Full offbreak, finishes on middle, bounces, balloons off the glove. Sarkar at first slip follows the ball to his left and clings onto the overhead catch on the rebound. Excellent reflexes. The sweep-happy Lyon is gone, and <strong>Bangladesh are just one away</strong>"

"#Scenes in Mirpur! Taijul pins Hazlewood in front and wraps up a famous win for Bangladesh. They beat Australia for the first time <i>ever</i> in Test cricket! Tossed up and turns into the left-hander, from around the wicket, Hazlewood plays down the wrong line and is rapped on the front pad in line with middle. That's plumb. Hazlewood signals for a review, but Australia have none left. It's all over in Mirpur. What a match"
