"full and straight to start, and Masvaure is right behind it to defend, though without much in the way of foot movement"
"this one shoots across him, Masvaure raising his hands high to let it through. Good carry through to the 'keeper"
"again this angles across him, but this time Masvaure puts bat to ball, forcing it away towards point"
"just short of a good length, and he stands up tall to defend to cover"
"this one slips out full and on his legs, but Masvaure can't quite put it away, picking out midwicket with a flick off his toes"
"Masvaure's judgement is good as he once again leaves a ball that angles across him and past the off stump, and a maiden to start"
"lift and movement outside off! Kasuza fishes at this one outside off, and is fortunate not to get an edge on it as the ball nips past him. Plenty of encouragement from behind the stumps"
and now Kasuza holds his hands inside the line to another delivery that leaves him outside off
"aimed at the midriff, Kasuza hopping back and tucking defensively to leg"
"shaping away gently outside off, from a slightly fuller length, and Kasuza is happy to let it go"
"full again, and curving away from the right hander. Kasuza has a good look and shoulders arms"
that's a better line! He shifts closer to off stump to get Kasuza playing and missing at a length delivery that leaves him off the pitch
"<b>big appeal</b> as this one cuts in to the left-hander, touching something on the way through to the 'keeper! But was it bat? The umpire doesn't think so. And in the end, neither do Bangladesh, who decide against a review. And replays confirm that the ball only touched his thigh"
"pushed across him, a touch wider, and it's left on the angle"
"Masvaure throws his hands out a slightly wider delivery, hitting the ball hard into the turf to be stopped at gully"
"<b>beaten on the outside edge!</b> Masvaure's feet are stuck in the crease as Ebadat aims a little fuller, with a testing line"
"nicely full once again, and a tentative drive is intercepted in the covers"
"Zimbabwe are yet to open their account as we come to the end of the third over, Masvaure leaving well alone outside off"
"outswinger, pitched full but too wide to get Kasuza playing at it"
"this one he aims at the off stump, testing Kasuza's defence as the ball keeps a shade low"
"in the channel, outside off and leaving him towards the slips. Kasuza steps towards the ball, but flicks his hands up to leave at the last moment"
"<b>beaten!</b> Gem of a delivery from Abu Jayed, angling the ball in only to shape it away from Kasuza's outside edge"
"slightly wider this time, and Kasuza leaves well alone"
"variation from the bowler as this one nips in a touch from outside off, but Kasuza spots it and gets behind the ball to defend. Still no runs though"
"Ebadat gets Masvaure playing, the left hander standing in the crease to defend a length delivery to point"
"whoa! This one slips out very wide, and goes even further outside off. Wide, calls the umpire, and Zimbabwe are off the mark with an extra"
"nice comeback from the bowler, hurrying Masvaure with a length that rises to sting him on the thigh. Pitching outside leg though, so there's no appeal. Also quite high"
"Masvaure is up on his toes to thump a cut to point, where the fielder pulls off a diving stop to keep the pressure on the batsmen"
"<b>bouncer</b>, but Masvaure spots it early, dropping to his knees as the ball shoots over his head"
"short once again, but wider outside off and Masvaure drops his hands as he ducks underneath it"
"on his legs, but Masvaure is hurried a little by the pace, wearing another one on the thigh as he shapes to nudge to midwicket"
"loose from Kasuza! A length ball shapes away from him outside off and he thrusts the hands out at it, fortunate not to get the edge"
"how do you play that? Abu Jayed aims this one full, angling the ball in and then jagging it away through the air. Kasuza gropes at it and is comprehensively beaten"
"straighter now, and this one holds its line to both Kasuza's pads, but the bat comes down in time and he defends to leg"
"a touch too straight once again, Kasuza's soft flick being easily intercepted at midwicket"
"still no runs! And another cracking delivery from Abu Jayed, who hits the channel outside off and zips an outswinger past Kasuza's outside edge"
"wider outside off this time, but Kasuza's patience holds and he won't be tempted, raising his hands to leave"
"<b>runs, finally!</b> Ebadat aims full outside off, and Masvaure leans into a languid cover drive, threading the gap and getting a solid connection"
"having just been driven, he pulls his length back, Masvaure making sure to get his hands and the bat out of the way as he leaves it well alone"
"again Ebadat angles a length delivery across the left hander, and Masvaure leaves once more"
"full and straight, and it's tapped back to the bowler defensively"
"<b>cuts him in half!</b> A leaden-footed Masvaure is caught in the crease but one that seams in to him, the ball missing bat, pads and stumps on its way through the the keepers. Plenty of chatter from the slip cordon"
"and a patient leave ends the over, this one aimed wider outside off"
"<b>beaten</b>, for the umpteenth time! Good areas, as they say, and Kasuza looks all at sea as the ball hits a length, on off stump, to draw the stroke, and then hoops away to beat him"
"speared in towards the pads, and he tucks it softly to midwicket"
"full again, but this is much too wide outside off to get Kasuza playing"
"the bowler re-adjusts, but rather over eggs his effort and shoots this one down the leg side"
"runs off the bat! Kasuza is finally off the mark to the 23rd ball he faces, flicking a straight length delivery off his hip and out through square leg for a brace"
"<b>plucked out of the air in the gully!</b> Kasuza is off the mark, and out immediately afterwards. Abu Jayed has repeatedly tested his outside edge this morning, and once again he hits a perfect length outside off. Kasuza has to play at it, but he's suckered by the movement and a thick edge is well pouched at gully. A just rewards after a thoroughly disciplined effort. This is Abu Jayed's 250th First Class wicket"
"full on off stump, and Masvaure steps forward to give it a firm thump - but aims the stroke straight at mid off"
"this one slips towards his pads, and Masvaure flicks it into the ground before Mushfiqur Rahim stops the ball at short leg - and a very deep short leg at that. A somewhat unusual position for him, but Liton Das has the gloves for this match"
"there's half an appeal as ball strikes pad, but it's pitched well outside leg. Possibly a touch high too"
"change of angle as Ebadat switches to around the stumps, but the line is wide outside off and is easily left alone"
""
"angling in towards the stumps, and Masvaure gets himself right behind the line to defend"
"on a length, in the channel on or around off stump, and it's defended back down the track"
"pushed across him, quite wide and going further with the angle. Ervine needn't have played at it, but thrusts his hands out at the ball and is fortunate not to edge the ball"
"pushed across him again, but much too wide this time, well outside off. Second wide of the morning"
"Ervine is off the mark with a push through cover. Not the greatest connection on the drive, and a very woody sound as bat hits ball, but he finds the gap and scurries through"
"surprise yorker from Abu Jayed, but it's not quite on the mark and Masvaure digs it out in good time"
"another yorker, but at no great pace at slightly over 124km/h, and it's pressed firmly towards mid on"
"length delivery, but it's well wide of him outside off and Masvaure's patience holds as he lets it go past him"
"looped up on middle and leg, Ervine stepping forward to drive to mid on"
"some grip and turn outside off, and Ervine is <b>beaten</b> as he pokes forward in defence. But his back leg was firmly grounded in the crease"
"straighter this time, and it's defended back to the bowler"
"turn and bounce once again, but it's wide enough outside off that Ervine can easily leave it alone"
"spinning away from the left hander, outside off, and again it's left"
"this one lands closer to the off stump and doesn't turn quite as much, but Ervine is in no trouble as he raises his hands to leave it alone"
"<b>slashed down to third man!</b> The ball was short and wide, but Masvaure was not in full control as he flung his hands out wildly at the ball. A thick edge balloons over the slips and bounces down to the boundary"
"<b>big appeal!</b> Abu Jayed launches an emotive appeal to the umpire as ball hits pad, on the full from around the stumps, but Joel Wilson isn't interested. Probably heading down leg on that angle"
"has Masvaure been rattled a little? Abu Jayed aims full outside off and he aims a booming drive at it, but hits only fresh air"
"a touch wider outside off, and this one he leaves alone"
"Abu Jayed looks to trouble the pads again, but his radar goes awry and the ball slips down the leg side"
"probing line, in the channel outside off, but Masvaure's judgement is good as he raises his hands over the ball and leaves well alone"
"<b>beaten!</b> Nayeem hustles to the crease and delivers a flighted offbreak that drifts in to draw a defensive push from Ervine, but then grips and breaks away to beat his outside edge"
"Ervine bends down low to sweep, getting very close to the ball to negate the spin, and times the shot to perfection to get his first boundary and send a firm riposte to the bowler"
"straight, full, and it's defended"
solid defence from Ervine once again
"quicker through the air, and hurrying on with the arm as Ervine defends"
"runs! Ervine again sets himself to sweep, and both the keeper and slip hurry towards the leg side, preempting the stroke. But the ball dips and grips to beat the stroke, and with the keeper and slip both out of position it bounces down to the boundary. Everybody was deceived by that one"
"full, aimed at the pads, and it's defended into the leg side"
"Masvaure laces a firm drive out to long on, who is close to the boundary"
"Ervine uses his feet to get to the pitch, turning the strike over with another single down to long on"
"there's some excitement at the crease as Masvaure leans back and whips into the leg side, not all that far from the man lurking under the helmet at short leg"
"a touch too straight, and he's worked with the spin into the leg side for a single"
"pushed down the leg side, and Masvaure helps it on its way with a little paddle sweep"

"length, around off, and he opts to leave as it spins past him"
presses forward to defend a length ball
"fuller, and he drives this hard, but cannot beat cover"

"short, and he hops and punches it towards point"
"fuller length, angles in to him, and he defends with a little forward press"
"back of a length, and he jabs this towards point. There's a direct hit at the stumps at the striker's end, but Masvaure wasn't really going anywhere. Lucky for Bangladesh, the ricochet doesn't go for runs"
"full, angles in, and he flicks this uppishly, but the vacant square leg region. Tamim Iqbal at long leg moves across to his right to cut this off"
"length, around off, and he drives this straight back towards the bowler. Fielded at mid-off"
"<strong>off the edge, but short of slip!</strong> Ervine presses forward to defend one pitching around off. It spins off the edge, and bounces on its way through to the lone slip"
presses forward to defend a length ball around off
"<strong>beaten again!</strong> Tossed up, and he presses forward to defend. Bounces around off, and spins across"
"defended off the crease, with the turn"

"back of a length, <strong>bowled at 134.1kph</strong>, and Ervine defends from the crease with a little hop to negotiate the bounce"

"around off, and he presses forward to defend towards point"
"shorter, and he goes back to punch this short of cover. Easy single taken with a quick call between the batsmen"
"fuller, down the leg side, and he allows this to run off his bat towards short fine leg. They pinch another quick single"
"<strong>very lucky!</strong> And on two counts! Ervine skips down the wicket, but skews another intended lofted drive. Goes in the air, but just to the left of Rahim at cover. And they go for a quick single, and he just about makes it at the non-striker's end. Ervine leading a charmed life!"
"length, punched back towards the bowler"
"length, <strong>stops a bit</strong>, and he ends up defending with the ball carrying on in the air for a brief while before settling harmlessly along the middle of the pitch"

"poor ball, full and down the leg side. Tries the conventional sweep, but ends up playing this along the ground to short fine leg"
"length, goes back and plays this with the turn towards square leg. Will be relieved to have gotten off strike!"
"fuller, and he flicks this to the left of short mid-wicket. Easy single"
"skips down the wicket, and drives this with the turn, hoping to play it towards long-on. Intercepted by a short mid-on in place, diving away to his right"
"this time, he plays the <strong>lap sweep to perfection</strong>! Top shot, because he fetches this from outside off, and uses the pace on the ball to guide it fine, past short fine leg. The outfield is a quick one here in Mirpur"
"Masvaure uses his feet this time, and also moves across to the on side to open up a bit of room. Drives this hard towards mid-off"
"lofted, and straight back over the bowler. This didn't go off the middle, but with mid-off in place, a safe shot. Went high, but importantly got some distance as well. Couple of bounces and through for four at long-off"

"flighted around off, and he defends with a forward press. Bowled at just 84.7kph"

"line around leg stump, and he can easily nudge this towards square leg"
"fuller, straighter, and he defends with a straight bat"

"length, defended back towards the bowler with the turn into him"
"looks to sweep a fuller ball. Fired in a touch quicker, and also going down leg, as he misses out on contact"
"full, down the leg side, and he'll be disappointed he has whipped this straight towards short fine-leg. A foot either side, and that would have been four"

"length, beats an <strong>outstretched defensive prod</strong>!"
"length, around off, and he allows this to run off his bat towards where short leg was earlier"
"length, and he pushes this towards mid-on. Mominul Haque has to run to this quickly to fire in a throw at the striker's end as they look to pinch a single. <strong>Referred for a run-out</strong>, but the throw was quite high. Liton had to bring this down"

"nice flight, the ball drifting in towards middle stump. Masvaure is defensively forward"
"nudged just wide of mid on, and the call for a quick single comes early. Good running"

"well forward this time, and he defends a full one into the leg side"
"<b>fifty up for Masvaure!</b> And it comes with a very neat straight drive. His eyes light up at the full length, but he doesn't over hit it, keeping his shape and sending the ball straight of a diving mid on. His second fifty in Test cricket, and a vital one for Zimbabwe"
"immediate riposte! Abu Jayed finds a better length, and a more testing line, Masvaure playing inside the ball as it holds its line outside off. <b>Beaten</b>"
"a shade wider, from around the stumps, and Masvaure's not interested, leaving well alone"
"<b>and through cover point now!</b> The bowler aims full, and Masvaure gets his feet moving to get in line, whipping his hands through the ball and lacing the stroke through the gap"

"Abu Jayed switches back over the stumps, Masvaure leaning into another drive that finds the cover fielder"
"landing very close to him, Ervine driving hard back to the bowler"
"this one squares him up a touch, the ball spinning across him and squirting off the outer half of a defensive push before rolling to cover"

"another one angled across him, another leave"
"full again, and he leans into a crunching drive that picks out the extra cover fielder"
"well, this one keeps a little low, dying on its way through to the keeper, but it was wide outside off so Masvaure was in no real danger"
"Abu Jayed tests Masvaure's patience a little more, with a length delivery going across him, and the result is another leave"
"down the track comes Ervine, getting right to the pitch and whipping it through the leg side. Deep midwicket is in place to clean up"

"full, and it's firmly pressed back to the bowler, who stops it cleanly"

"Masvaure hangs back, angling the turning ball down towards slip"
"<b>dropped!</b> Masvaure stepped down at him and chipped a return catch back at Nayeem. He jumped at the chance, getting a hand to it, but just couldn't cling on. A tough chance, but a regulation one at this level. That was the chance Bangladesh were waiting for"

"<b>edged!</b> Masvaure came down the track and thrust his hands out at this one as it broke away from him, the ball taking a thin edge and flying past the keeper, but landing short of the tumbling slip fielder. Or did it? In fact <b>that carried, and was dropped</b>. It's Shanto at slip, and he may well have been slightly put off by Liton's effort to catch it.

"full, outside off, and he just lofts this over extra cover. One bounce four, and this is poor bowling from Taijul. Just not been able to stem the flow of runs. Either too full, or poor lengths!"
"better length, and he forces Taylor to defend with a little forward press"
"full again, and he drives this past the bowler towards long-off"
"full, and he strays down the leg side this time. Ervine gets a sweep going, and fine leg cannot reel this in. In fact, he dives just over the ball, and watches helplessly as it hits the skirting"
"a bit short, and he punches this past cover for a couple"
defends a length ball outside off
"<strong>is that a drop?</strong> Looks to go fine with the reverse sweep, and this goes into the keeper's gloves, and then pops out. Might have just missed the edge of the bat, but that was far too close to try and sweep as fine as he looking to get that towards third man"
"<b>oh, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me!</b> There's a slip in place, and Taylor goes for the reverse sweep again. It goes far too fine, and actually gets <b>deflected again off the inside of the bat</b> and then hits the base of off-stump. That's poor shot selection from such a senior member of the Zimbabwe batting lineup. Bangladesh and Nayeem continue to claw back!"

"fuller length, driven towards mid-off"

"length, and he rocks back and punches this towards cover-point"
"full, down the leg side, and he tries the sweep. Liton Das pre-empts this and gets this in time to collect as Ervine misses"

"length, down the leg side, and he plays this towards square leg"
"fuller, and towards middle and leg, and he turns it with the tide towards square leg again"
"<strong>good ball!</strong> Just holds the length back, as Ervine stretches to defend. Pitches on off, and spins and bounces a bit extra, and he defends this well"
"pulls out the reverse sweep to a fullish ball, and gets it fine towards third man"
"length, speeds on after pitching around off, and Raza does well to defend this from the crease"
presses forward to block one closer to off stump
"length, turns across him at good pace, and he goes back to defend this towards gully"
"uses his feet to get close to the pitch of the ball, and defends"
"length, straighter, and he defends with a forward press"
"full, down the leg side, and he tries the cute lap sweep. That misses his bat, pad, and hits Liton Das' left pad as the keeper skips across to his right to stop it. <strong>Wasn't far from the leg stump</strong>, as a matter of fact! And Liton could also have effected a stumping, because Ervine had stretched well outside his crease!"

"tossed up around middle, and he stretches forward to defend"
"length, and he allows this to straighten, before blocking with a straight bat"
"short, and he goes back and whips this wide of deep mid-wicket. Two called for, and they rush through for the second quite easily in the end"
"length, and he goes back to punch this towards cover"
presses forward and defends one around off
"length, and he goes back to cut this. <strong>Plays this off the inside edge</strong>, and it goes back to strike his leg. Ah, could have chopped this on to his stumps on another day!"
"full, on the stumps, and allows him to paddle this down towards fine leg"
"length, and he punches this towards cover. Was looking to skip down the wicket, and Taijul just held the length back a touch"

"length, and he presses forward to defend"
"fired quicker, and he presses forward to defend this"
"fired in flatter, and towards leg stump, and he punches this towards short mid-wicket"
"full, towards leg stump, and he sweeps this down towards fine leg. There's a <strong>direct hit</strong> at the striker's end, but I think they have made this for two. Yes, he knew exactly what he was doing, and had his bat grounded well inside when that hit the stumps"

"fuller, and he drives this towards mid-on"
"length, punched towards cover, where Nayeem does well to dive away to his left and save his team three"
"length, just a hint of movement off the seam back into him from outside off, and he does well to adjust and keep this out"
"looped up very full outside off, Raza lunges forward to defend to cover"
"breaking gently in towards Raza, who hangs back and pushes to mid on"
"again Raza's on the back foot, but this time he's tested by one that fizzes in a little more sharply"
"full, straight, and defended back at him"
"Raza waits in the crease, exposing his pads, but his defence holds firm against an offbreak"
"<b>too full, thrashed through cover</b>. Nayeem's not bowled too many loose deliveries, but this was one. Right up to Raza, who held nothing back on the drive. Spanked"
"full, and Ervine is forward to defend to leg"
"down the track comes Ervine, meeting it on the full and easing it down to long on"
"nicely full, Raza stretches well forward to smother it"
"off the outer half of the bat as Taijul gets this one to grip, but it's played with soft hands and goes quickly to ground"
"looped up on the toes, but Ervine's flick finds midwicket"
Ervine is forward and across to defend this right under the eyes
"he comes around the stumps, and immediately creates something with some drift across Raza, who plays for turn and is <b>beaten on the drive</b>"
"fuller this time, and Raza launches into a drive - but there's cover in the deep for that shot"
"there's the reverse sweep, an he aims it into a sparsely populated cover field but picks out the man to perfection"
"full, pushed defensively back at the bowler"
"<b>in the air, but safe!</b> Ervine gets away with another one, skipping out and looking to attack the legside field, he gets a huge leading edge that swirls into the sky ... but evades the man running back from cover. Nayeem's created chances all day"
"full, patted softly back at him"
Ervine gets to the pitch and eases one down to long on
"<b>We've got a review here</b>. Raza gets himself into an awful tangle attempting a paddle sweep, and he's struck on the pad - or is it the glove - close to the stumps. They wait until the very last moment before asking for the review. But the replays only serve to show that the ball conclusively touched his glove. Not out"
"<b>keeps low!</b> Raza is playing the spinners from deep in his crease, and this one almost created problems for him as it rushed on low, testing a jabbing defence"
this time he's forward to defend
and he lunges well forward once again to smother it
"flashing cut as Taijul offers width, but he cracks it straight to point"
"pressed defensively towards short leg, who is very close in"
"looped up on middle and off, Ervine's forward to defend"
"just a touch too short, but there's no harm done as Ervine punches to cover"
"again Ervine hangs back, but this time he threads the gap for a quick single"
"defended to short leg, on the bounce. The fielder hurls a shy at the non-striker's stumps, hoping to catch Ervine out of his crease, but he's home"
"pushed at mid off, Raza playing from deep inside the crease"
"around the stumps comes Taijul, Ervine pressing a full one back at him"
"floated up on his toes now, and Ervine's flick is stopped by a diving square leg fielder. Again there's a shy at the non-striker"
"tip-and-run single, forward of point. Sharp running"
"some dip and grip, but Raza is well forward to keep it out"
"lunging forward defence from Raza, stretching out to get close to the ball"
and he's nicely forward to keep this one out as well
"flighted up temptingly above the eyeline, but Ervine is resolute in defence"
"full, on middle and off, and Ervine pokes it back defensively"
"there's a highly optimistic cry of 'catch it!' as Ervine presses forward to defend to the leg side, but it was nowhere near short leg"
"again someone asks for the ball to be caught, though this time Ervine drives it straight into the ground and to the left of mid on, who was just too deep to stop the single"
"Nayeem comes around the stumps to Raza, who defends the ball firmly into the ground at his feet. 'Catch it!' comes the call ..."
"full, this one drifting out slightly wider outside off. Raza pushes out in that direction to meet it, defending to cover"
"<b>picked up over wide long on!</b> Ervine dances out, getting close to it, and then whips across it using plenty of bottom hand, playing with the turn. There's another cry of 'catch it!' and there are indeed two men out on the leg side, but it flies over the boundary"
"<b>was there something on this?</b> Ervine pokes forward to defend, and the ball balloons off the pad to be caught at the leg gully. But that seems to have come off the pad alone"
"chipped into space on the leg side, and an easy single"
"<b>crunched over mid on!</b> Raza has been playing inside himself, but now he steps out to unleash a big drive over mid on. It clears the fielder, but lands in front of the rope"
"the follow-up is lunging forward defence, Taijul offering a little less flight on this one"
"punched to cover, off the back foot"
"drifting down the leg side, from around the stumps, and Ervine helps it on its way with a neat leg glance"
"another attempted nudge to leg, but this one goes nowhere"
"great line, drawing him forward with one that lands on middle and off"
"Ervine stands in the crease and punches to cover, resting on the back foot"
"this keeps a touch low, but Ervine's seeing the ball really well now and taps it down towards slip"
"Ervine's on the front foot again, defending to leg"
"he starts with a bumper, slamming it down very short, and Raza is easily underneath it"
"a hint of width offered, but the stroke is bottom-edged and dies in the turf"
"the ball appears to be tailing in to the right hander, and Raza covers the movement with a defensive poke"
"yep, it's reversing. But Raza is, so far, equal to it, defending to cover"
"this one leaves the right hander, who isn't all that far forward but nevertheless smothers to cover"
"just short of a good length, and Raza hops to work it off his hip into the leg side"
"<b>edged, and gone!</b> Once again Nayeem is the one to break through for Bangladesh. He's been coming around the stumps to Raza, and from that line of attack he's pushed the odd one straight across him, while turning other deliveries. Raza played his one as if he was expecting turn, but it rushed straight on, brushing the edge and landing in the keeper's gloves"
"Nayeem stays around the stumps, drawing Maruma forward in defence"
"nudged softly towards short leg, the ball bouncing well in front of the fielder"
Maruma hangs back to defend it back at him
"and now he's forward, smothering the turn as Nayeem comes back over the stumps"
"pushed through with a little less flight, Maruma stepping forward to defend"
"there's a stifled appeal as Ervine is struck on the pad, but this is clearly well outside leg. They take a leg bye"
""
"interesting looking leave from Maruma, who twirls his bat past the ball as it dips past him outside off"
"this one nips back in to the right hander, Maruma getting back and across to defend"
"fuller, and attacking the stumps, but Maruma is nicely into line to defend"
"sharp movement in to him! Maruma saw the line, wide of off, and decided to leave, but the ball tailed sharply in to him at the last moment and isn't too far away from the off stump"
"full, on his toes, and he drives to mid on"
"Ervine charges down, getting right to the pitch and cracking the ball firmly and straight back over the bowler's head. Clean!"
"arm ball, pushed through much quicker, and Ervine flicks off his pads to turn the strike over"
"offbreak, and Maruma is forward to meet it"
"floated up a little too full, and Maruma is off the mark with a firm thump down to long on"
"pushed through flat once more, and Ervine stays back to defend"
"shaping in to the right hander, but misdirected down the leg side"
"snaking in through the air again, and Maruma jabs watchfully into the leg side"
"drifting in towards his pads, and Maruma glances firmly but straight to square leg"
"on a length and tailing in, but it's wide enough outside off for Maruma to safely leave it alone"
"full, attacking the stumps, but Maruma presents the full face to keep it out"
"again Ebadat hurls one down full, Maruma glancing to midwicket"
"speared in towards the pads, Ervine's glance hits the field"
"Ervine's forward and across, defending a full one to leg"
"there's that reverse sweep once again from Ervine, and he gets a good connection but will collect only a single - there's a man out in the deep for the shot"
"Taijul comes around, and Maruma lunges well forward to defend"
"attacking his pads, but Maruma defends it straight down"
"pushed through a little fuller, dug out into the leg side"
"he comes around the stumps, but it's well wide of off and left alone"
"<b>slashed behind point!</b> Ervine was offered width, and threw himself into the stroke, bending low and scything the ball fine of the cover sweeper. He's into the 80s now"
"<b>thumped through cover now!</b> Full and wide once again, and Ervine flings a drive at it - but doesn't bother to keep it down. This wasn't all that far away from a diving extra cover fielder, but he manages to place it past the man and collect another boundary"
"Abu Jayed tightens his line, and shortens his length, after those two drives. Ervine stands at the crease and pushes it back to him"
"Ervine's forward to drive, but the ball is mistimed off the inside half of the bat"
"full, tailing in to him from around the stumps, and it's nudged to midwicket"
"length, defends stretching forward a touch"
"that's gone on with the arm, and he's been <strong>given leg before</strong>. Chooses to review this. This was tossed up outside off, and he let it pass and hit his pad. Impact may not be a question, as a result. Has to hit the stumps, and it will stay with umpire's call then. First look - it might be a very good review. I think this is missing off stump! Oh, and it's missing by a comfortable margin. Good decision to go with the TV umpire!"
"tossed up, straighter, and he stretches out to defend"
defends with a forward press
"chips down the wicket, and plays this towards Tamim Iqbal at mid-off. He has to run around to his left before releasing the throw, and they take advantage of that little split second to pinch one"
"full toss, along the leg side, and he sweeps this towards long leg"
"length, and he pushes forward to drive this towards mid-off"
"length, outside off, and he leaves"
"full, slants down leg side, and he whips it away towards fine leg"
"fuller length, around off, and he leaves"
"fuller length, and he presses forward to defend this"
"length, jags back in a touch, and he defends"
"full, down the leg side, and he sweeps but misses out on contact. Leg slip in place for that shot too"
nudges a length ball towards square leg
stretches forward to play one with the turn from outside off towards square leg
presses forward to defend a length ball on the stumps. Goes towards square leg yet again
"fuller, wider, and he can play the reverse sweep. More of a reverse paddle, and gets it towards third man. <strong>On to 90!</strong>"
"length, and he skips down the wicket. Drives it to Tamim Iqbal at mid-off, and picks up a single with some earnest running"
"length, a bit of reverse back in from outside off, but gentle at just <strong>124.8kph</strong>, and he drives to covers"
"full toss, on the pads, and he just whips this away. May have been looking for the yorker, but ended up bowling a juicy full ball. Dispatched through the mid-wicket region"
"length, around off, a bit of movement back in, and he covers the line to defend"
"zips back in from outside off again, and he defends towards short mid-wicket"
"close, and <strong>given out leg before</strong>! The batsmen have a conference, and this time Ervine seems reluctant to have Maruma send this up. Eventually, he does, though. This looked quite close at first glance, to be honest! Fullish length, and he made the mistake of playing back. It did tail in a bit after pitching around off. The fact that he has been given out might count against Maruma. No inside edge, and that goes on to hit the top of leg stump, about three-quarters of the way. <strong>Perfect from Abu Jayed!</strong>"
"length, some movement back in, but he covers the movement with a forward stride and blocks"
"length, down the leg side, and <strong>keeps low</strong> as Ervine looks to flick this away. Just hits Das' pads on the way through"
"fuller, and he flicks this away towards mid-wicket. Saif Hassan dives away to his left to stop this, but cannot bring up a single to <strong>bring up Zimbabwe's 200</strong>!"
"length, and he presses forward to defend"
"length, turns across him, and he defends from the crease. Had to adjust late to cover the turn on that"
"flighted, around leg stump, and he defends with a little forward press"
"a bit short, and he is content to block this, stretching forward"
"looks for the yorker, just outside off, and Evans drives hard. Goes to cover"
"fuller length, and he drives this hard towards mid-off"
"length, but drifts down leg, and he flicks this away towards long leg"

"length, and he stretches forward to defend"
"length, and he drives this back towards the bowler"
"fuller, and he presses forward to drive this back to the bowler"
"length, angles in, and he defends"
"length, turns a bit extra, and <strong>beats the outside edge</strong>. Ervine looks to chase it, but to be fair to him, he plays this with bat close to body"
"throws his hands at one slightly wider. <strong>This is fidgety from Ervine</strong>. Thankfully, it goes on the bounce towards point"
"length, outside off, and he leaves as this shapes further away"
"length, angles in, and it goes of the inside of the bat towards square leg. Mominul runs across from short mid-wicket to his right, and Ervine recognizes this to pinch a single. Sensible running, as Mominul throws with his left"
"fuller length, a touch wider, looks to entice Ervine to poke at it, but he just watches it go past"
"fuller length, a bit of shape back in from outside off, and forces Ervine to drive this towards mid-on. <strong>Much better ball!</strong>"
"tails in from outside off, and he drives this full ball towards that man who's just moved to short mid-wicket"
"<strong>shot!</strong> For a change, Jayed throws this a touch wide, and Ervine's eyes light up. He shapes himself beautifully, and gracefully drives this through covers. No chance for mid-off, who can only watch and admire that piece of timing from the Zimbabwe captain"
"length, and he walks across to defend this. Turns across him and strikes him high on the thigh pad. A loud appeal to begin with, but that dissipates soon from Nayeem"
"length, and he defends this off the back foot"
"length, played with the turn towards a man at square leg"
"turns into him from outside off, and he goes back to use the depth of the crease, and drives this down with the turn towards deep mid-on"
"length, and he plays the lap sweep towards fine leg. Abu Jayed has to run around to his left, and then rifles in a throw, but they run quick and hard to complete two"
"sweeps a fuller ball around the pads, and this time it goes straighter to Abu Jayed"
"length, but down the pads, and he can whip this away, standing tall. There's an easy two, and he pumps his fist as he <strong>completes two</strong>!"
"short, and well wide of off, and he lets this pass"
"a touch short, as it angles across him, and he defends towards point"
"length, but way wide. Called a wide too this time, as Das collects in front of second slip"
"<strong>oh, good ball!</strong> Delivered at 132.4kph, but more than that, the line and length. Just a bit short, but full enough to keep Ervine rooted to the crease. Nips across him, and beats the outside edge as he pokes at it"
"length, but width on offer, and he clubs this through the extra cover region. Abu Jayed is at deep point, and does well to cut this off, running around to his left and bending low"
"length ball, lifts after pitching outside off, and he plays inside the line of this. He's been beaten a few times today, but what's been good to see is how he's gone on to face the next ball without any baggage from the previous ones"
"length, pushes this down towards deep mid-on and picks up an easy single to Taijul Islam stationed there"
"tossed up, and he defends this with a forward press"
tosses this up and he drives this wide of mid-off
"fired in a touch, and he goes back to defend this"
"tosses this up, and he lets this pass outside off"
stretches forward to defend a straighter one
"tosses this up, wide of off, and Chakabva thrashes this through the cover region. <strong>Bad ball again from Taijul!</strong>"
"tosses this up further, virtually a slow, looping yorker, and he drives this towards mid-off"
"fuller, and he flicks this away towards long leg"
"fires this in quicker, and he plays it with the angle towards short fine leg. Wide of the man there, and an easy single can be taken"
"short, and he goes back and whips this away with the turn, pitching around middle and leg as it is, towards long leg"
"length, goes back in with the angle, and he presses forward to block this"
"full, driven back towards Nayeem, who fields away to his right"
"<strong>oh, what a ball!</strong> Floated up around leg and middle, and doesn't turn as much as Ervine hopes for. He plays this with a forward stretch, but his head falls over a bit as he tries to drive straight. Hits the back leg, and goes on to rattle the stumps. Nayeem Hasan is cockahoop, and Bangladesh know this is one decisive blow they have landed close to stumps!"
"length, turns in from outside off, and he goes back to defend this"
"length, he plays for the turn, and it goes past his outside edge. Das whips the bails off, but he's rooted inside the crease"
presses forward to defend this
"length, and he presses forward to defend this"
"tossed up around off, and he lets this pass"
"fired in straighter, and he stretches forward to defend this with a forward press"
"length, and he stretches well forward to defend this with a dead bat"
"length, straight, and he defends closer to the crease this time. Allows the ball to pitch, turn, and then nudges it towards the on side"
presses foward to smotehr a length ball
"fires this down the leg side, and he looks to flick this away. Off the thigh pad, and through towards the fine leg boundary. Pulled back in, but symbolic of how this day has gone for Taijul Islam!"
"no loosener for Abu Jayed, who immediately hits a testing line and length outside off stump. Nice shape on the ball too, and it zips past Tiripano as he keeps his bat inside the line"
"and again he beats the bat! Strong start, this. Slightly fuller this time, drawing the batsman forward only to beat him with some shape away"
"straighter this time, Tiripano driving hard at mid on"
"hooping away outside off, from a full length, and this one is left well alone"
"ah, the radar goes awry as this one is flung down the leg side"
"honing in on the off stump, Tiripano comes half forward to cover the movement in defence"
"around the stumps he comes, floating one up on middle and off. Solid defence"
"very generous flight on this one, Chakabva gets inside the line and drives inside out to deep mid off"
Tiripano comes well forward to defend
solid forward defensive the response to flight and turn
"a hint of inside edge on this one, but it goes safely to ground to the right of short leg"
Tiripano presents the full face to smother this back down the track
"beautiful shape on the ball! Abu Jayed steams in wide of the stumps, angling the ball in and then swinging it away at the last moment to <b>beat Chakabva's forward push</b>"
"in the channel once more, this time Chakabva gets right across to off stump to cover the movement and defends back down the track"
"a touch shorter, outside off, but at no great pace - around 121km/h"
"full, wide and shaping wider outside off. Chakabva won't be tempted"
"landing on a length outside off stump at 125km/h, Chakabva raises his hands to leave it alone"
"Abu Jayed stays in the channel, and another leave brings up a sixth maiden for him"
"landing on middle and leg, from outside off. Tiripano defends"
"<b>beaten!</b> Turn and bounce for Taijul, bursting the ball past the outside edge"
"zipped down the leg side, possibly an arm ball. Liton collects down leg as ball beats pad"
"pushed through a little flatter on off stump, solid forward defensive"
"<b>reverse sweep!</b> Where did that come from? Well, Ervine's not the only Zimbabwean who plays that shot, and Tiripano uses it to get off the mark, getting into position early and flicking the ball into the gap down to third man"
"arm ball, shaping in, but he's equal to it"
"outswinger, but it lands outside off and Chakabva wants no part of it, leaving well alone"
"fuller, straighter, and Chakabva stretches out to defend"
"nice away movement from a full length, but Chakabva's defence holds firm"
"Abu Jayed aims for the surprise yorker, but the line's not quite right and Chakabva sends it down to fine leg with a neat little glance"
"<b>edged, but in the gap!</b> There are two slips and a gully in place, and this has flown right between them. The ball was full, wide and swinging away as Tiripano leaned across to drive at it. But the movement meant he couldn't control the stroke. Fortunately for him, there's no-one at third slip"
"floated full on an off stump line, this time Tiripano's drive is rather more authoritative, but it's aimed straight at extra cover"
"a touch too short outside off, Chakabva leaning back to slap a cut just wide of point. Quick single"
"quicker, on off stump, and he stands up to push to cover"
"nicely bowled, on middle and leg, and he's forward to defend this time"
"full and straight again, Tiripano defending"
"flighted down on a leg stump line, a drive rolling straight to mid on"
"Taijul moves his line slightly wider outside off, and this one is well left"
"rising off a length, just outside off, Chakabva rolls his wrists over the ball to find space and a quick single on the leg side"
"shaping back in to the right hander this time, Tiripano keeping an eye on it and coming forward to defend"
"honing in on off stump, Tiripano gets behind it to defend"
"testing line, in the channel, and the ball squirts off the outer half of a defensive poke, rolling to point"
"<b>edged, gone!</b> Reward for some excellent swing bowling this morning. The ball was very full, right up to him, but that also gave it all the more opportunity to shape through the air. Tiripano is drawn forward into a drive, but the extravagant movement means he can only get a thin edge on the shot, the ball landing safely in the keeper's gloves. An early breakthrough for Bangladesh!"
"this is straighter, hits the seam and holds its line, Ndlovu stepping half forward to defend"
"quicker, on off stump, Chakabva pushing at it from the crease"
"flighted up full, from around the stumps, and he's forward to defend"
"on the mark, landing on middle and off, but Chakabva is firm in defence"
"<b>edged!</b> But it's well wide of slip, and to the right of backward point. There was some width, but Chakabva couldn't control the stroke as he thrust his hands out at it"
"<b>beaten!</b> Too good for Ndlovu, this. Landing on middle and off, the ball dips, grips and beats the outside edge"
"floated slightly wider, and this time he leaves well alone"
"Chakabva is forward, fetching a full one into space on the leg side to turn the strike over"
"<b>beaten on the outside edge!</b> The line, on off stump, draws him into the stroke, but the late movement means he's left groping at fresh air"
"<b>another play and miss!</b> Abu Jayed holds his line, in the channel, and once again the swing is too much for Ndlovu"
"<b>appeal, and given!</b> Ndlovu never looked comfortable, and Abu Jayed has made short work of him. This time he aims very full, attacking the pads. Ndlovu sets himself for a big flick to leg, but doesn't get close to the ball, which thuds into his front pad. That's adjacent, and there's no doubt in Umpire Paul Reiffel's mind as the finger is raised. Abu Jayed has his fourth!"
"full, just outside off, and he leaves it alone"
"length delivery, on off stump and swinging away at 126km/h. Safely negotiated by Tshuma"
"flight, on middle and off. Chakabva is forward to defend"
"drifts in to his pads, and Chakabva glances to leg, turning the strike over to Tshuma"
"flight, outside off, and he leaves it alone"
"<b>there goes another one!</b> Taijul strikes for the first time in the Test. This one landed straight and rushed on with the arm. Tshuma played outside it, expecting more turn, and he's rapped on the front pad. Big appeal, and given!"
"<b>beaten!</b> Turning away, outside off, and he pokes helplessly at it from the crease"
"fuller this time, pushed into the covers"
"pushed full and straight, Chakabva turning it to square leg. He turns down the single"
"rising off a shorter length, it comes off the hip and rolls into the leg side"
"swinging in at him, Chakabva gets across and glances to midwicket. Again he turns down the single"
"flicked off his pads, and this time he's happy to take the single. Nyauchi has two deliveries to survive"
"on a length, outside off, and Nyauchi goes fishing for it well away from the body. Lucky not to get an edge on that"
"<b>big inswinger!</b> Nyauchi's in some trouble as it zips back in to him, but manages to put some bat on the ball"
Chakabva defends from the crease
punched defensively to cover again
"back and across, solid defence"
"<b>and there's the big shot!</b> Chakabva bends down low and unfurls a powerful sweep, picking the gap behind square leg to find the boundary"
"he skips down the track, getting right to the pitch, and chips it down to long on for a single."
"<b>big appeal!</b> What's happened here? On first viewing, it looks like Nyauchi's flailing drive at the ball sends a big inside edge onto his boot. It then loops up to be easily caught by silly mid off. Joel Wilson isn't sure, he goes upstairs. The soft signal is not out. After several slow-mo replays, we can see that the inside edge has in fact hit the ground first, then the boot, before lobbing up to be caught. Not out"
"on a length, straight and Chakabva presents the full face to defend"
"fuller, wider, and it's left alone"
"some indecision from Chakabva, who pokes at a full one before deciding to pull his bat outside the line. The ball ricochets into the ground, rolling to slip"
"very full, and Chakabva stretches out to drive into the covers"
"on a length, shaping away, and he leaves it alone"
"this is fuller, attacking the stumps, and Nyauchi manages to get the bat down in time to keep it out"
"spinning in to Chakabva, who turns it off his hip, behind square"
"again he flicks behind square, turning down any thought of a single"
Chakabva moves back and across to defend
"big sweep! But he fails to lay bat on ball, the delivery spinning in to hit him on the body"
"spinning in quite sharply, Chakabva plays with the turn into the leg side"
fizzing sharply in off the track to beat Chakabva's forcing stroke into the leg side
"length, around off, nipping back in a touch, and he defends from the crease"
"length, a bit straighter, and he gets behind the line to defend"
"dug in short, and he <strong>plays a smart shot</strong>! Thinks about weaving out of the way, but then realises the line was outside off, and he just guides it over the slips cordon through to the unprotected third man region"
"short, angles in, and he biffs this away towards square leg"
"short, wide, and <em>very </em>wide! Chakabva seems to back away, trying to create room, and Jayed responds by putting this wide of off. Gets it all wrong"
"length, outside off, and given wide again. In his bid to keep Chakabva on strike, Jayed straying from his own fundamentals here..."
"length, wide outside off, and Chakabva looks to hit this hard through cover. Cannot beat the fielder there"
"a bit short, outside off, and he shuffles across and swivel-pulls this towards deep square leg. Good shot, but cannot retain strike for himself"
"length, around off, and Nyauchi goes back and punches this through the point region. They could have gone for two or three, but Chakabva settles for one to keep strike"
presses forward to smother one around off
pushes a length ball towards deep mid-wicket. Refuses the single
"length ball, and he defends from the crease"
tickles one around the corner with the turn towards deep square leg. Takes the one on offer
"length, and he goes back to defend"
"length, spins across him from outside off. To be fair to Chakabva, he plays with bat close to body, and is unruffled by that"
"outside off, turning further away, ignored"
"tossed up around leg, and he has a big swing at this, and holes out to mid-wicket. Nayeem Hasan takes this well! Smart bowling by Taijul, just tempting Chakabva with one that floats above his eyeline and brings out the big slog sweep. Top-edged it from the start, and from then on, it was just a matter of someone getting under this and taking it. Nayeem has already taken two catches before in this innings, and he makes no mistake"
"length, outside off, and he is happy to leave this"
"full, outside off, a bit of shape back in, but Tamim lets this pass too"
"length, a bit straighter, and Tamim presses forward to defend towards mid-off"
"wayward, outside off, and left alone. Collected by Chakabva between first and second slip"
"fuller length, just around off, and Tamim brings his weight forward to defend"
"full, but a bit wide, and he eases this past point. Stops well short of the point boundary, but Tamim and Bangladesh get going"
"fullish length, angles in, and he defends this away towards short leg"
"length, angles in from just outside off, and he defends"
"length, but angles in from middle and goes further down leg. Hassan can just dab it away and picks up four to fine leg"
"length, angles in from around off, and he defends towards mid-on"
"length, outside off, a better line, and Hassan is happy to leave"
"<strong>gorgeous straight drive!</strong> Nyauchi looks to go fuller, and bowls this straight from outside off. The natural angle of his release brings the ball back in, and Hassan gets into a good position to punch it straight back down the ground, between Nyauchi and the umpire, for four"
"<strong>chancy, but effective!</strong> Floated a touch full and wide by Tiripano, and Tamim throws his hands at it. Gets it away past point, going away towards third man. In the air, but no fielder there between gully and point"
"length, but well wide of off. Ignored"
"length, around off, and he stretches forward in typical Tamim Iqbal fashion looking to drive it straight. Gets it back towards the bowler with soft hands"
"a bit of shape back in from a good length outside off, and he drives firmly to mid-off"
"jags back in from outside off, and Tamim chooses to leave this! Hits him pretty high, and goes to slips. There's an appeal from the bowler, but that was probably missing off anyway"
"Tamim drives this past mid-off. <strong>Great shot!</strong> Tiripano isn't the quickest going around, and he just walks into this ball, thrown full and wide around off, and drives this with a good batswing, to the left of mid-off"
"length, and he plays this with the incoming angle towards short mid-wicket"
"length, jags back in a touch from outside off, and he is happy to block this"
"length, around off, and just a bit of extra bounce as it hones in on off stump. Hassan does well to get behind the line and defend"
"length, straightens after pitching around off, and he defends watchfully"
"length, around off, and he defends with a straight bat"
"<strong>there's the breakthrough!</strong> Nyauchi gets it absolutely right this time. Just around off, and goes on with the angle. Hassan stays stuck in the crease, and hangs his bat out. He actually takes his bottom hand off, but the limp bat he hangs out is enough for the ball to take a wee nick on its way through to Chakabva. Doesn't bother referring, because he knows he's got a feather-edge on to this"
"length, and he stretches well forward to drive this to mid-off"
"length, but strays down the leg side. Tamim shuffles across and finds he's gone well outside the line to play this on the on side. Good collection by Chakabva"
"length, defended with bat close to body. Tiripano oversteps in the process of delivering that, though"
"length, nibbles away from outside off, and he shoulders arms"
"length, around off, bounces well as it goes across him. Tamim stretches, but then withdraws his bat and hides it behind his pads as he lets it pass"
"length, angles across, and he stretches forward to defend"
"length, and he allows this to pass as it bounces across him"
"short, wide, too wide of off!"
"length, angles across, and he punches this past cover. Will pick up two"
"length, around off, and he stretches forward a bit to defend"
"short in length, and he hangs back to try and drive this down the wicket. Banged hard into the surface, and bounces through to mid-off"
"length, angles across him, and he stretches forward to defend this"
"length, and he leaves this"
"length, closer to Shanto, angles across, and he leaves"
"length, angles across him, and he pushes this towards point"
"length, around off, and he presses forward before leaving it"
"length, and he presses forward to drive. One bounce and straight into the midriff of the man at short cover"
"length, around off, and he presses forward to defend towards short cover"
"fuller ball, around off, and he squirts this away towards point"
"dug in short, and he allows this to pass through over his right shoulder"
"short, turns further away, and Shanto chases it a bit in trying to drive. Off the bottom edge towards cover"
"fuller, straighter, and defended with a forward press"
"full toss, and he whips this away towards deep mid-wicket. Easy two on offer"
"more accurate, closer to the batsman, who presses to defend"
"length, around leg stump, and he drives this back towards Raza. A little aerial, but beats Raza away to his left. Down to mid-on"
"strays on to the pads, and he flicks this wide of mid-on, and they take a single"
"well, what did Shanto have for lunch? He needs no sighter, stepping back into a forcing punch through the gap in the covers. Excellent connection on the stroke, and it rolls quickly over the boundary"
"Tiripano hangs this one out even wider outside off, and Shanto leaves this one well alone"
"on a length, wide and going wider as Tiripano continues over the stumps. No need to play that one"
"but he maintains a line wide of off, and Shanto once again leaves it"
"fuller this time, but again it's well wide of off. Shanto steps across, has a good look, and lets it go"
"this one is straighter, but the bat comes down equally straight as he drives to mid off"
"there's a yelp of excitement as Nyauchi comes around the wicket and seams one in to Tamim, who inside edges onto the thigh. No harm done"
"slipping towards his pads now, but Tamim's glance is intercepted at midwicket"
"full, on off stump, and Tamim leans into a languid drive. But again he hits the field"
"that's a better length, in the channel at 122km/h. Tamim holds his bat inside the line to let it pass"
"Tamim whips his wrists over the top of another length delivery, threading a gap in front of point. Didn't over hit it, and they're back for the second"
and he raises his hands over the top of this one outside off to leave it alone
"he offers generous width outside off, but Shanto's timing on the cut is lacking, and it dribbles to point"
"closer to him this time, cramping the left hander a little for room"
"much fuller this time, and he stretches forward to tap it watchfully to cover"
"<b>there's some timing!</b> Shanto leans across into a checked cover drive. Poise, balance and placement, and it races through the covers"
"Tiripano hangs another out, full and wide, but this one is left alone"
"same again, as Shanto shoulders arms to a full delivery floated up outside off"
Tamim steps into a neat defensive push to cover. Solid
"full this time, and a little more vim in his checked push. But Nyauchi stops it in his follow through"
"rising up at him off a length, Tamim rides the bounce and glances off the hip for one"
"just short of a length again, and Shanto hops to defend to midwicket"
"a hint of width as Nyauchi delivers from around the stumps, Shanto standing tall to tap it to point"
"full and tailing in to the stumps at 126km/h, and the drive bobbles to mid off"
"a full length draws him forward, but the drive isn't timed and is easily stopped at cover"
"angling in to him from a full length, and it comes off the inside half of a defensive bat, rolling to leg"
"a shade shorter, outside off, and Tamim stands up to push to cover with a high left elbow"
"full again, and he leans into a straight drive, but it's skewed towards mid on"
"nicely straight, on a length and angling in. Tamim defends"
"Tiripano switches back over the stumps, pushing this one across him but keeping the line tight. Tamim defends, and that's a maiden"
"he starts full, on an off stump line, and it's defended to cover"
"flung down fuller, but quite wide of off at 129km/h , and it's easily left alone"
"that's better, Tshuma delivering with a high, fluid arm action and getting a bit of shape back in to the left hander, who defends"
"hitting the seam and angling across him at 124km/h, Shanto pressing defensively to cover"
"<b>width, slapped!</b> Too short, too wide, and Shanto's eyes light up as he hammers it in front of point with a resounding thump"
"tighter line, rising off a length at 129km/h, and he's back and across to defend"
"Tiripano bustles in, delivering the ball from around the stumps, and keeps Tamim honest with a tight line on off stump"
"Tamim's getting a little frustrated by this string of dots, one feels. This one is full and wide, but he throws too much into the drive, mistiming it into the leg side instead of cover"
"slipping down the leg side, and now Tamim finds a single, via an edge onto the pad, into the leg side"
"on a length, but outside off and it's left alone"
"wide of off stump again, and Shanto's not interested, leaving well alone"
and another length delivery outside off is left alone to end the over
"and he finds a hint of extra bounce outside off, though Tamim whips his hands out of harm's way to leave it alone"
"fuller this time, but in the same channel outside off. Tamim covers his off stump and let's it go past"
"straighter this time, and Tamim's behind it to defend"
"<b>glorious!</b> Tamim finally gets one he can punish as Tshuma lands one too close to him. The bat comes down nice and straight, the elbow is high, and the ball zips back past the bowler"
"Tshuma pulls his length back, Tamim stepping half forward to defend"
"<b>off his legs now!</b> Again Tshuma over-pitches, and Tamim leans over this leg-stump half volley to send it racing through square leg. That'll help his frustration"
"a touch of turn outside off, and it keeps a little low. Chopped to cover"
"<b>beaten!</b> Raza twirls one down from around the stumps, and finds some bounce this time to beat Shanto's indeterminate poke outside off"
"full, straight, and Shanto's forward to defend"
"fuller still, and Shanto lunges forward to defend"
there's some grip and turn! But it starts wide of off and is easily left alone
"<b>bad delivery</b>, Raza straying down the leg side to offer Shanto a freebie. He accepts, helping the ball on its way with a paddle sweep"
"<b>sumptuous timing!</b> Tamim strokes his third boundary in the space of six deliveries, stepping into a balanced on drive that threads the gap between mid on and midwicket"
"Tshuma changes his line of attack, coming around the stumps, and Tamim keeps his hands inside of this delivery in the channel to let it go"
"attacking the stumps now with a full length delivery, but it's firmly blocked back at him"
"on a length, seaming in a touch at 126km/h, and Tamim's forward to defend"
"<b>crunch!</b> Vintage Tamim. Tshuma offers some width outside off, and he stands up into a high-armed backfoot punch. Nothing brutal about it, all timing, but it raced away through point"
"that's better from Tshuma, aiming for the top of off, and Tamim opts for defence"
"<b>and the runs keep flowing!</b> Shanto steps back as Raza delivers a long hop outside off, thumping it in front of square to the cover boundary"
"much better from the offspinner, drawing him into a forward defensive"
"full again, just outside off, and it's tapped to cover"
"nicely bowled, dipping on him outside off, but Shanto is equal to it"
"whoops, Raza has over-stepped here, delivering a no-ball"
"and now it's the line that's off, Raza spearing this one down at his legs. Shanto flicks to fine leg, and <b>there's the fifty stand</b>"
"slightly short outside off, but it's not punished, Shanto punching to cover"
"<b>more runs!</b> Tamim is really flowing now. Again, the shot is all about the timing and balance as he leans over a straight delivery with a big stride and threads the gap between mid on and midwicket"
"Tshuma switches back over the stumps, and finds a tight line on off stump. Tamim defends"
"chopped down behind square on the off side, and Shanto calls him through for a single"
"rising off a length at 125km/h, and Shanto defends off the back foot"
"short of a good length, and he hops to find a single off the hip"
"tapped to cover, they look for a single but there's none to be had"
"slightly over-pitched outside off, and he's on the drive down to long off"
"<b>edged!</b> But it falls short of slip. Raza has made something out of nothing, surprising Tamim with extra turn and bounce outside off. Taylor, at slip, dives to his left but the ball goes to ground <i>just</i> in front of him"
"full, pushed into the covers"
"Tamim steps back this time, using the crease, and cracks it to cover"
"generous flight on this one, and it's flicked off the toes to midwicket"
"nicely bowled, on middle and off, but Tamim is well forward to smother it"
"just short of a good length, on leg stump, and it's whipped to midwicket"
"landing close to a leg stump line again, from over the stumps, and the midwicket fielder has more work to do"
"full, angling across him, and Shanto protects his stumps with a solid forward push"
"Nyauchi keeps it tight on an off stump line, Shanto tapping a length delivery back at him"
"too full, and it's firmly glanced off his toes. But there's cover in the deep, so it's just two runs"
"short and wide outside off, at around 121km/h, but a rasping shot goes straight to point"
"tossed up full, and he drives this past the bowler towards deep mid-off"
"length, straighter, and he drives to mid-on"
"cuts a shorter ball away, but straight towards cover-point"
"length, defends towards cover"
presses forward to smother one around off
"straighter, driven to mid-on"
"back of a length, driven towards cover"
"fuller length, wide outside off, and he leaves. A little bit of late movement back in, as Chakabva collects moving across low to his right. Is that <strong>some reverse </strong>on offer?"
"length, outside off, and he drives towards cover-point"
"fuller length, straighter, and he presses forward to defend this, getting behind the line of this"
"fuller, a touch wider, and he takes the invitation to drive square of the wicket. Zips along the ground to point"
"length, and he plays this away towards mid-wicket"
"bowls this fuller, possibly seam-up, and he guides it past point"
"length, and he nurdles this with the turn towards backward point"
"fuller ball, and he whips this wide of mid-on. Easy two on offer"
drives one back to the bowler
"fuller, driven back to the bowler"
"length, around off, and he plays this with soft hands ahead of mid-on, and they go through for a quick single. Tell you what, <strong>Tamim was a bit slow off the blocks</strong>, but the throw was at the non-striker's end anyway. Missed"
"length, around off, and he defends this towards cover"
"fuller, along the pads, and he helps this along with a neat flick of the wrists towards deep mid-wicket. Easy three"
"fuller, around off, and he drives this towards short cover"

"length, around off, and he stretches forward and meets it with a dead, straight bat"
"length, around off, and he presses forward to defend"
"length, turns a bit and bounces from a length. Shanto does well to ride both the turn and bounce to defend away to the off side"
presses forward to defend a length ball around off
"the slider, and he goes back to cut this away towards point. Started from outside off, but nearly caused a bit of bother for Shanto"
"fuller, on the pads, and he whips this towards short mid-wicket"
"short, and he goes back to smack this through cover. Cannot beat the man at cover, though"
"short again, and this time he places this to the left of cover. <strong>Super shot!</strong>"
"length, around off, and he leaves"
"length, presses forward to defend"
"length, straightens with the angle, and he drives to mid-on"
"fuller, outside off, and he drives to mid-off this time"
"full, but strays on to the pads, and he can just knock this away towards deep square leg. Easy two for Tamim"
"length, outside off, and he thinks about having a slash at it. Bounces away after pitching, and he looks a little annoyed with himself for that attempt"

drives a ball closer to him down to deep mid-off
"length, and he hangs back to punch this towards cover"
"fuller, starts from around leg and straightens, and he presses forward to block"
"length, and he goes back to tap it dead at his feet"
"length, outside off, and the ball dies on its way through to Chakabva. Not close enough to interest any response from Tamim"
"length, around the hips and he whips this down towards long leg"
"length, and he defends towards gully after riding a bit of extra bounce on this"
"short, on the pads, and he whips this away towards deep square leg"
"outside off, and he leaves"
"<strong>great ball!</strong> And Tamim walks! It's a good length ball, and for once, Tiripano keeps this closer to the stumps. Tamim does his usual stretch and drive routine, but ends up playing just outside the line of this. Feather edge off the inside of the bat and through to the keeper Chakabva. The third umpire takes a close look at this for the front foot, and there's no issue there. Just a bit of the heel within the crease, and that's all it takes!"
"length ball, and Shanto goes back to thwack this towards cover"
"short of a length, turns away, and he plays a slap towards cover"
"length, and he stretches forward to defend this"

"length, around off, and he steps forward to defend"
"full, wide and he drives along the ground to point"

"length, way outside off, and he leaves"
"length, around off, and he presses forward to defend this with a dead bat"
"fuller, and he drives this hard. Stopped at short cover"
"dug in short, and way down the leg side. Too short in fact, as Chakabva has to scamper to his right and collect this way to his right!"
"wide of the crease, tries to get it short, but strays down the pads. Played off his hips towards fine leg. Long leg gets across and effects a good bit of fielding"

"length, gets behind the line to defend with a dead bat. Straight towards short cover"
"fuller, and he drives this wide of mid-on"
"checked drive to a length ball around off, and it <strong>goes in the air</strong>, but through the vacant mid-off region down towards deep mid-off"

"fuller, and punched wide of cover towards deep mid-off"
"fuller, driven towards wide cover"
"short, and this time he takes full toll! Hangs back, and uses the depth of the crease to get this through the cover region. Hit hard, and placed well"
"length, and he goes back to whip this towards mid-wicket"
"length, and he defends towards short mid-wicket"
"length, and down the leg side. He is able to play this away towards long leg with a little swat with one hand"
"fuller, and he drives this towards cover"
"length, and he goes back and plays with the turn towards deep square leg"
"length, driven towards mid-off"
"short, and he flogs this away through the mid-wicket region. <strong>Bad ball</strong>, and gets the treatment it deserves!"
"Mominul stays deep, whipping across an offbreak to get it into the leg side"
"speared down the leg side, a freebie but he can't get anything on it"
"floated up on middle and off, tapped back to the bowler"
"nicely flighted once again, and Mominul is forward to defend it"
"width, outside off. Mominul is down on bended knee to slap it past the cover fielder, who gets a hand to it to take some of the sting out of the stroke"
"aimed at the off stump, Shanto making a little room to chop it to cover"
"this keeps a touch low, having landed on a length, but Mominul is behind it"
"too full, on his legs, and Mominul just rolls his wrists over the top of it. The connection is good, but Masvaure hares after it to keep them to three"
"slanting in to the pads once more, Nyauchi having come around the stumps, and they find room on the leg side for a quick single"
"nicely bowled, in the channel outside off. Mominul gets himself right across to the off side to meet it, playing the ball late and under the eyes to get it to gully"
"a bit more width this time, and Mominul's on the cut, but there's protection in the deep for that stroke"
Shanto stays deep in the crease and forces to cover
"landing on a leg stump line, and Mominul taps it watchfully in front of square on the leg side for a quick single"
"whipped forcefully into the leg side, but Tiripano bends low at mid on to cut it off cleanly"
"Shanto leans well forward, defending a flighted offbreak into the covers"
a punchy little drive at a full one gets the ball down to long off for one
"generous flight, and Mominul is forward to smother it back at Raza"
"flicked into the leg side, but the ball hits the man under the helmet at short leg and goes nowhere. And no harm done to the fielder either, as it wasn't a particularly powerful stroke"
"slanting in to him from around the stumps, and he nurdles runs through midwicket. They run hard for three"
"worked off the hip, down to fine leg"
"back over the stumps comes Nyauchi, keeping his line nice and straight"
"Nyauchi hits a good length again, aiming for the top of off, but Shanto's flawless defensive push keeps it out"

"floated up, on the toes, and they rush back for the second"
"some grip and spin for Raza, but it's slow off the track and Mominul hangs back to defend"
"punched to mid on, again off the back foot"
"<b>full toss, cracked to midwicket!</b> Raza is looking for flight, but puts rather too much on this one and Mominul doesn't miss out, sending it racing to the boundary with a flick of the wrists"
"<b>over-corrects, and he's punished!</b> The last one was a full toss, this one is a long hop - at least to a player of Mominul's stature. He hops quickly onto the back foot, and doesn't bother keeping his pull down, smearing another shot to the same region"
"short, but without too much spice at around 128km/h, and Shanto swivels to pull to deep midwicket"
"width now, outside off, and Mominul places his cut behind point. The fielder in the deep saves the boundary"
"that's a better line, landing on middle and angling across him, but it's well left by Mominul on the angle"
"on a length once again, but wide enough outside off that he doesn't need to play"
"same again, shooting through well outside the off stump and easily left alone"
"<b>deft touch!</b> More width offered outside the off stump, and Mominul waits until the very last moment before dabbing down at it, placing the ball past a diving gully fielder to <b>raise the fifty stand</b>"
"and there's some spin for him first up, but it fizzes harmlessly down the leg side"
"<b>ouch, short leg in danger!</b> A touch short from Ndlovu, and Shanto rocks back to hammer a pull shot straight into Masvaure under the helmet at short leg. He raised his hands as the ball reached him, the ball cracking into the back of the hand. He's in some discomfort as the physio runs out. And he can't carry on. His hand immediately swelled up, and he's got an ice-pack on it as he leaves the field. This doesn't look good at all."
"<b>right through him!</b> Ndlovu changes to over the stumps and immediately finds some purchase, the ball dipping and spinning right through Shanto's defensive gate. Fortunately for the batsman, it also evades the stumps. That really wasn't far away at all"
"full again, pushed defensively to cover"

"<b>there's the hundred!</b> His ninth in Tests, his first as captain. And what a way to get there! He shifts his weight forward, lets the top hand lead, and laces it through the gap with the cleanest of drives. The celebration, though, is a somewhat muted one.

"<b>he's toying with them!</b> Mushfiqur is having fun. He's putting on an exhibition, and now he walks across to the off side and scoops a length delivery up and over fine leg"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b>, Tiripano flinging this one down very full and beating an attempted glance to hit him on the front pad. The umpire's not convinced, but they <b>ask for a review</b>. It may be more in hope than anything else ... Ah, and the TV umpire wants to pay special attention to Tiripano's back foot - he's coming around the stumps, very wide, and his back foot has transgressed, landing on the line! So that's a back foot <b>no ball</b>. Absolutely nothing going Zimbabwe's way. Had it not been a no-ball, it would in any case have stayed not out on the umpire's call. Just clipping"
"full, flapped out to the cover sweeper, taking the <b>partnership to 200</b>"
"worked away for another single, Mominul ticks on"
"pushed through full and wide, and this one is left alone"
"turned with the spin, which comes slowly off the surface, into the leg side"
tapped back at him this time
"Mominul's on the drive, collecting a single down to long on"
"full on off stump, and he drives inside out down to long off"
"another drive, this one pings long off"
"decent line, drawing him forward just outside off, watchfully defended towards point"
"crunched on the up, but the shot is aimed straight at extra cover"
"tight line, on off stump, and he defends"
"just a hint of extra bounce on this one, and the ball rises over the top of Mominul's attempted cut"
"short again, and Mominul stands back to pull, but doesn't connect too well and it goes nowhere"
"full, wide, and it's laced out to the cover sweeper"
"around the stumps comes Tiripano, angling a length ball across him. Mushfiqur watches it pass, without a shot"
"a touch too short, and he's in no rush staying deep in the crease and working with the spin into the leg side"
"full and flat, on the stumps, and he can't get this one away"
"<b>but this one he does!</b> Mushfiqur bends low into a sweep, rolling his wrists over the ball and cracking it hard through square leg. Tiripano puts in a dive near the boundary, but can't cut it off"
"slapped through point now, off the back foot, Raza running around to keep them to two"
"flicked off the toes, but straight to midwicket inside the circle"
"slightly quicker through the air, rushing him a little, but Mushfiqur gets a thick inside edge on it, onto the pad"
"on a length, and angling in to him from around the stumps. Punched firmly off the back foot"
"Mominul waits on a short one outside off, dabbing it down to third man"
"full, wide and he lets it go"
"Tiripano floats another one very wide outside off, from around the stumps, and Mushfiqur leaves again"
"oh dear, and this is too wide. Tiripano's been flirting with the wide line, but this one slips out much too far"
"Tiripano sticks to his plan, pushing this through full and very wide. Mushfiiqur won't be tempted"
"and same again, well wide of the off stump and very full. Mushfiqur patiently lets another one go"
"spinning in to him from outside off, defended back down the track"
"a touch too full, eased down to long on"
slapped hard to backward point
"Mushfiqur steps across into a paddle scoop, Taylor sprinting after it as the ball bounces down to fine leg"
"there's that late dab again, but Zimbabwe have a fielder at short third man"
"tapped down close in on the leg side, no run"
"on a length, at the stumps, and he crunches it into the leg side"
"ah, there's some shape for Tiripano. The ball hasn't been swinging much, but this one hits the seam and jags away from him outside off. But it's well wide, and he wasn't playing a shot"
"width again, but the point fielder stops the cut cleanly"
"forced away, on the up, to cover, again pinging the field"
"Tiripano keeps his line outside off, and once again Mominul is denied a run as his cut is stopped in a crowded point region"
"fuller, outside off, and it's left alone. <b>Incredibly, this is the first maiden since the 78th over</b>"
"landing on middle, spinning across him, and he's forward to defend"
"tapped down behind square on the off side, short third man dives to keep them to one"
"<b>up and over mid off!</b> Mominul spots some flight on the ball, with mid off up, and lofts it cleanly over the field"
and he follows that up with solid defence
"Ndlovu comes around the stumps, Mominul defending off the back foot"
"flicked with the spin into the leg side, no run"
"Tiripano stays around the stumps, aiming full and wide. Mushfiqur chances a drive at this one, but finds the fielder"
"full again, angling across him, and a drive is mistimed to extra cover"
"a shade shorter, but still angling wide across him. This one is left alone"
a chopped cut is stopped at point
"angled wide across him once again, left alone. Mushy's patience holds"
"full, and another drive is stopped at cover"
"flicked with the spin, into the leg side"
"<b>what a catch!</b> Relief for Zimbabwe. Mominul stepped down and looked to slap Ndlovu straight down the ground. But he couldn't get it quite as high as he wanted. The connection was a fierce one though, and Ndlovu has pulled off a stunning reflex catch. Zimbabwe have a breakthrough, and Ndlovu has his maiden Test wicket!"
"full and straight, and he leans forward to defend"
"arm ball, rushing straight on, but he's right behind it to defend"
"a touch short, he rocks back and punches to extra cover"
"full, outside off, and the extra cover fielder stops another one to <b>complete a wicket maiden</b>"
"as does the bowling plan, as Tiripano stays around the stumps and pushes the ball full and very wide across Mushfiqur"
same again. Well wide of the off stump. Mushfiqur won't be tempted.
"puts bat to this one, but finds gully"
"on a length, very wide. Tiripano keeps hanging it out there, Mushfiqur keeps letting them go"
"<i>very</i> wide indeed. He may have got away with one here, not sure how the umpire hasn't called this one wide"
"this one lands a little closer to him, but Mushfiqur doesn't hazard a shot. <b>Three maidens on the trot</b>"
"floated up on middle and off, and he's off the mark as a mid off fielder is caught napping. No intensity getting to the ball, which was hit straight at him"
"flatter through the air, attacking the off stump, and he defends"
"flicked into the leg side, where Kasuza dives and slides to palm it back towards Ndlovu. Mushfiqur called Mithun through, but then sent him scurrying back. Good fielding"
pushed defensively back at him
"firmly driven, but he finds the cover sweeper"
"<b>down the track, over the top!</b> Mithun spots some flight and charges the bowler, slapping the ball up and over mid off"

"length, around off, and he leaves"
"length, outside off, and ignored"
"fuller, wide of off again, and left alone"
"wide of off, and <strong>finally called a wide</strong>! This was near the popping crease to Rahim's right"
"full, width again, and he smears this through the cover-point region towards a sweeper in the deep. Half-stopped by a diving fielder, but not enough to prevent the single"
"length, around off, and he goes back and tries to dab this towards third man. Cannot beat point, who is quick to converge on this"
stretches forward to defend a length ball
"tries the reverse sweep. Goes off his glove, and evades Chakabva as it runs away towards third man. Pulled back by point, chasing it down"
"short, and he goes back and flays this through towards extra cover"
"length, driven towards cover"
"flatter, straighter, and defended towards point"
"length, around off, and he runs it towards deep point to pick up a single"
"length, outside off, and left alone"
"length, punched to cover"
"short, and he goes back and accesses the cover boundary with a delightful punch. Through the gap between short cover and cover-point. Delightful"
"back-to-back boundaries? <strong>Almost!</strong> Fuller ball, angles back in to him, and he leans into a drive between mid-on and short mid-wicket. Just about pulled back"

"full, driven towards deep cover"
"length, wide of off, and ignored"
"full, wide and left alone"
"fuller, closer the bat, and he looks to drive, and <strong>plays outside the line of this</strong>! An inner edge could have taken it back to the stumps!"
"drives this back past the bowler, and to the right of wide mid-off. <strong>Superb timing</strong>, as he leans into a length ball around off"
"fuller length, angles across him and he defends towards cover-point"
"<strong>delicate!</strong> Only gets one for it, though! Tries the dab down to third man, but Sikandar Raza goes haring after it from point and pulls it back. Rahim refuses the second"
"Ndlovu gets his second, but Mithun has <strong>reviewed this immediately</strong>! It's a length ball, close to the stumps, and he goes back to cut this, with his weight hardly ever transferring properly. Collected by Chakabva, and the Zimbabweans went up immediately in appeal, and the umpire also had no hesitation. Just a question of whether that caught the edge or not. There's a little spike off the toe-end of the bat, and that means Ndlovu's wicket stays"
"fuller, driven towards cover"

"length, presses forward to smother this"
"full toss, and he whips this away towards deep mid-wicket. Pulled back by Kevin Kasuza running in from mid-wicket"
"length, angles into him, and strikes him as he plays from the crease. <strong>Loud appeal for leg before</strong>, but not given. Must have gotten an inside edge, and has!"
"length, but wide of off, allows him to free his arms and drive this towards sweeper cover"

"he switches back over the wicket to Liton Das, who drives to cover"

"not much flight, and he's back and across to defend"
"nicely bowled, this one dips and spins across him, but it's safely covered by Rahim"
"Mushy's down on one knee, swatting a sweep out into the deep"
"chopped down towards backward point, where Raza tumbles to cut it off. Keeping a touch low perhaps?"

"he aims full and wide outside off, Rahim leaning forward into a drive out to the cover sweeper"
"shaping in gently from outside off, defended to cover"
"on a length, just outside off, and he walks into a firm push to get it out to the sweeper"
"whipped firmly off the toes, Nyauchi having switched back around the stumps. With the field spread, only singles on offer"
"forced off the back foot, out to the sweeper, as Nyauchi offers a little width from over the stumps"
"angled across him from around the sticks, Rahim taking one step across to the off side to cover his stumps and raising his hands to leave"
"punched with the spin, into the covers"
"looped down on middle, with a little flight, and he's forward to defend"
"<b>big appeal!</b> Das bends into a big sweep, but the ball rushes past his shot and hits the pad. Likely headed down the leg side"

"pushed through a little quicker, quite full and he's forward to smother it"
Rahim moves a little closer to his 150 with a booming drive out to the cover sweeper
"just short of a length, coming in to him, and he defends to leg with his weight on the back foot"
"full, straight and shaping in to him gently. Das is forward to defend"
"curving in towards the off stump again, and it's dead-batted back at him"
"too straight, Das nudges off his pads and they rush back for the second"
"Das hangs his bat out into a tentative drive, the ball coming off the inside half of the bat and rolling into the leg side"
""

"a touch full, outside off, and he drives into the deep"
"Ndlovu keeps it tight, on off stump, and Das is well forward to defend"
"nicely bowled again, a slightly low arm directing the ball towards the off stump. Solid defence the response"
"pushed through on middle and leg, and he defends another one"
"Nyauchi comes around the stumps, hanging the ball out very wide outside off stump. Rahim leaves yet another one"
"<b>there's that glide he's used so often!</b> Short outside the off stump, and he rolls his wrists over the top of the ball to keep it down and place it through the gap between slip and gully. And what's more, it <b>brings up his 150!</b> This celebration isn't quite as animated as that for the ton. Does he have eyes on a double?"
"full, wide, and it's flayed out to the cover sweeper"
"well wide of the off stump, from over the wicket, and Das shoulders arms"
"rising off a length, just outside off, and he's back and across to defend"
Das steps across and has a little fiddle well away from his body at a full one that holds its line. Beaten
"floated down on off stump, defended into the leg side"
"a touch shorter, Mushy hops back and defends"
"deft little cut, but it doesn't quite have the beating of short third man"
"<b>too short</b>, Das reads the length, rocks back, and hammers a pull well in front of square"
"speared down the leg side, the sweep is missed and Chakabva gets his pads in the way to stop it"
"width now, outside off, but the cut goes straight to point"
"meanwhile, Tshuma's back into the attack. And he adopts the very same tactic as the two senior seamers, coming around the stumps and aiming well wide of the off stump. Left alone"
"fuller, closer to him, and Rahim leans into a drive"
"shorter now as Tshuma switches back over the stumps, Das forcing it away off the back foot"
"floated down very full and quite wide, from around the stumps. The cover sweeper has some work to do as he lays into a drive"
"punched square, on the up, and the sweeper keeps them to two"
"<b>crack!</b> Tshuma drops short, and he doesn't quite have the pace to really hurry Das, who steps back and hammers a pull through midwicket. <b>That's the fifty stand too</b>, as Bangladesh continue to pile on the runs"
"flight, on middle and off, and it's defended"
"well bowled once again, but Rahim's defence is utterly solid"
"eased down to long off, turning the strike over"
cracked out to the sweeper as Ndlovu drops a little short
"spinning away gently, and it's punched to cover off the back foot"
"swept this time, but there's a man in the deep to cut it off"
"full and very wide from around the stumps, Rahim lays into a rasping square drive but a diving point fielder stops the shot"
"on a length, just outside off and going across him. For the umpteenth time, Mushy runs it down through gully"
"firmly cut, off the back foot, and the defensive field keeps them to one"
"angled wide across him, Rahim raising his hands high to leave it alone"
"full, and he drives hard down the ground. Nyauchi at deep mid off sprints across to cut it off"

"slightly short, outside off, and he slaps a cut out to the sweeper"
"aimed at middle and leg, Das staying deep in the crease to defend"
"tapped through cover, quick single"
"Mushy stretches forward into a drive, but he can't thread the gap"
"powerfully swept now, as he rolls the wrists to keep it down. Hard running brings two"
"full and wide, and there's a nice crack off the bat as he leans into a drive. But it's just the one, with protection in the deep"
"<b>close!</b> Rahim bottom edges a little defensive push, the ball going straight down and then bouncing up, only to roll back and threaten the stumps. But he's very alert to the situation, getting his body between the ball and the stumps to keep it away. Excellent awareness"
"wider outside off, and this one is left alone"
"fuller, but once again it's angled well wide from around the stumps. Left alone"
"another wide length delivery, another leave"
"Tshuma sticks to the plan, but Rahim sticks to his own, letting a wide ball pass harmlessly by"
"floated up from around the stumps, aiming at middle and leg, solid defence"
"landing on an off stump line this time, pushed to cover"
"forced into the covers again, but he pings the field"
"straighter from Ndlovu, and he presses forward to smother it into the leg side"
"full again, and straight. Ndlovu fields off his own bowling as it's tapped back at him"
"slightly loose end to the over, dishing up a short, wide one that's cut away into the deep"
"dug out towards mid off, and they hustle a quick single before the fielder can get the return in"
"hint of width offered, and he stands up tall to punch it to cover. Sweetly timed, but the fielding is equally adept to cut it off inside the circle and keep them to one"
he's on the front foot now to drive out to the sweeper
"for the first time in a long time, Tshuma aims one closer to Rahim, who stands up to defend"
"but this one is wider again, and Rahim likewise reverts to type, leaving it alone"
"very full, on an off stump line, but a firm drive goes straight to mid off"
"he switches his angle to over the stumps, and aims for the rough outside leg stump. Kicked away by Das"
"again he aims for the rough, but this one slips out a little too far outside leg"
"straighter this time, Das coming forward to defend"
"landing outside leg, spinning across him, and Das presses it to cover"
"this wasn't all that short, but <b>Das makes the most of it</b>, making room and slashing a cut through the gap. Nicely timed too"
"too short again, and down the leg side this time. Das hops back to pull, and a man in the deep saves the boundary"

"same again, testing Rahim's patience with a wide, angled delivery. Left alone"
"this one lands closer to him, and he drives to mid off"
"full, outside off, and Rahim shuffles across into another drive, finding mid off again"
"surprise straight ball, but Rahim's not bothered, flicking across his pads to collect two runs through square leg"
"normal service is resumed as Tshuma flings it down well wide of the off stump, and Rahim leaves it alone"
"landing on middle, Das drives to mid off"
"<b>paddle sweep</b> and he gets it very fine. It's Masvaure who hares after it, hauling it in <i>just</i> in front of the rope to keep them to three. <b>But that brings up 500 for Bangladesh!</b> The 10th time they've breached this score in Tests"
""
"<b>reverse sweep now!</b> Ndlovu delivers a leg stump delivery, and Mushy switches up his stance in a flash, hammering the ball through backward point"
"<b>and now the orthodox sweep!</b> The result is the same. Rahim bends nice and low, getting close to the ball, and making sure to place it fine of the man roaming around deep backward square. His 26th boundary, and a double now surely beckons"
"chopped out through the covers, one more and he'll keep the strike"
"he comes around the stumps, Rahim leaning into a flowing square drive out to the sweeper"
and now it's Das who flashes a shot out to the cover sweeper
"rising off a good length, Rahim standing up to his full height to ride the bounce"
"<b>into the gap!</b> It's the off side field that's packed, so Rahim targets the leg side as Tshuma lets slip with a low full toss on his legs. Excellent connection, races away"

"flicked down to fine leg, one more to the total"

"length, and he plays this towards square leg with soft hands"
"<strong>great grab by Chakabva!</strong> Length ball bowled by Raza from around the wicket, and Liton tries to run it down towards third man off the face of the blade, and Chakabva moves across swiftly and collects it at the first grab.

"<strong>two in two!</strong> This is absolute annihilation in the dark for Zimbabwe! Length ball, and he makes the mistake of playing back to that, possibly conscious of four around the bat in catching positions.

"sharp turn, across from middle to leg, and he plays this away towards fine leg"
"length, and he plays this towards square leg, making sure he keeps it low"
"off the edge, but <strong>just short and wide of first slip</strong>! Another one that goes straight on, and he plays forward to defend, but ends up edging it"

"plays a touch back to this, and it strikes him on the pads, but impact would have been outside the line. Missed the line of it, though!"

"probing stuff, curving away from an off stump line, Taylor defends"
"a touch wider outside off, and Taylor gets across to defend to point"
"<b>past the edge!</b> Taylor is suckered by the movement, and pokes flat-footed at one that leaves him outside off, with the bat away from the body"
"<b>inside edge</b>, onto the pads, and there's a yelp of excitement as it balloons into the off side, but it lands safely. Taylor's still stuck on the crease"
"now he gets the feet moving, stepping forward into a solid defensive push at a full outswinger"
"arm ball, rushing on to Kasuza, who defends from the crease"
"<b>big air</b> on this one, really floating it up there on the breeze. Dug out by the batsman"
"a touch flatter, landing just outside off, Kasuza stretches forward to defend"
"this one rushes on with the arm once again, but Kasuza is right in line to defend"
"<b>edged, and short!</b> Landing outside off, the ball breaks away from a groping Kasuza, taking a thick edge. But it drops short of slip!"

"nicely full, snaking away from the bat, but it's far enough outside off that Taylor can leave it"
"a touch straighter, and it's defended"
"fuller, zipping away through the air. Taylor reaches out with a forward defensive"
"just short of a good length, and without quite as much swing. Taylor hangs back to defend under his eyes"

"floated up outside off, defended to short extra"
"straighter, and he's right behind it to defend"
"Kasuza lunges onto the front foot, smothering it back down the track"
"flatter through the air, and indecision enters his foot movement. Forward, then back, and the defence is a hurried jab"
"and now slower again, flighting it on off stump. Defended"
"full enough to draw Kasuza into a drive, but it's stopped in the covers"
"punched firmly off the back foot, but a diving stop saves runs"
"just short of a good length, Taylor hops to tuck it to leg"
"outswinger, but it's much too wide outside off to get him playing"
"<b>pings out the middle!</b> Full, a long half volley, and Taylor leans into a languid cover drive, keeping the left elbow high and placing it to perfection. First runs of the day"

"flighted up on middle and leg, and he's almost done in by it, but keeps the bat straight and manages to keep it down"
"full, outside off, squeezed to point"
"<b>snaffled at second slip!</b> Taijul flights one that lands just outside leg, drawing Kasuza into a defensive push to leg, but then dips and rags across him to take the shoulder of the bat, squaring him up in the process. Second slip holds a regulation chance"

"Taijul comes around the stumps, landing it outside off. Taylor has a look and leaves it alone"
"Taijul loses his line down the leg side, Taylor helps it on its way with a little lap sweep"
"too short this time, and Taylor rocks back to punch through extra cover"
"nicely full, Taylor comes forward to smother it back down the track"
"<b>big appeal!</b> The ball rushes on to him, having landed on middle and leg. But there were two sounds, I think, suggesting he got bat on it. And it also looked to be headed down the leg side. Not out"
"<b>angled through the gap!</b> Ebadat starts with a shortish delivery, just outside off. Ervine stands tall and guides it straight into the gap between the slips and the gully. Bangladesh won't mind that"
"rising up at him off a good length, Ervine raises his hands high to let it pass him. Well bowled, and a good leave. On length. And that was the effort ball - up to 139.6km/h"
"seaming away from him, outside off, at 133km/h. Another leave"
"just short of a length, and straight. Ervine defends to leg"
"there's some excitement as Ervine wears one on the pad, but it looked to have pitched outside leg"
"fuller, and going across him on the angle. Ervine raises his hands to leave it alone"
"arm ball, but it's a little too short so Taylor has time to get back and force it to cover. A tumbling stop saves runs, but can't stop the single"
"eased just wide of mid on, with the turn. The fielder is a little deep, so an easy run"
"full, outside off, and Taylor defends to Mominul, on the bounce"
"<b>down the track, over the top!</b> Taylor gets his feet moving, skipping out into a flowing lofted drive. Over long off"

"rising off a length, Ervine aims a backfoot push into the covers"
"breaking in from outside off, Taylor shuffles across and defends to leg"
"<b>attempted reverse sweep</b>, but it misses bat, pad, wickets, wicketkeeper, all. Straight through everyone, down to the boundary!"
"some turn in from outside off, Taylor works with it to find a single to midwicket"
"Nayeem comes around the stumps to Ervine, who flicks behind square on the leg side"
"<b>a breakthrough from the young offspinner!</b> Taylor falls playing a big sweep. He was aiming for deep midwicket, but was done in by the bounce. He'd rolled his wrists on the stroke, but it didn't matter as the ball took the top edge, ballooning up into the air to be easily caught by deep backward square, running in. Vital breakthrough, and once again it's Nayeem who gets it"

"<strong>one-handed sweep</strong>, but goes to deep square leg for four! Sets himself up to sweep a length ball around off, and it bounces a touch extra, and he takes his bottom hand off. Skews it a touch, but is able to place it between square leg and short fine leg"
"punches one wide of cover, and to the left of mid-off. They run hard, and pick up two before Rahim can get to this"
"length, angles in, and he plays with an angled bat towards square leg. Went through his legs, in fact!"
"fuller length, around off, ends up as a sharp full toss, and he defends towards point"

"fuller length, angles in to him, and he defends well towards short mid-wicket"

"tries to go fuller, but strays down the pads, and he can just flick this away towards long leg. No fielder there"
"floated around off, turns away after pitching outside off, and he leaves"
"flatter, outside off, and he defends with a forward press. <strong>Delivered at 87.5kph</strong>, so you know he's slowing up the ones he's tossed up"
"top shot! Hangs back a touch to a length ball, shortening the length further thus, and then maneouvres this past cover towards the extra cover region. It's a bit of a race to the boundary line between the ball and the fielder chasing it, but ball wins!"
defends a length ball after going back a touch
"fuller ball, and they take on Rahim's arm at mid-on. There's a <strong>direct hit</strong>, but Raza makes it. Rahim had to run around from mid-on to his left. A good drive to get the sequence going"
"<strong>shot!</strong> It's a good length, decent pace, but there's some width outside off. He just drives this and places it to the left of point. Races away"
"length, around off, and he leaves"
"fuller, but wide of off, and he leaves. Decent head of steam at <strong>133.5kph</strong>; Ebadat has really come out all guns blazing this morning"
"length, around off, and he leaves as it tails in a touch after pitching outside off. Collected high to his right by Liton Das"
"length, around off, keeps a touch low, but not close enough to evince any interest out of Ervine"
"length, and he stretches forward to defend"
"length, slow turn back in, and he can go back to defend this with a push down to the bowler"

"length, turns back in from off towards middle, and he whips it away towards mid-wicket"

"flatter, a bit shorter, and he defends from the crease"

"length, hangs back and defends from the crease"
"skips down the pitch again, and <strong>lofts this towards long-on</strong>. Won't carry for six, in fact, gives a bit of scare to Ervine as it lands well short of the boundary. Rahim has to run back to get it, but cannot hold it before it bounces"

"fuller ball, driven down towards deep mid-on"
"<strong>shot!</strong> Quick sashay down the pitch to a length ball pitching around leg and middle, and he swings this well over long-on. Great swing of the blade, and that also brings up the fifty-run partnership"
"length, drives this back towards the bowler"
"flatter, outside off, and angles back in. He's able to drive this wide of point, and they pick up a single even though Raza is on the back foot"
"fuller, and he drives this down towards deep mid-on"
"<strong>missed stumping!</strong> Length ball, just around off, and it bounces as it moves across him, as Ervine comes forward. That gives Liton very less time to respond, and the ball actually thwacks straight into his chest, rather than his gloves. Ervine breathes, as do Zimbabwe!"

"length, and he presses forward to defend"
appeal for leg before as Raza stretches forward to defend. <strong>Bangladesh run out of time</strong> as they consider reviewing a not-out decision! A bit of bat and pad together
"oh, has <strong>Ervine run himself out</strong> here? There's a direct hit as Raza plonks this towards cover, and he is caught well short thanks to a great bit of work in the field from Mominul Haque. With lunch looming, Bangladesh get just the boost they would have been looking for"

"<b>swept hard, straight into short leg!</b> Maruma got down low and cracked it hard, the ball striking the fielder on the hip. A stinging blow. He takes a little time to compose himself. And the physio comes out with the magic spray"

"Maruma is a bit firmer on this push, tapping it back to the bowler"
"paddle sweep, and it's placed quite fine. But committed fielding at the rope saves the boundary"
"down the track comes Maruma, who thrusts at the ball with his bat behind his front pad. There's an appeal as he's struck on that pad, but it's turned down. No review either. He was way, way down the track"

"offbreak, spinning in from outside off, Raza is forward to defend"

"a bit of bite in this one, but Raza covers it well enough"
"<b>oh Raza, what have you done!</b> Taijul delivers a long hop, and Raza leans back into a powerful pull, but it comes off the toe end and he doesn't get the elevation he wants. Indeed, he can't get it over Mushfiqur Rahim at midwicket, who times his leap well to pluck it cleanly out of the air. Bangladesh have another one, and they're a step closer to a massive win"
"Chakabva's immediately off the mark, slapping some width through cover point for a couple"

"Regis waits in the crease, getting back and across to defend"

"full, on the off stump. Regis nudges towards mid on and they set off for a quick single"
"<b>big turn!</b> Maruma steps across and raises his hands to leave as the ball spins in to him, kissing the pad on the way through. Speculative appeal, but it wasn't doing enough"
"<b>is this a drop?</b> Regis hangs back and pokes his bat out, but the ball bursts past him and through the keeper's gloves. Not sure there was anything on it ... actually, there's an audio spike as ball passes bat!"

"fuller, straighter, defended back at him"
"nicely flighted, and landing on a length. Chakabva is forward to defend"

"<b>thump!</b> Maruma's been strong on the sweep so far, and gets a great connection on this one. Didn't bother keeping it down, and he picks out the gap well in front of deep midwicket"
"he delivers from around the stumps, Chakabva coming half forward to defend"
"some dip and grip on this one, but Regis is forward and deals with it well"
"<b>past the edge!</b> Drifts in, rips away, and beats the forward poke"
Regis comes forward to smother a full one
"<b>off the outer half of the bat</b>, but it's played with nicely soft hands and rolls to the right of second slip"
"rushing on with the arm, but Chakabva spots it and defends to leg"
"premeditated paddle sweep from Maruma, who telegraphs his intentions and then fetches a full one neatly down to fine leg"

"chopped down behind square on the off side, a quick single"
"Maruma comes forward with bat and pad close together, solid defence"
"another paddle sweep, but the fielder has been placed finer now so it's only two"
"landing slightly wider outside off, Maruma stretches his left leg out and leaves it alone, even as the ball turns in to him. But not sharply enough to bother the stumps"
"<b>great timing!</b> It was only slightly too short, but Chakabva hopped back and used the full depth of the crease, placing his firm push right into the gap and getting enough on it to beat the fielder"
"generous flight on the ball, and he bends low to defend"
"pushed through on a middle and off line, defended to leg"

"floated up high and landing on middle and leg, Chakabva defends"

"<b>swept hard!</b> Taijul gave him the opportunity by looping one down the leg side, Chakabva cashed in by helping it on its way, beating the man at short fine leg"
Regis is down the track to smother this back at him
"pushed down leg again, but he can't get this one away, just the single to fine leg"
"landing on middle, spinning to off, and Maruma is forward to defend"
"Taijul's line goes wrong again, spearing this down the leg side to prompt a sweep. But short fine leg has been pushed back to the boundary, so just the single"
"<b>thrashed to deep midwicket!</b> Hasan lands one full, outside off, and Maruma's eyes light up as he spanks it to the boundary. Well hit"

"rushing on with the arm, but well covered by Chakabva, pushing to point"
"<b>slapped to mid on, what a catch!</b> Well, a wicket comes against the run of play as Chakabva looks to thump Taijul over mid on, but doesn't elevate the stroke enough. Tamim's in position there, and he goes aerial to pluck it cleanly out of the air. The stand is broken, Zimbabwe wobble once again"
"whips a length ball, turning in, towards square leg"
"tossed up around off, and Ndlovu greets the first ball he faces with a firm drive down the ground past mid-off. <strong>Well played!</strong>"
"fired in quick, and he plays back to it. <strong>Dead duck, and he knows it!</strong> Nayeem Hasan has another one, and this time it's poor judgement from Ndlovu. It was a fuller length, and he simply had to play forward to this. Chose to hang back and thudded into his pad as he looked to defend. Would have crashed somewhere between middle and leg. <b>Eight in the match for Nayeem already!</b>"
"tossed up outside off, and beats the outstretched attempted defence from new man Tshuma"
"beats the outside edge again, as he looks to play for the turn back in, but doesn't get any"
"too full, and he squirts this towards point. Goes deep enough to force the second of two slips stationed for him chasing behind, and allows them ample time to go back for two"
"fuller, on the pads, and he flicks it away to the left of forward short leg"
"reverse sweep, and <strong>nails it </strong>this time! Picks this up from a line of middle stump, and places it past point with pinpoint precision. A lovely little roll of the wrists to keep it along the ground"
"fired in flat, towards leg stump, and he stretches to defend. Hit on the pad, but they don't choose to review after an enthusiastic appeal"
"length, <b>off the inside edge</b>, but safely to the left of forward short leg, as Maruma looks to defend"
"skips down the wicket, and is struck on the pads as he looks to defend. The distance from the stumps dissuades a potential appeal..."
"wide of off, and he helps this to the backward point fence. Lazy elegance, as he hangs back in the crease and makes the most of the substantial room on offer. <strong>Beautiful!</strong>"
"full, outside off, and he <strong>misses out on a defensive push</strong>. Strikes Liton on the pads and goes towards fine leg, and they scamper a quick bye to ensure Maruma gets back to face Nayeem!"
"<b>five for Nayeem</b>! This has been a really curious batting performance from Zimbabwe. There's a thin line between bravado and recklessness, and too many Zimbabwean batsmen have stepped on to the latter side today, when the situation needed some discretion! Loopy ball around off, and he tries to smash this towards long-off, but the lack of turn skews it away and it flies instead in the direction of Tamim Iqbal at wide mid-off. Easy enough catch in the end"

"length ball, straight on, and he's been given leg-before playing back. He reviews after a long pause, <strong>more out of disappointment</strong>! He started moving forward, but by then the ball had been speared in, missed the inside edge, and crashed into his pad. The only question here is of direction, and it would be umpire's call at worst. Hitting, and <strong>Bangladesh have won this</strong>!"
