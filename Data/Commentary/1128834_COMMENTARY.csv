gone first ball and this is a simple chip to short midwicket. Sangakkara can't believe what he's done. Looked to turn it gently but couldn't keep it down. A hint of grip for Nawaz and he's struck early. Golden duck for the Sri Lankan legend.
"tossed up on middle from around the stumps, he lunges forward and eases this back with the spin"
driven back with the spin to the bowler
"lofted over the infield but this is a miscue, just eludes the cover fielder. Lucky break, didn't get to the pitch of the ball"
"drifting into middle and leg, gets a thick inside edge back to the bowler"
turns this gently towards the leg side as they scamper a single. Eventful first over
"length ball that nips away off the seam from middle, defended"
stands tall and punches this short of length delivery to cover
"slants this down leg, loses control. Easy call for the umpire"
"stops on him a touch as he shapes to punch this on the up, on the bounce to mid-off"
"excellent control. Floats this a touch ahead of length on off stump, he looks to work it across the line and gets a thick inside edge onto the pad"
"looks to flay this away from the body through point but is beaten by the late away movement. Oh, hello. Actually, <b> Sarfraz has opted to review the decision. </b> He was super confident but there's no trace of a nick on replay. The biggest hint of this is the fact that the seam position doesn't change at all even after it has passed the bat. But, but but <b> there is a tiny little spike on ultra edge </b>. Wonder if it is enough to overturn. It's a feather if ever there was one and they've decided to <b> give this out. </b> Brave decision to review and it has paid off. You couldn't have heard that surely, but Shehzad will have to walk back. <b> Faintest of faint edges. </b>"
"nearly chipped that to mid-on. Survives, just. It's all happening."
excellent cover drive but an equally superb stop
"length ball slanted across on off stump, defended from the crease"
"length on middle and leg, tucks this off his hip to midwicket. Hint of inward movement this time"
the point fielder dives over this punch to concede a run as this squirts away to square third man
"<b> Watson has grassed a straightforward opportunity at slip. </b> Excellent seam position, extra bounce on this length ball as he looked to drive away from the body, this was a thick edge that flew to Watson and hit his palm as he moved to his left. Should've been taken."
beaten for pace as this thuds into the thigh pad and deflects into the leg side as he looks to nudge this away
"hint of movement away from this length ball on off stump, defended"
full but angled down leg. Misses the flick. Wide signalled
uppish and into the gap between cover and cover point. Ended up slicing this but somehow managed to get away. The bowler shouldn't be disheartened by that.
"this is solid, this is stunning. An extra cover drive for six. Nothing wrong with the delivery: a length ball outside off, he lunged forward and lofted this through the line. Picked the bones out of that. Nowhere near a half-volley, mind you."
turns this length ball towards midwicket as they jog through for a single
gets a thickish inside edge into the midwicket region
gets on top of the bounce and works this towards deep backward square leg
just clears mid-off as he looks to give this a royal whack
short and he's disdainfully walloped this short-arm jab over midwicket. Picked the length early. Top shot. Lot of bottom hand
"this time it's a skiddy bouncer well outside off, he looked to fetch the pull but it got big on him. Beaten"
"pulls and misses again. Good, hit-the-deck hard bowling"
squared up by one that moves away. Beaten! Has a word with the batsman too. He looked to work this towards mid-on
steers this down to third man
"full and drivable outside off, leans into it but ends up playing it back towards the bowler"
driven wide of mid-off for a quick single
"defended towards point, Tanvir was halfway down the pitch when he turned back. <b> A direct hit at the bowler's end and Tanvir would've been gone. </b>"
"thick outside edge that races away between point and short third man. Sliced away, not where he intended this drive to go but he'll take the runs anyway"
"once again short third man in action, looked to force this through but just didn't have pace on the ball to work with"
"<b> rapped on the fingers </b> as he shapes to pull this short ball. Winces in pain, throws his bat down and immediately takes his right glove off to assess the damage. Surely he'll have a blood clot there. Excellent short delivery to end the over. Maqsood was in no position to play that."
"floats this full on off, played back to Watson"
"full on middle, driven straight to mid-off"
"short ball that gets big on him, mistimes this pull towards midwicket"
"this has been heaved over midwicket, gets this into the gap. Wide long-on can't get around"
full inswinging delivery that beats Tanvir's wild swing and cannons into the stumps. Watson dropped him at slip a while ago but has his man with a superb delivery. End of a flashy cameo
beautifully worked off his pads into the gap at midwicket. Couple to get off the mark
"rocks back and cuts, superb stop by KP diving to his left at point. Can't prevent a single though"
"eased into the cover region, yes-no-yes-no in the middle, a misfield helps them cross over for a single"
"shortish on off, rocks back and cuts straight to point again"
"steered to point again, tight line this from Nawaz"
eased into the offside again
beaten by a skidder that had him play down the wrong line. Very close to the stumps.
"short on the stumps, turns away but stops on him to derail the cut. Chopped"
backs away and defends towards cover
waits inside the crease and steers this into the cover point region
"drift in and turn, Malik defends from the crease"
"nice flight on middle and off, he lunges forward and smothers this"
driven to sweeper cover as they jog the single
Malik's decided he's had enough. Steps out and launches this straight back over the bowler's head. Launched towards the sightscreen
"goes again, repeats this. Carbon copy of the previous delivery, same stroke too. Another sashay down the pitch, opens up the off side and then lofts this back over his head. Superb"
"looks to work this across the line towards midwicket, squirts this back to the bowler as this grips and spins"
dabs this straight to short third man
"leading edge but lucky this rolls all along the ground, down to long-off"
"fired into the pads, he's late on the flick. Hit on the pad."
"short around off, somehow Malik opens the bat face and guides the ball right into the gap behind point for two. How did he get the gap there?"
"flat down leg, flicked away to deep square leg for one"
"heaved away into the gap at midwicket for a couple more. Flat around off, mis-timed but Maqsood is very strong"
"flat and wide outside off, slashed away but straight to cover"
"the slider, the dart outside off, guided to backward point. The bowler and Sarfraz go up in appeal, they think it has hit pad first before bat. <strong>Sarfraz wants the tv umpire to check</strong>. The ball only hit the bat, the bat hit the pad. Quetta lose the review."
"a low full toss outside off, driven away to long-off for one"
"can't give Malik width. Short and wide, slashed away behind point. Third man runs across to his right to cut the ball off"
"shortish and wide, chopped down to third man for a couple. Should not have been two there."
"full and wide, the legcutter, driven to the sweeper cover for one"
"beaten by the slower bouncer, <strong>and smashed on the helmet</strong>. It's dug in, maqsood's through his shot, the ball bounces and hits him flush on the back part."
"another legcutter, around off, defended towards cover. Soft hands enable the single"
"the wide yorker, but too wide for legality. Right on the line, but the umpire calls wide."
"another slower ball, the legcutter, poked away into the vacant midwicket region. Malik forces his partner back for two."
"a slower delivery to start outside off, swivel-pulled to deep square leg"
"terrific yorker, on off and well-directed. Jammed away to long-on for one"
"shortish and wide outside off, 134 kph, glided off the open face down to third man"
"plumb in front. Maqsood walked across, looking to heave the ball. But it was quick and accurate, far too good for Maqsood was very late on the stroke. Struck him in front of off and middle, plumb!"
"almost pops the slower ball back to Laughlin. He too is deceived by the slower ball, hard hands doesn't help. The ball hits the splice of the bat"
"short outside off, 130 kph, goes past Whiteley"
"short and wide outside off, slashed to backward point for a run."
"strays on the pads, nudged to deep square leg"
"a drifty slower ball outside off, 115 kph, nudged off the open face down to third man. Rahat gets across to his left to stop the ball, labours there."
"on the pads, clipped to deep backward square leg for one"
"a short delivery outside off, Whiteley drags the pull past midwicket for two. Probably the wrong shot with the angle going wide outside off"
"a slower ball on middle, inside-edged towards midwicket"
"full and wide outside off, hammered with fierce power past cover for a couple. Nicely hit"
"131 kph, a short delivery on leg, Whiteley fails to connect with a pull and is struck on the body. They steal a leg bye."

"drifts on the pads, clipped to square leg"
"137 kph, full and wide outside off, driven away to cover"
""

"full and wide outside off, caressed away towards the sweeper cover"
"a wide yorker outside off, ends up as a low full toss. Malik slices the ball to backward point. Either side and that's a productive shot."
"change in length, short outside off, pulled away with decent timing and power into the gap at midwicket for two"
"lovely placement. Quetta keep feeding Malik there, short and wide again, placed behind point for four. No chance for third man even on a slow outfield."
"nailed for four. Goes full, and straight but it's in the Malik hitting arc. Drilled past the umpire for four. Long-on this time just runs around to pick the ball up from the boundary"
"a slower short delivery. Malik had jumped down leg to make room, sliced away to backward point."
"a slower ball and it's smashed over long-on. Not great timing from Whiteley, he was slightly early through the shot but he still go so much timing and power behind the shot that it carried over"
"full and wide, scythed away to the sweeper cover"
"short and wide outside off, sliced away in front of third man for a couple. More terrific timing and placement from Malik."

"a short delivery down leg, Whiteley, this time, can't connect with a pull, off the glove towards short fine leg."
"another wide, short and wide outside off, too wide for legality"
"a short delivery outside off, too quick for Whiteley who chooses to pull instead of cut. It goes over the bat"
"another bouncer, short around off, but it's called wide. Too high says the umpire"
"taken at mid-off. Full outside off, Whiteley can't make adequate contact with an attempted swat. The timing is so bad that it lobs to mid-off. Decent cameo from Whiteley."
"full and straight, worked away to deep midwicket"
"a length delivery around off, nudged into the short midwicket region. Rahat sprints across, but can't do much"
"a yorker around off, well directed again, pushed back to the bowler"
"drifts on the pads, a poor delivery and worked away behind square for four. Takes <strong>Malik to fifty</strong>, another professional knock"
"dropped and parried for six. Nawaz the fielder. Should have done better. A short delivery around off, heaved away to Nawaz, who runs to his right, gets to the ball but the ball bursts out of his reverse-cupped hands."
"a slower ball outside off, carved to point"
an excellent yorker outside off. Malik jams it out to the bowler.
"looking for the yorker but he misses his length, ends up as a full delivery outside off. The front leg is cleared and the heave goes well over long-on"
"a low full toss outside off, swatted away down to long-on, on the bounce"
"it's the slower one that drifts, keeps moving away. Pollard says I don't care much for that and drills a lofted drive over cover. Nonchalant."
"stunning batting from Malik. Another full delivery, he knows exactly what he plans to do if he gets a ball there, and that is smash the ball over cover."
"a legcutter around off, helped along to deep backward square leg"
"a yorker outside off, jammed down to short third man, who fumbles the ball away. No harm done."

gets this to bend back in to hit the thigh pad as he looks to work this into the leg side.
"slants a length ball on off stump, defended towards point"
"pulled with disdain, on the bounce to the midwicket fence. Lined himself up for the stroke and gave it a whack when it arrived"
beaten on the drive. Shaped to play the perfect one through cover. Down on one knee and all that
"beaten by an away-going length ball that keeps a touch low, Watson looked to slap that through cover point"
"full and angled away again, left alone this time"
"sitting up for the pull, he goes through with the stroke but finds the fielder in the deep, who takes it on the bounce."
beaten again as he looks to cut. This kept low again
up and over. Literally smashed over point. No one moved. Too short from Tanvir
"full but down leg, Sanga fluffs a straightforward take. Five wides."
rasping cut but Umar Gul does well to run around at square third man to cut that off on the dive. The outfield is quite greasy at the moment
mistimes a slog towards mid-on
nice stride forward as he drives to cover
eased into the off side as they take a single
"oh, dear. Pollard has <b> dropped a straightforward offering at slip. </b> Watson will surely remind him! Looked to cut but the ball bounced and got the thick edge. Pollard caught between wanting to take it with the fingers pointing upwards as against the traditional way."

eased towards point this time

"slapped between cover and point. Too short, this was sitting up nicely for him to thrash it away"
"punched to cover, good stop"
"crashed through point, no chance for square third man even though he was just about 10 metres away from the ball. Poor from Tanvir. Too short, too much width"

shapes to sweep but this one bounces to hit him on the pad and lob towards the helmet. Drifting down though
"cuts but this is a superb stop at point by the skipper, saved some runs"

"wrong'un that he picks, turned to square leg"
bunts this gently into the off side
pulled on the bounce to the man at deep midwicket
"hint of width, steered down to third man"
fetches this pull from outside off but can only hit it as far as the deep square leg fielder. Watson was chancing his luck with the bigger boundary but couldn't quite get the timing as he got this high on the bat. Umar Gul announces himself.

now he has a second wicket in two overs. Shafiq has been consumed by a rush of blood. Advanced to go over cover but ended up slicing this to third man. Gave himself too much room.

driven firmly but can't pick the gap at cover.
"flat on middle and leg, pushed to long-on from the crease."
"the reverse sweep, KP misses and is outta here! He looks for a wild, out-of-the-blue reverse sweep, and misses. Struck in front and the umpire gives him! It's one of those dismissals, did that pitch in line? Did it patter where it pitched because he was looking for that switch hit-type shot. There's no review from KP, although there should have been. <b>Replays indicate Malik had overstepped too</b>, wow. In the days where everything is checked ..."
"slow down leg, clipped to square leg"
"a low full toss outside off, sliced away to deep cover"

"a slower delivery outside off, tapped towards gully. Sanga gets across"
"another slower delivery, on middle, punched to long-off. But he has overstepped, so an extra run and a free hit."
"that's nicely played, a short, slow wide delivery. Rameez doesn't bother hammering it, instead just upper cuts the ball over the keeper for four. Clever batting."
"a slower ball around off, worked into the midwicket region for two. Right in the gap. Soft hands too."
"another slower ball, chopped away into the off side."

"short and down leg, Rameez smashes it behind square. Waited for the ball to come to him and easy pickings thereon."
"95 kph, shortish around off, pushed to cover from the back foot"
"a flat six. That's an awesome hit. Sir Viv is impressed, that's how good it was. He chipped down with nimble feet and drilled the ball over the umpire's head. Dead straight. So much power too."
"another well-placed and well-run two. On the pads, worked away in front of square with soft hands. And he races back for two does Rameez"
"ooh that's a friendly full toss down leg, helped along behind square for a run. The fielder runs across to prevent the boundary."
"tossed up around off, 86 kph, off the outside half towards point"
"on the pads from Tahir, nudged away to square leg for a run."
"the slider, flat and straight, Rameez takes it off the stumps and slashes a cut to point"
"goes through him! Another slider, misread and the ball goes through to clatter into middle and leg stumps. The flipper, it may have been, Rameez brings the ball down too late. The ball has lots of time en route to the stumps."
"a googly down leg, nudged away to deep backward square leg."
""
"another flatter one, on the pads, nudged to deep midwicket"
"a short, wide delivery outside off to start, 140 kph, carved to deep point. Bur Irfan has overstepped. Another extra run and free hit."
smashed over long-on! That's what you get if you infringe the front line. A full delivery is in the hitting arc and Rossouw smashes the ball over long-on.
"135 kph, full around off, Rossouw somehow cuts that from the stumps, to backward point."
"taken by Badar at the sweeper cover boundary. A terrific catch, but was that shot really needed? A full, wide delivery is sliced to the fielder at deep point, Badar runs across to his right, he takes it cleanly but does he have his fingers underneath the ball? The third umpire is checking, and the <strong>soft signal is not out</strong>. So there needs to be enough evidence for the TV umpire to overturn that. It's another one of those grounded catches that ask whether the fielder has his fingers underneath it? There may be some part of the ball hitting the ground, there may not be. Who knows? Not sufficient evidence to overturn the soft signal. That's one of the rules in cricket that needs to change: the soft signal, it's affecting the TV umpire's decision even if the standing umpires are unsure. <b>If they are unsure, why do they have to make a decision?</b>"
"full and wide, dabbed down to third man for one"
"a length delivery outside off, pushed away to cover."
"shortish and wide, a chop-on towards the keeper, who needlessly lets the ball out of his gloves to catch the batsman out. Concedes an overthrow as the ball misses the stumps."
"<b>almost an outstanding catch</b>, the googly on leg, Sarfraz heaves the ball away to deep midwicket. The fielder runs to his left and is flying as both his feet are off the ground, but the ball pops out of the hands."
"on middle and leg, drilled to long-on"
"an 88 kph googly outside off, sliced to deep point"
"short and wide outside off, carved away to deep point. In the gap enough for two."
"good stop, a full toss i hit away to the right of cover. A dive prevents the ball from going through."
"94 kph, full around off, driven to long-off for a single"
"a shortish ball down leg, pulled away to deep midwicket for one."
"has he taken that? What is the soft signal? The fielder says he is not sure. Did he take the juggle? <strong>The soft signal is out this time</strong>. This is absurd, he went to the leg umpire, asked him if he saw it, he wasn't sure so did he just guess? But that's an amazing effort, a shortish delivery outside off is carved away towards Masood at backward point, who leaps up with one hand. The ball pops out, but Masood is in control of the parry as he is falling over. But is it touching the ground? it's mighty close again, I can't see a clear decision either way. And so the TV umpire may not have enough evidence to overturn that. One hand was underneath the ball, the other hand tries to cup the ball. It's the right decision from the TV umpire: not enough evidence to overturn the soft signal. But the soft signal is at it again, deciding decisions based on uncertainty (if it was an uncertain soft signal that is)."
"full delivery around off, Rossouw backs away and drills a drive through cover. Superb hit."
"a nice slower delivery outside off, Rossouw is through his swat too early."
"can't pick another slower ball. Short down leg, Rossouw can't connect with a pull"
"he picks the slower ball this time but heaves the ball into the fielder's hands at deep square leg. Waits for it, but is a bit too eager. No timing, no power, an easy catch."
"that's a fine shot though. A full delivery outside off, Anwar lifts the ball over mid-off with the full face of the bat."
"a length delivery outside off, carved to point for one"
"on middle and leg, nudged away behind square. Tahir scampers across to cut the ball off, from short fine leg"
"a short delivery outside off, pulled to deep midwicket. Shehzad runs in from deep midwicket, went for the catch right from the outset, but didn't quite get there. A fine effort nonethess. Did well to prevent the ball from going past too. Seems to have damaged some part of his arm."
"a low full toss, 130 kph, worked away to deep midwicket"
"a low full toss, shovelled into the midwicket region. The long-on fielder gets across to his left, but the ball trickles across after he half-stopped the ball"
"that is hammered for six! Anwar sits back, waits for the ball, gets a length delivery and nails his heave over long-on. That is a long way back. Sir Viv is pumping his fists in the dug-out."
"a low full toss around off, drilled down to Pollard at long-on, who saves one run."
"there is that boundary. It's six! A poor delivery from Gul, a short slower delivery drifts down leg. Nawaz pulls the ball behind square, a hit-me delivery, flies over the backward square leg boundary."
"that is some pretty awful batting. A length delivery around off, Nawaz hits the ball down to Pollard at long-on. He picked him out to perfection, what was he even trying to do? <b>That is a five-for for Umar Gul</b>, what a display this has been."
digs this in and Anwar gets underneath it. He can't even take a risk now because of that previous shot. 9 off 9 comes down to 9 off 7.
"<strong>Umar Gul has six wickets.</strong> This match is turning one way, then the other, then the other. In the end, it comes down the last over. A short delivery down leg, a slower delivery, pulled away with bad timing to short fine leg. He was too early through the shot. <strong>Gul finishes with 6 for 24, he has passed 200 T20 wickets. </strong>"
"a shortish slower ball outside off, heaved to deep square leg."
"a slower ball outside off, 110 kph, Laughlin misses the heave. He is too early through the slower ball. Have to be set up for the slower ones"
"and run-out? A slower ball outside off is heaved into the gap at square leg. The fielder dives and stops the ball from hitting the boundary, the throw is to Pollard at the bowler's end, who fails to collect the ball before breaking the stumps. That would <strong>have been a run-out had he collected</strong>, Laughlin was well short."
"a slower ball around off, heaved away into no-man's land. Plonks for a couple. Wow."
"<strong>Hasan picks the slower ball and wins the game for Quetta!</strong> Scenes here in Dubai. Sir Viv is pumped. A slower ball around off, Hasan clears the front leg and nails the slog over midwicket. Sublime timing. A much-needed win for Quetta."
