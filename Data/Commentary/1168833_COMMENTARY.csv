"short, and it bursts past him down the leg side ... or does it? There's an appeal for a strangle down the leg side, and the umpire says no.

"<b>plumb in front!</b> Hasan steams in and issues forth a full delivery that jags sharply in to Hammad to hit him flush on the front pad. There's a desperate review, but the replay ball tracker comes up with umpire's call on impact.  <b>Hasan has bowled 11 dots today, and taken four wickets</b> (so far).

Green walks across and digs a yorker out to square leg to put Irfan on strike for the last ball
