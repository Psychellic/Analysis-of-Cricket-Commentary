"a lovely, typical start from Bhuvneshwar. On a length, close to off, inside-edged past the stumps for a run to fine leg. That indecisive length for the batsman - should I go forward or go back"
"full delivery outside off, checking if there is some swing in the air. Not much, left alone comfortably"
"132 kph, impeccable. Good length delivery outside off, punched nicely to mid-off. Not much swing so far"
"good cricket. Good length delivery outside off, mis-timed so badly to mid-off that even Kohli can't prevent the intent-laden single"
"138 kph, fullish delivery on a fourth/fifth-stump line, defended to mid-off"
"good end, typical Bhuvneshwar. Accurate and tidy, full and straight, pushed to mid-on"
"length on middle and leg, off the pad. A rather routine flick that"
"width. Not much but enough. Good length outside off, moving away, carved away confidently to the cover fielder"
"beauty. He's getting that angle to move across the left-hander. Depending on how much movement is there, you adjust your length. The previous ball was a tad too wide, he adjusts immediately. Starts this straighter, and gets this to jag across <strong>and beat the bat</strong>. Sensational."
"on a length around off, defended into the off side"
"not much movement on this occasion, starts it straight, worked to square leg. Nice, watchful start from Sri Lanka"
"132 kph, maiden. On a length on a fourth-stump line, pushed to mid-off where Kohli scurries to his left to field"
"a bit of width, but not much. Pushed away into the off side"
"whipped away. Over the infield. A calculated risk. Full and straight outside off, Dickwella moves across and lifts the ball easily over mid-on. Intentional. Good planning and execution"
too straight again and Dickwella finds the gap through midwicket this time. All along the ground. Axar times his dive well in front of the midwicket boundary. That's good batting
"on a length around off, defended towards point"
"full outside off, pushed up to mid-off. 86 mph"
"that's not a good shot. He'll get four. Full outside off, Gunathilaka looks to go over mid-off, not affording himself the failsafe if he mis-timed the ball. So many of those go straight to mid-off. he doesn't time it, but skews it away to mid-off's right. Kohli doesn't dive"
"139 kph, caressed through point. Dickwella goes inside the line and then backs away so much that he takes a length delivery on leg and carves it through point. A manufactured stroke if there was ever one"
"136 kph, over fine leg. Again, a risky stroke but he gets away with it. Back of a length on leg, Dickwella lifts it comfortably, much like how players do on the Highveld, he gets underneath it and goes bottom to top through the line so it goes up. Six over fine leg"
"now, that's good cricket. On a length from around the wicket, it's a good ball. Blocked towards cover for a quick single. More of that"
"good length on off, mis-timed back to the bowler. Looking for some width"
"a slower ball on off, 111 kph, played into the off side"
"another slower ball, 119 kph, on the pads, flicked down to fine leg for one."
"full and straight from around the wicket, nudged to deep square leg"
"good stop from Chahal at square leg. A slower ball on the pads, flicked neatly but square leg runs to his left and stops a couple extra runs"
"84 mph, fuller than a good length outside off, defended towards point. A loud call of no"
"another quality single. Just patted away to point, both batsmen respond positively. That's what India's openers do very well too"
"112 kph, another slower ball, close to off, pushed to point"
"136 kph, fullish on the pads, Dickwella gives himself room and defends to mid-off. Kohli is not happy"
"another slower ball outside off, 69 mph, defended to point. Pace off the ball from India's seamers"
"138 kph, good length outside off, dabbed towards backward point. Straight to Rahul"
"goes short. Not a bad change in length, back of a length down leg, pulled to fine leg"
"six more! 85 mph, on a length on middle and leg. Dickwella shuffles across, gets inside the line and pulls over backward square leg. Fine timing"
"87 mph, fullish on leg, pushed to mid-on"
"a slower ball on leg, 112 kph, Dickwella gives himself room and pushes to wide mid-off for one"
"excellent timing through cover. It's his hands, the power he generates when he meets the ball with his bottom hand. That's what beats Pandya who ends up escorting the ball. Back of a length, just outside off, punched"
"slower ball, the knuckle ball, actually, guides it to point"
blocks a back of a length delivery just outside off
on the pads and Dickwella clips it to short midwicket. Loud call of no is heard from the batsmen regarding the single
"walks right across onto off stump, but Bhuvneshwar isn't fooled. Delivers a back of a length delivery outside off which is pushed to cover"
pushes a fuller delivery on off stump to cover
"another slower ball on leg, 118 kph, nudged to backward square leg"
"another slower ball outside off, Dickwella looks to pick that up through backward square leg but is deceived by the lack of pace."
"the third slower ball of the over, 114 kph, on middle and leg. No room, defended into the leg side"
"gone! 125 kph, the fourth offcutter of the over. Slow down leg, Dickwella backs away and is flummoxed into playing early (despite it being the fourth straight slower ball). He does and chips a catch to Dhawan at midwicket who leaps up and to his left. That's another start Dickwella has thrown away"
"good option from Bumrah. Goes back to full pace, 136 kph, on leg, worked to midwicket. Looking for the yorker"
"another slower ball on leg, 108 kph, nudged to midwicket"
"lovely delivery. On a length around off, fourth-stump line. Defended towards point. Gunathilaka wants one, Mendis doesn't"
"too straight, off the pad to short fine leg. Should have put that away."
"136 kph, good length outside off, punched through extra cover for a run. Staying on the back foot, nice stroke"
strays down leg for a wide. Just a bit too straight to Gunathilaka again
"and again. This one beats short fine leg. On a length down leg, Gunathilaka misses a flick but the ball takes the pad and beats short fine leg to his left."
"much better comeback. Full and straight - towards off and middle, inside-edged towards midwicket"
"that's poor bowling. 82 mph, on leg and full. Help yourself. Alright, says Gunathilaka with a neat flick through backward square leg. In his bid not to afford width, he's given away eight runs"
"good length on off, or just outside off, 134 kph, defended nicely"
"short and wide outside off, 86 mph, slashed straight to Rahul at backward point"
"there may have <strong>been an edge there</strong>. Very slow delivery outside off, Mendis plays inside the line, gets a thick edge which falls a few metres in front of Dhoni"
"another slower ball outside off, 117 kph, left alone"
"good length outside off, 134 kph, Mendis sees the length early, stays back and punched to point"
"Bumrah's second maiden. Full and straight, hammered back to Bumrah who fields off his own bowling"
"starts off too straight, nudged down to fine leg for one"
"flight on leg, plenty of flight. Mendis shuffles his feet to make some room and drives to long-off nicely"
"walks down, gets to the pitch and drives to long-on. Good use of the feet, good batting"
"a tad short this time, short and wide, Mendis stays back and slashes a cut to the sweeper cover fielder"
"slow outside off, 79 kph, pushed back to the bowler from the back foot"
"more flight outside off, Gunathilaka gets to the pitch and drives back to the bowler"
"134 kph, short delivery outside off, a bouncer that's rather wide outside off. Mendis watches it go by"
"good length outside off, 132 kph, defended to point. Played that late"
"a slower delivery outside off, worked to square leg for one"
"uses the bouncer well but this is over the head. The right call of wide. Digs this in, Gunathilaka ducks"
"a short slower ball outside off, sliced to backward point"
"another slower ball, nudged to square leg"
"a slow, full delivery outside off, not great timing with his drive but Mendis finds cover"
"83 kph, driven back to the bowler"
"nice single. Plenty of flight on that outside off, defended towards cover and calls for one does Gunathilaka"
"81 kph, on the pads, worked to midwicket. Good stop by Dhawan, got to the ball quickly"
"flight on off, defended. Plenty of loop on that"
"lots of flight again on that, driven to mid-on"
"shortish this time, and Mendis immediately shuffles back, but his cut finds point. Five dots in that over, not good enough"
"a wide. Short but well down leg, poor execution from Pandya. Wide on height and line"
"good length on leg, worked to square leg for one"
"that's intentionally played. Slightly risky but he gets away with it. A slower delivery outside off, Mendis opens the bat face late and gets it through the vacant slip region"
"a change-up in pace, 138 kph, good length around off, defended"
"short and wide, too much width and Mendis won't keep missing out. Got there later to ensure he got it behind point. Nicely played"
"full outside off, a mis-timed drive finds mid-on"
good comeback but plenty of damage in that over. Mendis defends a good delivery away to cover
"a juggle from Dhoni but Gunathilaka is so far out of his crease that Dhoni stays calm, catches the juggle and takes off the bails. Plenty of flight on that from Chahal, may have got some drift too. But Gunathilaka uses his feet as soon as he sees some flight. Misses the line due to that drift, yorks himself and Dhoni makes a tough stumping look tough. Got the job done ably"
"that's tripe from Chahal. A low full toss from Chahal, Tharanga may have been wary of the full toss (considering his first-match dismissal), but caresses this through cover. 'Na, na, na' goes Dhoni"
"flat outside off, goes on with the arm, outside-edged to slip. Well bowled"
"the frailties of a wristspinner. Can often bowl two lengths. This is too short and extremely wide, Tharanga guides this past backward point late and will get four"
"sweet strike. Flight outside off, driven to cover who parries the ball towards mid-off"
"too straight this time, and flicked away towards square leg for one"
"good length outside off, 131 kph, patted away to backward point"
"good line, just outside off, defended back"
"fullish delivery outside off, outside-halved down to third man. Well played. Nice, safe way to get one"
"good length around off, blocked back to the bowler"
"that's better execution of the short ball. Aimed at the badge, forcing Tharanga to get underneath it"
"another one! Sri Lanka falling away. Good length outside off, Tharanga fishes at it, gets a thick outside edge and flies straight to a wide slip. That's terrific bowling. The old 1-2, the full, wide ball after the short one, gets just enough lateral movement too, the ball shaping away. Tharanga wafts and pays the price for a flirty, nothing stroke. Good captaincy from Kohli too, to have himself there."
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> as Mendis plays a sweep to a straight ball, drifting into him. Misses bat, but it would have carried down leg"
"picks the shortish length quickly, but even as he cuts hard, he finds point"
"loopy delivery on middle, defends capably"
"gets some <b>drift into the bat</b> again, Mendis makes sure to present the straight face"
"the flatter trajectory lures Mendis into cutting the ball as he backs away from it and good thing he makes contact too because that was hustling through towards off stump. Good pace and flight variations, even though he isn't really turning the ball"
ignores a back of a length delivery outside off
covers the line of the shortish ball on off stump
"<b>makes him hop</b> with a bouncer that gets up higher than Mathews expects. He is shaping to block a shortish delivery, but it rears at him looking for his throat. So all the batsman can do is take the bottom hand off and make sure it falls safely"
<b>straightens off the angle</b> and squares up the batsman as he defends in front of off stump. Pandya hitting the deck and looking threatening under cloudy skies
"short, a shade outside off, Mathews lets it fly by"
opens the face and guides the shortish delivery on off stump to deep third man
"fullish delivery, angling in with the arm. Mathews defends"
brings him forward to block a full delivery on off stump. Quick pace.
"<b>that's loopy</b>, and it's wider as well so Mathews attempts a slash. But he hasn't informed his feet about those intentions. They don't move <b>and he's beaten</b>"
drives to long-off
presses forward to block a good length ball aimed at the off stump
"the front foot is across, and Axar fires in a quicker ball on off stump, so Mendis has to defend around his pad"
"short, wide, Mathews is camping on the back foot as he pulls to short midwicket"
finds midwicket again as Pandya keeps digging it in. Mathews throws his head back in frustration
"now for the fuller delivery on off stump, Mathews defends from the crease, but he does use a straight bat which ensures his mistake isn't costly"
nudges a fullish delivery on off stump towards short midwicket
"drills it to the long-on boundary. Leans into the shot, but then checks it because he is, for a moment, worried about the ball not coming onto the bat. No reason for such caution. He has timed it beautifully, as evidenced by the ball flying past the stumps despite the lack of followthrough"
turns it away to long leg
"flatter delivery on middle and off, Mathews, leaping back, is surprised by the lack of bounce. Adjusts well enough with a straight bat block"
presses forward to block a fuller delivery outside off
<b>hint of turn</b> as Axar fires a fuller delivery outside off. Mathews plays with it to short cover
takes the ball angling into middle and pats it to long-on
races down the pitch and spears a good length ball past the left of the cover fielder. Good footwork - needs to be quick to do that against Axar's rapid pace
hangs back to a good length ball on off stump and clips it on top of the bounce to square leg
"shapes to hit it through leg, but with the flight on the ball, and the threat of turn, he plays with it and drives to cover"
"this time, with the line drifting to leg stump, he plays the sweep and sends it screaming to deep square leg"
blocks a flighted delivery outside off
drifts it into the middle stump and gets it to turn away. Mathews gives that ball the respect it deserves
"punches a quicker, flatter delivery on middle to long-on"
reaches out to the bait - dangled outside off - and drives along the ground to short cover
"thinks about whipping a good length ball across the line, but then reminds himself that Axar thrives on such mistakes and so punches with a straight bat to long-on"
"backs away seeing the short ball on off stump, but still can't pick the gap with the cut"
"tosses it up wide outside off, to see if Mendis would be tempted into a big shot. But he doesn't have to take such risks. Can leave and collect the extra"
<b>kicks up off the pitch</b> leaving Mendis to smother the good length ball with his wrists on off stump
"shortish and outside off, cuts to point"
"good shot - he sweeps, but does so without bending the back knee fully, and that is intentional because he knows he won't have the time for that luxury with Axar bowling so quick. Single to long leg"
"good length outside off, defends with an open face"
makes sure to keep the front leg away because Chahal is drifting the ball in nicely. That then allows him to whip a full delivery on middle to short midwicket
"loopy and outside off, he drives to short cover"
"<b>opts for the review after being ruled lbw</b>. It wasn't an immediate decision, so there might not be bat involved. Doesn't seem to be on replay as Mendis plays a sweep to a good length ball on middle. 'No bat,' says the third umpire. Three reds and umpire Martinesz decision stands. Mendis does play this shot very well, but this time, he chooses to do so against a straight and quick delivery. And bringing the bat down across the line off a high backlift takes time. Far too much time on this occasion, certainly"
"tosses it up outside off, drives to cover"
"full on off stump, drives to mid-off and takes the single, but he has to drag Mathews along because he was ball-watching"
drifts in with the flight and Mathews works it from leg stump to to long-on
"flat and straight, drifts on, pushed back to the bowler"
"flight outside off, pushed away to the sweeper cover for a run. Leant on that"
"a bit of width from Axar, Siriwardana goes back and executes a deft late cut through third man for four. Uses the pace"
"flat and straight, slightly fuller, defended back"
"slow outside off, quite full, sliced off the outside half towards point for one"
"nicely bowled, flight outside off, defended to cover"
"eases his drive through cover, the drift away from the left-hander, and a half-volley length allowing him to do so"
turns a tossed up delivery shaping in the air into leg stump to short midwicket
drives the flighted delivery on middle and leg inside out to long-off. Mathews was left unbeaten in the last match. Will he get more support today?
"pushes a flighted delivery to mid-off, who has come up for the new batsman"
"on the pads, for <b>this is the googly</b>, with Chahal wanting the left-hander to close the face of the bat and hit into the leg side. Siriwardana does, but there isn't much turn and he escapes with a single to deep square leg"
clips a good length ball on the stumps through square leg
"cuts from the stumps, which is risky against Axar. Weird choppy sound as the ball wanders to backward point"
"he's squared up, and brings his wrists into play big time, worried about the ball on middle <b>turning and bouncing</b>"
defends a good length ball on middle
drives fluently to long-off
"on the pads, Siriwardana clips to short midwicket"
"goes for the lap sweep with no one saving the single, or more importantly catching there. Axar's pace lends itself to that shot, especially with a left-hander on strike"
"comes down the track at the first sign of pace and heaves the length ball to the wide long-on boundary. Not entirely convincing, other than to exemplify how Sri Lanka think it is hard to play the spinners"
defends a good length ball on off stump. Some shape away off the pitch.
"tosses it up on middle, Mathews nudges to midwicket"
"there's the low-arm slider, pushes to long-on"
"gets back and punches a good length, quicker ball to point"
"low-arm slingy slider, which Siriwardana drives to deep cover"
"full and quick on off stump, Siriwardana defends"
width outside off and he cuts to the sweeper on the offside boundary
"<b>appeal for lbw and Reiffel gives it</b>. Axar strikes, and it's the big one too as Mathews walks back, the second Sri Lankan out sweeping. He plants his front leg across and tries to smack the good length ball on off stump away. But it's just that tiny bit too quick. The umpire took his time, wondering if the impact was in line with off stump, and then said yes. HawkEye show it would have been umpire's call..."
"quick, straight, on leg stump, turns it to midwicket"
"drifts it down leg, Kapu tries to flick it away, but it drifts past his inside edge"
pushes it to mid-on and runs with the shot
"good length ball outside off, dabs it to backward point"
"shortish on off stump, defends"
"back of a length and outside off, dabs to point"
on the pads and he clips it away past midwicket
"slower ball, Kapu doesn't really pick it, and adjusts by taking the bottom hand off the bat as he defends outside off"
"this time he sees the change of pace early, tries to take advantage of the shortish length and hints of width with a dab to third man. Kohli at slip moves to his right to foil such plans"
"top pace, looking to break the stumps, Kapu drives and feels the bottom of his bat afterwards"
"full on leg stump, clips it to square leg"
"tries to heave a good length ball over the leg side, but the slower ball, which dips before Siriwardana can get to it draws the inside edge"
"fuller delivery outside off, slices it to point"
defends a good length ball on off stump
pushes a fuller ball back past the bowler's left
"good length, on off stump, taps it down the ground and Axar rushes to his left to field it himself"
"<b>half an appeal for caught behind</b> as the bouncer soars over Kapu's left ear. Sensational bowling from Bumrah. Doesn't dig it in halfway - and that means the batsman can't spot it right away. He goes for the hook, but his balance is all off and he can't connect"
guides the back of a length ball to point
slower ball on off stump defends to point
"pummels the short ball that doesn't rise to the square leg boundary. Hits it in front, actually, which shows that short ball lacks venom and Kapu sees it early"
rolls his fingers down the side as the legcutter takes the outside edge to deep third man
"short ball outside off, pats it to point"
launches a warm-up delivery - short and on off stump - to the square leg boundary. Excellent cricket. Livens up the crowd
"now that's more the ball he was looking for - a rapid bouncer, from around the wicket, soaring over the left-hander's head. Wide though"
"shapes to pull again with the ball coming into him. But it is a bit too full to go through with that shot, so Siriwardana turns it into a short-arm jab through midwicket"
blocks a shortish delivery on off stump through midwicket
"goes for the pull, but ends up inside edging the short ball onto his body."
"full on middle, Kapu defends the off-pace delivery"
"back of a length and outside off, punches to point"
"short and outside off, cuts to the sweeper"
smacks a flatter delivery on off stump to long-on
"there's the low-arm slider, but it goes wide outside off"
punches a quicker ball on off stump to deep cover
"the sweep doesn't work again for a Sri Lankan, as Kapu plays it to another low-arm slider from Jadhav. The line is off for the lbw though, would have wandered down leg"
"comes in with the angle, but Siriwardana seems to expect it as he makes room outside leg and late cuts the ball nearly to the third man boundary. Playing quite sensibly so far"
"full and outside off, he drives to long-off"
"good length delivery on leg, worked down to fine leg for one"
"nicely played. Good length outside off, patted down towards gully for another easy single"
"pace off the ball. A slower full delivery outside off, inside-edged towards fine leg"
"good short one. Change in length surprises Kapugedara, who sways away from the line"

"slow and straight, pushed back. Nicely bowled. Drifts on with the arm"
"full and wide, slides on again, driven to cover"
"shortish outside off, punched to the sweeper cover from the back foot"
"a long run there. 80 kph, outside off, driven towards Kohli at cover, who has to dive away to his right"
"six! Short on leg, sits up for Siriwardana, who goes back, picks the length and hammers a cross-batted pull over midwicket. Fantastic execution, primarily because there was a massive gap there"
"shortish on leg, worked to square leg for one"
"off the face of the bat, nicely played, gets low and executes a late paddle sweep towards fine leg. Races back for the second"
"too straight from Axar, nudged away to square leg"
"a bit of width. Short and wide from Axar, Siriwardana looking for the late cut but misses"
"a direct hit from Bumrah, but Siriwardana is home. Guided to short third man for a tight run, but well judged in the run."
"full and wide outside off, the ball sliding on, carved away to point. No run, no width"
"flat on the pads, worked away towards midwicket. A little hesitation but an easy run"

driven straight to cover
"flight on the pads, worked to midwicket"
"good from Kapugedara, after five dot balls, he could have lost his calm, but chooses the best option to that ball, a languid drive to long-off with the spin"
"plenty of flight on that from Chahal, Kapugedara slices a drive towards point for a couple"
"in the air, but in the gap to long-off. Good use of the feet"
"flight on leg and middle, Siriwardana backs away and chips a drive over cover for a couple. Hardik Pandya labours to the ball"

"flat, quick and straight, pushed back to the bowler"
"full delivery on off, squeezed out to deep point for one. Pretty well played"
"flight on off, driven on the up but finds long-off. He has to get inside the line if he wants to go over cover"
"drifts on with the arm. Flat outside off, drifts on, and beats the bat"
"a bit of turn on this one. Full outside off, a flirty drive from Siriwardana, hits back to the bowler"
"driven to long-on for a run. End of Axar Patel's spell. Tidy, 1 for 30."
"that's utter tripe. Short on middle and off, sits up for Siriwarana, pulled to wide long-on for a couple. Rahul pulls it in"
"the drifter, slides on with the arm with his round-arm action, pushed back to the bowler"
"flat on off and middle, low-arm again, driven to long-off for a run"
"a low full toss, driven to the sweeper cover for a run. They bail out of the second late"
"short and wide, carved straight to Bhuvneshwar at point. There is a misfield, that allows them a second. And then Dhoni fails to collect. Three. Enables <strong>Siriwardana to get to fifty</strong>, a fantastic rearguard innings"
"shortish and wide, smashed down to long-off"
"flat on middle, pulled to deep midwicket for one"
"lovely stroke. Flight from Chahal, Siriwardana lifts the ball over cover. Wide long-off gets there. Full face of the bat"
"a low full toss, driven to long-off"
"looking for the big hit. Like he does in the small boundaries of Bengaluru, Chahal fires this wide outside off, a sliced drive finds the sweeper cover"
"comes down again, another skewed drive to long-off. Pandey fumbles, but recovers quickly to prevent the second. Awkward bounce"
"edged, but there is no slip at this time of the innings. Flat outside off, some spin, takes the edge and flies through third man for four. Lucky, but Kapugedara will not care"
"flat outside off, punched up to long-off"
"flat down leg, swept to deep backward square leg"
"shortish and wide, clattered to the sweeper cover for one"
"drifts down leg for wides. Pandya labours after it, puts in a dive and prevents some runs. Good stop by Pandya, but why is he fielding if he can't?"
a low-arm flat delivery outside off is hammered back to the bowler
"goes for it, full on leg, Kapugedara's big slog skews away off the inside half to deep midwicket"
"shortish on off, slapped back to the bowler. Not Jadhav's best day, but not a bad job either"

"a short slower ball outside off, sliced away towards backward point for one."
"a good yorker, on leg, nudged to midwicket"
"another slower ball outside off, sliced to Pandya's right at short third man. Pandya puts in a dive to save three"
"and gone! 111 kph, slower delivery on off. Siriwardana looks to go straight but the ball skews off the outside half and lobs to cover. An easy catch. But that was a terrific knock, the best of the series for Sri Lanka."
"a legcutter to start, on off, blocked to cover. Good that the fielder is stopping the single."
"another slower delivery on the pads, worked away to square leg for one"
"<b>dropped by Chahal</b> at deep midwicket! Extremely poor cricket all around. Full delivery on off, Kapugedara slogs the ball straight to Chahal on the boundary, who spills a relatively simple catch and concedes four. Just after the wicket, Kapugedara takes a big, big risk. His hand is on the ball and the boundary simultaneously, but the third umpire thinks otherwise."
"full and wide outside off, goes past Kapugedara's drive. Looking for another big hit."
"a legcutter but well outside off, outside the tramline and wide called"
"fantastic stop by Dhawan at backward point. Full and wide, sliced away. Dhawan dives to his left and stops three"
"good length delivery outside off, outside-edged down to third man. Good batting. Bat on ball required at this time."
"slower delivery outside off, guided away to the sweeper cover. Good stuff from Dananjaya"
"135 kph, lovely yorker. Accurate. Inside-edged into the pad for a run. No, says umpire Reiffel, but <strong>Kohli asks for the review.</strong> A big inside edge"
"good short delivery on leg, forces Dananjaya underneath that. Not too high"
"gone by a distance if he hit. Back of a length outside off, Dananjaya is hurried on his pull, finds mid-off and calls one. Axar picked up cleanly but missed the stumps at the bowler's end."
"another terrific delivery, full on leg, inside-edged into the pad. Not the slower one"
"135 kph, gone underneath the bat this time. Full and straight, Kapugedara can't do much. Gets his hands down too late and the ball sneaks under the bat."
"good length delivery on leg, goes past Dananjaya's pull"
"137 kph, full on off, hammered straight to mid-off. No run. SL losing their way again"
nicely worked down to fine leg but just one. Not enough
flicked away past midwicket for a couple. Nice shot from Chameera
"a big heave from Chameera. A slower ball outside off, the ball trickles away backwards of square for a couple."
"good end from Bhuvneshwar. Back of a length outside off, rushes Chameera on his pull and goes past."
"smashed away for four. Bumrah makes the mistake of going length, Dananjaya makes room, stays back and clatters a pull over midwicket. Very intentional"
"the slower ball and gone! Short and slow on off, Dananjaya slices a pull straight up. Axar runs across from mid-off and takes an easy catch"
"the slower one again outside off, slogged to deep midwicket, just one"
"looks for it, the full delivery outside off, driven back to the bowler"
"another slower ball outside off, completely deceives Fernando, beaten on the outside edge"
"goes for the yorker, doesn't quite find it, hit away to long-off. The long-on fielder gets across and stops the ball. Terrific comeback after that first-ball boundary"
"the yorker on leg, inside-edged down to fine leg"
"140 kph, another yorker down leg, flicked away towards backward square leg for on"
"short delivery outside off, Fernando can't get bat on ball. Good change in length again"
"another well-delivered yorker on leg, skewed away to mid-on"
"a slower ball outside off, Chameera misses a guide"
"good end. Back of a length down leg, Chameera can't get bat on ball. Dhoni fumbles the collection and Sri Lanka scamper a bye"
"<b>that could have been number 299!</b> A ripper of an outswinger, pitching on a good length in line with off stump and then darting viciously past the splayed feet and the poking bat of Rohit"
"and there's the counter, standing up tall, showing the high elbow and punching a short ball through cover. Effortless shot, and after two balls in the chase, it's Malinga 1, his Mumbai Indians captain Rohit 1"
"slides down leg side does the 134 kph delivery, with Malinga looking for the magic ball, zig-zagging from leg to off"
"good bowling, targeting middle stump and making Rohit play with the ball moving away off the pitch. If there's one bowler that can make Sri Lanka win un-winnable matches, it's Malinga"
pats a good length ball at 136 kph to mid-on. Little bit of nibble away again and Rohit shows it due care
nudges a shortish delivery on off stump to the right of mid-on
"beautiful bowling - spears it in on middle, and the full ball, which is threatening all on its own, swings into the left-hander, making Dhawan hurry into his shot."
"looking to angle the ball across the right-hander from over the wicket, he takes it too far"
"<b>outside edge</b> wanders past the lone first slip to deep third man. Good bowling from Fernando, pitching it up, luring the drive, and Rohit obliging without moving his feet"
"and he bowls too straight, allowing Dhawan the liberty of an easy flick off the pads to deep square leg. Gunathilaka on the boundary does well to save a couple"
"full on off stump, defends with the straight face"
"back of a length on leg stump, defends"
"looks for <b>the yorker, with the ball tailing into Dhawan</b>. The batsman does well to keep his feet out of the way and present as straight a bat as possible"
blocks a back of a length delivery on off stump.
"drifts a good length ball down leg, as Rohit flicks and misses. Malinga has been left hanging by the outswinger"
"<b>excellent line</b>, looking for the top of off stump, with a little bit of shape away. Rohit blocks"
<b>hits the pads</b> as he bowls full and straight - perhaps a touch too straight as Rohit flicks a bit too early
another wide down leg. Malinga makes a hand gesture that is meant to will himself back into the proper line and length
"firm straight bat in line with a full ball on middle and off. India playing this well. They realise this is a tough period and are eschewing every risk. Even the flick through midwicket, which they would play naturally to anything in line with the stumps, seem taboo"
"how about that?! Over square leg, <b>nonchalant</b>! This is the kind of shot Rohit has avoided, but just to prove that he has it in his locker he takes a length ball on middle and shows it the works. Flicked to oblivion"
strays in line again and Rohit works it behind square leg to collect a couple before Fernando can catch up with the ball
"looks to clip a full delivery across the line, and gets an inside edge onto pad. Malinga launches an appeal, before realising its futility"
"pushes a fuller delivery on off stump to cover and then asks for a new bat. That one sounded odd, coming off the bottom of the blade"
"fullish and outside off, Dhawan charges down the track to hack it to cover"
"sliding too straight and Dhawan has tapped it behind square leg, making sure he can keep it away from the fielder in the deep"
"full and outside off, pushes to cover, who then misfields to allow the single. That's not on, and it's the hero from the batting innings, Siriwardana"
<b>bottom edge</b> as Rohit goes chasing after a good length ball outside off. Doesn't carry to the keeper with the ball keeping low
"short-arm pull and away flies the new cherry. Short ball, and though it is near enough to the stumps, it is punished for its length. That's how good Rohit's hands are. They don't really need room sometimes"
"spears it to the right of backward point and deep third man can't make the ground. <b>Excellent placement</b>, and that's all he concentrates on as he gets down to the wide half-volley with an open face"
slower ball on leg stump - seems Malinga's realised the ball isn't swinging anymore - Dhawan clips to square leg
"back of a length on off stump, Rohit turns it to midwicket"
tucks a short ball off his hips to long leg
<b>beaten</b> as he feels for a fuller delivery outside off. Malinga scrounges up every little bit of movement there is out there and it's still not enough to fetch a wicket
"back of a length and outside off, Rohit doesn't bother with it"
"full on middle, Dhawan keeps back to block"
not quite short enough for the late cut which is why Dhawan's decision to do so doesn't lead to profit. Chops the ball by his feet
"steps out to the medium-pacer, but Mathews pulls his length back and as a result the checked drive goes straight to point"
"punches a good length ball to the left of point, where Kapu dives and parries the ball through the covers. Great attempt, but with the cover fielder moving to his right, it ends up costing Sri Lanka"
goes for the bouncer and Rohit evades it
"comes in off the pitch, and so Rohit has to be careful as he late cuts behind point"
"shape away through the air, and Rohit defends it well."
belts a widish half-volley over extra cover! Ferocious hit from Rohit as he presses forward and hits through the line
"back of a length on middle, Rohit places it into the vacant midwicket region. The man there is at the deep"
slaps a good length ball outside off to point
"attempted slower ball, dipping on the left-hander, on leg stump, but that line makes sure Dhawan doesn't have too much to be troubled by. Flicks it behind square leg"
blocks a good length ball on middle
"full and outside off, drives to cover"
"full on off stump, defends, as Dushmantha Chameera starts warming up."
that's gorgeous! Gets up tall to bring the bat down on top of the bounce and lace it through the off side. Places it in between point and cover
"back of a length and outside off, dabs to deep third man"
drills a shortish delivery to mid-off
"slower ball on off stump, pushes it to cover"
"138kph, shortish and outside off, Rohit blocks to short cover"
"<b>mistimes</b> a pull and he's done it so badly that it doesn't carry to mid-on. A 142 kph short ball, that rises higher than Rohit expects, nearly does him"
steps forward to block a good length ball at 141 kph on off stump
"133kph, covers the shortish delivery on off stump."
"<b>scoops the 135 kph short ball over the wicketkeeper!</b>. That is outrageous. He plants his front leg across early, Chameera might well have seen it and bowled shorter. But Rohit is still able to go through with the shot and pull it off blindingly well"
soars over third man! A much easier shot to execute with the ball short and wide. All Rohit does is get under it and lash it away. India have gotten past the early new-ball swing and now are starting to party
"back of a length and outside off, dabs to third man. From scoring a hundred in the last match to being forgotten about as he makes 19 off 23..."
"good length ball, coming in off the pitch, Rohit lets it come on and glides it with soft hands to third man"
steps out of his crease and crashes a good length ball outside off to cover point
defends a good length ball from around the wicket. No quick single there in the covers
the offcutter wanders down leg and Dhawan misses out with his pull
blocks a fullish delivery on middle and leg
"another offcutter on middle, Dhawan works it to deep midwicket."
"full on middle and off, at 144 kph, Dhawan pushes to short cover, not entirely moving his feet. That's the power a fast bowler holds. He pins batsmen to the crease"
gets back and blocks a shortish delivery at 143 kph to point
"hits it into the square and it bounces clean over the point fielder. There's only a little room, but Dhawan, by virtue of waiting for the ball till the last minute, and then looking to only time the ball, benefits big time"
"143kph, half-volley, drills it straight to short cover, who misfields because of the pure power in the shot. Mendis the culprit"
"legcutter on leg stump, Rohit picks it and packs it away to long leg"
pierces the gap between point and cover but there's protection in the deep
works a shortish delivery with the angle from around the wicket to short midwicket. No spin whatsoever...
"tosses it up outside off, Dhawan drives to long-off"
"the lack of spin makes Rohit adjust and push further outside off to defend. Seeing that there aren't any fielders in the region in front of point, they pinch a single. Good running"
"tosses it up, and it drifts into middle stump. Dhawan defends"
"down the track, but Dananjaya does well to pull his length back, and the revs he consciously puts on it gives him the drift to tie Dhawan down"
"smacks it wide of mid-on! Outstanding shot, if only because he accounts for the drift the spinner is getting into the bat and uses it to his advantage. Running down the track, Dhawan keeps his legs out of the way of his powerful batswing"
"legcutter outside off, Rohit stands tall and drills it to the sweeper"
goes for the pull against a short ball from around the wicket and finds a single behind square leg even if he isn't entirely in control of the shot
"sizes up the short ball and pulls it behind square leg. Controls it well, rolling his wrists over the ball to keep it down"
"full on off stump, pushes to mid-on."
"short ball, sits up to be pummmeled to the midwicket boundary. It's 140 kph but Dhawan spots it early and climbs into it"
"full and wide outside off, slashes to deep point."
the fine top-edged paddle sweep lobs over slip for a couple. That could have easily found slip. Mathews trundles after it. Nothing going for SL
"shortish and slow on the pads, worked away through square leg. Could have been two there"
"whoa, he did not pick that at all? It was the googly. Slow on leg, goes through a big bat-pad gap to hit him on the pad"
"short and wide outside off, hammered to the deep cover fielder for a couple"
"slow and straight, pushed back to the fielder"
"lots of flight on that, pushed back to the bowler"
"good length on leg stump, worked to midwicket"
"quick single to short cover, chopped away from a good length"
"lots of flight outside off, driven away towards Siriwardana, should have been one, but the batsmen don't go for it"
"flat down leg, Rohit misses a sweep but gets one, wide"
"shortish delivery outside off, Rohit stays back and shovels a drive to long-on for one. Gets to fifty as well. All those demons in Sri Lanka seem to be busted for now"
"gets to the pitch, converts flight into a full toss and drives to long-on"
"that's another poor ball. Full and flat down leg, Rohit gets low and nails his fine sweep, behind square intentionally played. Sri Lanka not helping themselves with appalling consistency"
"comes to the pitch, doesn't quite get there and lofts the ball comfortably over mid-on. Gets so much power behind that, it clears the boundary at long-on."
knows the next ball is probably going to be short so he stays back and punches one to long-on
"gone! Looked like the legbreak again, flat and full on leg, Rohit chooses to sweep but misses it. Dhawan seemed to instructed him, if you ... Rohit absorbs what Dhawan tells him <strong>and chooses to review</strong>. No bat on that. That is another terrible review, pitches on middle and leg, hits the stumps halfway up. Three reds and Rohit throws a hundred away."
"goes past the inside edge to hit him on the pad. The googly again, ripped past. Stunning delivery"
"the routine legbreak outside off, guided towards deep point for a run"
"tripe. Short and very wide outside off, hammered to mid-on from the back foot"
"another poor delivery. Flat down leg, flicked away through midwicket for a couple"
"flight outside off, nicely carved away through point for one"
"what a catch! That was perfect timing, sprinted right from the outset, ran to the ball in a straight line - as opposed to around the ball - and took the catch inches off the ground. Stunning catch. Flat down leg from Siriwardana, would have been wide had Dhawan chosen not to sweep. His top-edged lobbed towards short fine leg. That's the best moment of the ODI series for Sri Lanka"
"flight on middle, pushed back to the bowler"
"lands just short of the sweeper cover. Flight outside off, Jadhav runs down and looks to go straight, but the ball skews off the outside half, hangs in the air for a while and lands just short of the incoming fielder"
"flight outside off, driven away to cover"
"77 kph, the googly from Dananjaya and Jadhav is castled. Completely flummoxed by the fact that an offspinner is ripping googlies - well, the direction of turn is the same. He stays back, wafts with bat well away from pad, and the ball says hello to that glaring gap and goes right through to hit middle stump. That was not a good stroke, not helped by the fact that he did not have a clue of the direction of spin"
"that's a poor ball, short down leg and Kohli helps himself to four through square leg. Easy for the class of Kohli, just his persona may have forced that bad ball"
"Kohli's gone! 4 off 2! Dananjaya spinning a web around these Indian batsmen. What's happening. Yikes. Wow. Another googly, this one is soooo full but Kohli still does not manage to get bat on that. It's full and straight, Kohli takes his pads away from the line of the ball, looking for that trademark whippy cover drive, but all that does it create a massive bat-pad gap and the stumps are disturbed again. SL in raptures."
"flight outside off, driven away towards cover. 77 kph."
"74 kph, Rahul this time does not read the googly. And India are in trouble. Sensational control of the googly, so good that the length is just terrific - it's full but not full enough that Rahul can smother the turn, it's not short, definitely not short enough for Rahul to go back. It spins back in prodigiously, clips the pad and knocks into the stumps. <b>5 wickets in 15 balls</b>. Aaaah, wow."
"runs to the pitch, pushes it back to the bowler and turns back slowly. The bowler fields, throws to the keeper, who takes off the bails. Pandya makes it with a dive."
"full outside off, defended"
"flight, full and straight, defended"
"quick and straight, inside-edged towards square leg. Dhoni will just absorb this pressure as best he can"
"flat down leg, off the pad towards fine leg"
"Dhoni calls him through, gets to the pitch, flicks towards short midwicket who parries the ball away while diving. Pandya doesn't want the run, Dhoni does. Guess who wins?"
"flat, full and straight, defended back."
"Dhoni runs to the ball, gets there as it pitches and drives to mid-off"
"and again, sets off for the run as he hits it. The legbreak, full outside off, driven to mid-off. Knew exactly what he was doing. A misfield from mid-off"
"five for Dananjaya. And India are in utter shambles. It was Ajantha Mendis in Galle! It's Dananjaya in Pallekele! The power of wristpin. It's surprise, surprise, another googly. Pandya runs down to the pitch, but does not get there. Hey, guess what that does? It creates <b>yet another bat-pad gap</b>. The snake of a googly finds that gap, and settles nicely in Dickwella's gloves. Pandya was not reading that, thought he could smother the spin but the bowler was clever enough to drag that length back."
was that the googly or the offbreak? I don't know anymore. Axar stays forward to defend
"the legbreak on middle, inside-edged to fine leg for a couple"
off the pad for some runs. Flat down leg from Dananjaya

"short and wide, Dhoni will do this nicely, goes back and slices a cut to the sweeper cover"
"short enough, and Dhoni <b>picks the googly</b>, goes back and pushes to cover"
"hangs back again, works one down to fine leg. He'll want to play them off the back foot."
"flight outside off, the legbreak, worked back to the bowler"
"howzzaaa. No, says umpire Martinesz. Flat down leg, may have been the offbreak, off the pad towards leg gully. Good catch"
"86 kph, the non-turning offbreak? Who cares, say Sri Lanka. Axar can't review even if he wants to. Yes, it is. The non-turning offbreak on off, flat and full, draws Axar forward, beats the bat on the inside edge and strikes him in front of off. Sri Lanka have formed a circle with enough energy to power those floodlights that failed in the CPL earlier today. Akila has six!"
"the googly, he picks it nicely enough, stays back and defends."
"flat and full, smothered"
"gets to the pitch, doesn't allow to pitch, flicked through the gap between <s>bat and pad</s> mid-on and midwicket"
"flat down leg, worked down to fine leg"

"nice and full, blocked"
"flat on off, defended. An over of calm."
"another googly, full, just like four of his wickets, Dhoni gets an inside edge to fine leg"
"the legbreak, flat outside off, rips past the outside edge. Don't worry if you're batting. Cover the stumps, let the ball turn away if it has to. Do it the Steven Smith way."
"shortish on middle, punched to midwicket"
"nicely played, gets right forward and defends that"
"well played. Flat outside off, gets outside the line of the stumps, does not pick it but lets it go. Read it off the pitch"

"plenty of flight, full on leg, pushed back"
"quick and straight, defended away"
"quick, but flat and full, defended"
watchfully played into the off side to end
"runs to the pitch, flight on leg, driven to long-on. Not shielding Bhuvneshwar, it's probably not the best way to play I think"
"always wanted three. Flight outside off, looks to flick that, but the ball flies off the leading edge to third man. Three"
off the inside edge towards fine leg for a run
"flight on leg, nudged through square leg"

"good change in length, the bouncer outside off. Bhuvneshwar sways out of the line"
"good length, slower ball outside off, dabbed to point"

"comes down to try and put off Malinga's yorker, nudged to short midwicket"
"short down leg, nudged down to fine leg"
"Dhoni stayed low there, anticipated a yorker, but Malinga foxed him with a bouncer. Easily watches it go by"

"good length outside off, a punched block to cover."
"lovely shot. Terrific stop too. Saves two. Back of a length on leg, pulled behind square for a couple."
"141 kph, full delivery outside off, punched to mid-on. Dhoni calls for one and gets there"
"good option from Chameera. The short delivery down leg, Bhuvneshwar misses a flick. Dickwella bails out of his appeal. Tharanga wanted the strategic review but decided against it, rightly! Good non-review."
"terrific bouncer. Short on middle and leg, Bhuvneshwar sways out of the line juuust in time."
"fullish delivery on middle, very capably defended away by Bhuvi"

"<strong>hits the stumps, but the bails don't come off!</strong> Dhoni then picks up the ball and gives it back. Wow. it hit the stumps quite hard. Back of a length on off, Dhoni misses a flick, hits the body and trickles back onto the stumps. The bails want to see more action, they don't budge"
"short outside off, pummeled to deep square leg"
"on a length outside off, blocked to cover. Bhuvi wants one, but Dhoni doesn't"
driven away languidly through sweeper cover for one
"big appeal, no says the umpire. Sri Lanka think and think and choose to review. Not the worst decision. Flat down leg, Bhuvneshwar misses his sweep and is struck in front of leg. No bat involved. Sliding down says HawkEye. One red and two oranges means Bhuvneshwar can stick on"
"shortish on off, pushed to cover"
