"slightly wider, and seamed back in. Driven back to the bowler"
"<strong>oooh</strong>, that was a moral victory for Hasan, but India are off the mark! Came back in and tucked Rohit up. The batsmen gets an inside edge on one that nipped back in, and there was no preventing it running through to the boundary."

"straighter, and flicked away through the onside. In the air slightly, but well clear of any fielder and the two come back"
"a bit too straight, and quick as a flash, Rohit works it away to square leg. The infielder has a chase, and just about prevents it going to the rope. <strong>Hasan's first over brings nine.</strong>"
"Rohit looked to leave, but didn't get his bat out of the way quickly enough. Hits the bat andgoes through to Sarfaraz on the bounce"
"brilliant bowling. Rohit looked like he was coming forward and Amir knocked him back with a sharp bouncer. The footwork wasn't there, and the lazy pull barely missed the top edge"
"the angle takes this one away. Swing doesn't seem to exist for now, and Rohit leaves it alone. Amir has been warned, officially, for stepping onto the pitch."

Rahul gets off the mark off his eighth ball
"dragged down legside, and Rohit tucks it away to fine leg"

"lovely straight drive. Rohit is getting himself in very nicely. Perhaps a touch too full from Hasan, and this time Rohit's drive to mid-off just about evades a diving Wahab Riaz"
"wider and shorter, was there to be cut away. Exactly what Rohit tried, but misses out"
"better ball, on an off-stump line. Defended deftly"
"hint of tail back in. Gets a thick inside edge onto his pad. Better over from Hasan, but still cost five runs."
"angled away from the right-hander. Inswing not there, but it does play on the batsman's mind, so remains a goo option"
"bouncer, and Rahul pulls aggressively at it. Doesn't nearly get it off the middle, but with the fielding restrictions, there was no one at midwicket, where it trickled away for four"

"fuller, slower delivery, and Rahul lets it go through to Sarfaraz"

"short again, and Rahul doesn't shy away from the pull. Wasn't completely in control,but kept it along the ground"

"on target, and quicker (87mph). Rohit lets it go"
"<strong>oh, what a shot!</strong> Rohit is on the march now! Short of a length and the batsman takes a step back and lofts it over cow corner. It's higher than it is wider, but it was timed so sweetly it just about carries over the fence. Another expensive over from Hasan"
"wider, left alone"
"better ball, beats the bat and through to the keeper"

"cheeky from KL! This one drifts down leg and Rahul brings out a fine paddle to beat short fine. Got on top of the bounce nicely, risk-free"

"scooped straight to short fine leg. Didn't have the pace to work with. Hasan shortened his length, rolled his fingers over the seam. Good execution.

excellent over in the circumstances. Short ball that Kohli works to the onside for one
"slower ball, Kohli turns the strike over to Pandya. Can he pick up the pace now?"
"what was that? A slower ball from Hasan that beat Pandya all ends up. It takes his top edge and flies through over the keeper, all the way!"
"deceived again by the slower ball, beaten completely. Excellent stuff from Hasan. He has been a little unlucky today on a number of occasions"
"and just as I say that, he sends down absolute filth. Rubbish line, way down legside, and a full toss. You don't need to be Pandya to whip that to fine leg for four, but that;s what he did"
"and he's back to the good stuff from Hasan. Tight line, and it's too close for the cut that Pandya's attempting. 11 off the over but it hasn't been too bad from the poor bowler"
"slower ball, guided down to cow corner from Pandya. The pair run two once more. 13 from that over, which rather neatly encapsulates how unlucky Hasan has been there"
"slower ball to start off, Kohli flicks it and absolutely dashes back for two. The throw is a little too inaccurate, and that gives the Indian captain his second consecutive half century"
"slapped own the ground, and beats the man at mid-off. The time to be cautious against Amir is over, it would appear"
"slow and wide, Kohli went reaching for it and they take one"
"pulverised by Pandya! Slower ball, and the batsman steps into position and absolutely bludgeons this through cover. No chance for any of the fielders, and this is dangerous for Pakistan now"
"<strong>and gone</strong>! Stunned silence from three fourths of the crowd. Helicopter shot from Pandya again, and it found the middle of his bat, but just didn't quite have the power to clear Babar Azam at long-on. Massive breakthrough for Pakistan"
"slower ball and Kohli keeps the strike. He moves to 10,999 runs in ODI cricket"
"driven to extra cover, rare dot ball for Pakistan"
"and Hasan misses his line again. Down legside, and all the batsman has to do is tickle it to fine leg. Gets to 11,000 runs, and the quickest to do so by far. By 54 innings, to be precise"
"another ball that's tossed down legside. There was swing there, but down the wrong line, it's useless. Another easy flick to the fine leg boundary"

good delivery to Shankar first up. Pace and wide from Amir. Pakistan will try and keep him on strike
"slower ball, and Shankar dabs it to third man. Good result for India"
"doesn't quite time this, but gives him the opportunity to power through for another two. He has not once been denied by the Pakistan fielders once he's made his mind up."

"straight and quick, and driven to the fielder"
"worked away to the onside, and they come back for two"
"and he's gone, is he? Full and wide, and Shankar edges it to Sarfaraz. A big appeal, and the umpire rules it out. Reviewed immediately. The review shows a clear gap between bat and ball. Decision overturned"
"scooped up into the covers, and Shankar gets Kohli on strike for the final ball of the 47th"
"given a wide. Slower bouncer, and the umpire thinks it's above Kohli's head"
"so delicately done! Kohli uses the pace of the ball and guides it between the keeper and third man. Slower ball, but it still trickles all the way for four"
"slower ball, Shankar swings and hits fresh air. Pakistan need to keep him at this end"
"worked away to long-on. No thoughts of two, as Kohli wants to remain on strike"
"square cuts the slower ball, and it requires sharp work at deep extra to cut it off"
"gone, is he? <strong>Pakistan have Kohli!</strong> Quick bouncer, too quick for Kohli, who tried to swivel and pull it to fine leg. Gets the faintest of edges, and a prolonged appeal moves the umpire's finger"
"rolls his fingers over it, and Jadhav can only find point"
Sensational over from Amir. Four off the over and the wicket of Virat Kohli. Pakistan finishing with a bit of momentum

"no control from Shankar, scooped into the covers"
"another wide, Wahab is losing his discipline slightly. Nowhere near the stumps"
"Jadhav gets away the boundary, much needed for India! It was in the slot and he hit it through the line and just about clears mid-off"
"too quick for Jadhav, 89mph. Raps him on the gloves"
"short ball, in the air, kept deep square interested. The fielder plays it safe though and opts to field it on the bounce rather than go for the catch"
"low full toss, driven into the covers. Wahab's final over costs 12"
"<strong>dropped</strong>! Too difficult, in truth, and Amir got two hands to it, but didn't quite stick"
"slower ball. Amir gets the outside edge from Jadhav, but doesn't quite carry to Sarfaraz. Amir is running rings around India at the moment"
"in the block hole, excellent death bowling. Full, and driven to mid-off, and India scamper one"
and here's one for you Shankar haters! Lovely drive over extra cover. He read what Amir would do and leaned into that shot. Flew over extra cover and nearly carried all the way for six

"short of length on middle and leg, tucked away to fine leg and Pakistan are away"

this is <strong>magical from Bhuvneshwar!</strong> Absolute skill. Imam is squared up as he hops back to defend. Opened up by the pace and bounce

"huge appeal and he's struck first ball with a nip-backer! Vijay is delighted as are the rest of his mates. Imam is walking off. Massive break for India from an unlikely source. This is bowled full, swung back in a hint, but the doubt remains. Did it pitch outside leg? Could Pakistan have reviewed? Will need a replay to confirm everything, but what is confirmed is Pakistan have lost their first wicket."

slapped away but a misfield at covers keeps it down to a single. Lucky to get away with that <strong>filth of a delivery</strong>
"gets this to lift off the deck from a length, defended gently into the off side"
"superb stop by Kohli at extra cover. This was a half-volley which he absolutely belted, but the skipper threw himself to his left, full-length to stop it even as he was airborne"
"goes full outside off, Babar drives but gets a thick inside edge that rolls to mid-on"
driven firmly but straight to mid-off
"short of length delivery angled across, defended back"
"<strong>this is a beauty!</strong> Fakhar had no clue as he hung his bat out to defend. No feet movement, indecisive. Played from the crease"
defended from the crease
"looks to pull but he's beaten for pace. Excellent from Bumrah, attacked him on middle and leg"
"gloves this pull, rolls to square leg."
"short, down leg and he's helped this along to the fine leg boundary."
"angles in a length ball on off stump, defended back"
mistimes this attempted cut to cover
"scorching drive from Babar, can pay to watch strokes like that! Overpitched and he put it away without much fuss. Through extra cover"
"defended with soft hands, rolls behind the stumps"
"mistimes a drive to mid-on, got it off the inside edge. Quick single"
"hit on the pad, but this pitched outside leg. Looked to mow it across the line"

"mistimes this slog to mid-on, just about manages to complete the single"
"attacks the stumps with a full delivery from wide of the crease, defended"

slips this way down leg
driven on the up to mid-off for an easy single
"full, and Babar drives to deep cover, where India have unsurprisingly put a man now"
"no timing, thick inside edge to the onside"
"extra yard of pace, and Fakhar but about manages to get the middle of the bat on the pull shot"
"tight line, defended by Babar"
"short and wide. Babar cuts, but only to the deep fielder"
"exceptionally tight, Pakistan are being suffocated here. Asking rate continues to rocket"
"full, Babar tries to guide to third man but point cuts it off"
"wider half-volley, Babar strokes it elegantly, but only for one down to cover"
in the slot. Fakhar looks to tee off but sharp fielding at extra cover cuts off any avenue for runscoring
sliced to deep extra cover
"in the slot once more, but Babar doesn't quite get it wide enough of the deep cover man to get four. They come back for two"
"finds the boundary the other side of that fielder! Shorter and tighter to the body, but Babar caresses it past point, and no chance for the man in the deep. Much, much, much needed boundary for his team"
"starts off a little short, dive at short third saves any runs"
"no timing, trickles to the off side"
"better ball, Kuldeep can bowl a deviously probing line. Almost through Fakhar's defences"
"takes a thick outside edge, rolls through to the man at 45"
"cut away to the offside, first run of the over with a ball to go"
helped around to fine leg. Just two of Kuldeep's first over. Brings up Pakistan's 50
"straight, blocked"
"full, worked away to the onside"
"slower bouncer, and Fakhar had to adjust a bit there. Initially looked like he wanted to dispatch it to cow corner, but managed to guide it past fine leg, where it trickles through for four"
"struck to mid-off, and Babar has the strike now"
gets a thick outside edge and the ball runs down to third man. Some seam movement for Pandya in this over

driven down the ground
"stump-to-stump line, struck back to the bowler"
"full and slightly wide, and the batsman turns the strike over to deep cover"
tap and run. Good single from Babar. They'll need to be sharp with their running today
"an attempted heave from Fakhar, nearly dragged it on instead."
"this is more cultured from Fakhar. Steps away, makes some room and cuts past short third man, who has a chase on his hands. Prevents the boundary, but the over ends up going for six"
turned around to square leg
"that might have been trouble. Babar took on mid-on, who might have had the batsman struggling had he not misfielded"
"<strong>disdainfully dispatched by Fakhar!</strong> That's more like the player Pakistan need him to be. Premeditated, length picked up and a baseball swing to cow corner."
"comes around the wicket and targets the stumps. Ties him up nicely, and Fakhar can only block"
runs it to third man and races down to the boundary for four. Is this the over that Pakistan get a move on?
"hammered away by Fakhar again, but this time to the boundary fielder"

wider down the legside into Fakhar's pads
stroked to long-off. India are beginning to turn the screws again
"lovely bowling, was that pad first? Kohli really wanted to review, but Dhoni gives him short shrift. Was sure there was nothing in it, Dhoni"
"short ball, no timing on the pull. Just two off that over"
"flight and turn, Fakhar blocks"
"sharp turn, and has Fakhar's foot dragged out of his crease? <strong>Umpire goes upstairs</strong>. It's exceptionally tight, but looks like the batsman just about dragged his foot back in the nick of time. The third umpire goes with <strong>not out</strong>"
"Fakhar drives to long-off, and happily gets down the other end"
blocked. Pakistan are beginning to lose momentum now
"googly, Babar tries to turn it to fine leg"
"tucked away to the onside, just one from the over. For the next ten, enjoy Shashank's company"
"what a welcome! Into my comms stint, I mean. Sees this tossed up and he gets down on one knee and slog-sweeps with the spin to clear deep midwicket. Vijay and KL Rahul were in with a shout for a brief while."
"uppish but just short of Kohli. Chipped, didn't go through with it. The ball dipped on Fakhar as he played the stroke"

rocks back and cuts to point
"works this against the turn towards fine leg, the man had to come around a long way, by which time they hared back for the second"
swept with the spin to deep backward square leg
"biffed into the gap at deep midwicket. Picked this slog sweep towards the long boundary. Two bounces to the rope. This was full and flat, he picked it superbly. Pakistan are revving up slowly but surely. Will need Fakhar to convert this half-century into a century"
defended back to the bowler again
squeezes the drive past the diving Kohli at cover for a single
eased against the turn to long-off
"swept against the turn, picked it off a length. What clean connection. Magnificent from Babar. Decided to go through with the stroke and he's picked the bones out of that."
works this against the turn to long-on
"swept, but didn't get control, rolls off the inside edge to Rahul at deep square"
"gentle tap into the off side, they scamper through"
"makes room to cut, Chahal sees that and cramps him for room, defended"
swept all along the ground to fine leg
"drifts in and spins away off a length on middle, bunts it with soft hands to the off side"
"turns this googly to midwicket, got as close as possible to the pitch to negate the turn"
"nudges this to short fine, risky single taken as DK fires a throw from short fine."
cut away with the spin to sweeper cover
"<B> through the gate! </b> Incredible delivery from a supremely talented bowler. Everything about this delivery is the kind of stuff dreams are made of for a left-arm wristspinner. Nicely tossed up, the ball drifts away gently across Babar, pitches and then wickedly spins back in. Babar is looking to get outside the line to block, but is completely deceived by the dip, and then because he's played down the wrong line with a bit of gap between bat and pad, there's no second line of defence. Babar was worried about the wrong'un. Sneaks through the gap, clean bowled. Wow, what a ball. Magnificent."
defended into the off side with soft hands
"taps to point, wants a single but is sent back. The throw is wide at the striker's end and they get an over-throw. Vijay is livid with himself. Needed a better throw."
"sharp turn back in, gets a thickish inside edge to square leg"
works this with the spin to midwicket
wrong'un wich he picks and taps to the off side for a single
he's clobbered this sweep 15 rows back at deep midwicket. Not quite the length for the stroke but he took him on bravely and let his timing do the rest.
"sharp turn off a length, beaten on a forward push"
"he's top-edged this sweep to short fine. What a tame end to a promising innings. This was tossed up, he was sweeping against the turn, didn't get on top of the bounce and ended up giving a dolly to Chahal. Back-to-back wickets for Kuldeep. This is quickly slipping away from Pakistan."
"looking to sweep, then tries to squeeze a drive, in the end gets into a tangle, squirts this back into his pad"
toe-ends a sweep to Kohli at short midwicket
"wrong'un on a length, defended back"
"lunges forward and defends back, excellent stop off his own bowling."

hops back and defends to the man coming in from point
"slips this slower bouncer down leg, Hafeez wanted to pull but let it go in the end"
hops back and punches to point
"he's picked out the lone man at deep square. Oh, dear. What have you done, Hafeez? Elegantly flicked but timed it a bit too well. Pandya's turn to make a splash. How this game has turned."
"oh, it's a golden duck! The extra bounce from Hardik does the trick. Effort ball, got this to bounce off a length, just around off, Malik with a feeble push from the crease and ends up chopping on. Didn't ride the bounce, was perhaps surprised by it too. If that's the last we've seen of Malik in this World Cup, it'll be a bit sad. But he's now got two ducks in a row."
