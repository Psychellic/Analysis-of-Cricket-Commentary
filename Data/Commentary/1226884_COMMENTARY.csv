"144.7kmh, change of line now. It's around leg stump and Roy tucks it to midwicket"
"some bounce towards the hips, this one was outside leg, and he clips it towards square leg to get off the mark"
"<strong>through Livingstone</strong> as well on the first ball! This one kept low and went with the angle after pitching on middle, and sneaked through the gap between the bat and pad as the batsman looked to push it down the ground but was beaten. Might have taken an edge or the pad but it bounced before the keeper"
starts with a short ball and Roy pulls it for one
"this one even shorter, towards the ribs, and he tucks it a bit awkwardly to square leg"

"on the stumps, length ball, Munro defends it back"
"135.9kmh, with the angle around off, pushed away into the covers gently"

"short of length and into the batsman, tucked to deep square leg for one"
"too short, Munro doesn't have to move much and he stands tall to pull that for another six. Right into the stands"

"on the stumps again, flicked to deep square leg for one"

"really flat and quick down the leg side, it's a big wide if there's nothing on the way but both Philippe and O'Keefe have gone up for a big appeal for caught behind, and the umpire eventually gives it! Marsh is really unhappy, he wasn't even looking at the umpire for the decision, and then screams something in frustration, and even hits his pad with his bat in anger. Gives the umpire a long, hard stare while walking back"

"short of length outside off, he steers it to point"
"short and wide, he goes for the cut and misses"

"third short ball in a row and it's another six, <b>slapped over the covers</b>! Short and wide, Turner makes room yet again and smacks that from the meat again, dispatching it over the extra cover boundary. And it's a one-handed catch in the crowd"
"short of length but much tighter line, he taps it to leg for one"
"he keeps bowling them short, the third man is in and Inglis joins the fun this time with an upper cut over short third man. Four more!"
"<strong>dropped by Philippe</strong>! That leading edge went to the moon and came back, giving Philippe enough time to get under it with a few steps back, but he couldn't hold on to it. It wasn't a short ball for a change, Inglis flicked, and got an edge"

"shorter ball, pulled away to leg for one"
"tries the yorker, driven down to long on and they come back for the second"
"they want two again, has <b>Inglis made it this time</b>? He pulled the back of length slower ball to long leg, the fielder fired in a flat throw to Philippe, and oh my, this is really tight! One frame shows the bat is out just before the stumps are broken, and the next shows the bat is just inside when the stumps are well broken. We need a frame in between but looks like we don't have one, and the decision goes in favour of the batsman"
"wide yorker, Turner chases and misses"
"ohh, Turner walks away to the off side and exposes all his stumps, but this is gone down leg for a wide"
"fine leg in the circle, Turner wants to paddle it fine after moving across but misses it"

"finds long-on on his first ball. Jhye Richardson opens up on the back foot, pulls the short ball and doesn't get enough distance to be caught by Christian well inside the rope"
"Inglis is not interested in a single to take strike, he wants a six and gets it! Gets a slightly full delivery and he takes on long on as well, and clears him rather well to land this into the stands with a big swing"

"dropped at short fine leg by Richardson, that's gone through him! Vince pulled the short ball, Richardson was right at the edge of the circle and instead of standing still and grabbing it at head height, he falls on the ground, almost moving out of the ball's path. He might have lost the ball in the air"
"on middle and leg, and it's tucked to square leg for one"
tight outside off and he defends into the covers

"full on off, lovely flick with the wrists and it's racing away for four but Munro cuts it off at deep midwicket with a slide and a last-minute back of the hand fllick to keep the ball in. Saves one"

"<strong>that'll go down as a drop</strong> but it was a really tough running catch! Vince lofted that down the ground, it went high towards mid off and Tye ran back with his eyes on the ball and even got under it just in time but couldn't hold on"
"too short, he stands back and tall and pulls that away to the midwicket boundary. Makes it look so easy"
"bisects the gap again, this time on the other side of midwicket. The short ball came in, he went further on the back foot to pull that late and send it crashing between deep midwicket and fine leg"
