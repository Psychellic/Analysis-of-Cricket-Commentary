wide outside off with some length and Salt slices that over the gully region to get off the mark
strays down the leg side for a wide
"at 140.7kmh, but another one down the leg side for a wide"
"142kmh, gets the line better but it's too short, Weatherald hangs back and pulls that handsomely over the square leg region for a cracking four"
"back of length and angling in again, worked off the hips for one more"
"<strong>goes in the air</strong> off the top edge, but falls safe! Short and wide, Salt had to go at it and he went hard but didn't get the middle at all and the ball went high and fine on off to land wide of third man"
"another one in the air, this time Weatherald kind of scooped it intentionally in the air towards third man, it was short and wide again, and this one landed to the left of the running third man again"
"<b>smoked</b> for a boundary! He is bowling short again and again, and Salt didn't have to move much to absolutely hammer that to the midwicket boundary with a wonderful pull. Cracking sound off the bat!"
"pitched up a little but, bit slower at 133kmh and it's driven down to mid off with hard hands. Looked like a cutter"
"pulls the length back, just a hint of width on off and Weatherald cuts that so well with perfect timing to beat backward point with that back foot stroke"
"just a hint of width again, slices that straight to point this time"
"that's <strong>gone all the way</strong>! I'm losing count already of the number of pulls today. too short, Weatherald transfers his weight on the back foot and dispatches that nicely over the midwicket region with another handsome pull. Can't bowl short to him on either side"
pitches it up a bit this time and Weatherald goes back to drill that powerfully towards mid off
"a <b>leading edge</b> and this time caught at third man! On the pads, I think Bird rolled his fingers over that one and Weatherald flicked on leg but got the timing completely wrong and the top edge hung in the air for enough time for third man to get under it"
"good length outside off, he taps it behind square for one"
<strong>misfield at mid-on</strong> that's gone for four! Length delivery smashed down the ground and mid-on got there in time to tumble to his left but his two ends didn't grab the ball properly
"excellent effort from Silk at point! Salt cut off the back foot, Silk threw himself to his right and tried to grab that with his left, and got enough hand to deflect it to cover point for one"
"good length, hardly any width on off, he steers it towards point"
"back of length and towards the hips, no room and Carey defends it to leg"
"pitched up a little and Carey makes room for himself to caress that along the ground, piercing the gap between point and cover point to break the shackles"
"angling in towards the pads, goes off the pad behind square on leg for a leg bye"
"135.6kmh, on length outside off, he backs away a bit and slices it. Backward point is right there to cut it off"
"nice straight bat shot down the ground to mid-off, after that was pitched up around off"
a bit of length to work on and he leans forward to drive it to sweeper cover for one
"short ball, he hooks, but fine leg is in, and even though he didn't middle it, it went just over the fielder for a lucky four for Salt"
"back of length again, he swats it just behind square on leg and calls for two immediately. A fumble in the deep helps the batsmen"
"starts well around length on off, Carey defends it back"
"cramps him for room around leg stump now, worked towards midwicket"
"106.6kmh, slower offcutter, it's short too and Carey has enough time to make room and cut it on the off side by beating point for four"
"a wide yorker outside off now, Carey jams his bat and finds mid off"
"another short ball in the powerplay, and another smashing six from the Strikers! Carey pivoted on the back foot and hammered that over the midwicket boundary nicely. Lands in the crowd, did someone catch that?"
"much better short ball this time, rising towards the shoulders and he taps it close to himself"
"makes room, this one's slower and he's cramped for room but still manages to cut it on off"
"attempted yorker angling in, Carey flicks and finds mid on"
"123.4kmh, taps the slower ball towards point and wants one but doesn't get it"
"136kmh, pitches up this time and nicely driven to deep cover for one"
on length outside off and it's swatted down to long on for one
"angling into Carey from length, worked down towards long on for one"
"nicely flighted on the pads, worked away off the legs for one"
"pitched up, it's too full and Salt slog-sweeps that against the turn, using the length and gets six over square leg!"
goes back to let it turn and whacks it to long on
wrong'un turns away from Carey and he's beaten on the back foot
<strong>just over square leg</strong> this time as Carey sweeps that with the turn in the air off the pads and gets two
goes back this time to let the ball turn in towards the stumps and punches it through off to keep strike
"<strong>just short of point</strong>! A bit short outside off, Carey made room and sliced it and it fell just short of Silk there"
"back of length around leg now, he stays back and swats it to mid on this time"
"almost in the block hole around off, he finds cover this time"
"137kmh, wider outside off, bit full and he chases this one to get a single towards deep point"
"no room at all, nice and tight on leg and worked down to mid on for one"
<strong>loud lbw appeal</strong> from the bowler as it's right in the block hole and might have hit Salt in front of leg but looks like it was going down leg
"tossed up around leg stump, driven down to long off"
<b>holes out</b> to deep midwicket and Salt is gone! Pope has delivered some better balls this season. This was a half-tracker and Salt rocked back to pull it for six but found Vince in the deep who did well to not go over the rope in the end
chases that from well outside off to sweep it to leg
"short ball and turning away, enough room for Wells to go back and chop that wide of backward point to get off the mark in style"
"marginally better length outside off, steered into the covers for one"
"bit flatter towards leg from middle, worked off the pads for one more"
"<strong>leg stump goes for a walk</strong>! Alex Carey has not looked great today, no doubt about that, and he made room yet again to smash that away but Hazlewood was accurate there to pitch it on length and hit top of leg"
"right on target again, on off stump from length and White respects it with a solid defence"
"pulls the length shorter a bit, and he punches it through cover point. Off the mark"
a bit overpitched and driven away for one through the covers
"absolutely accurate again, on off and middle, and White gets the outer half of the bat on the off side"
"on middle and leg, flicked away this time for one"
"outside off, hint of width, and steered towards cover"
"that looked a bit quicker, hits him on the pads and goes behind square for a single for a leg bye"
"he goes on the toes for that shorter delivery angling in and tucks it behind square to quickly come back for the second. Had to put in a dive at the end, and got there comfortably"
"back of length again, now outside off, and steered to point"
gives the charge and works the ball to sweeper cover now
"right on the stumps this time, no room and he blocks it back"
starts with a short ball and it's pulled away in the deep for one
"pretty tight line and length, on the stumps, and he defends off the back foot"
makes a hint of room and punches that from outside off towards the covers for one
"<strong>dropped</strong> technically, but that was a tough one! Wells absolutely middled that short ball with a pull and the fielder at midwicket got a hand to it with a leap but couldn't hold on. Hughes was the fielder, it seems"
"that's a stop gone completely wrong! White went a long way to off to scoop that length delivery fine on leg, but he only got an edge, lost balance and might have hit his groin off the edge while falling over. Bird has a big smile"
"tight stuff on the stumps, he works it to leg"
"good bounce outside off without much room, Wells hops and defends"
"a rare poor delivery from him today, strays down leg and that's deflected off the thigh pad, fine down leg for a four to just beat fine leg"
"nice and tight on off again, he gets bat on it but can't get it away"
"hint of room now outside off, nicely driven through the covers for one"
goes across on off to whip that on leg but that length delivery beats him completely
"almost in the block hole outside off, driven away through square for one"
"slow through the air towards middle and leg, White dabs it back"
dances down to go over the covers but doesn't middle it at all
"comes down again, he middle it this time and it's gone for a big, big six over the cow corner. White took it on the full and swung hard for that one"
"jumps out of the crease again, taken on the full again and this time he's gone all the way over the long off boundary for <strong>another six</strong>!"
"tries the reverse paddle now, doesn't get bat on it"
"<strong>finds long-off</strong> this time, White holes out in the hunt of the third six! A very scratchy innings comes to an end. White had to go big this over after the time out, he did get two sixes and on the third attempt he couldn't get the distance like earlier. Edwards stayed steady at long off to pouch that with the reverse cup"
"has a misfield resulted in a run out there?! Wells flicked the fullish delivery to the square leg region, two fielders ran in and Short slipped just after turning, saying no for the second, but then the batsmen see a misfield in the deep and they do decide to go for the second, but a turn of decision again and Short has to come back! Puts in a dive and it isn't enough. Replays checking if the ball came out of the keeper's gloves before the stumps were broken, it's very very tight. Maybe the ball was marginally out of the gloves when the zing bails lit up with the impact of the gloves"
"length delivery on the stumps, worked down to mid on for one"
"tad shorter, flicked straight to midwicket this time"
"flicks uppishly, shouts of 'catch it' as he goes just over midwicket"
another misfield from the Sixers and another four! Wells gave the charge and cut that away to backward point where Hughes couldn't stop that and Bird isn't happy
goes for the cut again and this time Hughes stops it
"<strong>pulls the short ball</strong>, has he just managed to beat the fielder in the deep? Yes, he has! Vince sprints to his right, goes for the dive but the ball beats him"
tries to flick and only gets an edge onto his pad
lets the ball turn away and punches it to deep cover
"pithes it up now, driven straight to cover"
"stays a bit low as Neser wants to punch it away but gets an edge onto his pad, they sneak in a quick single"
"a bit of fumble from Curran at deep midwicket after Wells swept that against the turn, they get two"
"middles another pull, this time straight to Curran and Wells will be happy to keep strike"
looks like a cutter outside off and Wells does very well to guide that wide of short third man for a well-placed four
"low full toss outside off, tapped towards cover for one"
"goes for the slow yorker now, Neser opens up and whips it to deep midwicket"
taps the slower ball towards long on with soft hands and calls for two straight away but there's time for only one
"it's a nice full toss for the batsman, attempted yorker gone wrong, and Neser smashes that over the circle and behind square. Third man is in and it's an easy four"
"short third man has some work to do for that <strong>leading edge</strong>! Neser whipped that to leg and got a top edge, Pope ran back from the circle and the ball was in the air for some time but Pope couldn't even get close to the ball, the ball going right through his hands"
"a bit slow around off, lobbed towards long off for one. Wells on strike"
"<strong>superb timing and placement</strong>! Gets only some room, he stays so still and uses his wrists very well to cut that nicely through square to get four more"
the wide yorker now and he jams his bat down for one
"Neser gets into the act by going back and across, opens his stance and whips that fullish delivery right between deep square leg and deep midwicket for four more"
a helicopterish whip now off the pads and he gets one towards wide long on
excellent reply by Curran. Wells went a long way to off to scoop that fine and Curran chased him with a slower ball which beat the batsman. Might have gone beyond the wide line but Wells had moved across too
"deep and across in the crease, gets the attempted yorker and flicks that away to wide long on for four useful runs"
"deep again in the crease, the bowler brings it shorter and Neser misses"
"deep in the crease again, gets the middle of the bat, nothing else, and he <strong>smokes </strong> that nicely over midwicket for a cracking six!"
"targets the leg side again, and this time Vince takes a sharp catch at deep backward square leg! A nice cameo comes to an end. Flicked the full delivery to the leg side again, this one went behind square and Vince took a few quick steps to his right and got both hands to it"
"139kmh, well outside off, driven square of the wicket for one"
"Rashid gets into the action straightaway! Goes deep in the crease and gets a short of length ball outside off, gets it flying on off and it <strong>lands just short of the fielder</strong> running in from deep point"
"slower one at 115.4kmh outside off, Rashid swings and misses"
attempted yorker but Rashid is ready for it deep and across in the crease. Swings at that with hard hands and gets a really thick edge for a four over short third man
"<strong>hardly a swing</strong> of the bat but he gets six! He was waiting well inside the crease, got a low full toss on the stumps and merely flicked it with perfect timing to send that sailing over square leg"
"<b>dropped</b> again by the Sixers! Slower ball pulled to deep square, Dwarshuis ran in, got both hands to it but spills it"
"and <b>dropped</b> again by Dwarshuis! Oh my goodness! This was a tougher chance as Rashid pulled again, the fielder ran in for another attempt but this one wasn't going to carry to him so he slid forward and got his hands just under the ball but could not hold on"
"full delivery and he flicks it towards wide long on, Rashid was ready to come back for the second"
around off and worked down to long on for one
just outside off and helped to point
flatter on leg stump and steered towards deep midwicket for one more

this one goes away with the angle and beats the outside edge
"length delivery to start with, worked down to long on for one"

"nice and tight around off, he defends it back"
"138kmh, quick and tight on middle stump, punches it down to mid off"
"nips it in towards middle from off, a little dab towards mid on for a quick single"
"on length, maybe a tad full, and Avendano pulls out a graceful loft down the ground with a nice swing and starts with a four against Stanlake"
"not much room for the length delivery on leg, he defends it down the ground"
"a tad outside off, steered to cover and he says 'no' again"
"nice straight drive again, this time a quick single towards mid on"
"141.1kmh, goes back on his toes and defends the ball to leg"
"wide this time outside off, thick edge runs down to third man"
"angling into the pads, worked away for one"

"short ball, doesn't quite middle the pull but gets one"
"shortish again, Philippe pulls and gets one to square leg"
"bangs in the a bouncer at 129.5km, called a wide as it's left alone"
"great bounce, almost like Stanlake, for Conway from back of length. Avendano wants to punch it on off but is beaten by the bounce"

good yorker on leg stump and there's an <strong>lbw appeal</strong> but there was an inside edge there
"nice length on off stump, dabbed down to mid on for one more"
"<strong>one bounce four</strong> on the leg side, Avendano looking in good form! Short ball, he's on top of it and pulls that away in style for a cracking shot to get his fourth four of the evening"
adjusts his length and the batsman taps the ball to mid on
"on length outside off, steered away straight to point"
"tad fuller on off, driven to the left of mid-off and they scamper across for a quick one"
starts with a googly and a mild lbw appeal that's turned down as he took the ball on the pad on the back foot. Was going down leg
""
"goes a long way across to off, Rashid pitches it around leg and he's swept it dangerously, fine on leg for four"
"tries a slog sweep this time, against the turn, but the length wasn't there to be swept and he gets an inside edge onto his pad"
"delivers this from close to the stumps, and Philippe has absolutely <strong>hammered</strong> that from the middle, lofting that over the cow corner for a pretty clean six!"
"shorter on off, the googly turns in and Philippe tucks it to leg for one"
flicks this 143kmh delivery on the pads past midwicket for two
"short of length outside off, punched down to mid off"
"top edge off a pull and <strong>lands absolutely safe</strong>, right in the middle of two fielders! Philippe pulled, got a leading edge before midwicket ran back, deep midwicket ran in and the ball landed right between them"
swats this fuller delivery towards wide long on for two
"another short ball, another pull, and another six of the evening! Avendano is not leaving anyone tonight, he is taking on Stanlake fearlessly"
"full delivery follows the short ball, pushed down to mid off for one"
"Avendano, my goodness! He's not holding back. Goes deep in the crease, sees Siddle's first ball on just short of length and smacks that away on the leg side for his second six"

"many a catches put down today off leading edges, but the keeper Alex Carey gets under this one to break the opening stand. Avendano has missed a fifty but he's done his job here. Went across to off and tried a rare shot across the line, got a leading edge and the keeper ran towards backward point to pouch it"
punches the shortish ball off the back foot for one
"a loud appeal for caught behind from Conway and the keeper, but no edge there, it seems. Hughes didn't move his feet and drove away from the body. Lucky for him there was no edge"
"much better, drives off the middle to deep cover and off the mark"
"low and dipping full toss on the stumps, Philippe stoops a bit to push it to long on"
"<strong>edged to the keeper</strong>, it seemed for a second but the sounds was of bat hitting the ground outside off for the full delivery"

"129.9kmh, slower one beats the drive and that's lobbed up over mid off who has to run back"

goes back and helps the googly to leg for his <b>fifty</b>
excellent running there as Hughes chips the ball in the air towards long on. It didn't have much pace and they ran back for the second
<strong>sweeps and finds deep midwicket</strong>! Rashid has got the breakthrough here. Hughes saw the delivery outside off and went for a flat sweep but it wasn't big enough to clear the fielder who was a few yards inside the boundary
"102.7kmh, hurried for pace towards the pads. He taps the ball back"
"104.5kmh this time, even quicker and Vince manages to block it back just in time"

"shuffles across, it's almost a yorker and he gets the bottom of the bat behind square on the leg side for two"
"<b>excellent catch at sweeper cover from Rashid</b>, he completes it and signals out! High full toss on off, flat-batted by Vince on the off side and Rashid tumbled forward for what's a clean catch, replays confirm. Hang on, the umpires are checking for a no ball, and Siddle has juuust something behind the crease for a legal delivery. The umpire also checking the catch, it looks clean, and now checking the height of the full toss, that's well below the waist"
"low full toss on off, pushed down to long on for one"
"makes room, gets a full delivery expecting a yorker and he drills that wide of mid on for four. Excellent start for him"
"and another four, on the other side this time! Shuffles to leg, the ball chases him as it's a low full toss and he swats it wide of fine leg for a one-bounce four"
"<b>that's some fine hitting from Philippe</b>! Short ball, he stays still and gets on top of the ball to hammer that away over the midwicket fence for a clean, clean six. That's the match, I think"

"a yorker, inside edge to leg for a single"
"wide yorker at 129kmh, Curran chases and misses"
"<strong>sealed with six</strong>, have you heard that before? Curran finishes it off by swinging the full toss down the ground, brings out a big smile and gets a hug from Philippe"
