bouncer first ball. Dug in short at a leg stump line and has Lewis avoiding this hurriedly
"short and wide this time, and it's all hands from Lewis. Lifts his front leg slightly as he reaches out and cuts this over point"
"good length, leg stump, punched from the crease to mid-on"
"draws the outside edge, but it's gone through where fourth slip would have been. No feet again as he tries to drive on the up to a length ball at off stump, Jadhav cleans up at third man"
"full at leg stump, pushed to mid-on on the up"
"nice line. Just wide of the corridor at a good length, left alone"
and he starts with a wide down leg side today as well. This one went with the angle
"good length outside off stump, nips back in after pitching but the off stump is well covered as he lets it go. The ball lands in front of Dhoni who stops with his pads"
beats the outside edge. Gets this to straighten from back of a length and has him poke outside off stump
"back of a length, angling in from outside off, left alone"
"goes for the full one, but it's misfired. Exercise for Dhoni down the leg side"
"floats this outside off stump, bends it in from the wide marker, but it's still too wide for Lewis to hit"
"better line, much better. Curves it in towards the corridor this time, hits a good length. Lewis wary of the one that straightens is fending anxiously with a big gap. Inside edge onto pad"
shot. Takes a step down the pitch and drives this firmly from outside off stump. Can't meat mid-off to his right
"good length at off stump, solidly defended with a full face"
"nice and juicy, short and wide, but he can't time the cut. Chops it into the turf, It dribbles to Jadeja at backward point"
"back of a length outside off, slight movement in off the pitch. He pushes at it in front of his body and gets an inside edge onto his mid-riff"
"back of a length in the corridor, shuffles across, closes the face too late on the attempted glance. Square leg speeds in to field it"
"back of a length in the corridor, punched on the up, but not enough timing to get it past extra cover"

"back of a length and wide outside off, leans back as he looks to cut this, under-edged into the off side"
"good length, swinging in from outside off. Not as much as Lewis expects though. He prods inside the line and is well beaten on the outside edge"
"133kph, full and wide outside off stump. Asks him to chase and he does, but he's beaten once again. Wouldn't want to get in a street fight today..."
"short ball at the rib cage, defended comfortably"
"bangs it in behind a length, up in the corridor, bunted into the off side on the up"

"good length outside off stump, defended off the back foot"
"back of a length, angled into the corridor, shuffles to tuck it to square leg"
"off the mark, finally. Shami misses his length slightly, and this is short enough for the pull, even with the persistent off stump line. Swung away behind square"
"short and wide outside off, skids low and takes the inside edge as he goes for the cut. Dhoni gets low very quickly, to his left, stops the boundary"
"good length ball at off stump, poked to mid-off...where Kedar Jadhav runs in and puts in a throw that defies cricketing angles. Mid-on is running in the opposite direction and can't back up with the dive backwards and midwicket is too far away to cut this off"
"back of a length at middle stump, defended off the back foot"
"swing away from the corridor, good length, left alone"

"back of a length outside off. Some width there, but the ball climbs above the outside edge as he cuts"
"back of a length, corridor, defended into the off side. Wants a quick single, but short point is lurking"

"back of a length, angled in at off stump, pushed to mid-off on the up"
"short and down the leg side, Lewis tears up at this generous offering. Perhaps why he can't connect on the expansive pull"
"<b>connects this time!</b> And it's sailed over the square leg boundary. Short and into the hips again, he swivels, gets under it and doesn't even look in the direction of the ball after he has dismissed it"

"good length, angled in, defended back down the pitch after a quick shuffle towards the off side"
"back of a length in the corridor, squeezed out to cover point"

"back of a length outside off, slashes at this on the up, beaten by slight movement away off the pitch"

"back of a length, corridor, shovelled wide of mid-on off the back foot"

"back of a length, angled into the hips, whipped to deep square"
"offcutter, floated full at leg stump, flicked off the toes to deep square...and then he wants to hare back for the second. Hope is as stationary as the stumps at his end. Lewis has to hurry but there's no danger in the end"

"offcutter again, good length, off stump, forward defence back to the bowler"

"full at leg stump, driven to long-on"
"back of a length at leg stump, can't get this glance away, thigh guard comes into use"

"offcutter, good length, off stump, whipped. Straight to midwicket"

"good length at off stump, clears the front leg and clubs across the line...just gets it past Umesh Yadav at mid-on who considered a dive for a fleeting moment. It was travelling too quickly"
"holes out to sweeper cover. Pandya gets Kohli wickets. This is good length, outside off stump. Hope was visibly antsy, trying to open up and get quick runs.

"shorter now, outside off, slapped to deep point"
"stock ball turning down the leg side, worked down to long leg"
"tossed up, drifts in late towards off stump, driven to short extra-cover. Good stride forward this time"
"beautifully bowled. Down the track and the drift does Lewis in. He wants to drive this straighter, over mid-on, but it drifts into him, forces him to hit it squarer, and midwicket takes a good catch diving forward. The ball got too close to Lewis to let him free his arms fully"
"lovely. First ball drifts out towards off stump, turns back in. Good forward stride, defends back down the pitch. He'll be a lot more wary of playing across the line given the way he got out in the last match"

"overpitched now, drifts ouside leg. Hope whips it away easily over midwicket"
"better length now, on leg stump, comes forward and shows the full face to push to long-on"

"fuller, similar line, defended into the covers"
"a touch short on off stump, punched to the right of sweeper cover"

"flat, a little round-arm on off stump, goes back and chops to backward point"

"floated up on leg stump, swept to deep backward square leg"
"back of a length, pitches on off and doesn't turn in as Chase expects. Shapes to work it leg side, adjusts and defends into the covers"

"interesting shot. Length ball on leg stump, goes deep in his crease and into a bit of a crouch to pull it to deep midwicket"

"tossed up higher, driven to mid-off"
"again, on the back foot to a length ball. Quicker too, hurriedly jams his bat down to defend his off stump"

"short, a bit of width, slapped to deep point"
"back of a length outside off, steps back and across and works it to midwicket"

"another bouncer, this one gets up to just around neck high, over middle stump. Keeps his eye on it and ducks"
"full and wide, doesn't really get his front leg across - he starts from a pretty open stance too - so he has to reach out to drive this. Slices it towards third man"
"back of a length on off stump, nicely played. Let that come on and dabbed with soft hands to the right of Jadeja at backward point"
"tossed up wide of off, dips a little on Chase. His attempted flat-bat drive through cover ends up rolling gently to mid-off"
"whoa, that's a replay of his third-ODI dismissal! Googly, tossed up beautifully outside leg. Chase gets his feet out of the way to try and whip into the leg side, misses completely since he was playing for the stock ball, and the ball turns past his outside edge and clips the top of middle stump.

"tossed up outside off, defended to short extra-cover"

"Ouch. Bouncer just outside off. Hope steps back and across and looks to pull, but the ball stopped on the pitch a little - Pandya rolled his fingers over at release - and he's through his shot too early. Ball smacks into the grille of his helmet. He calls for a replacement"
bangs it in again. This time it's angling in and Hope ducks under it. Bounces well over head height
"full, wide of off. Gets a good stride forward for a checked drive to the sweeper"
"length ball on off stump, gets forward for a push through cover point"
"cross-seam ball, back of a length outside off. Hope looks to open his bat face and steer it down to third man, but the ball straightens just a touch, with just a hint of extra bounce, and Dhoni falls to his right to pouch the nick"
"good length, slight tail back in towards off stump and he finds the inside edge before he finds the pad"
"bouncer, bit too short, comfortably ducked"
"another inside edge. Shami was hitting the corridor in his first spell, now he's looking for some reverse. This moves in slightly off the pitch from a length. He's playing in front of his body and hits another one onto pad"

"good length, angled into the pads, clipped to deep square leg's left"
"back of a length at middle stump, dropped behind square on the leg side off the back foot"

"full and fast, middle stump, but strategically pushed with enough mistiming to steal a single from mid-on"

"slower ball, short and wide outside off stump. Slashes at it, gets a thick outside edge. It lands well in front of Karthik at third man...he watches it into his hands"
"short and wide outside off stump, slapped on the up in front of square. Kuldeep does well at sweeper cover to run to his right. Has it covered for a long time but puts in the dive a bit too late. In the end, it's a lot of pushing and dodging and acrobatics as he tumbles at the ropes. A matter of frames...and it's in his favour"
"full delivery aimed for leg stump, toe-ended drive to mid-on"
"low full toss, bit of inswing, but it's on the pads. He flicks...and gets it past midwicket, but only after he gets a hand on it"
"<b>caught down the leg side</b> and it's given. A back of a length ball, angled down leg side. Not a particularly fast ball either. Just an unlucky dismissal as he tries to tickle this fine"
"good length, wide outside off stump. Doesn't chase it"
"length ball in the corridor, dabbed down to third man"
"back of a length, off stump, drops it towards backward point...and his partner has the cheek to consider a run. Back you go, says Jadeja, with a bullet throw"

"short and wide outside off stump, emphatically cut to sweeper for one"
"back of a length at off stump, spins in and bounces, pushed to midwicket"
"a stunning delivery that slips through the gate from a good length. Dhoni appeals and caught behind is given. Powell has reviewed it. Snicko shows there's no edge...but his leg is in front of middle stump as the ball brushes it. He could be out lbw here...oh, nope. That's spinning over and past leg stump. The review works out in the end. A nice loopy delivery from Kudleep, not picked at all as he nearly fell over trying to drive into the off side"
"wrong'un, tossed right up at off stump, driven to mid-off"
"<b>nearly defends back onto his stumps.</b> Playing him off the pitch without a clue right now, and it's forcing him to play late. This time, he goes back to the length ball and nearly plays on"

"full and tailing into the pads, clipped out to deep square leg"
"back of a length in the corridor, shapes to pull, adjusts to bunt it behind point"
"<b>good catch.</b> Only Jadeja can make running backwards look so simple. This is back of a length and climbing in he corridor. He swipes across the line to try and pick the midwicket boundary but it's a leading edge that lobs up and swerves awkwardly as cover, backward point and sweeper cover all show interest. Jadeja's call is the loudest and they let him be. Adjusts his steps to perfection, shimmies slightly to his left after running back and holds on"
"short ball at the ribs, leaps off the ground and gloves this to Dhoni's left"
"good length at off stump, forward defence to extra cover"
"a straightforward one at backward point this time. Short and wide, and honestly, an average delivery. In the slot for the cut, but the mind doesn't always back you up at this level. Tentative in his approach and he hits it straight to Jadeja"
"angled across off stump, back of a length, left alone"
"good length, angled in at off stump from around the wicket, no-feet defence"
"full at off stump, pushed into the off side. Jadeja swoops, Jadeja throws, and misses at the non-strikers"

"full and swinging away towards off stump, poked into the covers"
"back of a length at off stump, backs away to find a single through third man, hits it straight to backward point"

"length at middle stump, flicks against the turn for a lob towards long-on"
"back of a length outside off stump, defended into the off side off the back foot"
"good shot, but only one. Anticipates the full one on the stump, backs away and drives with the full face. Mid-off dives to his left to stop it"
"slower bouncer, picked well, but there's no pace for that hook to go the distance. Lands well in front of deep square leg"
"ding ding ding. Bishoo has invented a new shot. Backs away, and looks to reverse-hook this bouncer. But as with most batting inventions from lower order batsmen, this yields nothing"
high elbow this time. Drives this overpitched ball to long-off
rolls his fingers on another bouncer. It squeezes through from under this attempted pull
"inswinging yorker at off stump, dug out and back to the bowler. Can't do much else"
"short ball in the mid-riff, gets the front leg out of the way and pulls to deep square"
"<b>top edge, helmet grille, diving fast bowler</b> and Nurse is done. Length ball hurries him as he stays put in the crease and looks to whip across the line. Hits the back of the bat, smashes the grille and lobs up to Umesh's right. He dives across the pitch and gets his third"

"bouncer. No clue. Looks to hook, is very late on it, but the top edge falls well in front of Dhoni"
"good length outside off stump, driven on the up to extra cover"

"back of a length at middle stump. Backs away and gets it in the slot for the slog, but it's an inside edge onto boot"

"for the second match in a row, Holder has dismissed Kohli after troubling him with the short ball. Good bouncer, just outside off, similar to the one that he missed a few balls ago. This time he gets a top-edge that goes straight up, three storeys up, and Shai Hope takes a few steps forward and wraps his gloves around it"

"<b>dropped!</b> West Indies really need to hold these. Length ball angling into the pads, and Rahane flicks uppishly, straight to square leg at shoulder height, and the ball slips out of his grasp before he can wrap his fingers around it. You'd call that a dolly. Jason Mohammed is the fielder"

"slower ball outside off, Kuldeep plays and misses, looking to guide it to third man"
"dipping slower ball, full outside off. Looking to drive to long-off, Dhoni drags it back to the bowler"
"full outside off, driven to extra-cover, who's on the edge of the circle"
"nicely bowled. Mid-off was in the circle, and Kuldeep may have been eyeing that area while he made himself room. Follows him with a slower ball, and all he can do is jab into the point region"
"quick length ball now, fairly wide of off. Looks to slap it through point, can't connect. Again he tried to make room, and moved too early. Gave it away to the bowler"
"this time he moves the other way, across towards off stump. Bowls a full slower ball and he gives it a big slog. Only manages a top-edge that bounces down towards third man"
"full outside off, too full for Dhoni to get the elevation he wants, and he's hit it straight to long-on. Cleared his front leg, swung hard, and hit it flat and too close to Joseph, who moved a couple of steps to his right to take a waist-high catch"
bowled him! Off-stump yorker and Umesh slogs all around it. They check for no-ball but Holder's foot is totally fine. This is his fourth wicket. 4 for 25 in 9.1 overs.
"too full to get any elevation. Full and straight, he clears his front leg and swipes, all along the ground, to long-on"
"in the blockhole again, on the stumps. Clears his front leg and slogs and only manages a bottom-edge towards short fine leg"
"five-for! Holder's won it for West Indies! A full-toss on off stump, not the greatest ball he's bowled, but why would he care? Makes himself room, Shami, looks to hit over extra-cover, but can't clear the fielder. Side-on replays show it's just below waist-high, and that's when he's taken a stride forward"
