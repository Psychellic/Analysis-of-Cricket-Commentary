Replays show it pitched in line, just inside leg stump, and didn't turn much - was straightening towards the stumps in my opinion. I have a feeling ball-tracking will back me up, and reveal that Dhawan has escaped here. Actually, a good decision from Sri Lanka. <b>Snicko shows a bottom-edge on that></b>."

Down the track to the leg-stump ball, gets too close to the pitch of the ball for the big hit, and he ends up dragging it off the inside half of the bat to the right of midwicket, where Thirimanne takes a good, low catch. A bit of turn there for Pathirana despite there not being too much distance between where it pitched and where it met Dhawan's bat.

length ball angling into off stump from wide of the crease. Blocked back to the bowler
"beauty. Goes wide of the crease again, angles one into off stump, pitching a couple of inches shorter than the previous ball, and gets it to straighten past the outside edge of Rohit's defensive bat. Opens him up too. The slight change of length pinned Rohit to the crease"
"and then he follows up with a long-hop. Angled into the body, and he just plants himself half-forward, like he does, and swivels to swat it away to the right of the square-leg umpire"
"short again, this time cramps Rohit slightly with a bit more bounce, and he can't pull with as much power. Long leg sprints to his left, dives, picks up the ball, and flicks it to the fielder approaching from deep square leg. Sadeera to Gunaratne, excellent fielding"

"flat length ball on middle and off, goes back and across to work it through square leg"

"back of a length on off stump, punched to long-off"

"ooh, shot. That's in the blockhole on off stump, and he moves away to make room, and stabs it to backward point. Wait a minute - Sri Lanka are appealing for a catch. Looked like a bump ball at first. The umpires are referring it - soft signal is not-out. Not even a proper bump ball - that bounced a couple of feet from the bat"
"bouncer over off stump. Gets down low - probably looking to sway, initially, but then decides he has a bit more time than he initially thought, and goes for a ramp over the keeper. Can't quite connect"

"<b>Outrageous stroke from Rohit</b>. He stays leg side of this full ball outside off and drives it delightfully over backward point, as only he can. The ball flies over the boundary. He made it look ridiculously easy"
"back-of-the-hand slower ball on middle, hit wide of midwicket for just one"
"Thisara returns and breaks the rampaging stand. Slower legcutter, 101.6ks, short on the off stump, Iyer can't manufacture enough pace. He swings it straight down the throat of deep midwicket. Iyer gets a pat on the head from his captain and applause from his coach"

"Whoa <b>Rohit brings up his third double-hundred in ODIs</b>! Take a bow, Rohit. Another outrageous innings. Back of a length on middle, Rohit jabs it away through midwicket. He celebrates the landmark with a Warner-esque leap (sort of). He then has his hands aloft and soaks in the applause. #Scenes in Mohali"

"length ball fairly close to off stump. Lacks the width for the full-blooded on-the-up slap, so he chops it into the point region"

"this time a bit more width, and he middles that no-feet punch. Straight to mid-off, though"

Slowly enough for them to chance a second run, and India appeal for a run-out... It goes up to the third umpire, but Mathews has just made it before the direct hit. Dhoni, typically, let that go with his back to the stumps, after feigning to collect it. How does he know, <i>always</i>, where the ball will go?"

"slower ball on off stump, walks across and clips to deep square leg"
"bouncer over off stump, and that's another boundary. Doesn't really control the pull - it was a sharp bouncer that climbed to over his right shoulder - and it hangs briefly in the air.

"fired in flat down leg, and has Mathews dragged his foot out of the crease? Stretched out to work it into the leg side, playing for turn, but it just slid on with the angle. Dhoni had the bails off in a flash, as always, but not his most confident appeal. Is his toe on the line, or is there some part of his sole behind the line? It looks prettttty close to me... There seems to be a decent amount of shoe behind the line, juust about grounded."

"down the track now, and <b>Dhawan drops it</b> at deep midwicket. Flat, but he gets close enough to the pitch of the ball, but maybe drags it squarer than he wants. Dhawan dives forward for the low chance, gets both hands to it, but can't hold on."
