"a sliver of away swing for Zaheer and I thought Gayle defended inside the line. Could have had pulled his bat away, having originally intended to play? Nah, I'll go with the batsman being beaten. Lovely fuller length on off stump too"
"that time he did leave. The speedgun says it was 136 kph, seems a long time since Zak's nudged towards that range. This was back of a length and far enough outside off to forget about it"
"duck it is! Superb effort from Duminy at first slip, diving to his left and cushioning the ball with both hands. Teasing outswinger from Zak again, bringing Gayle forward. He doesn't quite move his feet a lot, you know. Pushed at the ball with an open face, gets a healthy nick and that cordon was well packed for it"
"was he trying to drag this one back in? It was a back of a length delivery at 139 kph! AB was shaping for a cut, but has to adjust when he doesn't have to room for it."
"he is definitely looking for the inswinger to the right-hander, but Zak's thrown this too far wide of off stump. Lashed over point"
"big gap at cover, with short cover pulled close to the batsman. AB recognises that and makes Daredevils pay. Good length ball drilled through that yawning expanse of the outfield"
"and when the ball is so wide, not ot mention overpitched, Kohli can conserve his energy. It was 140-plus kph and the batsman used all that pace as he sliced it over point"
"141 kph, shortish and rising towards Kohli's chest, blunted with a straight bat"
"some shape into the right-hander, but Morris fails to pitch it. Kohli seems to be generous. Blocks it back to the bowler"
"was that a thick outside edge? Kohli was stepping forward to delivery one of his crisp cover drives, but the fuller ball at 149 kph pings away to third man"
"148 kph, extra bounce! Aided by the fact that the shortish delivery was not anywhere wide enough for a cut shot. AB tries it anyway and is beaten"
"blocks towards mid-on and sets off, but for once Kohli is not interested in taking the fielder's arm on."
seemed like an offcutter - and it did deviate off the pitch - Kohli reaches out and guides it behind point
"seeks the yorker on middle, and that speedgun says he's at 140 kph. AB had to rush in getting his feet out of the way and push it to mid-on. Late movement back into the right-hander"
"back of a length and outside off, eased to the sweeper on the off side boundary"
it seemed like he had gotten into the pull a little too early. Picked up the short ball and loaded up with the shot on instict. Had to temper it a tad and finds a single to deep midwicket
"that's excellent timing. It was shortish and at Kohli's body, he clips it away ever so late to try and beat deep square leg on his right. Doesn't quite do so"
weaves away from the line of a shortish delivery and rides it through to deep point
"lbw appeal straight away! Shami still has the zip he gets off the track and its enough to beat AB. Pitches just back of a length on off stump and darts into the pads of the batsman. Plays a flick, can't connect. Too high"
"that's dreadful. Bowls a delicious short ball way down leg and Kohli barely has to do anything more than help it away. Pristine leg glance, intentionally hit over the top"
"speared away to the cover boundary! All along the ground. He preferred to stay just a tad legside of the ball, I don't even think he moved his front foot that much, just concentrated on keeping his eyes on the ball and his head still and pierced the gap"
"fuller ball on off stump, defended"
"was that another chance? Almost. The inside edge, as Kohli plays a flick, was heading towards leg stump, but instead ricocheted off the pad. Shami is getting the ball to move into the right-hander quite late"
"so why would he go for a short ball at waist high? He's been bowling good pace, veering the ball into the right-hander and cramping him for room. Here, he abandons all that, bowls a hit-me ball and gets pulled over deep midwicket"
"angles across the right-hander, Kohli works it to his favour and glides the ball to deep third man"
"waits on the shortish delivery just outside off, drilled to deep point"
"back of a length and outside off, runs off the open face to third man again"
"short-armed pull! And yet the power on it was stunning. Remember, Zak doesn't offer much pace. What he did offer was an angle to encourage the shot. He was bowling from around the wicket, picked it short and was smashed"
"went for the yorker in panic, it comes out as a full toss and AB drives it through extra cover. That was a simple, straightforward cricket shot."
"split the slip and the backward point! AB had intended to play it there, he had set up for the late cut. I wonder if he knew this was going to be the offcutter. Clears that front leg to make room, and picks that tiny gap intentionally!"
"makes him leap to get on top of the bounce, then Kohli's soft hands take over. Run down to third man"
"140 kph, shortish delivery meanders into the pads and AB says punishes it with a deft little touch to fine leg. Shows you the versatility of the man"
"did he roll his fingers over that? The ball spun back at AB at 137 kph. He was jumping up and is sorely cramped on middle and leg. Tries to fend it away, struck on the stomach"
"good length ball on off stump, defended towards point. Easy single taken. Negi's throw hits the stumps direct, wanders away into no-man's land and Kohli races back for a second! Excellent cricket"
third man's been placed fine with Morris' extra pace. Kohli sways away from the short ball on off stump and ramps it to Shreyas Iyer on the boundary there
"that's spectacular! The Powerplay ends with a resounding straight drive. Morris overpitches at 145 kph and de Villiers simply extends a defensive stroke. That's all he did, and yet the little white thing scurried away."
"yes, there is some grip in this pitch. Negi pitches a flatter delivery on off stump and gets it to turn substantially. Kohli was backing away, and ends up having to reach for the ball. Chopped through the covers"
"awful bowling. Negi pitches it short on middle, AB is already deep in his crease, waiting and waiting and waiting, before unleashing a pull past wide long-on"
cut away through the covers. Not perfectly timed
"pushes the length fuller, although there is no sign of flight yet. Some turn away from the right-hander, Kohli clips it through midwicket"
"superb strokeplay. He understands that the pitch is turning, so he waits for it, and makes his room as he plays the shot. No premeditation in that cut shot"
reaches out to a tossed up ball outside off and drives through the covers
"prefers to play off the back foot, even with Mishy tossing it up. But Kohli's hands are so quick he can adjust and cut the ball into the covers"
not so shy about using his front foot. Runs down the track and slams a flighted delivery on leg stump to the long-on boundary.
"shortish and outside off, cut to point"
whipped away through midwicket
"flatter delivery on middle and off, not much turn off that trajectory, AB knows that and nudges it through to wide long-on"
"that's the googly, Kohli plays within himself. A little clip towards midwicket. Contact was more on the inside edge"
"flighted on middle, Kohli moves forward and beside it and drives to long-off"
jumps back as soon as he sees the flatter trajectory and drills it through the covers
that's something new. Never seen Kohli look to play a reverse paddle. Negi saw it coming and fires it in full on leg stump. Kohli just about gets it away to point
"good length ball, defended"
"stunning shot! The key here was placement. He had to get it past backward point's right, but far enough to the left of the sweeper cover. And he does so to perfection"
a simple single to long-off results in a breaking of the sound barrier as the crowd stands up to applaud another skillful fifty from AB de Villiers
"went on with the arm, AB seems to lower his backlift against spin. Or against Mishra specifically. Picked away to long-on"
"width outside off, Kohli laces it through to deep cover. The batsman had been shaping to run down. Mishy bowled it short and wide. Kohli still adjusted"
"Shami was running up and to his right from long-on, and he couldn't even collect the ball properly because of the pressure put on by these two running. Easy two after a gently nudge"
"pushed through quick on leg stump, AB plays a leg glance, doesn't quite connect with bat. It clips the thighs and runs away. Mishra seems afraight to use his greatest strength - his flight -"
"goes for a lap sweep from outside off, single to short fine leg"
"googly, pitched on a good length outside off, Kohli though has retreated deep into his crease to give him the leverage to pull to deep midwicket"
shouldn't that tell the spinners to bowl slower? Kohli was lumbering down the track and was there too early. Negi had pulled the pace off this one and as a result a loft over cover takes the inside edge and flies over midwicket
"again, a little slower than normal. Tosses it up on middle and off, AB was down the track and can only defend"
"speared into the pads there, clipped to short fine leg"
"set up for the lap shot, Pawan makes it dip on the batsman though and AB mistimes it to short fine leg"
"you just can't get away. Even if you string a couple of good balls together, if any one of these batsmen decides it has to go. It goes. It was a length ball on middle, Kohli moved to the leg side with his front foot and let his hands flow through the line. Huge six over long-on, and a tough shot to complete when you aren't to the pitch."
pushed into the extra cover region
"comes down immediately, Brathwaite adjusts with a shorter ball. Picked away to long leg"
"he does seem to have that magic touch. It was a length ball, much like many AB has golf-swung over long-on many many times. This time though the bat turns just a bit in his hand and that takes some power off it. Just enough for Shami to take the catch"
"back of a length and outside off, pushed into the covers. Kohli was haring up for a single, but Watson yells 'wait, wait.'"
"tailing in on middle and leg, nudged behind square leg. Watson seemingly has a bat without a sponsor..."
"walks at the seamer again, Brathwaite bowls a short ball on middle and leg, cramping him for room, glanced to long leg"
"attempts to glide a back of a good lengt hdelivery to third man, but it wasn't quite short enough for that"
"shortish on leg stump, eased to deep square leg"
"141 kph, that's a loose shot. He was looking to force a backfoot punch over to long-on. With Shami generating the pace he is and getting the ball to bounce higher than his waist, Watson is beaten"
"shortish and outside off, sliced through point"
"comes down the track, but it short and doesn't allow any room to free the arms, short-arm pulled through straight midwicket"
"stays back in his crease and punches a shortish delivery into the covers. Again, fourth-stump line. Good work from Daredevils"
turned to deep square leg for the single he needs to complete a second successive fifty.. Joins AB in that regard tonight. There's plenty of overs left and Kohli seems to defy all notion of the human body's frailties. He is so fit
"excellent skill from Brathwaite. It was a slower bouncer, around the fourth stump again. So Kohli's pull shot doesn't work. He was beaten for the lack of pace, tries to adjust midway through the shot, has to settle for a leg bye as the ball deflects off his right shoulder"
"length, smashed! Kohli has a big grin on his face at the non-strikers' end after watching a Watson straight drive that pings the sightscreen"
length again and smashed again! This time Watson uses his wrists and whips it hrough midwicket
drifts down leg again and Watson directs it to the long leg boundary. This never-ending batting line-up is going to force a few bowlers to rethink their chosen discipline
"pulls the pace off with a back of a length ball on off stump, Watson tries turn it through midwicket, it ends up as an inside edge onto pad"
"excellent bowling. That was only 90 kph, and it was directed away from Watson's reach. Brathwaite made that decision the minute he saw Watson moving leg side. Toe-end wanders into the covers"
"that's the slow, loopy legspinner. It was only 72 kph, pitched outside off and weaved further still to defeat the cut shot"
"and again. Mishy, this is superb! Slows it down to 74 kph, and though it was shortish, the lack of pace makes Watson lose his shape in the pull. Didn't wait long enough. Mis-hit to long-on"
sublime! He had not reached the pitch of this. And it was turning sufficiently enough to encourage second thoughts. But Kohli never has them. Trusts his game to the hilt and produces a magnificent loft over extra cover
"how is that fair. He is so good with orthodox shots, now if he starts playing these dinky reverse sweeps... Beats third man ever so easily"
clipped away through midwicket
"tossed up and outside off, Watson has to reach out and drive it through the covers"
"looks for the yorker on and around off stump, Watson drills it to cover"
"doesn't need to always keep muscling them. Gets down low, knowing the bowler will bowl full, and that the bowler doesn't have that much pace on it. Lap sweeps Zaheer over short fine leg and punches gloves with Kohli with a big grin on his face"
"excellent yorker on middle, Watson manages it dig it out through midwicket"
"walks down the pitch, Zaheer tries to trump him with a loopy slower ball outside off. Ends up as a full toss. Could have been a wide, but Kohli reaches out for it and pats it through the covers. How can he timed the ball when he wasn't entirely well balanced?"
that's all in the wrists. Meets a fuller ball on middle and sends it soaring over long-on
"bisects deep midwicket and square leg to perfection! Of course, he was assisted by the fact that this was a full toss but the skill in the shot is near unmatched. Kohli stays stock still and powers it away with a whirl of his wrists."
"that was mistimed! Shami defeats Watson with a slower ball, and yet goes for maximum. The batsman was moving away from the line and ends up hitting it off the very bottom of the bat"
"131 kph, short ball has been pulled to short fine leg. The pace did Watson there. Also the lack of room to swing his arms. Went for the shot on instinct, hoping to beat Morris inside the circle, but just ends up ballooning a catch to him"
"short and wide, lashed away to deep third man. Gee, he is already timing the pants off them"
"short and at the body, Kohli pulls to long leg. Kept the ball down and tried to beat Morris on his left. Couldn't manage it"
"Shami, you legend! That was spectacular work in his followthrough, quick pick up and accurate throw to exploit an excited Sarfaraz stepping down hoping for a single. And he was only thinking about it. Kohli was too, had come down, but then returned to his crease quickly enough to send Sarfaraz scurrying too. But Shami was quicker than them. Left-handed pick-up, swiveled around, and as he did so changed the ball to his dominant right hand and nails the stumps. Sarfaraz dives and he was nowhere near close. Prior to all that, he did excellently to bowl a slower short ball outside off to make Sarfaraz mistime his chop"
"shortish and slow and outside off, steered to deep third man"
"shortish and outside off, Jadhav chops it back to the wicketkeeper"
"yorker outside off, beats him for pace. Jadhav was going for a slice to third man, no contact"
"goes for a cut, but only gets an inside edge to long leg. The pace of Morris has been too much for Jadhav in those few balls"
"wide yorker outside off, and its at superb pace too. Kohli had backed away and he can't reach far enough to make connection. Yells within the vicinity of the stump mic, and I can't quite say what he yelled because it wasn't PG"
"short-arm pulled ot long leg and Kohli always wanted the second. Jadhav was hesitant, but he has to motor soon enough"
"yorker on the base on middle at 146 kph, pushed down the ground. Excellent over. Rushed both batsmen with his speed"
"goddim! A superb run out the last over, now he bowls one full enough that Kohli can't get under. The RCB captain tries to combat that with a whip of his wrists, and though they are perhaps the most powerful ones a current cricketer, this carries only as far as long-on"
"slower short ball, rising towards his shoulder, Jadhav goes for a hack and mistimes it down the ground"
"banged in short, the batsman was moving down leg, Shami follows him to prevent the giving of room. Jadhav just ducks and the ump raps the bowler on his wrist for being clever"
"good chase from the man running back from midwicket, keeps it to just a single. Great work Iyer! Actually, Jadhav had just stood there even as Wiese had crossed him for a single. Jadhav thought he had got enough to get the boundary. Mistimed pull resulting in appropriate runs, finally"
"shortish on off stump, picked away to long leg"
"struck on the stomach as he plays a pull, and then struck in the back as he was going through for a single. Jadhav's not looked comfortable against pace."
"full toss on leg stump, Wiese plays a flick too early and gets a leading edge to point. Go for a single considering the stage of the game. The throw lobs over the stumps and there was no chance for anyone to get behind it. By the time deep midwicket mops up, they have a second"
"lovely bowling. Slower short ball on off stump, Jadhav mistimes a pull and has to settle for an single off the inside edge onto his body"
"goes for a toe-crusher, Morris gets reverse-swing into his country-mate, Wiese clears his legs and jams his bat down for a single through midwicket"
"low full toss, Jadhav backs away and smacks it to mid-off. Hit on the bottom of the bat. Shami is the fielder, who aims a throw and had he hit direct, that would have been out"
"looks for the yorker, doesn't quite get it, but doesn't allow Wiese to get any more than a push to long-off"
"shortish delivery, the batsman becomes a revolving door as he goes for a slog. Beats him and could have kissed off stump. It was that close"
"oh dear. After all that excellent work, he has offered a low full toss. Jadhav manages to smear it away over the covers. Gets a pat on the back from his captain nonetheless. He gave away only four runs in the 18th over, and only eight in the 20th"
"short, wide, and de Kock starts the chase with a boundary, freeing his arms to slash it away to the left of cover point"
"oh my. Now he overcompensates massively, looking to go full and straight and ending up slipping it miles down the leg side, giving his keeper no chance of diving across and stopping the ball"
"length ball, a lot of width once again, and this time Chahal dives to his left from cover and stops de Kock's powerful flat-bat drive"
"fullish, angling away from off stump, left alone"
"length ball on middle stump, slanting across. Iyer is opened up a little while defending into the covers. His front foot didn't really get far forward, and he was initially looking to work it into the leg side"
"back of a length slower ball, angling across. Once again, lax footowork from Iyer as he hangs back and looks to dab it down to third man. The ball slips past his edge and drops just short of the keeper"
"shifts his line wider, a little too wide. Iyer leaves and the umpire signals wide"
"oh my word, what a catch that is. We've seen a lot of assisted catches near the boundary, but this might be the best of the lot. Watson runs back from mid-on after Iyer steps out and miscues a big hit. The ball is not middled, but it's still going three-fourths of the way to the long-on boundary. Watson is sprinting full-tilt, the ball is dropping over his shoulder, and he judges it perfectly. That's step one. His momentum is carrying him towards the boundary, and he flicks it backward just as he's about to go over the edge. Wiese is following him from mid-off, the ball is flicked a couple of feet from him, and he dives, grabs onto it, and finishes inches from touching the rope himself. Wow. Just wow."
"length ball on off stump, played to midwicket with the turn"
"back of a length on middle, goes back and punches to long-on"
"back of a length on middle stump, and de Kock puts it away brilliantly. It's only a touch short, no real width, and he steps away from it and punches it into the gap between cover point and extra cover"
"tossed up on off stump, defended into the covers"
"a bit of flight again and this time he makes himself a bit of room, stays next to the line of the ball and plays a gorgeous sliced drive to the right of Kohli at cover"
"short, a bit of width, and de Kock will put those away with his eyes closed in this sort of form. Cut away crisply behind point. Jam-packed off side ring, pierced repetitively"
"came at the bowler, who delivers a 138 kph shortish delivery on middle, clipped to the right of mid-on. Samson was looking for the boundary, that's why he brought his wrists into play. Couldn't beat the man. RCB's fielder has been tigerish so far"
doesn't quite time the slam down the ground well enough. He had picked the length to be short so early that his body reacted that much early. Aravind bowls at gentle pace though and that helps him. Miscue to mid-on
"back of a length on middle, blocked into the covers"
"how good is he with the cut! He has beaten one man inside the circle on his left, then the man on the boundary is beaten on his right."
"full toss, and de Kock is surprised by it. Slow on the pick up shot over the leg side. That is among his favourite shots. Hardly seen him mistime one. But the fact that this was a high full toss trips him up. Struck only as far as mid-on"
"banged in, and rather slow outside off, de Kock leaps up off his feet and pulls it through midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, patted to mid-on for a quick single. This is how Samson gets off the blocks. If RCB can pull their in-fielders closer and get dot ball pressure on him..."
"a tad slower and fuller just outside off, pushed to mid-on"
"just a little too far from the diving Sarfaraz at backward point. This was a poor ball from Watson, a full toss very wide outside off. de Kock laces it away. Ah, such sweet freedom for the hands"
"banged in short on middle and leg, de Kock lets it go"
"gets down the track, but the slower ball forces all the timing away from him. Possibly why he slugged the ball legside. Bat face turned on impact and he went through with the shot. Single to mid-on"
"not enough room, but Samson is under pressure because of the score on the board, goes for a pull but finds midwicket"
"through Harshal at mid-off. Overpitched outside off, sweetly struck drive nearly scurries away to the boundary. Hit the practice pitches and drifted away."
"he's pitched camp there and will not budge. RCB had backward point and short third man, but de Kock threads that gap with a cut. Took the ball from off stump"
"comes down, knowing the bowler would toss it up after his short ball was punished, nudged to midwicket"
moves beside the good length ball on off stump and pats it through the gap past cover
"strides down the track, but when he can't get to the pitch of the offspinner on off stump, Samson can only push it back to the bowler"
"driven past the diving midwicket fielder. Aravind was moving to his left, and it would probably have still not stopped the single"
"cuts from leg stump, de Kock then looked for a single, but he is sent back. AB ran to his right from point and sends in the throw with not enough venom"
raps him on the pads as Watto bowls that back of a length on middle and leg. This length seems to hold in this pitch a little more and ruins the batsman's timing.
"that was a length ball just outside off, Samson swings across the line and is completely beaten. Loses shape on his shot. Could have got the boundary he wanted had he looked to for a straight drive over the bowler"
"overpitched outside off, Samson drives it to mid-off. Can't let bad balls get away like that. Gets a few works of encouragement from de Kock so that he doesn't buckle to the pressure"
"he's buckled. Watson goes short and gets it to rise to an uncomfortable height around his chest. No room to free the arms either. Samson goes for a pull, strikes it too high on the bat and offers a dolly to midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, defended"
turned away through midwicket as Nair gets behind a shortish ball on off stump
"superb shot Karun! He's stunning behind the wicket, plays reverse sweeps at will sometimes. Here he gets an easier option. Short, skidder outside off, cut past short third man. Played it ever so late"
"flighted on off stump, driven into the covers"
stays back as he judges the length to be shorter and punches it with a straight bat through cover point
"flighted outside off, driven gently to long-off"
"just straightened after pitching, which is why Nair's backfoot flick shot through midwicket takes the leading edge instead and goes through cover"
any invitation to take that route behind point! Not that the bowler was giving him much. This was all in the footwork. De Kock zips away outside leg and takes a short ball on off stump and lashes it away
starts his IPL with a full ball down leg. Jadhav appeals for a caught behind after it passed the batsman's leg glance. No connection
"back of a length and darting back into the right-hander, Nair was looking for a flick but it comes off the deck a touch too late. Gets struck on the body"
gets forward to a good length ball on off stump and tucks it to midwicket
"back of a length on off stump, defended"
"he went for the right option. It was short and rising outside off, Nair swayed his torso away and went for the upper cut. Just a touch too quick for him this time. An 'oooh,' and a wry smile from de Kock"
"Nair came down the track, mistimes a lash through the off side. Ends up going back to the bowler and making de Kock lunge back within the crease. Wiese grins at the awkward effort"
"good shot! That over was becoming one of those that RCB could have pointed out to as a turning point. Nair makes that a touch harder by running down the track, turning a back of a length ball into length and smashes it through the covers. Mind you, that still makes it only five runs off it."
and he's been sent packing! He can play this with his eyes closed. The pick up over square leg. Almost Jayasuirya-esque. Harshal gave him the length to get under and de Kock's hands are just too good. Guess that's why he's such a good keeper too
"back of a length and outside off, pushed down to mid-off. Kohli flattens the stump with his throw. De Kock thinks about an overthrow. No luck there"
"straying on leg stump, Nair flicks it sweetly between long leg and deep square leg but the fielders there are.... you guessed it! Watson and Wiese. The partnership works again, Watson dives to his left running from long leg, Wiese collects the relay and its only two"
shortish and outside off - rather slow as well - Nair shapes to play a late cut and fails to connect
"and finally he connects! Been playing that upper cut over the keeper for a while, but with Harshal's limited pace, he probably gets to see the ball longer, tune his body better and lifts it right over the keeper"
"shortish and outside off, patted to deep third man"
"back of a length on off stump, nudged to long-on"
"back of a length on off stump, picked away to deep square leg"
superb strike! He's not letting the pressure build. RCB had zeroed in on this length - the shortish length - but the problem arises when you get it only up to the waist. Nair pulls it to deep midwicket
"short, slower ball outside off, Nair lifts it over the point field. Didn't look to hit it too hard. Merely hoped to beat deep third man. Couldn't though."
"fifty in style! Course, it was a full toss which helped his pick-up shot through square leg. Whip of the wrists takes it away from long leg. Aravind dives, but he can't stop it. Special innings this. His productivity behind square on either side of the pitch is notable"
cuts through cover - he ended up reaching for the ball because Wiese bowls it short and slow and way outside off
he's been cutting from the stumps against Rasool since the chase began/ This though wasn't short enough and the inside edge nearly clatters the stumps
"too far down leg, de Kock sweeps nicely to long leg."
leans forward and clips to short fine leg. The ball goes to Gayle and so there is a huge roar from the ground
worked away through midwicket.
"on the pads, eased through midwicket and he yelled 'two' straight away. Played that softly always intending to get two. This is going to be tight though. Very tight because the throw from Sarfaraz is top class. Right next to the stumps, flat and hard. But it is not a direct hit and that allows a desperately diving Nair to make his ground. Super cricket all around"
"good length ball on middle, turned away to long-on to bring up the fifty partnership. Very vital to the Daredevils' cause, but it hasn't weighed on the two batsmen. They've played just normal cricket"
"shortish and slow and on the pads, de Kock nurdles it away to long leg"
"lands the yorker, with a little tail in as well, Nair works it away to deep midwicket"
"short and wide, slapped to Gayle at point. He misfields and there is an overthrow as well. Two runs given away. Hard-handed pick up and throw, when there wasn't anyone backing up"
"super bowling! The slower bouncer at 121 kph, and it climbs on de Kock then it dips. Hard to get the ball away when it does so much. Pull shot to no avail"
runs at the bowler and yorks himself as Harshal bowls length on leg stump.
"low full toss on leg stump, clipped over the ducking square leg umpire. Only five runs off the over. Great comeback from Harshal after a 14-run first over"
tossed up and that's enough for de Kock to wade forward and smoke it down the ground. That was the googly as well. A little overpitched so the batsman didn't have to worry about picking it
"driven hard down the ground, Nair was backing up very far and the deflection from Chahal's hands could have had him had the ball hit the stumps"
superb bowling. Looped it up and slowed it down. Knows the right-hander would be set up outside leg to try and gain all the room he can. In the end he has too much. Play and miss
"goes for the reverse sweep, the spinner bowls it full on leg stump, single to point"
dull clunk as he miscues a slap down the ground. No power in that shot and it doesn't even carry to the long-off running in. Chahal keeping the ball very wide of the batsman
"lets it go, and Nair, who has cottoned onto the tactic, lets it go and collects the extra"
"flighted outside off, driven smartly through the covers."
"smashed! Lovely start to the over. It was the shortish slower ball, but the offcutter simply sat up this time. Nair was leg side of the ball nad lofted it over extra cover"
"beautiful batting. That's right out of the Kohli school of batting, for the critics. Nudged a shortish ball between deep square leg and deep midwicket. Played very softly for a second to be possible. Kohli himself was the fielder, and had his throw been closer to the stumps though, things could have been problematic"
"shortish and outside off, pulled through midwicket"
"there's three men on the leg side boundary, that's why Wiese's bowling these short offcutters at de Kock's body. Pulled to deep midwicket"
"yorker on middle, only a single to deep midwicket, but Wiese's overstepped in putting in the extra oomph"
"and away she goes over square leg! It wasn't entirely well timed, but it was in his slot. Slogged away, lost his shape a tad, but the small boundaries save him"
"short ball rising towards his chest, but de Kock has been in there long enough to put this away too. Pull shot, rolled his wrists to keep it down, and kept it away of deep square leg too. That's the 20 run over then"
"shortish and outside off, chopped towards point"
"shortish on middle and leg, pulls to long leg and de Kock is still sprightly enough to come back for a second"
"superb hitting! It's a length ball, but putting them away with such frequency is special. This was blazed down the ground off the front foot"
"shortish on middle, de Kock brings the bat down on it like a chainsaw. Doesn't beat short third man though"
"shortish and on off stump, cut away to point."
"that tailed in and that itself seemed to work against RCB. Beats the batsman's flick, drifts away off the pads to long leg"
"looks for the fuller one just outside off, drilled to long-off"
"Nair has played a little beauty! That's the hundred stand. He knew Aravind would go full, but didn't premeditate it. Went across and down on one knee only after the ball was released. it was a full toss, which helped, and he glances it just past the diving keeper"
"backs away leg side, Aravind follows with a low full toss, lofted through cover. Yuzi misfields and yet its only one"
that's the kind of shot that tells you which team is winning. A tad overpitched and de Kock belts it over the covers. Kohli looks crestfallen
"slower ball, full of length, de Kock goes for a lace through cover again but gets an inside edge"
"he was moving outside leg, then he was shaping for the scoop over fine leg, then he reacts to the ball in front of it - a slower short ball outside off - opens the face on it and nearly threads the gap between third man and backward point. Leaps in the air as he was watching the ball travel while taking his single, obviously gutted it didn't go through"
he is playing a blinder! Lifts it over the bowler's head with such panache. The ability to play that shot in a big run-chase which can still swing around. Daredevils have risen to the occasion
"back of a lengt hand outside off, patted into the covers to bring up a fifty. Punched the air in triumph. Gets a big hug from his partner and a standing ovation from the dugout"
"yorker on leg stump, de Kock digs it out past the bowler. Actually, Harshal misfields"
"full toss on off stump, Nair moved outside off for the lap shot past the keeper. Gets too fine an inside edge on it and Jadhav collects it on the bounce"
"slower ball tailing into the pads, Nair places it behind square leg with a deft touch and yet the ball scurries away"
"moves to 99 and punches gloves with his partner. De Kock's looking like he is the boss out there. He premeditated a scoop, but when the bowler bowled short and slow, he slipped into a pull shot over the short fine leg fielder"
"shortish slower ball outside off, Nair flays at it and gets a thick inside edge back at the bowler"
"low full toss, lofted to long-off. No timing on the shot, immediately asks for a new bat"
"off comes the helmet and a fairly subdued raise of the bat. The shot epitomises his innings today. So many runs behind square. This was short and wide, sliced away. A little smile of satisfaction when he sees the standing ovation from the dugout"
"fuller ball outside off, laced into the covers. Direct hit could have had him, but there wasn't one"
"loops a full toss way wide of off stump, de kock can't reach it with his cut"
"that's a slog, not often has he played that shot. Takes a thick edge and flies away over the keeper"
"this is turning into a party for de Kock! This was full and around the stumps, he clears his front leg and scythes it through the covers. All along the ground."
clipped through midwicket
"he wont be there to finish the game. Watson does not celebrate. He simply offers applause to a fine innings. Goes up to de Kock as he walks away with a nod of the head. It was slower short ball, dug in and rising towards his shoulder, the batsman swings instinctively. The pull shot only takes the glove and goes to the keeper"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to point"
"shortish and outside off, punched through the covers. Daredevils doing this easily now"
"low full toss on off stump, JP skews it off the open face past point and gets the couple he wanted"
"shortish and slow and on off stump, JP shuffles across for a flick through leg. Has to settle for a leg bye, which levels the scores!"
"that's a little bit of comedy to finish things off. He pushes it down the ground, Yuzi dives across and fields it himself. At that point, Nair was hurtling down for the single. Yuzi backflicks looking to hit the target, doesn't and the overthrow is taken"
