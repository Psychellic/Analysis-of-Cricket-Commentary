"tossed up on off, he comes on the front foot to defend."
"down the track but can't get to the pitch of it, and mis-times the drive to mid-on. <b>he's overstepped though so free hit coming up</b>"
and can't score off the free hit. Looped up on leg and Zaman was looking to swing it over deep square but misses it and is struck on the pads
down the track again and biffs this straight back. Lyth tried to direct the ball onto the non-striker's stumps with a deflection but couldn't quite get it right
"flatter on the stumps, goes back and whips through midwicket"
goes across and flicks this to short fine leg
"<b>clears the in-field with a mis-hit</b>. He'll get a boundary for that. Came down the track to go over the top, got the toe end to it, but enough to go over mid-off and the ball had legs on it to go all the way to the fence"
"good length, nipping in a touch, nudged to the bowler's left for a quick single"
gets it to move in the air but a bit too much and that's gone down legside
"<b>lovely shot</b>. Too full and given room outside off, Tamim gets down on one knee and unfurls a classical cover drive that purrs all the way to the boundary"
"better line now, closer to off, but he's dealt with this well, going across and nudging it backward of square softly enough to pinch two runs"
nipping into him but the line is too straight and it goes off his thigh pad towards square leg
"<b>beaten</b>. Gets this one to leave the left-hander. Zaman has seen it coming into Tamim from the other end, ends up feeling for it in the channel as it hisses past the outside edge"
"and this one comes back in from the same length and same channel, he's looking to push this through cover, gets an inside edge onto pad"
"back of a length going across him, he plays with the angle to push to point"
"going across him again, wider of off, and he ends up beaten on the drive"
"<b>slashed over point</b>. Tamim was expecting the one to go across him this time and goes with the angle, doesn't bother to keep it down, gets it over point. Third man is too fine to stop that"
<b>and again</b>. This one was fuller but well wide of off and Tamim leaned forward to carve it over point once again
"<b>huge appeal</b> but turned down. He corrects his line and has Tamim in a tangle. Much straighter this time, but might have pitched outside leg. Nipping across him off the seam, and hits him on the knee roll as he's trying to work it to square. And it did pitch outside leg - but a good ball"
"fuller outside off now, he has a thrash at it, gets a thick outside edge to third man"
"<b>super shot</b> Nothing that much wrong with the ball, he kept it on a length in the channel, but he moved across and manipulated the field beautifully, flicking it to square leg, where there was no fielder"
"too straight and goes across to flick again, but behind square this time, so only a single"
<b>bang</b>. That is dismissive. Comes down the track and picks it up from in the slot to swat this over long-on. Sohail Tanvir probably not used to being treated this way by batsmen.
"down the track again but Tanvir shortens his length this time and keeps it outside off, so Zaman ends up mistiming his pull to mid-on"
"good comeback, beats him outside off with a good length ball in the channel. Zaman stayed in his crease that time and ends up feeling for it"
"back of a length, given room outside off and he slashes it past backward point to find another boundary. Huge over for Lahore. 15 runs off it"
"good length coming in slightly on a length outside off, punched to point"
strays on the pads and is nicely picked off behind square. Good effort by the fielder at deep square leg to sprint to his left and dive to save the boundary
"good length coming into him, tapped towards mid-on for a quick single"
"good length nibbling around off, steers to point and they set off for a quick single. <b>direct hit and he was gone</b>. Risky single that, but Tamim is still there. Khushdil was the fielder"
"<b>top edge taken by point running forward</b>. Well done by Junaid who dug it on a hard length around off. Tamim was moving across to paddle-pull it in the gap behind square, but the ball perhaps stuck in the pitch and he was early into the shot. Gets a top edge that loops up, comfortable catch for Khusdhil"
"<b>beauty</b>. Took off from back of a length, bowled on leg stump and zips past off, trampoline like almost. Sohail nowhere near it, as it whizzes across him, near chest height, followed it with his hands but too quick - just as well, otherwise he was in danger of edging it"
"full on off, driven to mid-off"
"back of a length on off, and that's wonderfully done. Punched through cover, bisects the gap well and there's no protection in the deep so that's a boundary"
"back of a length but nipping into him that time, pulled off his thigh pad to deep square leg"
gets it to move into the left hander but the line's awry and it slides down leg
"yorker on off, digs it out to cover. Lyth swoops in and has a shy at the stumps that misses - so they get a run with the overthrow"
<b>caught at deep square leg</b>. Sliding on the pads and Sohail wanted to flick that powerfully over the boundary. Gets decent connection but not the elevation and Rossouw on the boundary keeps his balance and catches it above his head. Had to move back but judged it well
"length ball sliding on the pads again but Zaman can't flick it away, wears it on the pads"
"length ball on off, glides it to third man"
"back of a length, some width outside off and he's cut this nicely through point. Powerplay done though so there's protection there"
<b>slammed to the midwicket boundary</b>. A bit short and he transfers weight back and pulls across the line. Not the best connection but the placement was perfectly in the gap
"tighter line on off, steers it to third man with bat close to body"
"short on off, goes back to pull. Mis-times it to deep square leg"
"length ball on leg stump, nips away off the seam and Hafeez is beaten on the flick to be struck on the thigh pad. Half an appeal from the bowler"
"good length on off, on the money first up, Zaman plays him from well back in the crease to defend into the offside"
"<b>Tahir is pleading for an lbw and they've gone for the review</b>. This was on a length, and Zaman went down to sweep it from off. Misses it completely, because it went straight on and is struck on the back thigh having gone down on his knee. <b>pitched outside leg though</b>. Great decision because it looked really close in real-time"
"googly, slightly shorter in length, goes back and punches to long-off"
"tossed up on off, comes on the front foot to drive to deep cover"
"<b>dropped</b> by the bowler. But you could say he saved his fingers there. Zaman came down the track and absolutely wallopped it, straight back. Tahir was almost getting out of the way as it went to his left. Did have his hands out but it was more of 'if it sticks it sticks'. Hit hard enough that long-on can't get around to save the boundary"
"back of a length, cuts it through point"
"length on the stumps, worked backward of square on the front foot"
"too short, he rocks back to pull, but Afridi's got that to turn a bit, so Hafeez gets it on the lower part of the bat. Loops up and bounces to deep square leg"
"googly, stays back and punches to long-off"
"good length on the stumps, stretches forward and pushes to cover"
a bit shorter and he rocks back to pull this. going hard at it but no timing - which has eluded Zaman through the innings almost
steered to backward point and they take the quick single
"fuller on off, driven on the front foot but mid-off cuts it off"
"drifts on leg, and is clipped to long-on"
"fuller on the legs, tapped to long-on. A bit of hesitation from Zaman in running but they complete the single comfortably"
"nicely done. Looped up and dips on him, he's come on the front foot but can't reach the pitch, it grips and tuns away as he tries to flail at it"
"length on off, punched to mid-off"
"googly, don't think he read it. But he was shaping to punch through the offside so got enough bat on it to go towards point off the outside half"
"<b>dropped</b> by the keeper. Tough one. Quick leggie that he was going legside of to steer away, gets a nick but the keeper can't hold on"
"length on the stumps, flicked to deep midwicket"
"beaten with a quicker one outside off, tries to steer it away again but no contact"
"<b>dropped at point</b>. After quicker ones Afridi loops this outside off. Hafeez has a thrash at it, and gets a top edge. Bopara at point is running back but seems awfully slow and doesn't get to the ball. Would have thought that was catchable"
"flatter, cuts it through cover"
can't get it away. Comes on the front foot to try and punch through off but can't beat the man in the circle at cover
"down the track, takes it on the full and biffs it to long-off."
"inside edged onto pad. Zeeshan was quick behind the stumps to take off the bails but Hafeez dragged his foot in, in time. Was looking to drive, beaten in flight and drift"
"too short and he goes back and pulls this between deep midwicket and deep square leg. Not timed, came off the toe-end but gets the desired result"
<b>top edge falls safe</b>. Went down to slog sweep and got a top edge to short midwicket. Tahir is the only one around and he runs to it but can't get there
"length outside off, steers it to point"
<b>nails the slog sweep</b>. Got the length he wanted and made good connection. Went hard at it too. Carries over deep midwicket. 12 runs in the over despite a couple of miscues
"<b>caught at long-off</b>. Afridi gets his man finally. Looped up outside off, Hafeez made room to swat this over extra cover. Doesn't get it cleanly and the ball carries only to long-off who holds it safely with both hands over his head"
"quicker outside off, skids through, and Zaman is beaten on the cut"
"down the track, but Afridi shortens his length and he can only punch it back"
"googly, stays back and punches to deep cover"
"full toss outside off, driven to long-off"
"googly but outside leg, he comes on the front foot and nudges to square leg"
<b>down the track and nails it</b>. Takes it on the full outside off and smashes it straight. Bounces just in front of the boundary
<b>nicely timed</b>. Makes room and crashes this through cover to find another boundary. He's beginning to cut loose
"<b>leading edge taken at backward point</b>. Had the right idea, but wrong execution. Down the track again, but Lyth keeps this a bit wider and Zaman loses his shape from the attempted loft over cover, and the leading edge is easily taken"
makes some room to cut this past point
"fuller on middle and leg, glanced fine"
"fuller outside off, and premeditates the sweep, gets it fine"
"full toss, dips on him on leg, jammed to midwicket"
"<b>quicker one goes through him</b>. Dunk is caught on the crease, as this one pitches slightly fuller of a length but he's stayed back to it. Turns in from middle and off and there is a big gap between bat and pad as he's looking to work it to leg. His stumps are splayed before he can do so"
"length ball outside off, stays legside of it and punches through cover on the back foot"
looped up but strays too far down leg
"fuller outside off this time, cuts it to deep point"
"tossed up on off, comes on the front foot to smother it in defence"
"tossed up on the stumps, too full and flicked off his toes to deep midwicket. End of a fantastic spell by Afridi."
"given some air, on a lengh on the stumps, comes on the front foot and opens the face to glide it towards backward point"
"tossed up outside off, uses his wrists to work it to deep square leg"
"flatter on a length on off, punched to long-off"
"length outside off, considerable turn, he plays with it to push to point"
"<b>almost through him</b> bu the inside edge goes to the fine leg boundary. Tahir has his head on the pitch. Beautifully bowled, with drift and loop into him, he pushes at it and gets an inside edge that just misses the stumps and the keeper misses it too"
"flatter on the stumps, pushed back to the bowler on the back foot"
"slower ball back of a length, adjusts and taps it through cover"
"slower bouncer again, and Wiese pulls out of the the pull shot having shaped to play it. Goes past off"
"<b>nails the pull shot that time</b>. Too short and doesn't rise up, just sits up and Wiese rocks back to pull to deep square leg"
"back of a length outside off, cuts it off the back foot between cover and point"
<b>crashed</b>. Makes room and cuts this back of a length ball outside off through point. Bopara was the fielder in the circle and he doesn't bend down in time to his right to collect cleanly
"slower bouncer again, he can't get it away"
"slower bouncer, Wiese controls his pull shot to deep square leg"
"dug in short outside off, he can't connect with the pull"
"back of a length outside off again, no timing as he slaps it to extra cover"
"yorker on the stumps, but he was deep in his crease and picks it off his toes to deep midwicket"
"<b>pulls this nicely for four</b>. Sloppy from square leg, who got there but couldn't stop the ball while tumbling. Bouncer at normal pace and he goes back to place the pull well"
"<b>lovely shot</b>. Full outside off, and he uses the depth of the crease to carve this over cover"
"bouncer outside off, he doesn't get on top of it but he's placed it in a gap between deep midwicket and deep square leg, so it falls safely. Not timed so will be cut of before the boundary"
"<b>biffed</b>. Too short and not rising up at all, he takes a couple of steps and smashes a pull to deep midwicket"
"<b>beautifully done</b>. Was expecting the fuller one outside off thanks to the last two balls and was ready for it, stays back and lifts this over extra cover in one clean shot. got the width for the shot too, with the ball well outside off"
"<b>top edge goes for four</b>. Fortune favours Wiese. Down the track again, a normal pace bouncer that he goes to pull. The top edge goes very fine to third man and he gets another boundary"
"this is carnage. Length ball on the pads, and he stand stall and just pulls it fine. Didn't have to time it well, just helped it on its way with no fielder there. Bad ball"
"finally a dot ball. Goes down the track and is beaten by the back of length slower ball, doesn't connect with the pull."
"length on leg stump, he's making room, swipes this to deep midwicket while coming forward"
"full toss low outside off, unwinds to hit this straight - just misses Patel at the non-striker's end - and long-off fields"
"down the track, and that is a great shot. Bouncer at normal pace and he not only controls his pull he puts it in the gap too to get a boundary at deep midwicket"
"<b>caught at cover</b>. End of a fine hand by Patel. This was full on the stumps, he came down the track again, wanted to go over long-off but gets the toe-end and the ball swirls up for an easy catch at the edge of the circle"
"<b>muscled over deep midwicket</b>. Wiese continues on his merry way. Short ball outside off, slower one having rolled his fingers over it. Wiese has to create all the pace on that shot and he does so, rocking back and using his immense power to cart it over the boundary"
"<b>finishes in style</b> Tanvir was going for the yorker, Wiese just stayed still and lofted this over wide long-on with arms extended. Clean, clean strike, a great one to finish. What a knock by Wiese."
"yorker first up on middle and leg, he's almost falling over but makes great connection with it, clipping it off his legs to the deep midwicket boundary"
"fuller outside off, pushed to mid-off from the inside half of the bat. collision between non-striker and bowler as they complete the run, but no damage done"
"<b>yorker kept out</b>. Brilliant one on middle stump, but he gets the bat down in time to keep it out"
"<b>swung over mid-on</b>. Full outside off again, he clears the front leg and swings through the line. Gets more height than distance but enough to clear the in-field and find the boundary"
"<b>lands safely off the toe-end</b>. Full outside off again, he goes for the lofted shot over the bowler, but the ball's hit the end of the bat and swirls up. Lands in no man's land past midwicket and they pinch a second run"
finishes an eventful over with another searing yorker that the batsman does well to get bat on. The ball flies off a thick outside edge to third man
<b>good shot</b>. A bit short outside off and he goes back to create room and cuts it powerfully through point
straighter now but he makes room again and steers it to backward point
"<b>mix up but safe</b>. length ball on the pads, he misses the flick and it rolls off the pad to the keeper's right. He sets off for a run and is sent back. Keeper takes the gloves of and hits the stumps direct - but the bails stay on. Batsman was in anyway"
"fuller outside off, goes for the slog sweep and misses"
"<b>beauty</b>. This pitch has something for the spinners, a considerable something as the first innings showed. This pitched on a length on off and spun away sharply, beating the outside edge as he was looking to push it"
<b>nailed</b>. Err in length and be punished. In the slot for the slog sweep and he unleashes a full-blooded one that sails over deep square leg
"fuller spearing into him, he's making room but is cramped and pushes to cover"
"slips in the short ball after having bowled it full, outside off and he rides the bounce well to steer it to third man, rising up on tip toes with the ball"
"<b>superbly done</b>. Another yorker but he is backing away to make room and that means he can stay legside of the ball, open the face and drive it through point with great timing and placement"
strays down leg and he'll have to rebowl that. Not the best thing given he's in visible pain
nails the yorker on middle stump and all Lyth can do is get his legs out of the way and squirt it to point
"<b>swatted over square leg</b>. Length ball outside off, he swivels and pulls this powerfully. No sting in this ball, sits up for Lyth and he nails it over the fence"
"yorker on leg stump again, he was backing away, carves it to backward point where a fumble allows them a single. Lyth has also broken his bat and needs a replacement."
"<b>sloppy work at short fine leg</b> Dilbar Hossain the man. This was on a length and swept from outside off. The fielder was in place, and took a few steps to his right but instead of holding onto the ball it goes under his hands"
"tossed up on leg stump, he's giving himself room again, steers it to point"
"given some air outside off, he slashes it but can't time it well. One bounce to backward point"
moves across now to sweep but can't connect with this flatter one on a length
"too short and that one is launched over midwicket. What do three dots matter if you can do that? Rocks back and his eyes must have lit up at that length, threw all he had at it and sent it soaring over the boundary"
"fuller, driven to cover on the front foot"
"fuller outside off, tried to flay it with feet static, takes the inside half to roll to midwicket"
<b>caught behind off a short ball</b>. well bowled by Rauf who dug this in short outside off and got it to rise appreciably. Zeeshan tried to ramp it over the keeper but it was getting too big on him and he can't connect well. The keeper does well to leap up and hold it
"length on the pads, flicked to deep square leg's right for a couple"
"back of a length outside off, stays still and cuts it to third man"
"keeps it on a length outside off, he steers it from close to body to third man"
"back of a length on off, punched to point"
"<b>dropped at midwicket</b>. Full toss that Lyth was not expecting perhaps, and he swats it tamely to midwicket. Fakhar Zaman is right there, moves forward and gets it in his hands but it bursts out. could be costly"
"length ball outside off, stays still and opens the bat face to glide this square of third man"
"fuller and on the stumps, steers it to third man"
"fuller on the leg stump, falling over a bit as he nudges to mid-on for a quick single"
"<b>wham</b>. Marginally shorter in length but at Dilbar's pace and with Lyth in this form, that is going to go. He rocks back and absolutely belts the cover of it, sends it several rows back over deep midwicket."
"<b>dropped - is it? -at point</b> but a tough chance. back of a length, he's making room and slashes at it hard. Samit Patel at point dived to his right but couldn't get the ball to stick. Probably took some pace off it though, for the man on the boundary to field. Got both hands to it tumbling to his right but couldn't hold on."
"length ball, flicked to midwicket"
"fuller outside off, room given, and he slices it to third man's left, who does well to slide and stop it."
"length on the stumps, tucked off his pads to deep square leg"
"slower ball, too early into the drive, the ball pops up but drops safely before mid-off"
"back of a length outside off, slashed to third man"
"short ball, hits him on the chest guard. He was trying to run it down to third man I think, but the ball came onto to him quicker and also cut in slightly. Drops down and he's looking for a quick single but there isn't one"
"length ball on off, goes back and punches to wide long-off. They pinch a second with good running"
"fuller outside off, comes on the front foot to clip this through midwicket"
"<b>run out chance missed</b>. too short and he rocks back to carve this over cover. Masood was haring back for the second. Sloppy of the fielder to throw it to the bowler's end, gave him time to turn around and scramble back and dive into his crease."
"down the track but this was flatter, ends up almost a yorker and he digs it out to long-on"
too short and he rocks back to swat this across the line to deep midwicket and raise a brilliant <b>fifty</b>.
"shorter again on leg stump, stays still and paddle-pulls it to deep backward square leg"
"<b>outside edge goes to third man</b>. Down the track, was looking to launch it over mid-off, but gets an edge that runs down fine"
"back of a length, goes back and slugs across the line to deep midwicket"
"<b>caught at deep midwicket</b>. Baseball slug to a short of a length ball, across the line. Made a crack as it left the bat, but it's a long boundary there and he's picked out the fielder. Superb innings by Lyth ends."
"tucks him up with a length ball on leg stump, which he nudges through midwicket"
"fuller slanting across him, and he strokes it nicely through cover. Hafeez runs across to his left at the cover boundary and slides save the boundary"
"down the track but he sees him and shortens the length, tapped to extra cover with a horizontal bat"
"given some air on a length outside off, tapped gently into the offside for a quick single"
"straighter and flatter, gives himself room and slaps it to long-off"
"held in the pitch a bit and Rossouw was playing from the crease, going into a forward defensive position, had to hold it and tap the ball down"
"length on the stumps, turned through midwicket"
goes down and sweeps this length ball to deep square leg
"dips on him and he is beaten on the sweep. turned a bit too. Rolls to backward point, who has a shy at the stumps and hits direct - unfortunately for him that means the ricochet brings an overthrow."
"length ball on the pads, flicked to deep midwicket"
"down the track but he keeps this well wide of off so Rossouw has to reach for it, ends up toe-ending to cover"
"giving himself room but Wiese follows him with a slower one, and he can only swat it to mid-off"
"slower ball yorker, steered to short third man with a flat bat. Softly done so another quick single"
"length on the stumps, flicked off his pads to deep midwicket"
"pace off the ball, gives batsmen nothing to work with. Rossouw slaps this fuller one to extra cover. No timing on it"
"length on off, he gets a thick outside edge off an attempted on-drive that goes to third man"
"back of a length on the stumps, he can't do much with it except open the face to steer to third man"
"length outside off, he stays on the back foot and whips through midwicket"
"that is what he does, down the track and the bowlers spots him and bangs it in short. But he makes decent connection with the pull shot to deep midwicket"
"fuller on the stumps, driven through extra cover"
"<b>the pressure tells and he's got him</b>. Great catch by Ben Dunk. Masood moved around in his crease and went across, tried to ramp it but made poor connection - so poor that it almost didn't reach the keeper. Dunk had to dive forward and to his right and scooped it up with one glove."
"pace off, length ball on off again, punched to mid-off. The fielder over-runs it but it's still just a single"
"fuller on a sixth stump line, he stands tall to drive but can't time it. Goes to mid-off, and the man is a bit wide but moves quickly and dives to stop it"
<b>ramped over the keeper</b>. Dug it in short but had no third man. He read it well and waited for the ball to come to him and then ramped it over the keeper's left
"fuller on the pads, tries to turn it to the legside but gets a leading edge that trickles towards mid-off"
"<b>caught behind off a top edge</b>. Back of a length and the asking rate forces Bopara to swat across the line at this. Another slower one, dug into the pitch, Bopara can't time his shot at all, gets a top edge that goes straight up and behind. Dunk calls for it, settles under it, and pouches it."
"fuller on the stumps, another slower one, waits on it and pushes to cover's right"
"Length ball on leg stump, he was looking for room so that tucks him up. Nudged to short third man"
"Keeps it wide of off stump and he reaches for it, slashes it and connects well to find the point boundary."
"Yorker length outside off, goes a bit across and drives it to long-on"
"<b>Wiese with a great catch now</b>. You just can't keep him out of the game. Low full toss that he tried to blast over long-off. Wiese was at the boundary, times his jump and holds it with arms stretched high above his head."
"<b>bowled him first ball</b> and the Qalandars are shutting down the Sultans quickly. Afridi was moving across, looking to whip this backward of square. Too fast, too accurate and too good though. Yorker that goes between his legs and shatters stumps."
"back of a length, moving across him, but he manages to punch it to short cover"
"and that's one, yorker outside off, dug back out to the bowler"
tries another but it's a low full toss and he whips that through midwicket using his powerful wrists
"nails another yorker, on middle and off, but he manages to get the bat down in time to jam this to mid-on"
"bluffs now with a length ball outside off, that the batsman just lets go"
"almost yorker length outside off, but he's sitting deep in his crease so manages to drive it to mid-on"
"low full toss on the stumps, punched to long-on. Not timed well"
"full on the stumps, steered to short third man"
"offcutter, no pace on it, bunted gently into the offside for a quick single"
<b>David Wiese can do no wrong</b>. Another slower ball. The batsman hasn't read it at all. He goes for a big swipe across the line - the asking rate demands that - but he's through his shot when the ball pings into the stumps.
length ball angled in on the stumps from slightly wide of the crease. Tapped gently into the legside. Another quick run
"slower and full outside off, steered to backward point"
"yorker on the fifth stump, steered to point. Dot ball to end Wiese's quota."
"swing and a miss. Full ball angling across outside off, goes down on one knee, can't connect"
"<b>caught at square leg</b>. They are tumbling quickly. Back of a length and he gets it low on the end of the bat as it swirls high. Dunk calls for it but Hafeez settles under it. <b>Wait a minute, he's overstepped by an inch, so that's a no-ball</b>. Khushdil gets a life. And there's a free hit coming up to Ilyas."
has a big thrash at this length ball outside off and gets a thick outside edge to third man
<b>what do we have here?</b> He frees his arms to a fuller one outside off and slams it high and handsome over long-on.
"better length, pulled it back a fraction and got the ball to lift nicely while going across him. Another big heave but he can't connect"
"giving himself room but the bowler follows him with a back of length slower ball. Slapped to deep midwicket, no timing on that - but that allows them to hare back for the second"
"length outside off, he waits for it and cuts it nicely through point. Takes only a single to keep strike. Second would have been risky anyway"
"too wide outside off, targetting that tramline but just beyond it. Wide ball"
"keeps it full and wide outside off, Khushdil goes down on on knee to carve it away but there is a square third man who will field it"
"full on leg stump, nudges it to midwicket while on the back foot and off balance, takes off for a single. Dives to make it but a direct hit would have had him in trouble"
"<b>bang</b>. Khushdil living up to his reputation as a big-hitter. Full on the stumps, he clears his front leg and swing through the line to deposit this over wide long-on"
"keeps it yorker length on a fifth stump, and he has to reach for it a bit having backed away a touch. Toe-ends it to mid-off"
"fuller on off, squirts it towards point and they take a single. Samit Patel swooping in from point can't gather cleanly"
"<b>super shot</b>. He was expecting the full one outside off, stays still and blasts it straight, over mid-off's head and into the boundary"
"<b>that's run away for four</b> and Shaheen is shaking his head. Full toss outside off, and he just pushed at it, but ended up placing it perfectly backward of point. No fielder there!"
"yorker on off stump, bunted back to the bowler and they sprint for the single. Shaheen runs down, gathers the ball and lets loose at the stumps at the bowler's end. <b>misses the run out</b>. Would have been miles out."
"<b>caught at deep midwicket - is that the match?</b> Shaheen kept it full, Khushdil can't get properly underneath the ball and ends up with more height than distance. The calm hand of Hafeez aren't spilling that. End of a fine hand by Khushdil, but he was always fighting an uphill battle."
"<b>brilliant catch by Ben Dunk behind the wicket</b>. Snorter, short ball outside off that climbs on him. He can't get gloves out of the way, follows it with his hands and edges behind. Dunk has to tumble forward to grab it, and gets a glove underneath it, to scoop it up inches off the ground. The soft signal was not out but they've gone upstairs and it's clear Dunk caught it cleanly."
"won't get a hat-trick, but was close enough. Full ball swinging in hits him on the pads but it's clearly going down leg. Rolls off towards point for a leg-bye"
"full on off, makes room and crashes it through cover-point. There is a fielder in the deep"
"<b>top edge taken at deep midwicket</b> and it's all over. Swiped across the line, the ball went high in the air and was taken safely. <b>Lahore Qalandars have marched into the PSL 2020 final</b>."
