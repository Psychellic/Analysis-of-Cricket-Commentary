"carves it away... third man's lining it up.... but it falls short! Whoa. Talk about anti-climax! And to make it worse, <b>Mujeeb, the fielder, gets struck in the eye</b> as the ball bounces up at him. He's going off the field"
"back of a length and outside off, Williamson lets it through"
"glorious strike, standing up on those tippy-toes to crunch a shortish delivery to point. That lovely vertical bat. That sexy high elbow. Excuse me for a moment..."
"<b>bounced out</b>! Because Williamson isn't prepared for it to kick up off the pitch as it does. He sees the ball pitching short, believes there is enough room on offer for the pull, goes through with the shot, but only splices it to mid-off. Ashwin takes a simple catch. Kings XI draw first blood."
gets forward for a Test-match block
"covers the line of this back of a length delivery, just outside off, at 137 kph"
cramps Dhawan for room and the batsman can only chop it down by his feet
sweetly hit as he waits for the full delivery on the pads and whips it through square leg
"<b>beaten</b> with a bouncer! Oooh, this is a ripper of a start. On a true pitch with plenty of kick for the quicks, Sran hits the deck and gets the ball to rise up to Dhawan's neck. He goes for the hook and comes up a distant second"
"ooh, that's crunched. He sees width, He throws his hands at it. And then watches the ball skip away to the cover point boundary."
"flicks off the pad to the right of the wicketkeeper. Dhawan's little leg glance doesn't quite have the, um, legs"
"the right-left combo spawning a few mistakes. Sran strays on Saha's pads, who deftly turns it to the fine leg boundary. That ball would've been perfect for Dhawan"
"that's supreme skill. He reads the length of this short ball so early. He doesn't mind that the ball is decking into him, not giving him too much room. But the left-hander still goes for the late cut and gets it away to the third man boundary"
"<b>special bowling</b>! It's bounce again, only this time it happens with the ball moving away from the batsman. Dhawan is squared up. He needs to play, but he's not sure how to. Ends up poking the bat out and offers the outside edge. Karun Nair at slip dives forward and takes a lovely catch."
"good length, outside off, Pandey ignores it like the due date on a phone bill"
"he's probing away, just outside off, generating steep bounce. Pandey chooses to leave again"
"forces the batsman off his feet to deal with this short ball angled in at middle. Oof, this is top-class new-ball bowling"
"good length on middle, pushes it down the pitch. Pandey is a senior player in bad form. If ever there was a time to come good..."
"leans into a lovely cover drive, but that off side field is better packed than a jam jar"
rides the bounce on this short of a length delivery outside off and guides it to point
some cut back in off the pitch surprises Saha as he blocks the ball with soft hands and trots across to the other end
"magics it to midwicket! This is Virat Kohli territory, taking a good length ball on middle and off and ushering it to a legside boundary with great poise"
shortens his length immediately and pushes the ball further across the right-hander. Pandey leaves
"<b>dropped</b> by Ashwin running back from mid-off! He moves a little slowly, perhaps because he has to keep track of the ball over his shoulder. Reaches out in desperation and ends up fluffing a mostly straightforward chance. And so Pandey gets a reprieve. Dude plays sweet shots, and then loses his head straight after. Like here, when he looks to take on a good length ball on off stump and lift it over mid-on. Not the shot to play on this pacy pitch"
"full and swinging away on off stump, Saha pushes to cover"
opens the face and runs the short delivery to third man
"slots it between extra cover and mid-off, Ashwin catches up with it, puts in a dive and saves a few runs."
"shortish on off stump, steers it towards point"
"taken at midwicket! Rajpoot is winning this on his own!  Meanwhile, Saha, the experienced Saha, the man who should have dropped anchor after the openers fell, goes for an ugly slog and gets a top edge. Sunrisers fans, look away."
"<b>dropped</b> by the same man who gobbled up the last catch! Tye is in the firing line of a fierce pull shot from Pandey (loads of power, poor placement) and he fumbles an absolute dolly. Pandey gets a second life in the Powerplay"
goes for the drive on the up - a dangerous shot on a bouncy pitch. Finds cover
"<b>picks out third man</b>! What is happening?! Shakib takes aim at a short and wide delivery and top-edges it straight down to third man. <b>Oh, but wait! It's a no-ball</b>! Shakib gets a life now! That's three wickets mucked up by Kings XI within the first 32 deliveries of the game."
"dude should have been out last ball, instead he gets a hip-high full toss as a free hit and launches it to the square leg boundary. This is the craziest Powerplay ever!"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks it"
"blistering hit! He is such a clean striker, especially with the cut shot. And he will have plenty of opportunity to play that on this bouncy pitch. Third man and point may as well be doing the crossword"
"top effort at short cover, Tiwary diving to his left to stop a scorching drive"
pokes it into the covers and looks for a single off the misfield. Shakib says no.
cuts the shortish delivery outside off from around the wicket to point.
"<b>inside edge</b> as Ashwin catches Shakib in the crease with a lovely length, just around the 4 m mark. The ball comes in with the angle and messes up the batsman's timing further"
knocks it down to long-on
hangs back and works a good length ball (still offbreak) on middle to deep square leg
backs away as the good length offbreak comes in with the angle. Shakib punches it to cover
"<b>is that a run-out</b>. Ah, no. Ashwin loses the ball as he tries to guide it onto the stumps. So Shakib survives after a nudge into the covers and running a tad bit lazily"
"around the wicket to bowl side-arm offbreaks, like Kedar Jadhav. Shakib works it behind square leg"
"<b>the ball comes out of his hand at around stump-high</b>, as he bends his front knee and crouches in his action! Pandey stays still and works it through midwicket"
"full and outside off, drives smoothly through to the sweeper cover"
"slow through the air, barely wanting the ball to bounce with that side-arm action. It goes down leg and Rahul fumbles."
goes back and slaps a shortish delivery on off stump through to long-off
that's the high-arm action and Pandey drills the half-volley to deep cover
"good length on middle stump from around the wicket, with the normal action. Shakib knocks it to long-off"
blocks the fuller delivery on off stump
whips a flat delivery on off stump down to long-on
"holds the offbreak back, and Pandey is sucked in by the flight on this, goes through with the sweep shot way too early and misses altogether"
"fuller little carrom ball outside off, drives into the covers, where Mujeeb misfields rather badly"
"keeps it wicket to wicket and Pandey, without any room, can only block"
backs away and taps the shortish delivery to long-off
"full on middle stump, and easily worked off his pads towards the vacant square-leg region"
"good length outside off, and no spin this time. Cut off the back foot, but straight to point"
"good length outside off, and <b>extra bounce</b> this time. Misses the cut"
back of a length on off but angling into Shakib. Goes onto the back foot and fends it back to the bowler
"good length outside off, and Shakib goes deep inside the crease. Taps it towards mid on for a walking single"
"full just outside off, but spinning sharply into the right-hander's pads. Big stride forward and whipped towards midwicket"
"good length outside off, and starts off with the cutter. Pandey's through his drive too early, and takes a thick-ish edge. Falls just short of point though. Well deceived!"
"short on middle, and Shakib's quick to swivel and pull. But mistimed towards midwicket, which allows them to scamper across for one"
"slower ball again. Back of a length outside off, and mistimes the pull again. Comes off the bat's bottom-half and trickles away towards midwicket. The lack of pace behind that shot allows him to come back for another run"
"slower ball, on a good length. Wide outside off, and Pandey's been deceived by the pace once again. Tries to cut but the ball goes over his blade"
"back of a length outside off, and Manish makes some extra way. Opens his bat's face and slices a cut to short third man"
"overpitched wide outside off, and it's an attempted drive from Pandey. Comes off the bat's toe end but sneaks through between the umpire and non-striker. Man at long on, however"
"the batsmen must feel like this pitch can't make up its mind. To the quicks, it's fast and bounce. To the spinners, it keeps stopping. Pandey, here, all set to punch through cover, gets an inside edge back to the bowler"
adjusts better to the pace of Mujeeb and plants the ball in the gap at cover
makes him reach - an instinctive change in line as he sees Shakib backing away - and produces a miscued cut to third man
<b>beaten</b> as the offspinner gets more bounce than turn and Pandey is looking for the non-existent turn with a late cut
"another late cut, this time Pandey making sound connection as he beats the diving Sran to his left"
"leans forward and flicks a slow, tossed up delivery on off stump through straight midwicket"
full and outside off - but it's slow. So very slow. Pandey is preparing to paste it through the covers and has to adjust his shot considering the lack of pace. Single to long-off as the bat turns in his hand while making contact
"yep, have to go, have to do something. And so Shakib walks across and pulls a slow, short ball away to the long leg boundary. Really good batting. Targeted the vacant area, so reduced the risk involved"
"<b>misses a full toss</b>. Well, if there was any doubt over how hard it is to pick an Andrew Tye slower ball..."
"back to top pace, and it's a yorker too, on leg stump. Basically the worst ball to deal with as a batsman. And Shakib works it to deep square leg"
"moves back and across again, but this time, Tye does better, pitching the ball up, but not so far that it is a half-volley. With nothing to get under, and no room to work with, he mis-hits to short fine leg"
"fuil and outside off, smears it to long-on"
"follows the batsman as he makes room and as a result, Pandey can only push it to long-off for a single"
"oooh, that cuts back in sharply off the pitch. The length is such that the left-hander thinks it is ripe to cut. But with the ball spinning the wrong way, Shakib has to work overtime in pulling the shot off"
"<b>pops up</b> but it's too far away from Mujeeb, on his right, to be a chance. Beautiful bowling from the young offspinner, holding the ball back, deceiving Pandey in flight and dip."
"caught at deep midwicket! Mujeeb, who took a cricket ball to his eye, is bowling like a champion. Taking pace off the ball and preying on the pressure piling on the batsman. Shakib goes for the slog. Mistimes it badly and has to walk back"
"shifts back, gets low, and scoop-pulls to fine leg. The umpire, however, says there is no bat involved and signals wide down leg"
"goes for the late cut, and ends up taking the ball right off off stump. <b>Clooooose</b>"
drives to long-off
"carrom ball, but it's gone short and allows Pandey the room he needs to smack it to the left of long-off. The lack of pace off the pitch, however, means he has no timing"
"another carrom ball, against which Pandey comes down the track and pops out to long-off"
lobs it up tastily above Yusuf's eyeline. The batsman isn't sucked into a big shot and instead hits along the ground to long-off
spins past the long leg fielder! That's lucky for Sunrisers and Pandey's hogging it all tonight. Sweeps hard. The ball bounces right in front of the fielder and spins past his left hand
"comes in with his legbreak action, like Anil Kumble, and bowls the offbreak instead. Pandey jams his bat down on the near yorker-length ball"
right in the slot outside off and Pandey monsters it over midwicket. A-grade hitting
traps him in the crease with a good length ball on off stump
"full and on leg stump, sweeps it to long leg"
""
stays back to a flatter delivery on off stump and taps it down the pitch
"full and outside off, he lunges forward and is beaten on the outside edge. Yusuf is clearly not reading Mujeeb's variations"
"does him again! He has Yusuf reaching outside the off stump, the flight is just so darn delectable. But he just can't reach the pitch of the ball. Ends up driving with an angled face and is beaten on the outside edge"
"shapes to cut a short ball that is loath to give him any room. Even though Pandey makes a lot of his own, he doesn't get the result he wants. <b>Beaten</b>"
wide yorker to follow the mean bouncer. Pandey is not ready for this one either.
"oooh, that's the length he wants, right in his hitting arc on middle stump. But Tye saves himself some punishment with his change of pace. Pandey swings hard and gets an inside edge onto pad"
belts the length ball outside off to long-off
"<b>misfield from Ashwin</b>, but it costs only one extra run with deep point still on the boundary. Pandey doing all he can to get a decent score on the board, this time with a late cut to a knuckle ball"
"<b>dropped</b>! Again! That's Pandey's third life of the game as he takes on a slower ball, on a length on middle, and tries to launch it over midwicket. The lack of pace messes with his timing. The height the ball goes messes with the fielder Agarwal"
"starts with a carrom ball on middle and off, Pandey works it to long-on"
"backs away and cuts the legbreak to point. The throw comes in, and it's three or four feet away from the wicketkeeper and nearly results in four overthrows"
"<b>dropped</b> at deep midwicket, this time it's Tiwary, waiting on the edge of the boundary, having very little room to manoeuvre. That makes him nervous and that makes him lose it. Yusuf lives to swing across the line again"
nudges a full delivery on off stump through to long-on
"short and outside off, wallops it to sweeper cover.... <b>and do we have a run-out?</b>. Miller subbing for Mujeeb sends in a lovely throw - flat and hard and right over the stumps - but Yusuf's dive saves him"
carrom ball that skirts the wide line. Yusuf wants to pulverise it. He ends up being beaten by it. #Irony
misses a leg-stump full toss and is struck on the pad. <b>Late inswing for Tye</b>
"opens the face and launches the intended wide yorker over extra cover. <b>That's fifty</B>, off 48 balls."
clears his front leg to take care of a near-yorker on middle and leg. Single to deep midwicket
bouncer - at top pace - and Yusuf is comfortably beaten on the hook shot
straying on the pads and Yusuf deflects it away to the fine leg boundary. Rare bad ball from the death-overs specialist
"full and outside off, Yusuf clatters it back into the bowler's hands"
"back of a length and outside off, Pandey inside edges the cut into where silly point would be"
"goes wide of the crease looking for the wide yorker. It results in a full toss and Yusuf only manages an outside edge, on the bounce, to the wicketkeeper"
"goes for the bouncer as Yusuf starts to duck, then pokes the bat up like a periscope, and eventually accepts Pandey's call to get off strike so balls aren't wasted"
"the perfect yorker! It starts from wide of the crease, hones in on middle and leg, takes a detour off the front pad and knocks over middle. Top stuff from the uncapped fast bowler, who now has four wickets in the game"
sets up deep in his crease and slashes a short and wide delivery point point's head. No one in the deep to stop that.
"<B>five-for</b>, that's his career-best figures, and the best this season as well. Great work from Rajpoot, going full, going straight, giving very little leverage for the batsman. Nabi tries his best to launch it down the ground, but it only carries to long-off"
full on off stump. Rahul takes a stride forward and fends it back to Sandeep
"full outside off but swinging into his pads late. Rahul shuffles across to the off side, and pushes towards midwicket"
"good length outside off, but tailing into Rahul's pads again. Flicked off his pads to square leg and <b>loud cheers</b> as Gayle gets on strike"
full on middle and swinging across Gayle's bat. He tried to defend off the front foot after covering his off stump. Through to Saha
full on middle stump but tailing across Gayle's body again. Takes a big stride forward and taps it towards cover
"good length on leg stump, but Gayle waits for the ball to go across his body. Opens his bat's face and glanced it towards point"
"full on off stump, but no real spin this time. Defended off the front foot"
"<b>over long off</b> Full on off, and Gayle comes shimmying down the ground before lifting it over Nabi. Checks his shot, but still enough to clear the boundary"
"full on middle stump, but going down the leg side. Gayle tries to whip it behind square but it hits his pads"
"<b>falls just short of long off!</b> Fast and flat outside off, and Gayle crunches it down the ground. Was in the air for a bit. Pandey the man there"
"good length on off and Rahul goes onto the back foot. Punches it straight, and off the bat's top half. Falls just in front of Nabi and then sneaks under his body to long on"
"<b>appeal for stumped!</b> It was wide outside off, and Gayle lets it go thinking it'll go for a wide but knows fully well where his popping crease is. Slides his back leg inside the line before Saha whips the bails off"
"good length outside off, and that back-foot punch is timed well. But straight to cover"
"good length on off stump, and slightly shaping into Rahul's body. Fended off the back foot with soft hands"
"good length on the fourth-stump line, and Rahul taps it down the ground to mid off. Forced to call for the quick single, and they eventually scamper through comfortably"
"full on leg stump, and easy clipped off his pads to deep midwicket. Gayle is more than happy to walk across to the other end for a single"
"slower ball, full on middle and leg. Rahul keeps his eyes on the ball and judges the pace early. Whips it towards deep midwicket with the use of his wrists thereafter"
"full on middle stump, and Gayle check-drives to mid on. He wants the single though, and sprints across to the non-striker's end. Williamson's throw can't get the direct hit"
back of a length on off and cramping Gayle for room. Defended to mid on
"good length outside off, and the bounce gets big on Gayle. Still manages to turn it towards mid on for a quick run"
"short on off stump, and Rahul's waiting to pounce on that length. Rocks back onto the back foot and pulls over deep midwicket!"
"good length outside off, and enough width for Rahul to cut it square. Takes a step towards the leg side to make extra room, and crunches this past point thereafter"
"full on off, but Rahul walks across to the off side and sweeps this over short fine leg! Some form he's in. Got inside the line of the ball and punished it once again"
full on middle stump. Rahul goes back and pushes it to mid on. Enough time to take another single
"knuckle ball? In any case, it deviates away from the right-hander, and rather late too. Rahul is playing in front of his body, with a closed bat face, and gets a leading edge"
"shortish on and around middle, Rahul knocks it down to midwicket"
"buh-rilllllllliant cover drive! It's up there for the shot, but the put away is pure no-nonsense awesomeness. Lovely stride forward, perfectly straight bat, gorgeous timing"
"full on middle and leg, he keeps it out"
comes down the track to a slower ball and clips it through square leg
picks the change of pace and defends the 119 kph delivery in front of off stump
tucks a fuller delivery on leg stump to midwicket
"outrageous! He walks down the pitch, the bowler tops him by shortening his length, but Rahul says I'm good enough to still hit down the ground. Stands up taller, that bottom hand grips the bat tighter and he somehow gets on top of the bounce to clear mid-on"
"<b>falls short of short third man</B> as Rahul attempts another unreal shot - the late cut to a short ball angled into him. And on this occasion, even the batsman mistiming a shot doesn't help Sunrisers as Sandeep dives forward but can't get there"
"full on middle, he drills it to long-on"
spears it between short third man and point. These are not shots normally associated with Gayle. Just like he was never meant to get a century with a quick single. So you can understand Kaul going wide yorker. And then going wide-eyed
"full on off stump, Gayle looks to go big down the ground - that's more like it - but he gets an inside edge to short fine leg"
stands nice and tall over this delivery on his pads and clips it to deep midwicket. Very slick.
squares him up - if only a tiny bit - with a shortish delivery on off stump from around the wicket. Gayle blocks to point
"there it goes! High into the night sky. Up into the second tier above long-on. And all Gayle does is clear the front leg and give it the full swing. Jeez, how much power does he have?"
"bisects the fielders with a mis-hit! Luck be with Gayle-y to-niiiiight. Also, that slice off the outside edge, landing between point and deep third man <b>brings up the fifty partnership as well</b>."
a gentle little nudge to deep square leg
"full on leg stump, Gayle taps it to midwicket"
"<b>b-e-a-uty</b>! He has an in-form batsman lunging forward, reaching for the ball, unsure of how it turns. That bat may as well have been a chop stick"
hangs back and punches the googly down the ground to long-on
"all of Hyderabad roars for an lbw appeal. But this good length ball, skidding through to beat Gayle's flick originally pitched outside leg"
goes for the big wind up and slogs a fuller delivery on off stump to deep midwicket. Mistimes it though
"<b>how... what.... just... why</B>. That just should not happen! Rahul covers the stumps. He gets a good stride forward. He looks all set to defend this good-length legbreak on off stump. Except, it finds a way past the outside edge and then clatter into sticks like it was always destined to. Plays for the googly. Done in by the legbreak. Unreal bowling from the best in the business"
slices a tossed up delivery on off stump to deep point
glides a shortish delivery outside off to deep third man
"can you hear the noise?! The screams of the Sunrisers. The absolute joy in the crowd. Basil Thampi is responsible for all of it. Started the season on the bench. But here he is, taking out the Bradman of T20 cricket, with an honest to goodness super dooper bouncer. It's quick. Its from around the wicket. It comes at his chest. The pull shot malfunctions. Top edge straight up and Thampi takes the catch himself somewhere around short leg"
"works it between fine leg and long leg. And oh, there's <b>a collision between Rashid and Kaul</b>! And the legspinner is gingerly feeling his bowling shoulder. Oh dear..."
"back of a length and outside off, slices it to backward point"
smacks a shortish delivery outside off to deep third man
dabs a back of a length delivery down to deep third man
full toss wide outside off and Nair laces it through the covers

"clears the front leg and whips a quick, flat delivery on leg stump to wide long-on"
"leans into this tossed up ball on leg stump, turns it to deep square leg and pinches a couple of runs before the fielder knows what's up"
"works it off his hips to long leg, and Rashid hits the turf after being off-balance in trying to throw the ball in quickly"
"blocks a shortish delivery angled into the right-hander. He did this to Hardik Pandya and kept him quiet, refusing him any hitting room"
opens the face and slices the back of a length delivery outside off to deep third man
lifts the short of a good length ball off his hips to deep square leg
"<b>top-edges the pull</b> but he manages to evade the bowler's reach and the ball plops somewhere in front of the imaginary mid-on. Another good short ball from Kaul, rising up to the chest and giving no room to swing"
"full on middle and leg, clips it through square leg"
"goes back, thinking this short ball is a legbreak, but it nips back in and messes with his cut shot"
"looks for the pull, but the ball skids off the pitch and does not give him enough time to hit properly. Single to long-on"
"pulls to deep square leg; a rare slower, short ball from Rashid"
"loops it up, and keeps it outside off. Agarwal looks for the slap through cover and is beaten"
pitches it up and gets it to skid into the right-hander as Agarwal plays a leg glance to short fine leg
stays back and blocks the flatter delivery on middle
"long straight boundaries here, and Agarwal chooses to take them on despite not being to the pitch of this Shakib special. There's enough flight to draw the batsman forward, even out of his crease, and yet he still can't get near the ball. That little distance he has to reach forward to make contact ruins his timing. <b>Fiftieth IPL wicket for Shakib</b>"
he drives the flighted ball on off stump back to the bowler
sweeps a tossed up delivery from outside off to deep square leg
"full on middle, Finch knocks it down to long-on"
"full and outside off, drives to cover, where Williamson doesn't let it through"
"premeditates a sweep and only just pulls it off, with the bat hacking down on the ball like an axe"
beaten by the legbreak as Rashid pitches it on a good length and gets the ball to hurry off the pitch. That quick arm action again...
a touch shorter than he likes to be and that allows Nair to tap it down to long-on
goes for the sweep before the ball even comes down the pitch. Rashid adjusts by pulling his length back and offers only a single to square leg.
"<b>doesn't read the googly</b>! Ignorance is clearly not bliss, at least if you're Karun Nair and Kings XI. The poor guy gets forward to block what he thinks is a leg break and is comfortably beaten on the inside edge. Great control of length from Rashid, suddenly pushing this one fuller, and slowing the pace too."
"<b>huge appeal</b>, Rashid wants the review, Saha says high and there's a mini conference, in the end there is no review. What a beauty though. He angles the leg break into the right-hander, but doesn't let him reach the pitch. Tiwary is lunging forward, he's off balance, he's closing the bat face and is beaten on the inside edge. The ball strikes his back thigh, in line with off stump. But is it high?"
"loads up the sweep, but he's through the shot - Rassshiiiid.... his ability to change the pace in accordance to the desperation of the batsman is just unreal. The ball jumps over the top edge, lobs off the shoulder and then to slip"
sees some flight and decides it has to go. Violent swing over long-on
"taken at long-on, right on the edge of the boundary, with less than an inch leg! Pandey, you legend! Hyderabad is awake. The Kings XI are slowly falling asleep at the wheel. Finch wants another six to his name, wants to finish this off quickly, but that is a long straight boundary and even with perfect connection in the last ball, he only just cleared it"
presses forward to block a fuller delivery to the left of cover
"full and outside off, Tiwary drives to long-off"
"comes down the track to try and nudge it to midwicket. But the ball drifts in a little too much for him to make contact. Big shout for lbw, but that's shot down. Then there's indecision between the batsman over taking a single. Nerves jangling everywhere!"
turns a good length ball on middle through midwicket
walks at the bowler and taps a back of a length delivery to long-on
slower ball - the legcutter. Tiwary slices it to point and looks for a quick single. Ashwin says no
"slower ball, it loops off the bat and settles in the SRH captain's hands at short midwicket. Sunrisers are breaking out of jail <i>again</i>. Should Bhuvneshwar Kumar worry about his place in the XI now? They're making mincemeat of a top batting line-up without him. Case in point, this special little variation, having Tiwary reach in front of him for a flick shot and making the ball kick up off the pitch to ping off the high part of the bat and into safe hands"
"<B>dropped</b> by Shakib, but this is a seriously tough chance, with the ball going a mile high, swirling in the air, coming down perfectly straight, bisecting long-on (Shakib) and long-off. Big effort from the Bangladeshi, but it's in vain"
"<b>traps him in front, but Tye has reviewed</b>! It's the knuckle ball - now that's a story to tell, Tye's a legend with that variation but he doesn't pick it. Swings all across the line, feet planted in the crease. Replays says there is no bat, HawkEye says it is clipping just enough of leg stump to make it umpire's call."
"fullish and outside off, he blocks to point and says no for the run, but Ashwin pulls him through"
"back of a length, giving him absolutely no room. Sran plays half a cut shot and the ball skews out towards cover"
flat-bats a short ball to long-off
"backs away and slaps a shortish delivery to the sweeper cover, where Rashid keeps it to only one."
clears the front leg to swing hard and swing free. But the change of pace - knuckle ball - does not allow him to make contact
"and now the wicketkeeper runs out the batsman! Kings XI are pulling off a spectacular collapse. And Sran's little contribution is a toe-end slog that goes into the slips, making him believe there is a single. Ashwin knows there isn't and sends the batsman back. Meanwhile, Saha runs across, grabs the ball, takes aim and topples the stumps."
"<B>dropped</b> by Nabi at long-on! The man with a five-for wants to finish it in a blaze of glory. Takes on a hard length with a big ole slog. The ball soars up, swirls in the air, comes down into a pair of waiting hands and then pops  right back out."
"slogs again, but this time, his mis-hit saves him so much that the ball lands short of midwicket running in off the boundary"
"backs away and toe-ends the slash meant to go over the cover and watches his opposite number settle under a simple catch on the edge of the 30-yard circle. Rashid spreads his arms and soaks in the moment. Either that, or he's saying, 'yeah, this is me. Deal with it'"
<B>almost finishes it</b> as a quick leg break beats Rajpoot's swing and somehow takes pity on off stump. Allows it to stay standing
"comes down the track and swings a long hop (yep, he seems capable of bowling those too) to short fine leg"
"whoa! Reverse sweeps his countryman to the backward point boundary, taking a quick delivery on leg stump out for a night on the town!"
"another reverse sweep, another boundary, this time over short fine leg! This game's alive and kicking again. Rashid tries to keep it away from the batsman's hitting arc, bowling wide outside off. But Mujeeb's the wunderkind. So obviously he pulls off this outrageous shot"
"swings hard, swings blind, to be completely beaten. Saha fumbles behind the stumps and they sneak the bye"
"he walks right across his stumps to heave the full delivery from the wide line out to deep midwicket. <b>These nine runs, by the way, are Mujeeb's first in all T20 cricket</b>"
"slower ball, hiding it outside off, and Rajpoot only just catches up with it as he slashes it to long-off"
"stands still and tall at the crease, no sign of nerves and cuts the short ball to long-off. Gee, this is a special kid."
"<b>inside edge</b>! This game has had everything, and now this too. A trusty slog that becomes a sneaky boundary, beating Thampi"
"<b>knuckle ball misses off stump by a whisker</b>! Rajpoot goes for the six over long-on and for all the good it does, he may as well been a card board cut out of himself"
"goes for the inswinging yorker at 141 kph, Mujeeb clears the front leg to heave it through midwicket. Gets struck on the back pad and pinches a run to point"
"Base of middle Thampi seals the game! The simplest way to knock over the tailender. Go full, go straight, watch him flop around like mad and knock the stumps over. Rajpoot goes for the scoop, so he probably expected the fuller ball, just couldn't come out the right side of the gamble"
