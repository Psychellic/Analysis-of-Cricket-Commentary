"nice line and length in the channel outside off, lets it go"
"<b>trapped in front</b> but Roy reviews. That was a mighty close shout, pitched in line and nipped back in. Height may be an issue. <b>and it is going over the stumps</b>, so Roy survives.

"nips in off the seam to hit Root on the thigh pad. No appeal, going over the top and possibly down leg too"

"fuller on off, almost falls over while going across and clipping towards mid-on"

and that is what happens when you're struggling for runs. Gets one a bit short and pulls fiercely. Not perfectly timed but would have got runs if he had placed it better. But short midwicket dives to his left and saves
"finally gets one away. Length outside off, gets down low and late cuts to third man"

"good length nipping across gently, defended solidly from the crease"
"<b>just out of reach of Cummins at deep square leg</b>. Not sure Stoinis intended to bowl a short ball on leg stump given his field, but Morgan moves across and swivels to pull hard.

"length ball nipping in, jabbed towards backward point"
<b>bang</b> goes Root! Dances down the track and disdainfully pulls a short ball. Nice thwacking sound off the bat as it flies hard and straight over midwicket.
"length ball, cramping him for room, tries to cut from close to his body. Ball doesn't travel much towards short third man, no single"

"tossed up, a bit too full, allows Root to sweep to deep square leg"
"<b>caught at slip</b>. The move works, both to bring in Zampa and to have a slip for the right-hander. Nicely tossed up, Root's taking a step forward, but the ball dips before he can get to the pitch and turns just enough to take the outside edge. Smart take from Finch, to his right."

"fuller on off, driven to mid-off"
"<b>reverse swept fine</b> and he'll get a boundary. Great execution. Tossed up on off and he committed to the shot early, and got the placement right"
"<b>oh nicely done</b>. Morgan's shifted gears from 2 to 5 in the blink of an eye almost. Not that tossed up, but he gets to the pitch with a stride and uses wrists to drive over the in-field"

"slightly quicker, played into the offside on the back foot"
"length in the channel, moving away, pushes at it but beaten"

"fuller and swept hard, deep square leg cleans up"
"<b>huge shout not given</b> and Finch reviews. Great loop on this, pitches on a length on middle and turns past his forward defensive to hit him on the knee roll. <b>and it's three reds</b> so that's a fabulous review and an extremely critical wicket.

"full outside off, Rashid frees the arms and lofts over backward point for four to bring up the <strong>50 partnership!</strong> Cleared the front leg, opened the face, and chipped it behind square"
"Rashid swats awkwardly at a short ball, which beats him and flies through to Carey"
"banged in, back of a length, and Rashid swats at it, <strong>sending it over the rope for six!</strong> Didn't quite get up as he'd have liked, and Rashid cleared the front leg, hooking towards the shorter boundary. The wind carried it over Labuschagne on the rope, and it's half a dozen more!"
"length outside off, Rashid slugs in front of square and picks up four more! Looked like a slower ball, and Rashid shifted his weight forward, heaving through midwicket"
"full and wide outside off, Rashid gets it away behind square on the off side and Stoinis just about prevents the boundary. They race back for the third, and <strong>this is turning into a very expensive over!</strong>"
"slower ball on a length, punched out to the man sweeping on the cover boundary"
"slower ball on a length, Curran pulls hard in front of square on the leg side, finding the gap between midwicket and deep backward square to pick up four!"
"slower ball bouncer at the left shoulder, Curran swings at it but can't get bat on it. Gough has a long think, and belatedly calls wide"
"length outside off, pulled out towards wide long-on for a scurried two"
"hard length, banged in, and Curran top-edges the pull towards mid-on. Finch races in off the fence and throws at the bowler's end, but Rashid just about gets in"
"<strong>cleaned up this time!</strong> A vital 76-run partnership finally comes to an end. Pace on this time, slightly full of a length, and it crashes into middle and leg as Curran looks to heave over the leg side"
"length on fifth stump, slashed out to wide long-off and they race back for two"
"slower ball into the pitch, Archer swings cross-batted and sends it back over Marsh's head for four! He set himself early, anticipating the short ball, and picked the slower ball early, bludgeoning it dead-straight down the ground"
"full on middle and leg, clipped to square leg. Sloppy work from England first up, allowing the single, with Tom Curran failing to collect the ball cleanly"
"length on the stumps, moving a touch away, Finch hops into the tuck past short midwicket, but can't go past mid-on"
"full on the stumps, driven back firmly and he sets off for the single. Woakes got his hand to it and half-stopped it. Mid-off swoops in and lets fly a throw. Finch wasn't even in the frame but the ball doesn't hit the stumps. Morgan the fielder"
"back of a length moving across him, stays on the back foot and defends to short cover"
"back of a length, he rocks back to pull. Not short enough, gets an under-edge that square leg is onto quickly"
"full on the stumps, looked like Warner might have been hanging on the back foot a bit, but he gets bat in front to steer to third man's left"
ooh he has a bit of a waft at it but then pulls his bat away. Back of a length and going across him from Archer
"short and wide, Warner goes after it but only gets a toe-end to the cut. Carries over point but not enough legs to go to the boundary"
bluffs with a full straight one on middle. Finch stays beside it and drives to cover
"length ball in the channel, pushed to point"
"length ball in the channel again, tries to punch off the back-foot, mis-times to point"
"superb yorker to finish, Finch just about gets his bat down in time in front of middle stump to squirt it away towards mid-off"
"length ball, stump to stump, blocked towards mid-off"
"length on off, pushes on the back foot to mid-off. Ball goes off the end of the bat"
"too straight that time, and Warner tucks through midwicket off his pads"
<b>sharp in-cutter</b> that catches Finch on the crease. Loud appeal but probably going down. Inside edge too. Finch was rooted to his crease and trying to punch
"down the track, takes it on the half-volley and drives firmly straight past the bowler. Archer at mid-on moves to his left and tumbles to stop it. Good work"
"fuller outside off, driven - but can't beat the in-field"
"pacy ball on a length on off stump, Finch defends towards mid-off on the back foot"
"good bouncer, at 88 mph. Finch decides to go after it but he's beaten for pace. Too late on the pull and can't connect as the ball flies past"
strays on the pads and Finch tickles it fine. There's a man back there
"<b>got him again!</b> Archer has the wood on Warner. This was a scorcher at 91 mph, back of a length and moves across, has Warner poking at it in the channel. Awkward height too, with the ball near rib-cage. Takes a thin edge through to Buttler."
"back of a length outside off, pushed tentatively to point"
"back of a length, dug into the pitch but down leg, he clips it off his hips to square leg"
"full outside off, pushed to extra cover on the front foot"
"fuller on the pads, clipped but can't beat short midwicket"
"<b>stunning</b>. Where did that come from?! Down the track and Stoinis drives with a very straight bat, lofts it all the way over the bowler and the boundary line. What a hit. That's a shot that deserves a roaring audience."
"fuller on off, driven to mid-off"
"back of a length coming into him, defended back to the bowler"
"length ball coming into him, blocked back"
"length ball on the stumps, tapped towards short midwicket. Thinks about a single, but decides against it. Wisely"
"gets on top of this and beats a diving point fielder to get a boundary. Width offered outside off, and room too with it being back of length. Finch gets on top of it and cuts nicely"
"fuller and straight on middle, goes back and across to clip from in front of his pads to midwicket"
<b>Finch gets pinged on the helmet</b>. That is one heck of a quick bouncer at 91 mph and on target. Finch moving across to pull but that's too quick for him. Bangs into the top of the helmet and they'll actually get four leg-byes for it. Finch seems fine but the docs will check on him as per protocol. The helmet took the brunt of the impact.
"another shot ball that has Finch hopping. This one isn't dug in as short, and it's outside off, Finch jabs at it with bat away from body and pushes to cover"
"length ball strays down leg, flicks the thigh pad on the way to fine leg. Finch couldn't connect with his attempted glance but they'll get a leg-bye anyway"
<b>boom</b>. Finch may have been hopping against Archer but if he gets a full and wide one outside off he's not going to hang back. Lashes this through cover with a strong bottom hand
"down the track but Woakes shortens his length a tad, and Finch pushes past the bowler. Archer at mid-on in the action again, fields the ball"
"back of a length outside off, defended solidly"
"fuller and into him, stands tall and on-drives. Mid-on fields"
"length on off, stays back and punches, but can't get past cover"
"fuller, comes on the front foot to drive, gets it off the inside half of the bat to Archer at mid-on, who lets fly a rocket throw. Not at the stumps, beats the keeper too, but no overthrows."
"back of a length but on leg, rises up on his toes to clip this off the thigh pad to square leg"
"<b>outside edge</b> falls just short of backward point. Finch had no clue about that. Stuck on the back foot, and this is a length ball moving away, takes the splice and flies up. Just short"
<b>sloppy work by Bairstow at deep square leg</b>. Slips in the short one but not short enough and Finch controls his pull shot through square. Bairstow makes a mess of it running to his right.
"back of a length, pushed to cover. Quick single taken"
"<b>that is just amazing fast bowling</b> Short leg was put in place so the batsman was expecting a short one, but Archer is so quick and so accurate that he manages to get a wicket with a short ball anyway. Banged in back of a length and hisses up like a cobra towards Stoinis who is all in a tangle against that. Fends awkwardly and it takes the shoulder of the bat to loop up for an easy catch behind him. Archer's bowling with serious fire"
<b>oooh</b> this is some serious wheels by Archer. Short ball in the channel and what a ball to get first up. He has to hurriedly drop his wrists and arch his back to let this go through.
"back of a length outside off, pushed tentatively towards point"
"length on the stumps, pushed back to the bowler"
"length ball coming into him, blocked"
"back of a length, Finch was caught in two minds there and ended up a mite squared up, the edge plops down in front of him"
"fuller on off, driven to cover"
"<b>another edge doesn't carry</b>. drops well short of point. Finch is surprised by that one, bounces more off a length than he expected and takes the shoulder of the bat. He wasn't going hard at it though so it doesn't travel far"
"length outside off, chopped towards point"
"<b>shot</b> He's not stuck on the back foot due to Archer's threat and pace. Sees a short and wide one outside off and latches on, cuts it beautifully through point"
"fuller on off this time, 91 mph, and he gets his bat down in time to defend"
"another good bouncer, but dealt with well too. Rises up from back of a length outside off and he manages to get bat on top of it to pat it down towards point. They take a quick single too"
"fuller on off, Finch is hanging back but manages to stay well balanced in pushing this with soft hands towards mid-off. Goes for a quick single. Billings the fielder swooping in misses the stumps at the striker's end. Might have been curtains for Marnus. Second run-out missed by England, first one was against Finch earlier"
"another short ball outside off but Marnus dealing with those well, brings his bat down late to chop it to third man"
"fuller on the pads, turned to backward square leg"

"gets the line closer to off that time, still quite full, driven to long-off"
"tossed up very full outside off, driven fluently but straight to cover"

"length on off, punched gently to cover"
"fuller on the pads, clipped away but straight to short midwicket"

"good length outside off, left alone"
"too full and room outside off, he gets down low and slaps it through cover"
"length, pitching on middle and spinning across, he goes right back and swipes it to long-on"
straying a bit on leg and is picked off through square
"<b>under-edge goes for four</b>. Went down for a slog-sweep, gets it under the bat and it races off to the fine-leg boundary. Uh-oh, it's a no-ball because four were not inside the circle."
down the track and swipes across the line to long-off

"fuller on off, defended towards mid-off"
"length ball nipping back, stays in his crease and punches back to the bowler"

"too full, too much air given, and Finch plonks his front foot down and gets underneath the ball to loft his on-drive powerfully, bounces a bit in front of the ropes"
driven through cover
"drags it a bit short, quicker one, clipped off his pads to deep square leg"
"length outside off, bit of nibble in off the seam, and Labuschagne gloves it down towards third man. Shaped to cut, but cramped for room"
"length on fourth stump, checked drive to short extra cover"
"comes down the pitch and struck on the pad as he looks to work to leg, <strong>Curran belts out an appeal</strong> but no dice. And no review. He was a long way down, and it might have hit outside the line?"

"nagging line and length, pushed across the right-hander, who defends back to the bowler from off stump"
"bustling medium pace from tight to the stumps, and Labuschagne clips out to square leg for one"
length ball nibbling away from the off stump. Finch nudges into the covers
"back of a length, Finch latches onto the short ball and nails him in front of square for four! Too short, and not enough pace to trouble Finch, who pulls hard and sends it straight through Root at short midwicket. Fielder could have done better, I reckon"

"banged in, back of a length, and Finch jumps onto the back foot to defend. 83mph/134kph"
"very wide on the crease, Finch drops into the off side and sets off for a sharp single. Roy get round to his right from backward point, but his throw is wide of the stumps at the bowler's end, and even a direct hit might not have got him"

"sharply-spun legbreak, which turns past the bat as Labuschagne lunges forward. Brings his pace down, and rips it past the edge"
steered out to backward point on the back foot
"legbreak, whipped to backward square from outside off and they scamper back for the second, despite Bairstow getting round quickly and firing in a throw. Even a direct hit wouldn't have been enough"
"legbreak on the stumps, clipped out to square leg again but Bairstow gets there in time to stop the second, this time"
tucked off the hip for a jogged single to short fine leg

"legbreak, pushed out to cover but straight to the fielder"
"tossed up, full and straight, and <strong>Finch thumps it straight down the ground for four!</strong> Huge backlift and nailed through Rashid's hands, racing away from Billings at long-off to his right. Arguably a half-chance for the bowler, but it would have been one of the best catches of all time!"
"tosses up a sharply-spun legbreak, which turns sharply away from the bat as Finch looks to heave another boundary over long-on"
"cross-seamer which nips away from Labuschagne as he looks to work to leg. He yelps in pain as he is struck on the back thigh pad, and Archer lets out a wry smile"
"length ball on fourth stump at 85mph/137kph, which Finch bravely leaves alone. It zips just past the top of off, vindicating his decision"

"length ball on fourth stump, 88mph/141kph, and Labuschagne jams the bat down to defend with a yelp of 'no run!'"
"slower ball on a length, steered to backward point for a sharp single. Looked like a legcutter, I think"
"short ball in at the ribs, 89mph/143kph, and <strong>Finch wears one</strong> as he is late on the pull. Smashed him between the left pectoral and the biceps, and Finch swears in pain"

"length on sixth stump, Finch jumps onto the back foot to punch it straight to short cover"
"slightly back of a length, and Finch swats it down to long leg to retain the strike"

"in the slot on the stumps, pushed uppishly towards mid-off on the bounce"
"slightly full of a length on fourth stump, nudged into the covers for a quick single"
"Labuschagne shimmies over to the off side and takes a step down the pitch. Woakes drags his length back, but it sits up nicely for him and he <strong>pulls sweetly through backward square for four!</strong>"
"nudged out to square leg for one, which <strong>brings up the 100-run stand</strong> from only 128 balls. These two have put Australia in control"
"wide on the crease, bold leave from Finch as this keeps slightly low and nearly brushes his off stump! Nearly made to look very silly"
"short outside off at 87mph/141kph. Labuschagne shapes to leave, but dangles the bat in the way of the ball to steer it down to third man for one. Not sure he knew much about where that was going"
"tight to the stumps, Archer hits a length at 88mph/141kph, and Finch pushes effortlessly to deep cover"
"slower ball, full on the stumps, and dug out towards mid-on. Might have been the knuckleball, dipped in late"
"back of a length, steered through gully and down to third man for a sharp two. Rashid should probably have done better running in from the boundary, but great running from Australia yet again"
"length in the channel at 89mph/144kph, Labuschagne is late on it, and steers an awkward upper-cut over gully as he looks to withdraw the bat. Gets lucky, and it loops up to Rashid on the bounce"

"length on off stump, nudged to short extra cover"
"length outside off, pressed out to cover and they scamper through for another tight single"
"trapped on the pad, Woakes lets out a desperate appeal but Gough says no. <strong>Morgan reviews immediately</strong>. This struck both pads as he looked to work a length ball to leg, but crucially hit the front one first. No bat, Ultra-Edge confirms. Hits him in line, and would have smashed into middle two-thirds of the way up! Marnus has to trudge off, and Woakes has the breakthrough"

"<strong>gottim! Archer gets the breakthrough, Marsh chops onto his stumps!</strong> Slightly back of a length, didn't get up much at all off the surface as Marsh jammed the bat down on it, and only managed to inside-edge into the timber.

"length ball nipping in, defended from the crease"
"fuller outside off, goes to drive it, toe-ends it to short cover"
<b>cleaned him up!</b> three wickets in less than two overs and the captain's gone now. This was a length ball closer to off stump and held its line after pitching. Finch was playing inside the line and it clatters stumps.

"length on off, keeps a bit low, jams his bat down"
comes on the front foot and opens the face to steer to third man
"short fast, and into his rib cage. Maxwell wasn't even looking at it just turned around into a half-hearted pull. The ball thuds into bat. It was ball hitting bat, not bat hitting ball. 91 mph"
"length on off, defended on the front foot"
"slower one, at just 77 mph, nipping into him. Just about defended by Maxwell"
"tailing into him at 89 mph, flicks the pad and goes to short fine leg. Lots of leg-byes off Archer today"
"full, almost yorker length but solid in defence is Carey"
"and Archer ends a fantastic day with the ball with a sharply jagging in delivery that hits Carey on the thigh pad, defeating his back foot defence. Half an appeal but that was too high."
"<b>knocked him over!</b> Australia might have been mentally breathing a sigh of relief at no more Archer. If so, they forgot there's still Woakes. Very similar to how Finch got out, Maxwell just playing down the wrong line totally and loses his stumps"
"full and angling into him, straightens a bit, Cummins forward defence is more hopeful than convincing, squirts off the edge to third man"
pushed into the offside on the front foot
"full and on off, defended to cover"
"<b>edge doesn't carry to slip</b>. Pushing down the wrong line again, the ball also straightened off a length on middle. But soft hands so the ball bounces well before reaching Root at slip"

"too full, and he comes on the front foot to flick this to wide long-on"
"tossed up, ends as a full toss, but Cummins can't put it away. Patted tamely to mid-on"
big-spinning leg-break and Cummins was targetting cow corner with a big slog-sweep. Defeated completely
"plays it more carefully this time, coming forward to a tossed up delivery and gently steering towards point"

"back of a length on leg stump, takes the pads to roll towards leg gully"
"length into him to tuck him up, patted towards short midwicket"
hisses past the outside edge as Carey is caught on the crease and poking at it. Keeps bat close to body though
"back of a length angling in on off, tapped towards mid-on"
"rapped on the pads but that's going down. Angling into him, and he can't connect with the flick off his pads"
"length ball outside off, and pushed to mid-off"
"tossed up outside off, gets him to stretch forward and pat it in defence"
"teasing loop, dips and grips to turn past the hopeful forward defensive prod"
<b>boom</b>. Rashid goes too full and Cummins gets a free swing of his arms to loft this over long-on. Way over.

"length outside off, tapped through cover"
squirted away through backward point
"length outside off, opens the face to run it down to third man"
bounces a bit more than Cummins expects it to and he gets it high on the bat as it pops up. No short leg though and it lands there
"length outside off, punched to mid-off"
"back of a length outside off, cuts it to deep point. Good work by the fielder to run to his left and keep them to one run"
"<b>clatter</b> Went around the wicket and Cummins was looking to hit his way out of the building pressure, has a big swipe across the line. Gets a bottom edge that ensures the ball clatters into the stumps. Not enough room for the pull shot, but then, Cummins is not a top order batsman"
"<b>got him first ball!</b> This is all unravelling rather quickly for Australia. Length ball outside off, on a sixth or seventh stump line in fact, Starc has a waft at it, no foot movement to speak of, and gets a healthy edge that Buttler tumbles to his left and grabs."

"length ball angling into him, tries to play it with the angle, the ball trickles towards short fine leg"

"back of a length outside off, no pace or bounce to work with, his push finds the toe-end of the bat hitting ball and it not travelling very far"
"fuller on off, pushed firmly to mid-off"
"short and wide outside off, cuts it nicely through backward point. Good effort in the deep by Tom Currant to run around and cut off the boundary but the attempted relay through goes awry as he lobs it out of Morgan's reach. That allows the batsmen to take a third"
"hit on a hard length from wide of the crease around the wicket and straightening a touch, solid defence offered"
"full on off, driven on the front foot, but short cover intercepts"
"length ball nibbling in the off stump area, punches into cover"

"fuller on off, punched to point"

"swing and a miss. back of a length on the off stump and angling in, he clears his front leg to swipe across the line. Doesn't connect. The ball goes over the stumps"

"fuller and a bit too straight, clipped to mid-on's right"
"was backing away but Tom saw that and followed him, ends up inside-edging a drive towards square leg"
"length on off, tight line, bunted to mid-on"
"stepping away to make room again, but Same also follows him and he's gone so far down leg that the ball beats his outside edge while going past leg-stump line"
"and he changes up from bowling it short and into him to bowling a yorker on the fifth stump. Zampa tries to get low and get bat on it but can't. Good, smart bowling"
"length ball outside off, another big swipe across the line, takes the bottom edge off the end of the bat and bounces down"
"pops up straight in the air and Archer moves to his right at mid-off and holds it with both hands above his head. That's the end of Zampa. Was moving away again and aiming to go down the ground, too early into the shot and it just spoons up."
"inside edge onto pad off his attempted punch, but he ball goes slowly into the covers and they take a single"
backs away but Curran follows him and he can only mis-time the pull to wide long-on. Doesn't get a second
"length ball angling into him on the pads, comfortably tucked through square leg for a single"
saw him backing away and he bowls a slower ball full and wide of off. Carey ends up trying to reach for it and can't connect
"punchy drive but straight to extra cover. This was full and on middle, he made some room and connected well, but not in the gap"
"back of a length, swats a pull to wide long-on, again not well timed"
"oh he's going to take the single and keep strike. Fuller on the pads, glanced to fine leg"
"floats up a fuller ball on the stumps, flicked to short midwicket"
"slips in the short ball, Hazlewood tries o paddle-pull it and the ball misses bat but hits his body and drops at his feet. Sam rushes across in his follow through and kicks the ball onto the stumps but Carey was quick off the blocks and makes his ground"
just can't get them away. This one is dug into a length and doesn't come on to the bat as Carey shapes to slap it away. Gets it through cover but no further
"length on off, patted to long-on"
"tries to drive, but no timing, and straight back down the pitch"
keeps the strike for the next over with a single through square leg
"googly, pulled across the line out to deep backward square"
"googly again, Hazlewood keeps his eye on it and pulls unconvincingly for one through midwicket"
"brings out the reverse, jumping across towards the leg side, and laps it to Tom Curran at third man who put it down! Leaping at full stretch, gets a fingertip on it, and parries it down to third man"
"fired into the pitch, heaved out to long-on for one more"
"flat legbreak, clipped off the hip for one more to square leg"
"brings out the slog-sweep to a full ball, flat on off stump, and <strong>finally gets his first boundary!</strong> Eventually gets one out the middle, and it races away in front of square to beat Billings diving to his right at deep midwicket"
"bustling medium pace, tight to the stumps, and Hazlewood clips into the leg side from the top of off to get off strike"
"banged in on a length, punched out towards wide extra cover and they pinch a single"
"width outside the off stump, cut away in front of square to get Carey back on strike"
"back of a length, <strong>Carey gets it up over mid-off for four!</strong> Slightly too short from Curran, banged into the pitch, and Carey swung hard, cross-batted, to send it over the rope after a couple of bounces"
"bustling line and length, Carey heaves it down the ground with a grunt, but no timing. It trickles down towards long-on, and they'll pinch a second run"
"back of a length, tucked out to square leg to keep the strike"
"flat and fullish, goes for the slog-sweep, but only gets the bottom edge to short fine leg."
"<b>quick single taken</b>. Tossed up googly that Hazlewood didn't read, was trying to tickle it fine, goes into the offside"
"googly and he misses it! Clearing his front leg to sweep that into oblivion, can't get bat on it with the google floated up on off and turning away"
"<b>stumped by a mile!</b> and England have kept the series alive. The slog sweep weren't working for Carey so he shimmies down the track. Rashid bowls a third successive googly - Carey hasn't been reading them anyway - and this is out of his reach, spinning further away. Fast hands by Buttler to whip the bails off and seal the win."
