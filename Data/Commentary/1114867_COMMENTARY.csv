"fullish on off stump, blocks it to cover"
works a full delivery that <em>seems</em> to tail in just at the last second to mid-on
good finish - pitches it up on off stump and keeps it to a dot as Carey defends
"hits him on the pad, but the bowler doesn't bother appealing. Too busy getting across to the ball to see if there's a run-out chance cause he knows Weatherald had got an inside edge while he played a flick"
"<b>bowled 'im</B>! Splendid bowling, keeping it full and in line with the stumps. Carey forgets about his feet, goes for a wild swing and walks back to have a cold shower."
drives a full delivery to mid-off
opens the face to nail the overpitched delivery through the covers. Excellent shot - that's his second boundary of the night and he looks very good playing his shots
"fuller delivery outside off, he looks for the extra cover drive this time but ends up inside-edging the ball"
angles it in at middle and stump and the length is very near to a yorker as well. Weatherald manages an inside edge onto pad for a single to mid-on
sensational timing through the covers! All he does is step forward to a good length ball outside off and meet it with the full face of the bat.
"back of a length on off stump, Weatherald plonks the bottom of the bat on it and pinches a single as it wanders behind to the slips"
punches a full delivery outside off to mid-off
cramps him for room with a back of a length delivery on leg stump. Weatherald flicks around his pads a bit and doesn't get anything on it. Good on Head to pinch a single as the ball wanders into the covers
"<b>slower bouncer</b>, which Head doesn't pick up as he loads up the pull and plays it as well as the guy who yells happy new year with 3... 2.. 1 on the New Year's countdown still left"
"charges out, looking to heave the length ball away over midwicket. Gets struck on the pad"
stands up to deal with a bit of bounce and nudges the ball off his chest through to the left of deep midwicket. Risky second run but they make it
flicks a shortish delivery on off stump through to deep midwicket
"<b>slower ball again</b>! It's only 109 kph and it looks exactly like the ball that a left-hander would fancy tonking to cow corner - pitching on a length and starting just outside off, meaning he thinks he has the room to swing his arms. Problem is it's the change of pace, and the angle into the left-hander is fairly steep. Weatherald's through the shot too early and walks back to the hut"
shuffles across and flicks a full delivery from outside off through midwicket
inside edge onto pad as Head looks to drive on the up without moving his feet
"slower ball again, but this time it is read well by Head as he clips to through square leg"
"tosses it up outside off, Ingram drives to the left of cover"

"short and wide enough for Head to punch it through point, where the fielder fumbles to allow the single"

"quick and flat on middle, he works it through midwicket"
clears the front leg and swings the short ball through midwicket
<b>outside edge</b> as he looks to drive through extra cover. Seems like this ball didn't break in like the left-hander expects
nudges a flighted delivery on off stump to long-on
<b>that's the one that goes on with the arm again</b> and it's more dangerous with Ingram rushing out of his crease. Only just saves himself from a stumping
"<b>stumping appeal</b>! Swepson continues to send the ball across the left-hander, and Ingram, looking to take him on, without exactly seeing how the ball will turn, is beaten as he plays a slog sweep. Back foot is firmly grounded behind the line"
flicks a quick delivery on middle through midwicket
loops it up outside off and gets the ball to dip enough that Head is reaching awkwardly in front of his body to drive to long-off
"looks to sweep, based on the line outside leg, but the length is too full and so he gets struck on the pads"
"<B>zips through and beats him</b> as Head goes for a cut shot. The flatter, quicker delivery works nicely"
"punches it to cover, off the back foot"
"<b>does him with the wrong 'un</b>! Beautiful bowling from Yasir; he created pressure with dot balls and then throws Head a tempter, making it bob above his eyeline, angling it outside off to see if he wants to take it on. The Strikers captain goes for the sweep shot - he plays over the ball as it dips sharply and then it has a free passage onto off stump"

flicks a flatter delivery on middle through midwicket
"full toss outside leg, sweeps it to deep backward square leg"

hangs back and flicks through midwicket
"tosses it up and angles it into middle and off, Wells defends"
"makes him reach way from the body, tossing the ball up wider and getting it to dip before he is able to drive. Single through point as Wells adjusts with an open face"
"hoicks the long hop between deeps square leg and midwicket. Heat's spinners have been doing quite well, worrying batsmen about which way the ball turns. Not this time"
works a shortish delivery through to deep midwicket
"full toss outside off, Ingram drags it out to the right of deep square leg"
"looks like a flipper, well outside off, Wells cuts and gets a top edge to short third man."
smashes a loopy half-volley down the ground

works a full delivery on off stump to long-on
"walks at the new bowler, who shortens his length and only allows a single to deep square leg"
crunches a back of a length delivery to the sweeper cover
"<b>taken at short cover</b>! Wells tries to drive on the up but the short of a length ball holds in the pitch, kicks up to take the high part of the bat and sits in McCullum's hands. 'Cross-seam,' he asks the bowler after celebrating, and Gannon replies 'yeah'."
"<b>dropped</b> at long leg, and it's a fairly simple chance too, around knee-height. Steketee gets both hands on it, but it hits his palms and just pops out. Lehmann lives to swivel-pull again"
flicks a back of a length delivery through midwicket
he's stuck in the crease while defending a quick delivery on off stump
shapes to sweep a full delivery outside of. Wanders off the pad to short fine leg
"goes for the sweep straight away, but the length ball comes off the top edge and <b>strikes him on the grille</b>"
hides back in his crease even though it's a pretty full delivery - clear signs he's not reading the ball out the hand - and flicks behind square leg
"short-arm pulls it away to the left of deep midwicket. Good placement, but Strikers need to get a few boundaries away. This is a slow pitch, but they're only going at 6 an over"
"gets low to sweep - but is surprised by a 96 kph yorker outside off. He ends up plonking the bat down, desperate to get something on it"
"taken at deep square leg! It's the premeditated slog sweep again, and the good length ball gets more bounce than he bargains. Top edge lands safely in Gannon's hands. Legspin for the win"
defends a back of a length delivery to point
opens the face and guides a shortish delivery to deep third man
"<b>dropped</b> by mid-on running back. Second life of the innings for Lehmann. He goes for a big swing straight down the ground, but the length is a bit too short and it hits high on the bat.  Lalor is the man running back with the ball - it seems like he thinks he has it covered but at the last second realises he needs to leap leaps up to have a chance. Ends up fluffing it."
""
"short and outside off, he goes for the cut and is beaten by extra bounce"
smacks it back down the ground. Gets a ball in his half of the pitch and takes full toll
"goes for the sweep, but it's the googly, which spins past the bat swing. Poor stuff from the Strikers. It's sweep or nothing and so the leggies can amend their plans accordingly. Like here, Swepson slows it down and tosses it wide"
pulls a shortish delivery to deep square leg
""
looks to lash a full delivery - a quick one too - through the covers. But is beaten for pace
slog sweeps a length ball - appears to be the flipper -  to deep midwicket
"yanks a full and wide delivery with a premeditated sweep to deep square leg. Gannon is there, about 10 feet away from the boundary, he seems to have it covered and then mucks up so badly the ball trickles past his massive frame and kisses the boundary"
<b>between keeper and wide slip</b>. Good length ball outside off. Neser slogs at it and gets a thick outside edge to third man
"slower ball, just outside leg stump, at nearly a yorker length. Neser whips it to long-on"
"<b>top edge</b> over the keeper. Lehmann is surprised by a bouncer, coming up at his head a top pace. The hook shot is more reflex to protect his face"
swings a short ball away to deep square leg. The fielder has to move a decent distance to his right and he does well with a dive
nudges a back of a length delivery off his hips to deep midwicket
<b>dropped</b> by long-off running in - and it's Lalor again! He fumbled one running back earlier in the game and this time too his dive isn't enough. Neser pinches two with his front-foot loft
spreads his feet in front of the stumps and gets ready to scoop the ball over the keeper well before Lalor releases the ball. That allows the left-arm quick to deliver the slower ball well outside off and mess wit his timing. Lehmann could easily have been caught behind. That's how poor the connection is
"short and outside off, slaps it to cover"
"sends it into the second tier at deep midwicket! Big, beefy hit from Neser! And it deserves such treatment. Short, wide, hit me it screams and well..."
smashes it back down the ground to long-on! Lalor started his night with 2 for 13. Then he dropped two catches and he's now being pummeled
"full and outside off, Neser flails and misses"
waits on the slower ball outside off and cuts it to the sweeper cover
"pulls it off the front foot to deep square leg, where Swepson does well. Doesn't have too long a distance to cover, but it was hit so very hard"
"cuts to the boundary behind point. Good stuff from Lehmann, waiting on the short ball, waiting until it passes him so that he can pierce the gap"
"slower bouncer, climbing over his shoulder. Lehmann looks for the hook but he's beaten for the lack of pace"
"another slower ball, outside off, Lehmann is unable to get anything on it"
straight up and long-off <b>takes the steepler</b>! Lehmann throws his back into this big hit and the lack of pace makes him send the ball high but not long. Burns comes in off the boundary and takes a very good catch.
"full and outside off, drills it to long-off"
"walks across outside off, and so Lalor, from around the wicket, shifts his line even wider. That though means the ball hits the grass outside the strip"
"looks for the blockhole again and Neser, walking across, gets an inside edge onto the back foot and down to long leg"
"full toss outside off, Neser shuffling across misses the lash"
"over the wicket for a full delivery outside off, Neser looks for the slap through cover."
smokes the full toss into the stands at midwicket! He steps outside off again - knowing the left-armer wants to bowl wide yorkers - and gets a surprise gift
"good option - the bouncer - which catches Neser by surprise. Strikes him on the glove as he goes for the pull and he goes through for a single, not knowing where the ball is"
"six over point first ball! He has a history of hitting boundaries the moment he comes in - but this is pretty sensational. It's not far off a wide yorker but Rashid gets on one knee, reaches out to it and sends it soaring over the rope"
"caught at short third man. Looks for another huge one, this time over the leg side. But Lalor keeps bowling outside off and gets a top edge"
"slower ball outside off, he looks for a slash and misses it altogether"
swings an off-pace short ball out to deep midwicket
"full on middle, drives to mid-off"

"slapped over mid off for a couple. It was full and outside off stump, but he couldn't completely get under the ball"
"good length on middle and leg, bunted down the ground to mid off"
"backs away to the leg side and tries to slog this over the off side. Slices this full ball over point, and it falls just shy of the field. Living dangerously, Pierson"
"flat and short on middle stump, mistimed pull off the back foot to deep midwicket. Calls for the double, but they need to stick with the single"
"full ball sliding across the right hander, Pierson backs away to the leg side to make extra room, and it's smacked to the extra cover boundary"
"full on leg stump and Pierson tries to send this out of Adelaide. Not enough muscle this shot, and it has come off the toe end. Taken at mid on! There's the early breakthrough"
"tossed up full on off stump, squeezed away towards cover and point"
flatter outside off and spinning into Lynn's body. Tries to punch off the back foot but inside edge takes the ball onto his body
"tossed up full outside off and <b>it's given for caught behind!</b> Lynn looked to push at it, as the ball slid under his bat and through to Carey. Lynn cannot believe it, as replays suggest that the noise came off the bat hitting the ground. No edge, but Lynn has to make his way back for a duck!"
seems to pick the googly and he flicks it through midwicket
<b>beats the outside edge</b> as a 101 kph delivery outside off stump rips past McCullum's front foot defence. Gorgeous stuff.
"barely pulls a shortish delivery outside off to long-on. He's bowling rapid stuff, is Rashid"
"145kph, full and tailing into the right-hander, McCullum drives to mid-off"
"pace! high pace! Burns is done in by a short ball, striking him very high on the bat as he goes for a pull. The miscue goes only as far as short midwicket, where Rashid takes a sliding catch and flings the ball back up in the air. The strike force is in full force on New Year's Eve. Again"
"150kph, goes for the flick but it snicks the pad as the ball wanders down to the wicketkeeper. The ump though doesn't spot it"
blocks a shortish delivery on middle at 147 kph

hares out of his crease against a 144 kph delivery tailing into his pads. Inside edge to long leg
backs away and bunts a full toss at 151 kph right in front of middle to mid-on
"<b>through him</B>! Neser's going to be Man of the Match tonight! Full delivery, nips in off the pitch, surges through the tiniest gap between bat and pad and knocks over middle stump. Beats him for pace, it looks like. Big back lift doesn't come down in time"

flicks it off his thighs to deep square leg
"slower ball, which is gently tucked towards midwicket"
"full on off stump, pats it to short midwicket"

ducks the 148 kph bouncer
"149 kph, gets into a tangle as he deals with a full delivery angled into middle and leg. Cutting's instincts are to flick, but he's worried about the situation his team is in and he checks his shot and it goes to mid-on"
hangs back against the 146 kph short ball a shade outside off and guides it to deep third man
chops a back of a length delivery at 149 kph to point
"smacks it over mid-off, and a 147 kph thunderbolt disappears. McCullum steps to the leg side to have the room to free his arms and a full delivery allows him to hit through the line as well"
sweeps the googly between short fine leg and square leg. He has massive reach and he uses that to great effect against the leggie
"another sweep, but this time he finds square leg"
sweeps on length - with the ball just short of full - and makes sure to keep it down as well. Single to deep square leg
"nudges a full delivery to short fine leg. It's a risky single, but they make it"
power! Pure power and the sweep shot flies to the square leg boundary. He's keeping his shape well even if he is also doing the same thing the Strikers' batsmen did - sweep the legspinner every ball. No over-hitting. Slight premeditation. Course Rashid is bowling too quickly to beat batsmen in the air
"slower delivery outside off, and Cutting accounts for the lack of pace as he sweeps gently to long leg."
"111 kph, seems like a legbreak, which McCullum dabs to vacant midwicket"
"taken at point! This is the top speed delivery, but it seems to hold on the pitch a fraction. Cutting is preparing to play it down to third man. But there's a touch more bounce, it hits high on the bat and veers squarer to Ingram"
"bouncer on middle, Gannon evades it and Laughlin doesn't like the call of wide"
"glides the shortish delivery down to deep third man. Fumble from Stanlake, but it doesn't cost too much"

"back of a length and outside off, leaves it alone"

"full and outside off, drives to cover"
"there's the googly, but it is too short and scoots down the leg side. Good stuff from Carey again to get across in time"
"looks for the drive to long-off but he almost ends up bowled through the gate. McCullum comes up to talk to his partner, presumably saying to play this over out"

"googly, on middle and off, Gannon looks for the flick but gets an inside edge onto pad"

"good length ball on middle, he keeps it out"
"pushes it down leg and Carey is right there, pulling off another lovely save"
"shortish and outside off, chops to extra cover"
"skids through and hits Baz's bat quite high. Good bowling from Neser, back of a length and hurrying through off the pitch"
"strides out of his crease and hoicks it down the long-on. Lehmann takes the catch, turns around to the crowd and revs them up. The Strikers on New Year's Eve are unstoppable. So is Neser. That's his second wicket - a big one as well - after a 40 off 26 balls."
"back of a length and outside off, glides it to deep third man"
"slower short ball outside off, he pulls to deep midwicket"
"shortish on off stump, clips to deep square leg. There might have been a collision between the batsmen with Lalor missing his footing..."

"backs away to try and cut, but the ball is too slow, and too full to get anything on it"
"<b>straight up</b> and it lands safely at midwicket. The fielder was on the boundary - Head and by the time he runs in they pinch two. Solid bouncer from Siddle, beating Lalor for pace"
"direct hit from Siddle! He wraps up a good yorker, which Lalor can't touch after shuffling across outside off, by running up to field the ball, take aim at the stumps at the bowler's end and knock them over"
slower ball - dips sharply on the batsman - and Steketee almost ends up sweeping it to long leg
"a near yorker on off stump, which he skewers out to deep midwicket"
"change of pace again and the 112 kph rascal beats both batsman and keeper. Carey with the gloves has been briliant all season. But this ball bounces on the half-volley, spins away from his hands and through his legs"
""
top pace yorker - 138 kph - nails the off stump before the batsman knows what's going on. Too good. Too much
"there's the big dipping slower ball again. And Yasir, hanging deep in his crease, gets up as the ball starts above his eyeline, then crouches desperately in an effort to adjust. All to no avail"
