"134kph, good length, wide of off, he leaves this alone"
"138kph and a <strong>waft and miss!</strong> Poor shot. Full wide outswinger, feet were nowhere and he puked at it away from his body and missed it. Paine was interested in an edge but no one else went up"

flicked away to deep midwicket. Azhar growing in confidence now
defended from just outside off stump
"nice shape on that ball. Bit of turn from middle, Shan stout in defence"
"pushes Shan onto the back foot. Good, tight over from Lyon"
copy and paste. Just one from that one
"Wide of off stump and short. Nothing to trouble Azhar, who shoulders arms"
"better, this one was angling back in. Good leave, though"
pokes at one to point. Cummins needs to make Azhar play at more deliveries
"fuller, brings Azhar onto the front foot for a defensive drive"
"bouncer, but going well down legside. Azhar ducks"
"well wide of off again. Maiden over, but not too much to get excited about"
"pitched around off, Shan defends to the offside"
good bowling from Lyon. Not too short but not full enough to allow Shan to come onto the front foot
"he's getting a bit of turn, but the batsman solid in defence"
"<strong>excellent </strong>delivery. Bit quicker and fuller, but Shan not quite certain about his footwork"
"and again. Something's happening here. This one dind't quite turn and Shan nearly regretted his leave. <strong>Bit of bounce, </strong>too"
And Shan has the last laugh. Dropped this one short and Shan wastes no time in slashing this through backward point. Pakistan playing sensibly
good stump-to-stump line. Azhar blocks
"full and straight, defended on the front foot"
Cummins keeps dragging his length wide of off stump. Azhar watches it go through to Paine
"outside off again, Azhar allows it to go through"
"seamed back in slightly, Azhar can still afford not to hit it"
"thick outside edge, goes through to slips on the bounce. Another maiden from Cummins"
"fuller and straighter. No spin there, and the batsman gets a thick inside edge on it"
blocked
defended solidly
"poked at it, only getting an outside edge and prompting some exited yelping from the keeper"
lazy footwork from Shan. Stepped back but didn't quite commit to the shot. Thick inside edge onto his pad
better defensive work from the batsman. Two maidens on the trot
sharp bouncer around 140kph. Azhar spots it early and wants nothing to do with it
"short and wide, Azhar defends to the offside"
driven to mid-on
"that's the line Cummins needs to be more consistent with. Targeting top of off. Azhar is up to this one, but some of the bowling from the world's best quick has been a bit wayward"
"brilliant again. Alert leave from Azhar but if Cummins sticks to this line, he's going to make it tricky for these openers"
"prodded just wide of mid-on, and Azhar keeps the strike. <strong>First run in 18 balls</strong>"
bang on the money to start his second spell. Targets off and middle
"oooh, <strong>was there an edge</strong> there? No, but that was superb stuff. Just short of a length and absolutely reared from the surface. Azhar lucky to miss that. This is what makes the Gabba such adifficult place to bat"
"follows it up with a toe-crusher. Azhar keeps his eyes on it, just about digging it out from underneath his shoelaces. Good, absorbing cricket"
"and a <strong>glorious straight drive</strong> to follow that drama. Went a little too full with that one, and Azhar is able to get out onto his front foot and caress it back past the bowler"
"hits him on the pad. Muffled appeal, but always too high and going down leg side"
lets it go. Fascinating over
"Starc begins with a full delivery. Not quite a yorker, though that's probably what he was going for"
"what happened there? Shan flicked it smartly behind square and instinctively set off for a run, without quite realising there was a leg slip stationed there"
left alone
"good line and length. No real movement, which is where these openers have perhaps made things easier for themselves"
"short, jabbed through the onside"
good pace from Starc. Well defended. Maiden over. Australia ensuring Pakistan don't get away even if they aren't losing wickets
short. Didn't seem short enough to duck but Azhar does so anyway
dragged down legside
"Hazlewood is getting a but of movement back into the right hander. Azhar up to it, though"
"good delivery, just outside off. Azhar blocks"
"slightly further outside off, a length Azhar has happily left to all morning"
flicked off the pad for one. The legbye the only run of that over
Starc finds a bit of swing. Full delivery starting well outside off stump that comes back slightly
"shorter and straighter this time, Azhar defends to short midwicket"
fuller again from Starc. Azhar digs it out. A yorker at the stumps could be imminent
another short delivery. Azhar gets out of the way
sends that down legside
"Slightly outside off and Azhar leaves it again. Can't say he hasn't judged line well, to be fair to him"
pins Shan back with a bouncer to start off the over
"fuller, targeted at off stump. Slightly wide of it, though, and Shan decides against playing it"
deftly played through the onside. Sharp fielding from Cummins to keep it to one
blocked
nicely driven through the covers
"another good-looking drive, this time to mid-on. One off the over"
starts off with a bouncer. But even Australia's bouncers haven't been particularly well directed. Need to do better.
"full from Starc, but dragged down the legside, and Shan whips it behind square leg. <strong>Goes all the way</strong> for four"
"shorter and straighter, defended. All movement has been drained from the ball now"
"wider of off, left alone"
"targeting off stump, Shan on to ti quickly to block"
good delivery to end the over. Masood gets a thick outside edge to gully
lovely straight drive. A little more on that and it would have beaten mid-on to go all the way to four
"bouncer, but Hazlewood hasn't quite got the pace to harass Azhar, who has enough time to let it go"
"wobbled in the air slightly, but Azhar gets in a solid block"
"driven through the covers gorgeously. Pakistan bring up the 50. It's taken pretty much the entire first session, but they've done it without losing a wicket, and that is a resounding success, no matter how sluggishly you might feel they've batted"
"fuller length, punched to mid-off. Azhar is getting comfortable now"
"makes Azhar jump with that one. A little shorter and quicker, hits Azhar just about the groin."
"poked away just past gully, and the batsman come back for two"
"Starc getting the pace up now. This one over 144, straight into the body"
"short and straight, pushes Shan back"
"dragged his length down legside slightly, and Shan tucks it away to fine leg for another couple. Good batting from Pakistan, this"
defended
"full, flicked away by Shan, but short leg ensures it doesn't go for any runs. And <strong>that is lunch</strong>"
"139kph, very full tailing in, hits the pad, <strong>there's a shout for lbw,</strong> but it was going down and it runs away for an extra"

"133kph, back of a length outside off, he's squared up a touch but defends off the back foot"
"<strong>edged and it runs between second and gully</strong>. Good length, 132kph, it climbs from a length, he was forward, it caught the shoulder of the bat, but he had soft hands, it went straight down and between second and gully along the ground to the third man rope"

"<strong>just wide of short leg!</strong> 139kph, short ball into the ribs, he jumps back and fends it away off the gloves, it just loops behind square away from the diving Labuschagne who was infront of square"
"133kph, back of a length outside off, he's hanging back but defends well enough. It was tentative"
"<strong>an appeal for caught behind</strong>, not out, and no review. Back of a length, nipping in, it cut him in half as he defended and it went past the inside edge and flicked the back pocket through to Paine"
"136kph, good length wide of off, he's happy to leave"
"133kph, back of a length wide of off, it jagged away but he leaves"
"135kph, fuller, he squirts a drive off a thick outside edge behind point, this really races away over the outfield, Warner does well to haul it in"

"141kph, good length angled into off, he defends with a compact position under his eyes"
"<strong>edged straight through a vacant fourth!</strong> It was at a catchable height but only two slips are in. A nothing shot from Shan Masood. Back of a length wide of off, he prodded at it, edged it like catching practice but no one was there"
"bouncer, over leg, he ducks underneath"
"<strong>caught at second slip!</strong> Got him this time! Back of a length, angled in and climbing, Masood was uncomfortable on the back foot, working across the line, closing the face, it comes off the edge and flies to second slip and Smith pouches the catch comfortably."
"<strong>huge appeal for lbw</strong> but there was a clear inside edge. Good length, fuller, he pushes on the front foot and gets a thick edge onto pad. It was high too."
"<strong>edged and caught at first slip!</strong> Brilliant catch from Burns diving forward. Superb bowling. Again that probing length and line, on a fourth stump, Azhar has to play, it nips away this time, catches the edge near the stickers and it flies low to first slip, Burns dives forward and gets his hands underneath it. Great take."

"short outside off stump, begins with a confident cut shot"
"a snorter under the armpit, and Babar just about fends it away. He's off"
"full, wobbled in the air slightly, but Asad confidently drives through the covers."
"short and straight, Babar defends through the offside"
"disaster! <strong>catastrophe for Pakistan!</strong> Babar falls in the most un-Babar fashion you could imagine. Full and wide, and Babar launched into an expansive drive fourth ball into his innings. Got a juicy edge that flew to the slips, where Burns completed a comfortable catch"
"targeting the stumps, defended"
"expansive drive from Iftikhar. Almost looked like a T20 shot, caused a ripple of excitement among the crowd. Straight to the fielder. Is this how Iftikhar will play, then?"
"short and wide, lets it go"
"good delivery. What an over from Hazlewood. The wicket of Babar, and Australia are swarming all over Pakistan now"
lets this go
"some movement off the seam. Asad shoulders arms. He is so, so crucial to this innings now"
"gorgeously driven. Exquisite transfer of weight through his body and into the off-drive. It's a teaser for the fielder, and the batsmen run three"
"mean bouncer, and Starc follows it up with an extravagant follow-through. Iftikhar gets out of the way, but unlike some of the short stuff, this was very well-directed"
Iftikhar shoulders arms. Starc honing in on that shorter length now
"short again, Iftikhar ducks"
"short, and at the body. Blocked"
much too wide of off for any  batsmen to bother playing
"sweetly driven by Shafiq. Punched back past the bowler; it was all timing that created that shot. Perfect balance, rock-solid technique, ideal result"
"bang on off stump, defended"
"careful! Caught in two minds, there, was Asad. Not sure whether to play or leave. Did neither in the end, the ball taking the outside edge and keeping third slip interested for a while."
lovely ball to end a probing over. Just beats the outside edge
"wicket-to-wicket, straight bat from Iftikhar"
short. Starc appears to believe this is the stuff to discomfit Iftikhar. Interesting battle brewing here
"short again, watches it go by"
"finds the gap through an empty gully. Deft back foot punch, and three further runs added"
"flicked confidently away through the onside for a couple. Shafiq, and how often do we say this, looking good"
"full, but kept out"
"driven back to the bowler, slightly uppishly"
"good length, defended through the offside"
dead bat to a straight delivery
banged in short. Iftikhar is being peppered with this length right now. Gets out of the way
"<strong>driven on the up</strong>. Maybe that's why they're bowling short to him. Went fuller this time, and Iftikhar had no qualms about stepping out to greet the ball and dismiss it through cover point. One of the best shots of the day"
defends deftly to end the over
"wide outside off, Paine collects"
"copy and paste. But of extra bounce once it was past the stumps, though"
three in a row. Shafiq appears to steer clear of anything from Starc he doesn't need to play right now
"yorker length, driven to mid-off"
"came back in slightly, defended confidently"
"<strong>swing!</strong> Came back in much more sharply and beat Shafiq on the inside edge. Hits his pads, though much too high for any real excitement"
"<strong>Lyon strikes first ball!</strong> Pretty careless from the batsman. Steps out to defend in front of his body, gets a thick inside edge onto his pad, and short leg is standing to gleefully pouch the easiest catch. Soft, soft dismissal. Australia insurgent"
"nice flight, dead-batted"
and again. Rizwan keen to play much closer to his body.
"driven back to the bowler. Somewhat uppish, excitement from behind the stumps"
defended through the offside
"manages to keep it down, so Labuschagne can't get into the game. Fantastic first over post-lunch from Lyon"
"that might be the <strong>shot of the day</strong>. Bit of width on offer and he leans into another silky cover drive. Teases David Warner in the chase, but trickles over the fence"
whipped down to fine leg
leaves that one alone
punched through the offside to get himself off the mark
"mean bouncer. Rearing up sharply, and Rizwan was reduced to taking evasive action while mid-air"
"strong finish to the over. Another short ball, hits Rizwan high up on the bat"
"once again, Asad lulled into an expansive shot through the offside, and just about avoids getting a tickle on it"
nice line and pace. rizwan goes deep inside his crease and defends
"shorter, allowing the batsman to male room for himself and carve it through point. Sharp fielding on the boundary keeps it to three"
defended. Lyon is in his element now
"Loss of concentration there, somewhat. Went for a cut, lucky not to get a feather on that"
"strong back foot punch, but it goes to a fielder"
"starts off with an excellent short delivery, has Rizwan jumping inside his crease"
good-looking drive through the vacant cover-point region again
squared him up with one that threatened the stumps at pace. Just about gets his footwork right to keep it out
"drags it down legside, gets some pad on it and it races all the way to fine leg. Any runs will do for Pakistan"
sharp fielding at backward point once more. Lyon this time. Saves at least a couple of runs
thick edge down to mid-on
""
solid defence
"confident! Comes down the wicket and flicks it in the air to midwicket. Gets a single, but he's taking risks all of a sudden. Not sure it's necessary"
defended
"<strong>that's one way of easing the pressure!</strong> Gets to the pitch of the ball, makes the cleanest contact and sees it clear the long-on boundary for the first maximum of the day"
dead-bats this one sensibly. Eventful over
"short of a length, Shafiq gets that defensive block out again"
nicely directed bouncer. Shafiq gets out of the way
goes wider of the crease to change the angle and directs it at the stumps. Blocked
"back-foot punch, and the pair scamper a quick single"
"<strong>magnificent shot</strong> from Rizwan. Perfect balance, allows the ball to get right to him, and when it's just underneath his eyes, just prods at it back past the bowler"
"four more! A little more ungainly, this, but just as effective. Short ball, and Rizwan goes back in his crease and whacks it through square leg. Nice little partnership building now"
"moves out of his crease, flicked to midwicket"
straighter delivery. Shafiq stays put this time and defends it
"once more. He's playing the ball late, which is the best way to handle Lyon"
jabbed to the onside. Keeps it low
"around the wicket, and it <strong>nearly produces instant results</strong>. Shafiq lost his balance slightly, and the extra bounce nearly claimed the edge of the bat"
"defended, and that brings about as good a session as Justin Langer could have dreamed of"
"136kph, half volley on leg stump and <strong>Rizwan clips is away beautifully!</strong> Lovely shot. But a surprisingly poor delivery."
"135kph, fuller length wide of off, he pushes with hard hands and it runs <strong>through backward point and races away!</strong> Amazing timing"
"136kph, good length, top of off, he's defending from the crease to cover"
"<strong>glorious on drive!</strong> Three in the over. Over-pitched angled into off, and drives powerfully with the full face crunching it straight of mid on. Superb intent"
"138kph, short ball, chest high, he swivels on a pull and nails it straight to deep square leg"
"136kph, climbing outside off, he rides the bounce and knocks it down with his bat away from his body"
"139kph, fuller and a hint of shape back towards off, he makes a tight leave. That wasn't far away but a good leave in the end"
"135kph, good length, fourth stump line, he defends on the front foot. Lovely stride forward and plays under his eyes"
"132kph, back of a length, top of off, he's up on his toes to defend"
"<strong>edged between gully and second slip</strong>. Deep square went back, he was caught on the crease thinking it would be short, he hung back to a length ball, wafted wide of off, got an edge, it went down and through the gap"
"133kph, back of a length outside off, he stands tall and punches through point, they look for two but only get on as deep point as back"
"133kph, fuller length, angled in towards off, he defends on the front foot"

"<strong>caught behind! Oh dear!</strong> Almost a mirror image of Haris. 138kph back of a length outside off, he wafted with no footwork and he gets a thin edge to Paine. But replays show Cummins hasn't got any part of his foot behind the line! It's close but it looks like a no ball. No he's <strong>given out!

driven to cover-point

"a tad short, and cut away to cover-point again"
"that was uppish. Bit of a nothing delivery, and Asad tried to sweep it, which the length didn't allow. Nearly spooned it to mid-on"

works this away to legside and turns the strike over again
came down the track again without really middling it. Would have been an easy catch had there been a mid-on positioned

"good, hostile start. Shafiq caught on the wrong foot and poked one uppishly into the onside"
full and straight. Play and a miss from Yasir
"<strong>big appeal</strong>, this is close. Pitched on or close to leg stump, and after a long appeal, they decide against reviewing it"
"<strong>cleans him up</strong>; this is what makes Starc so lethal! Perfect yorker, right in the gap between bat and pad. Yasir tried to sort his feet out but it goes straight through the gate and clatters into middle stump. Will Starc run through the rest now?"
"<strong>big appeal for caught behind</strong>. There was a huge appeal, and in all honesty there was a sound. Paine belatedly reviews. And there's a clear nick. Shaheen is on his way! Starc is on a hat-trick"
"he had no clue, did he? Gets a thick inside edge and sets off to get a single without even looking at Asad. Asad's not interested, he'd rather have the strike instead. Who could argue with that?"
"line and length, defended. The field is all out; they're handing a single to him on a platter, as you'd expect"
driven through a vacant in-field; they don't take a run
"outside off, Shafiq leaves"
"<strong>that's a ripper</strong>. Never mind about the tail, Cummins has cleaned Shafiq up. Did the tail mess with his concentration? Just left a huge gap between bat and pad, and the ball jagged back, going right through it to rattle middle stump. Shafiq goes for a well-made 76; you'd think Australia will bat a few overs today"
defended to point
"Imran gets off the mark, and perhaps mercifully, keeps the strike. Naseem will be shielded from Starc for now"
thick inside edge onto the pad. Starc is in the mood to finish this off this over
"pushed wide of off stump, Imran prods uncertainly, missing the outside edge"
"back of a length, Imran defends fairly confidently. Think it's a bit harsh to send him in below Naseem"
driven to short extra
"clears the front leg and decides to heave at this. Beaten for bounce, with the ball sailing over his head through to Paine"
full toss. Imran gets a thick outside edge that rolls along to the slips. Naseem will have to face the music now. Cummins to bowl
"short, delivery that kicks up off the surface. Little Naseem could do about that"
"swung wildly at that one, connected with fresh air. The ball was barely in the same postcode as the swishing blade"
"yorker, and Naseem digs it out, and gets his <strong>first Test run</strong>"

"drags his length back, very close to the outside edge once more. Living on borrowed time, these two"
stellar defensive shot to conclude the over

"another wild swing, another complete miss"
"145.4 kph yorker, and Naseem digs another one out. Gets it through point and the batsmen add another useful two to the score"
short and well over the batsman's head. Umpire deems it to be a wide
another short delivery. Think Australia might genuinely be wanting to ensure they don't need to bat today.
"146.5, that. Naseem was gearing up for another bouncer, but Starc came up with a length delivery. Just about dig it out"
"144kph yorker, and <strong>Naseem tonks it straight down the ground</strong> for four. Starc yorker? No problem for the 16-year old!"
"play and a miss. Australia will, in all likelihood, not need to bat today even if the last wicket falls now"
"beats the outside edge again. That was devilishly close to the bat. Expect an increase in intensity again, since a wicket means the end of the day"
"mean short delivery, Imran gets underneath it"
beats the edge and the off-stump again. This is excellent bowling from the world's very best
"targets the stumps, the batsman gets in line behind that nicely"
"<strong>dropped!</strong> Imran finally gets an edge on one that had been due a few overs. No foot movement at all, and fourth slip appeared to be taken by surprise. The dive to the left came against the body weight of Labuschagne, and in the end he snatched at it."
"short and quick, Naseem ducks"
"and that's it. Naseem's spirited, brief resistance comes to an end. Caught on the crease, Naseem got a top edge that went straight up, allowing Starc to get underneath it and pouch the simplest of catches.

"good delivery. Bang on off stump. Warner's not inclined to take any chances, and why would he?"
"oh, there was nearly a mic-up as Warner sought that hundred. Pushed it into the offside and they absolutely sprinted the first one. Burns was ready to come back, but Warner thought with his head in a pressure moment and opted against risking it. <strong>He will sip tea on 99</strong>"

"driven back to Shaheen, who collects smartly"

"sharp swing back into the batsman. Strong appeal from Shaheen, who wants a review. Azhar isn't inclined"
"low full toss, jabbed through the onside, and that <strong>brings up his half-century</strong>. Excellent innings from a man at the top of his game. Has hit a purple patch of late, and this innings was as assured as any of the others"

shorter and he tries to guide this cut to get it fine but picks the fielder
"good length, he's caught on the crease but defends it well"
"<strong>huge appeal for caught behind</strong>, not out. They went nuts think Warner had touched this wafting at a length ball. No <strong>review</strong> after a long discussion. Nothing on RTS. Good decision. Poor shot. His feet were nowhere and he just jabbed at it"

"gets on the front foot to offer a straight, defensive bat"
"<strong>big appeal, given!</strong> Reviewed straightaway. Pitched around middle and off and the batsman appeared to play down the wrong line, getting beaten on the inside edge. Replays show a thick edge, however. <strong>This will be overturned</strong>. And it is"

"up and over, and <strong>Smith is away</strong>! Dances down the crease and just flicks it over midwicket for four"
"and <strong>he's cleaned up Smith's off stump</strong>! What happened there? landed on off, didn't even turn much. Smith tried to whip this through the onside, and just missed the ball completely. A sense of disbelief around the Gabba as Smith has a rare failure"

"good first ball. Just outside off Stump, and Wade shoulders arms"
"and again. Shaheen is trying to move it back in to the left-hander. Hasn't happened just yet, though"
"more assured front foot cover drive from Wade. Fuller delivery, too, and Wade gets him off the mark"
pulled down to midwicket. Shaheen not quite quick enough to get much bounce from the short delivery right now
short of a length outside off

defended on the front foot
pushes him back inside his crease. Wade dead-bats it
"<strong>lovely shot</strong>, this will do him the world of good. Much too full outside off, and Wade pounces on it in a flash, tonking it through extra cover"
driven to mid-off
"short and wide, angling across Labuschagne. He doesn't play it"
and again. Pakistan might prey on his nervousness as he approaches his first Test century.
driven crisply back to the bowler
"and that's it, his <strong>first Test hundred! </strong>Bit of luck with the final shot, but boy, has he deserved that! Thick outside edge that pieces the gap where Pakistan decided against having a fourth slip. He kisses the badge, embraces Wade and acknowledges the crowd and his family. Love moment"

defended to mid-on
"crisp drive back to Shaheen. Labuschagne looks very comfortable. Shaheen not really getting any movement, and not looking too menacing"
"as I say that, he draws a thick outside edge from the batsman again. Slower delivery he leant into and just bounced in front of the gully fielder. Good thinking from Shaheen"
rocks back and blocks. Maiden over
"googly, but drops it a bit short and Wade is on to it. Square cuts it and gives a couple of Pakistan fielders another draining chase. The ball wins"
"gets on the front foot, and a defensive block allows them to change ends"
"lands it outside off stump, defended"
good ball. Lands on middle and turning towards off. Big stride from Labuschagne to block

"shorter this time, allowing Labuschagne creams it through the offside"
"indecisive footwork, hits him on the pads. muffled appeal for lbw, but pitching outside leg"

"<strong>glorious shot</strong>, nearly went all the way. Came dancing down the track and effortlessly lofted it over cow corner, which was completely empty. Far too easy for Labuschagne right now"
"<strong>another boundary</strong>, this time using the pace of the ball to play it late, running it down to the third man boundary"

"too full angled into off, <strong>he clips this beautifully with the angle between midwicket and mid on!</strong> Lovely placement. Threaded the gap superbly"
<strong>And again!</strong> This whipped square of midwicket. Again too full and straight and he timed it beautifully. Lovely balance. Two gifts
"good length, fourth stump, he defends on the front foot"

"<strong>caught at second slip! Bottom edge trying to pull, onto thigh pad and it pops up to second slip!</strong> From around the wicket, not that short, back of a good length, he tried to pull and got cramped, got a little bottom edge, it hit the thigh pad and ballooned up to Asad Shafiq at second slip.

"<strong>caught at gully! Soft way to go</strong>. Labuschagne lost all concentration there. Full and wide, it tailed away a touch, he reached out to play a nothing shot and just sliced it straight to gully. He remained at the crease for a while, just in disbelief at what he had done"

"straighter on leg, he tickles this fine with control for a couple"
<strong>Given lbw!</strong> Starc has <strong>reviewed</strong>. This looked plumb live. he went back to a leg break and got hit below the knee roll. Nothing on hot spot or RTS. No bat involved. Ball tracking has it pitching in line and smashing middle and leg. Australia lose a review. Good bowling from Yasir

"tossed up outside off, he drives nicely to deep cover"
"<strong>Huge lbw appeal and given!</strong> Hazlewood <strong>reviews</strong>. Good length leg break, spinning back down the line, hit him on the shin but he did get a decent stride in. Nothing on hot spot or RTS. No bat involved. Ball tracking has it hitting the bails. It stays out. It was pitching in line, hitting in line, and hitting the bails. Umpire's call. Good decision"
stings him with a brute of a first delivery. Above the thigh pad and he's hopping around in pain. This won't be easy
"rears up from short of a length, Shan only too happy to watch this go past him"
"<strong>silky shot</strong>. On his pads, and he gets onto the front foot quickly to whip it through midwicket. Shan showing he won't be pinned back. For now, anyway"
"flicked off the hips again. This one was straying down leg side, and Shan gives it short shrift. Positive start"

wider this time and Shan lets it go. Tight first over from Cummins
"peppers Azhar with the short ball first up. Straying down leg, though"
"fuller from Starc, and closer to off stump. Azhar lets Paine collect"
carbon copy. Pakistan eager to see off the new ball for the second time in two innings
"fuller and wider, and Azhar onto it in a flash. That was 148 kph, but Azhar's eyes lit up the moment he saw width. Leant into it and just used the pace of Starc to time it for four"
"brings it back in, clatters into his pads, <strong>given!</strong>. Azhar was very indecisive about reviewing, but does. Got some swing for the first time, and beat Azhar on the inside edge. Umpire's having a look now. Fair delivery, and <strong>no inside edge</strong>. It's <strong>Umpire's Call </strong>for hitting the stumps. That means <strong>Australia have their first wicket</strong>. Pakistan on the ropes"

driven into the offside
"fuller outside off, driven to mid-off"

"fuller on off stump, tucked into the onside"
"plays it late again, and used the pace to guide it to the third man boundary. Intelligent batting."
"<strong>and gone!</strong> Carbon copy of the dismissal in the first innings. Back of a length outside off stump. Haris could have let that go but prodded at it. The ball moved ever so slightly away from him, Taking the bat's outside edge and sending back the number three"
"well, that's an easy first delivery to get. Barely landed on the pitch, it was so far down legside. Paine had to dive exaggeratedly to prevent it going for five wides"
elegant back foot punch to end another successful over for Starc
"tight, wicket-to-wicket line from Hazlewood first up"
"length ball, Shan defends"
""
"just outside off stump, Shan lets it go"

"short of a length, Asad gets on top of it"
lands it outside off. Asad shoulders arms
reached for it a little. Fuller outside off and Asad lulled into a drive. The ball cuts back in and keeps low
"gone! That's irresistible bowling! There's little you can do about that. On off stump, seaming away with a bit of extra bounce. Asad wanted to dead-bat it. It took the outside edge and flew towards Steve Smith at third slip"
good defence from Babar first up
"wide of off, Babar leaves"
"rocked on the back foot and pulled it across. I may jinx it, but Shan does look assured"
"wider of the crease, defends"
"top of off, defended"
hits him on the pads as he looks to work it away
"<strong>thick outside edge</strong>, and slips were in business. Just short of Labuschagne at fourth slip in the end"

wide down leg side
"lands it outside off, Babar wants nothing to do with it"
gets in line behind the ball
"well left. Doesn't need to play anything outside off stump, and looks like he won't"
"Shan doesn't shy away from the pull shot. Nearly hit it straight down mid-on's throat, but just about manages to get it wider"
"straighter, and Babar practices his defensive shot once more"
"good ball, just wobbling outside off. Babar knows exactly where his off stump is, so watches it through to Paine"
"wider, left alone again"
"<strong>beauty</strong>. Goes right through the gap between bat and pad, and if you can do that to Babar, you've bowled a peach. Whisker away from off stump, too"
more assured from Babar in defence this time
"nearly chopped on. Loose from Shan, but fortuitously manages to get it down to fine leg"
"flicked off the pad to fine leg. Hazlewood a little sloppy, and Babar takes him on and comes back for two"
"lovely shot to get off the mark. No one at mid-off, and the moment he had a slightly fuller ball, he timed it down the ground"
good comeback. Right on off stump

"drags it too short, and with three close-in fielders, Shan has a chance to ease the pressure by crunching one through the covers"
nice line. Tossed up slightly on middle and off. Shan solid in defence
"bug, big turn. Hit the surface and reared up. Little Shan could do there"
<strong>unplayable stuff</strong> Beats the outside edge - or does it flick the edge? - and first slip dives forward to take the catch. The umpires go upstairs to have a closer look at this. The soft signal is <strong>not out</strong>. Replays show the ball hitting the ground. Not out
"lands on middle stump, defended"
"excellent penultimate over from Lyon. Shan lucky to still be out there, in some respects"
"thick outside edge, and it goes through the gap between third slip and gully. Bit streaky, though Babar's good enough for that to have been intentional"
"wider outside off, left alone"
well bowled. angling back in and Babar almost allowed it through the gap again. Thick inside edge prevents it from sneaking through into the stumps.
"left alone. That is what Babar wants to do to the final two deliveries, if at all he can"

"<strong>beaten</strong> by another beauty! This was better, 135kph, same length, it climbs and rears away, he fends off the back foot but got nowhere near it. Babar is smiling. Can't nick those"

"bit of width on offer. Rizwan looked like he really wanted to lash out at that with a square cut, but held himself back. This is what I meant by him getting frustrated"
"and pounces on this one. Fuller ball and Rizwan has the chance to lean into a cover drive. Hasn't quite timed it well enough to go all the way, but Warner had a chase to the boundary from extra cover"

"almost yorker length just outside off stump. The pace is up, too, just over 145 kph. Babar digs it out"

"and there it is. <strong>50 for Babar Azam</strong>. Makes some amends for the poor shot selection in the first innings. Comes in fine style, too. Rocks back and just punches it through cover, sending it racing away"
Starc bounces him in response
helped along to square leg
moves onto the front foot and carves this just behind square on the offside
"very quickly spots the short length and goes back and absoutely spanks Starc to the midwicket boundary. That doesn't happen too often to Starc, and RIzwan may just have started loosening up"
blocked
gets behind it and defends
flicked to short fine
"wider of off stump, and Babar sees the opportunity to beat the man at extra cover with a nice drive. Not quite timed to perfection, and they run three"
dances down the ground but drives it straight back
"back of a length, and Rizwan slightly disappointed not to clear the man at short third"
starts with one floated up around middle and off. Driven to the onside
on the money right away. lands on off stump and it bounces and turns away. Nearly took his outside edge
Babar decides to stamp his authority. Bit of flight and room and he crunches that past cover point. Babar doesn't want to let him settle
blocked
"dragged down and Babar goes back and <strong>smacks him over mid-on</strong>. Nearly went all the way for six, that"
"defended. Interesting over, would like to see more of that"
comes down the crease to try and smother the spin. Just about got to the pitch of it
stays back and blocks it to the offside
"very sharp turn, but Rizwan still manages to slice it through the offside and get off strike"
defended
worked away through the offside
"lands on off stump, Rizwan blocks"
tossed up. needs to be straighter. Babar runs it down to extra cover
"strange shot. This was well outside off, too, and Rizwan was eager to lap-sweep it. When he saw it wasn't on, he swept it anyway, top-edging it, luckily for him into a gap"
that's bang on the money. Lands on middle and spinning
"slides this one through, Babar lets it go"
"wrong'un, cuts it away to deep point"
decides to leave that alone. That's lunch
"130kph, good length, fourth stump line, he defends from the crease half forward"
"131kph, good length, nipping back, hits him on the thigh pad, there's a stifled appeal for lbw but it's way too high"
"131kph, back of a length top of off, he defends half forward taking the bottom hand off the bat to get it to square leg"
"fuller and wider, he slices a drive slightly in the air towards point, Lyon makes a good diving stop to know it down but they get one"
"131kph, good length, top of off, he stands tall and defends"
"133kph back of a length on off, he's defending on the back foot"
"134kph, good length, he drives on the up dragging it through forward square, wasn't in control but he gets off strike"

"<strong>cracking cut shot!</strong> 137kph, short and wide, a gift for Babar, so much time to rock back and smoke it forward of point"
"137kph, good length, sixth stump line, he leaves"
"136kph, slightly fuller and tighter to off, he defends half forward pushing this to point"
"133kph, back of a length fifth stump line, he stays leg side, opens the blade and runs this nicely past gully. It came off the slice of the bat but he controlled it ok"

"132kph, good length fourth stump line, he defends from the crease, opening the face running it to gully along the ground"

"139kph, good length, he pushes on the front foot with soft hands to the gap at cover and calls decisively"

"139kph, good length, angled into the top of middle and off, he defends from the crease"
"<strong>huge lbw appeal</strong>, given not out. The Australians deliberate and <strong>review</strong>. Height the issue here. Good length nipping back, it beat the inside edge and hit the top of the knee roll on the crease. There's nothing on hot spot or RTS. No bat. Umpire's call, with hawkeye having it clipping the bails! Everything was right but it was umpire's call. Babar survives. Australia keep the review. That was very tight"

"137kph, good length outside off, he defends with soft hands to cover and pinches a single"

"133kph, fuller and too straight and he glances neatly to fine leg"
"135kph, chest high bouncer, he pulls forward of square, not timed perfectly but hit well to deep square"
<strong>short and wide and smacked!</strong> Superb. Bad ball from Hazlewood and Babar can play these in his sleep. He thrashes it to the cover-point rope

"tossed higher, he leans out to smother it"
"flatter on off, he defends on the front foot"

"140kph back of a length on leg, he's back and tucking this to forward square"

"138kph, shorter length, into the ribs, he jumps up again but has to knock this down"

"139kph, bouncer over leg stump, he ducks under it easily"
"climbing short ball, 135kph, on off, he has to rise on his toes to knock it down"
"135kph short ball and <strong>it's met with a superb pull shot!</strong> Only chest high, he was back and waiting, rolling the wrists and thumping it forward of square"

blocked
kept a little low
nicely defended
backfoot punch to short cover
solid defence
whipped to square leg and the strike turns over to Rizwan again
bouncer. Rizwan gets under
lands it just outside off stump. Rizwan defends with conviction
"back of a length, fended to backward point"
"wide, and Rizwan reached out for it a little. Was well outside his natural hitting zone, and almost lost control of it. Was in the air for a while, but there was no short cover"
"well-directed bouncer at Rizwan, and he <strong>nearly paid the price </strong>for flashing at it. Looked to get it up and over the keeper, was lucky he didn't get anything on it"
full on off stump. Driven to short extra
bit of extra turn. Thick inside edge
"quicker, Babar blocks. Labuschagne's having a bit of a sledge from short leg"
blocked
comes down the crease and works it down to long-on
"nearly nicked off again. Short and spinning back in, Rizwan looked to run it down to third man, but was beaten by the extra bounce"
"fended it away from his left shoulder, and gets Rizwan on strike. This'll be interesting"
"bouncer. Much, much too high. Lucky to get away without it being called a wide"
"back of a length, punched through the offside"
"another bouncer. Rizwan looks across suggestively at the umpire, but doesn't get anything"
gloriously pulled away. One leg in the air and he leathers it away to square leg. Great effort on the boundary from Starc to save the boundary
another bouncer. Exciting cricket now
"comes down the crease only to drive straight back at Lyon. Has to scurry back hastily, though"
single to mid-off
Rizwan dead-bats it
elegantly worked down to long-on
defended
"and <strong>the wicket finally comes</strong>. Babar rocked back and tried to drive through the covers, , but just played own the wrong line, got a thick outside edge, and Paine did the rest. Australia had been coming close to a wicket, though you would have thought Rizwan was more at threat."
"bouncer to Rizwan to kick off. He looks across again, hoping for a wide"
and another one. He has a chat with Labuschagne at fine leg. I'm sure the Australian's giving him the best advice he can get
"three in a row. Rizwan wanted this called a no-ball, I believe, for being the third bouncer on the trot. The umpire didn't, and that's what matters"
cutting back in to Rizwan. Goes back and defends
nicely driven off the front foot. Straight to extra cover though
"exquisitely cut away past backward point. Wasn't even that short, but Rizwan's footwork was good enough to use the pace of Cummins and get this past the man stationed there"
dragged wide down leg side
"short of a length, Yasir manages to get on top of it and keep it down. I'd like to see a silly point for him, personally"
"guided down to fine leg, and that's him off the mark"
"bouncer. Rizwan's getting peppered now, but appears to be dealing with it reasonably well"
block and run from Rizwan. They scamper through. Direct hit from Wade at short cover might have made it interesting
"big appeal. Seemed to be going down legside with the angle Starc was operating, and Australia opt against reviewing"
"big shout again. That struck him below the knee roll, and looked fairly straight, but umpire says not out. Replays show a <strong>thick inside edge</strong>. Good call"
"length ball on off, Yasir defends"
"expansive drive behind backward point, and Yasir <strong>has his first boundary</strong>. Opened the face of the bat and used the pace of the delivery"
nasty bouncer. Yasir gets out of the way
defended
helped down to the onside. Yasir keeps the strike
hits Yasir just above the groin. Have a feeling this'll be a testing over for the leggie
that's one way to avoid that; get to the other end. Flicked away to the onside
"back of a length, defended"
nicely timed off the back foot. Rizwan looks <strong>so</strong> good when hitting through that region
"slightly less classical, but the cross batted swipe to Starc gets him a single to square leg"
"drags this down legside. Was 148kph, but the pace only meant Paine could help it along to the boundary for byes"
"short of a length. Rizwan tried to work it down to midwicket, but the low bounce meant he only got a bottom edge"
"fuller and straighter, driven to mid-off"
driven back to the bowler
"landed around off stump, worked away for one through the offside"
defended
full outside off. Just the one from that over
"gorgeous. <strong>Shot of the session </strong>for me. Comes down the crease and guides it past extra cover. Balance, footwork, timing all spotless"
gets carried away slightly. Came down again and was done by the turn. Lucky to get a thick edge on it
defended
swept with authority
driven down the ground
opens the face and gets one on the offside
begins with a long hop. Yasir goes back into his crease and deposits him to cow corner
"another one dragged down. Yasir goes for the same area, but just gets a couple this time"
"full toss this time, and driven to long-off"
"another short ball, and Rizwan pulls it away to long-on. This hasn't quite worked out for Australia. Poor over from Marnus"
eased to deep backward square
quick single back to the bowler. 13 off that Labuschagne over
sweeps it
driven back to the bowler
"looked to sweep it, got nowhere near timing it. Hit the bottom of the bat and nearly had silly point in business"
blocked
"defended, just keeps it away from short leg's reach"
solid in defence again. And <strong>that is tea</strong>
"84kph, leg break from around the wicket, he stretches out to defend"
"full toss, he swipes this hard through midwicket to the sweeper"

"leg break on leg, he defends with soft hands to cover-point for one"

"<strong>excellent sweep past short fine!</strong> It was pitched outside leg, fine leg is up and deep square back, he roped it powerfully behind square past short fine to the rope"

"shorter outside off, he's back and knocking this to point"
"flatter on off, he defends to silly mid off"
"<strong>slog sweep over midwicket!</strong> Tossed up outside off, he reached out and slapped it flat over midwicket. The man back is behind square"

"skips down the track, and works it back to the bowler"
"flatter on off, he defends on the front foot to cover"
"fuller outside off, he drives nicely against the turn to the gap at cover"

"angled into middle, he defends on the front foot to midwicket"
"angled down leg, he tickles this fine, they could have pushed for two but they only run one"
"<strong>Has Labuschagne taken an extraordinary catch?</strong> Umpires send it upstairs. Soft signal is out! Rizwan went to paddle sweep, it popped up off the glove and went behind the keeper, Labuschagne ran from short leg, Smith from slip, they both dive and Labuschagne comes up with it. But the ball just touches the ground as he catches it in the one hand. Not out is the call from the third umpire."

"137kph, good length on off, he defends unconventionally, knocking it into the leg side"
"135kph, back of a length, on middle, he is back and working this to midwicket"
"<strong>Oh no! Holes out at deep backward point!</strong> Just got sucked into a trap. Short and wide outside off, he has played the upper cut well in this innings but there's a man placed at deep backward point and he hit it straight to him! Easy catch for Lyon"

"back of a length on off, he's back and hurried in defence"
"<strong>top edge over the keeper!</strong> 136kph, short ball, he tried to ride it and work it behind square, top edge flies high and safely over the keeper, Paine sprints back to dive and save four!"
"134kph, short ball, <strong>he clears the left leg and smears this wide of mid on!</strong> Wow! Yasir having some fun. that was smoked."
"<strong>waft and miss</strong> at a 135kph, length ball wide of off. He shuffled around pre delivery and missed it by some way"
