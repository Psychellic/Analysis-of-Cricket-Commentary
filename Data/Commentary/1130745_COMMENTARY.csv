hangs back again and pats a flatter delivery outside off to cover
"<b>past slip</b>! Beautiful work from Mehidy, tossing the ball up, getting it to drift away at the very last possible moment, leaving the batsman stranded as he lunges forward to block the original line of the ball."
hacks a shortish delivery to deep midwicket; the pull shot is more a short-arm jab because he doesn't have too much room
"lovely bowling - he angles it onto off stump from around the wicket. The length is full. It draws the new batsman forward, and Karunaratne is rather reluctant to do so. Defends well enough though"
firm push into the covers as he steps towards the flight of the ball on off stump
"there's that constricting line, from around the wicket, angled into the right-hander, off a shortish length. Mendis tries to cut but can't get proper timing"
defends a good length ball on off stump
slides back in his crease and presents the full face with aplomb
"hammers it to the midwicket boundary. Picks the length up quickly and shovels the ball over the infield; it's not a full-blooded pull. More a lift, with a desire to unsettle the comeback man"

fetches a <b>leading edge</b> as Mendis closes the face of the bat to a ball on leg stump a touch too early
defends in line with middle stump as the new ball skids through with the angle
"a smidge of spin on offer, and it's all the more potent considering Mehidy's line, angling into off stump."

"Karunaratne invests in a longer stride to handle the turn, and he does it very well"

"draws him forward with his flight, but Mendis is capable enough to blunt its threat"
"87kph, goes back to block a quicker delivery on middle"
"pushes a flighted delivery on off stump towards mid-off and pinches a quick single - good stuff from Karunarante, he spots Taijul Islam hanging on his heels, and in his rush to get to the ball, <b>he slips on the outfield</b> and may well have hurt his side. He chooses to stay on the field though."
"lovely work with the wrists, letting the shortish ball come to him so that he can play close to his body and deflect it to the right of short leg"
goes back to a good length ball and defends
draws him forward but Mendis has it well covered
a flick off middle stump but Bangladesh have set a good field for Mehidy to attack the stumps
"<b>does him in</b> and Razzak is on the board after four years in the wilderness. Big smile from the veteran as he angles the ball into the left-hander, and it keeps drifting, making him panic, especially seeing as he's down the pitch. A hasty flick comes out, but by that time the ball has danced past the inside edge, spins through his legs and Liton Das behind the stumps does the rest"
good length ball - a fairly quick one - and Dhananjaya calmly gets forward to meet it
"<b>drift again</b>, and Dhananjaya manages only an inside edge as gets forward to block"

blocks it like he's in Lego Land
"good length ball outside off, lets it come onto his bat and glides it to point"
"<b>misfield</b> at long leg, which is in some ways fair considering Mehidy bowls short and down the leg side. Pulls it away"
spectacularly hit over midwicket. It's short. It sits up and it's unceremoniously smashed
"<b>catch it</b> the cry, and it only just evades Kayes as he runs and dives to his left. Mehidy was so close to the perfect ball - pitching it on a good length and yet confusing the batsman, who does not know whether he has to go forward or back. Eventually Mendis plays from the crease, gets a thick inside edge and survives"
"<b>puff of dust</b> as Dhananjaya plays back, tries to flick and is struck on the pads"
"<b>straightens</b> and there's a mini-explosion from the pitch again. Poor Dhananjaya. He comes searching for the ball, and is left clueless as it zips past the outside edge"

"<b>outside edge</b> but Mendis controls it well, playing late and close to his body"
"a few to many short balls, in between a few jaffas, and Sri Lanka have whacked all of them away. A basic pull shot would do here and Mendis knows that"

"opens the face, as he makes room on leg stump, and pushes the flatter delivery through cover"
positions himself in front of all three stumps - he's almost standing on top of them - and blocks
"short-arm pull as he heaves the ball away to deep square leg. The length is only just short. The line doesn't do him any favours, cramping him from freeing the arms. So he uses his wrists to get the power he is denied"
"rocks back and carves the flatter, quicker delivery outside off through point."
he's across on off stump this time and with the ball drifting into him he has to be quite careful about bringing the bat down straight lest he gets struck in front
whip-pulls it between square leg and midwicket on the boundary. Sensational connection on a ball that seemed to quicken up off the pitch. Amazing strokeplay from Mendis this morning
that's outstanding work! He spent the last over hiding in his crease. Here he races forward like a happy puppy at the sight of its owner and launches a perfectly good length ball into the striaight boundary

it's short even from the new bowler and Dhananjaya hits it sweetly to deep point

<B>slider</b> coming in with the arm and Dhananjaya is able to handle the threat using quick hands and a straight bat

"pitches it up on middle and off, Mendis lets it go after covering his sticks"
shuffles across and leaves the ball outside off
"goes full on off stump, Mendis pushes it to mid-off"
"<b>beautiful cricket</b>! He turns another good delivery into a gimme ball, charging down the pitch, giving the bowler no indication of those nefarious intentions. And then it's all about the shot - a graceful lift over cover."
"steps out again, but this time Taijul does his bit to cramp the batsman and makes sure he hits it to mid-off"
quicker and flatter and Dhananjaya slices it to point
ventures out of his crease again and is met with a rapid delivery on middle. Defends it well
<b>fiiiiieeerrrrce</b>! How can a spinner toss the ball up when he's being treated like this? Dhananjaya skips out of his crease and majestically launches it over the straight boundary.

runs a back of a length delivery towards point
"the sucker ball - he's ever so good at it too, danging it full and wide but not too wide - Mendis isn't quite seduced by its wiles"

"pushes at it from the crease, and again despite that he isn't in too much trouble. Keeps the ball down as it goes to cover"
"good length, outside off, no hsot"
"short ball, but it comes off ever so slowly off the pitch. So much that Dhananjaya has to delay his pull shot and then roll his wrists to make sure it goes straight down and then to square leg"
"<b>cutter</b> and it squares up the right-hander. Nevertheless, Mendis knocks it down by his feet and goes to take a well earned drink"
"back of a length on off, shifts back and punches towards mid-off"
"extra turn and bounce, rips away from a length and gets big on him after drawing him forward. Manages to keep it out with control into the off side"
"ah, this is lovely bowling. More of this. A length ball, sliding so sharply into middle and drawing him forward. He pushes forward and the ball shaves the outside edge with turn and bounce"

"fuller, crunches a drive towards mid-off"
"full and slid in on middle and leg, blocked down the pitch"
gives him the charge and gets right to the pitch before pummeling this to the left of the bowler. The bat turns in his hands and as a result the ball stays along the ground. The bowler gets a bit of a hand to it as he gets down but the ball only deflects towards the mid-on region and carries to the boundary nevertheless
pushed into the off side

"similar line and length, puts his head down and blocks"
"full, sliding on middle, defended"
"just short of good length, forcing him back with pace as he defends into the off side"

"back of a length, very loopy, turns away slightly but just enough to beat the outside edge and miss off-stump"
"fuller outside off, driven into the covers"

"back of a length, stays back and sticks the bat out to drop it to point"
"another sweep, this time from around middle and off and behind square"
"that's a lousy shot, really. Why would you be playing that kind of a shot after getting your eye in on this kind of a track? Rocks on to the backfoot and dares to clear mid-off with a slap. Chips it straight over the fielder's head and he takes it comfortably with his hands reverse-cupped"
"oh, what a delivery! That's a top delivery. Straight through the defences of Chandimal. Loopy sliding length ball, lots of revs on the delivery, draws Chandimal forward and gets it to rip away past the outside edge to flatten his off stump. Razzak - what a comeback into Test cricket he's having! On a hat-trick now"

"short of a length, turns away outside off, punched off the backfoot into the covers"
"<b>has he taken it?</b> Sabbir at first slip seems to suggest he has hit the surface. The umpires have referred this upstairs. Soft signal is not out. Ah, that has clearly bounced short.

"too short and Mendis latches onto it without remorse, rocking back and pulling the ball away furiously"
"<b>what a rippah</b>! It's the length that traps Mendis. He has to come forward to it, but Razzak does not let him get anywhere near the pitch. That means the batsman has to predict how much it will turn. Mendis underestimates as he tries to defend. And the ball skips past the outside edge to crash into the off stump"
keeps to his crease to defend a good length ball
"excellent cricket, hurrying out of his crease to meet the flighted ball on the full and tapping it to mid-on"
makes sure to press forth to the pitch of the ball and smother it on middle stump
shapes to advance but then remembers he shouldn't take too much risks with his team already five down. Blocks off the front foot
<b>keeps low</b>! There's puffs of dust. There's stumps taking a battering. There's Sri Lankan batsmen trudging back shaking their heads every other minute. The chaos starts with Dickwella premeditating a move down the pitch. Taijul pulls his length back and pushes it through quicker. Then the pitch lends him a helping hand as the ball sneaks under the bat

nudges a full delivery on middle through midwicket
"he's been stoic with his defence all this time but the moment he sees a short ball, he rocks back and hammers it through cover point"
"sneaks a full delivery down leg. Silva looks for a leg glance, playing as close to his body as he could, and that's why he misses"
"tosses it up nicely, and so long as the ball is in the air, the batsman is in the wars. He knows he will have very little time to adjust to whatever happens off the pitch. Silva defends hurriedly"

gets forward to defend a good length ball on off stump. It skirts off the outside edge to deep third man

nudges it off his pads again to square leg
works it off leg stump to deep midwicket
stays back to a fairly full delivery and so has to hurry into defending the ball on leg stump

"full on middle and off, defends"
"that's the arm ball - and Silva kills all the threat it poses with such a gentle touch. He's on middle stump, the front foot taking a cursory trip down the pitch. Then he watches - ever so closely - as the ball comes down on middle and then turns into him. His heightened concentration allows him to adjust and meet the ball almost casually"

"full and outside off, spears it through cover"
rocks back to the flatter ball outside off and whips it through midwicket
"the bat is safely tucked behind his front pad as he lets a good length ball go outside off. Then he seems to be asking for some help from the dressing room, pointing at his left shoulder. They physio is out there, checking on his range of movement. Impromptu check up done. He's good to continue"

"looms over the full delivery on middle, waits for it to reach him, and as soon as it does, he whips it straight of midwicket"

"short one again, perfectly directed, climbing up to Dilruwan's chest. But the batsman does equally well, pulling his bottom hand off the bat and running the ball gently to gully"
"short on off stump, and then keeps low. But the lack of pace off the pitch, and Silva's determination to play as late as possible helps him spirit it away behind square leg"
"slides into the pads and Dilruwan sends it away deftly to the long leg boundary. Minimum effort, maximum reward"

"pins him in front of middle and leg, and given. Dilruwan asks for a review. Looped up on middle, Perera comes forward to defend and he has got a massive inside edge onto the pad. But that only rules out the leg before because the ball has been caught at silly point. That's a horrific review. Dilruwan was asking the non-striker if it was caught before referring it to the third umpire. Wicket lost and review lost"

"oh, shot! A very full delivery on the fourth or fifth-stump channel, Dananjaya carves out a drive right along the ground through the right of the cover fielder who chases it down"
"short of good length on off, gets on top and flicks to midwicket"
"ah, cuts in off the seam and misses everything - the inside edge, stumps and the keeper diving tohis right. Just grazes the left elbow as he pushes forward. That was the cutter and he was into the shot early"
<b>Appeal for leg before</b>. Where was the impact? And was there an inside edge? Another cutter that cuts in off the seam and hits him in front of middle. Huge inside edge

"fires it in on middle, Roshen turns it to short midwicket"
"<b>beats him</b> on the outside edge as Taijul slows it down, tosses it up, doesn't let Roshen get to the pitch and therefore gives himself the best chance of deceiving the batsman"

"quicker and flatter on off stump, blocks"
"looks for the single after nudging the good length ball on middle to midwicket, but he's sent back and rightly so"
"spoons a catch to short cover! The ghost of the bouncer traps Herath on the crease, when he really should have been going forward. Simple catching practice for Mushfiqur as the batsman throws his hands at a full delivery outside off"

too wide outside off to draw a shot

"gets out of his crease, but Taijul cramps him with his line and the block to cover doesn't fetch the desired result"
spears the full delivery outside off through cover
"full on off stump, handles it easily"
"too short, too wide and Roshen stands tall to flay it to the right of the man at deep point. Splendid connection. Batsmen concentrating on defence as hard as he has been can sometimes miss out on such opportunities. Not him"
"realises the threat of Mustafizur when he comes around the wicket and aims at off stump - he gets the ball to straighten and secure the outside edge - so Roshen plays with soft hands and as late as possible. The result, a firm block off the middle"
back over the wicket now and a full delivery outside off is sent to cover
looks to lash an overpitched delivery outside off through cover - a shot he possibly wouldn't have played if not for the No. 11 at the other end - and is beaten
"a shade short, but not quite wide enough for the cut, which is why Lakmal mistimes the shot to cover"
comes ever so slowly off the pitch and in that time Lakmal positions himself on off stump to whip the shortish delivery away to deep midwicket
"<b>appeal for caught behind</b> and he's gone. A rippah to end the innings as Roshen. coming forward to defend what he thinks is a simple good length ball, suddenly spits up off the pitch, bounce so sharply that it takes a bit of the top glove through to the keeper"
start off with a fuller length delivery outside off that Tamim strides forward to and drives into the off side
"full, outside off, Tamim drills it down the ground. The bat face turns in his hands as he meets the pitch and he sends it along the ground through long-on"
"oh, gone! Tamim Iqbal's chipped a tame return catch and the crowd's gone silent. Tamim pays the price for being half-forward. That means he has to stretch out for his drive and he ends up chipping it from an awkward position. Lakmal gets down to his right on the follow through and snaffles it one-handed"
"short of good length, angled across the fourth or fifth-stump channel, shuffles across and shoulders arms"
"short of good length, angled across just outside off, Tamim is sure of his off-stump and lets it go"
"similar angle and length but slightly wider this time, no shot offered again"
"flighted outside off and just a little bit of turn outside off, pushed into the off side off the front foot"
"full and tight on off, puts his head down and bunts it out"
"looped up outside off, inviting the drive and he crunches it to mid-off. They set off for the single and the non-striker is pretty much jogging the single. Completely overlooks the throw from the fielder at the keeper's end. But, hang on, it only gets worse. Turns out he's covered decent ground and is nearly there. All he had to do was stretch forward and ground his bat. But he's limping forward with the bat in the air, holding it like a flag, making possible a run out that never should have happened. This is atrociously shoddy"
"pitched up outside off, drilled to mid-on"
"lots of flight outside off, plants the front foot forward and gets pinned on the pad. Impact well outside off"
"full on the stumps, crunched to mid-on"
"short of a length, angled across at 131 kmph, shuffles across and offers no shot"
"short of good length on middle, stands tall in the crease and check his whip, stays in the air momentarily but lands well short of the bowler"
"good length, angled across in the corridor of uncertainty, that could be very tempting. This is left alone but it's good bowling"
"<b>keeps low</b>. Short of a length, refuses to get up above shin height, he can't make any contact whatsoever as he plays at it from the crease"
"just back of a length in that channel outside off, Imrul shoulders arms"
"short of good length, cuts in to tuck him up and finds the inside edge as he punches off the backfoot"
"flighted outside off, draws him forward like a magnet and he drills it back to the bowler"
"<b>was that dropped?</b>. This is hilarious. Was there an edge? Could be, judging by their reaction. Looped up outside off and spinning in. Ah, seems like it has missed the bat and beaten the inside edge before lobbing in the air off the pad. Keeper and short leg excitedly run towards it. The former goes at it clumsily with reverse-cupped hands. He drops and short leg can't get his hands around the deflection"

lobs off the pad to short leg who takes it above his head as it spins in sharply to him

"length ball, holds its line on the fifth-stump channel, no shot offered"

"short ball, ducked under easily and the bounce is too much"
"<b>ah, misses again, as close as the last one</b>. Shorter in length, again it cuts into him prodigiously and nearly, nearly shaves off-stump"
"a lot fuller inswinging delivery, negotiates it with a straight bat"
"clearly, he hasn't learned anything from the previous two instances. He has seen how far Lakmal is getting his deliveries to come into the batsman and still dares to shoulder arms. It was just short of a good length, but this time, the bounce is just enough to clatter into off-stump. At the very least, he needed to shuffle across to protect his stumps but he fails to do that too. Add the dropped catch, too, and you can't get any more lucky than that"
"really full outside off, bunted on the front foot"
stays back to a fullish length ball and punches through the covers

"oh, shot! Against the run of play, a glorious cover-drive from Imrul that pierces the cover field like a laser. At long last, something to offset the madness that has been this innings so far"

"short of a length on middle, shuffles across and keeps it out"
"short of a length, angled into him and holds its line just outside off, sticks his bat out and gets beaten"

"defends a full delivery outside off back to the bowler. However, he intended to close the face and perhaps pick up a single to midwicket"

"<n>got him at slip!</b> Mahmudullah's haphazard approach against spin gets him out for the second time in the Test. Premeditates and steps out early. Akila pushes it flat, gets it to dip just back of a length and has the Bangladesh captain scrambling to try and get behind the line with anything he can. But his front leg has to go too far across and the weight hasn't moved forward. Beaten in flight and stuck - you don't get away at this level. Can only manage to follow it with his hands and parry it to Karunaratne"
