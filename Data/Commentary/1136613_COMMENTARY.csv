"slows it down nicely, tossed up on middle, Tripathi lunges forward and blocks"

"skiddy bouncer, Archer is late on the pull, toe-ends it to midwicket"
stands tall and punches this length ball to point
"he's gloved this down leg, so the move hasn't worked. Archer swivels back to pull but is cramped for room as the ball angles back in, faint little edge through to Parthiv. Fourth duck of the season for Jofra."
gets half a stride in as he defends this length ball to point
"<strong>beaten by a beautiful away-swinger!</strong> Leans to drive, no feet and simply goes through with hard hands, done in by late swing. Zips through to the keeper."
"touch short, he rocks back and pulls to AB at deep midwicket"
"turns this gently towards the man coming in from mid-on, aggressive running. Misfield from Chahal"
"drifts in a quicker delivery on middle and leg, eased to long on"
"gets outside the line of the stumps and sweeps this with the spin over deep backward square leg. The big stride was the key, neatly executed."
"sharp turn from length outside off, defended back"
"goes through him! Sharp turn to beat the inside edge and hit the pad. Big appeal from Parthiv, nearly four appeals. Moeen joined in late. May have been missing leg stump. <strong>RCB don't review</strong> Moeen hinted to Kohli that it may have gone down leg."
punched straight to point
Lovely timing! Opened the bat face late to ease this behind point. Pure timing
right behind the line of the length ball as he defends.
"right in the slot, thumped over the bowler's head. No chance for mid-on. Lovely followthrough as he picked the length up"
"pulled, but not in control. Gets this wide of mid-on"
"short-arm jab, gets it up and over midwicket. This kept a touch low but the timing was superb. Fetched the pull from outside off."
"whipped superbly. Beats deep square leg. Lovely wrist work. Just a touch short from Southee, Rahane used the depth of the crease superbly to put that away."
"slower length ball on off, worked across to square leg"
"looks to biff this pull, no timing and just manages to get it into the gap at midwicket. Hit the top part of the bat"

uses the inwards angle to turn around and guide it to backward square leg
"back of a length outside off, opens the face to third man"
gets an under-edge that nearly finds the stumps. Too much bounce outside off for him comfort and he can't et on top of it as he tries to pull
crunches this length ball to cover where AB dives and saves it
"short and wide, slapped to sweeper cover"
"good length outside off, opens the face to third man"
pushes forward early and chips a punch to a length ball that nearly carries to backward point

"shortish outside off, opens the face to third man"
sprays it down the leg side and gets past the attempted glance
"fuller ball outside off, slower in pace, and he mistimes the whip between midwicket and long-on. Kohli and Southee converge and Kohli slides and picks it up"
slid down the leg side again. Poor from de grandhomme
"full and straight on off, crunches a drive to long-off"
this one's the worst of the lot. Way down the leg side. That's three wides in the over
pats a length ball to midwicket for one
walks down the ground and waits for this slower one to come on before picking the gap between midwicket and long-on. Pushes back for a quick second
"length on off, whipped away wide of long-on"
"full outside off, flicked away across the line to deep midwicket"
"pacy length ball outside off, uses that pace as he opens the face and runs it down to third man"

"back of a length, walks across prematurely and pulls it away to deep midwicket"
"short and sitting up nicely on off, pulled to deep midwicket"

"fullish outside off, driven away to deep point"
"length, cuts into him at off, punched to wide long-on"
gives the charge and ends up awkwardly slapping a length ball to long-off
cuts very late and finds backward point. Boundaries have completely dried up. They need some desperately
"short around off, tries to pull and gets an under edge to deep square leg"
skews this short one off the top portion of the bat to deep midwicket. No pace again at 111.7kmph. <b>Fifty for Tripathi</b>

"flat slider on leg, swept to deep square leg"
"length ball on leg, pushed back to the right of the bowler"
"comes down the track and heaves blindly without getting behind the line, gets a thick outside edge that runs away to third man. Nicely done by Chahal to flight it up and draw the batsman forward but taking it away from him"
comes down the track and goes inside-out to the left of long-off
"takes it away from him and spins away, and that's got to be a wide. Tripathi was expecting the call, which is why he let it go. But not called by the umpire"
"again floats it up well away from the batsman, forcing him to reach out for a drive to sweeper cover"
"swings across the line to heave it over the leg side and gets hit on the pad. Umesh turns around and appeals and the umpire takes a long time to give it. Rahane asks for the review. A little too full for him to attempt that heave with a half-angled bat as the ball sneaks from underneath after keeping a little low. Seems to be be hitting the stumps, but he did take a big stride across which is what could save him. Nah, actually, it's umpire's call on impact"
"straight to short midwicket. Umesh again provides RCB with crucial strikes. Royals cannot afford to slow down anymore, and Samson has paid the price for checking his stroke here. Closes the face from outside off to a length ball and the follow-through isn't great as he's caught in two minds. Chips it straight to Moeen Ali"
"short of a length, defended in front of off from the crease"
"length, angled in at off, flicked to the left of deep midwicket"
"make that three in one over! Umesh is producing another sharp burst of bowling. And this is a stunning delivery. An extremely full ball, curving into him at pace and dipping to hit the pad. Klaasen reviews and could the angle save him here? No, it's actually an inside edge. Clear deflection onto the pad. Top delivery nonetheless"
"full outside off, drilled off the inside of the bat towards mid-on"
"flatter on middle, worked wide of midwicket"
punched back to the bowler. Looked to work it from way outside off towards midwicket
"gets outside the line of off and works this to deep midwicket where <strong>de Grandhomme misfields to concede the second</strong>. Ran in too quickly, then lost his balance as he attempted a one-handed pick-up"
dabs this gently but straight to short third man
"good, clean strike. Down the ground as he gets to the pitch and lofts it straight into the sightscreen. Magnificent timing and use of the feet"

slips back in to beat the underedge as Klaasen looks to punch on the up.
"skiddy length ball back in from wide of the crease, Klaasen hops back and defends"
"thick inside edge, flies past leg stump into the fine leg boundary. Went for a pull, no position to play it."
backs away and punches this length ball on the up between cover and mid-off. Lovely timing.
"slower and fuller outside off, slapped to deep cover as they hare back for the second"

"tossed up on middle and leg, gets to the pitch and whips this to long on"

"right into the blockhole on middle, squeezed to long on"

"dipping yorker on middle and leg, toe-ends a lofted hit to long on"
"slower and fuller outside off, Tripathi looked to biff this over midwicket but swung through early and missed."
down on one knee as he slogs this to deep midwicket where Kohli covers good ground and then dishes in a dive to stop that. The recovery too was top notch
"toe-ends a slog to long on, called two but had to pull out as AB came around quickly."
"right into the blockhole, Tripathi backs away and squeezes this to cover"
"carved away over backward point, clears the ropes. Opened the bat face and then got underneath the full length delivery to put this away. Lovely"
"full toss, he walks across and then scoops this deep into the stands at fine leg. Siraj looked for a yorker, missed his length completely."
"skiddy bouncer, Klassen fetches this pull from way outside off, gets it into the gap between deep midwicket and long on"
"sees him backing away and bowls a slower one outside off, Klaasen can't reach this. Nice awareness from Siraj"
"looks to clear long off, but no timing and Moeen takes a simple catch at the ropes. Klassen backed away, Siraj bowled it full and wide. Slowed the pace down as well, so he couldn't get any timing on that as well despite having a good reach. Useful knock nonetheless."
squeezes this full length delivery straight to extra cover
"pulled magnificently. What were you doing inside the dressing room for so long, KG? Goes short and wide, Gowtham is across in a jiffy as he nails this pull in front of square to perfection."
"too full, too straight and banged over long off. Hitting right out of the top drawer. Reach, height and timing - everything perfect for that stroke."
"squeezes this full delivery to short third man, a direct hit at the bowler's end from short third man and Gowtham would've been gone.  As it turns out, they sneak in an overthrow"
"bowls this full and wide, inside the wide line though as Gowtham leaves."
"walks across, so Southee fires this full and wide, he can't carve it so decides to scoot a bye. Parthiv flicks the underarm throw to Southee, who breaks the bails at the bowler's end with Gowtham not even in sight."
"length outside off that stays low, Kohli shuffles and the ball sneaks from beneath"
tucked to midwicket
"flat back of a length ball outside off, Kohli fends and gets an inside edge, lucky to not chop on"
"pitched up outside off, driven down to long-on"
shifts back to a short of a length delivery that curves into him and hurriedly whips it away to the on side
backs away to force a cut but makes no contact and loses balance as the ball nearly shaves off-stump
"what a shot! Oh, that's stunning. Arches back to a short delivery that climbs outside off and just uses the pace to help it over with a ramp"

backs away to a short of a length ball and swings and misses
gets a top-edge to a short ball that drops short of deep midwicket
"short of good length, cuts into him from outside off and gets an inside edge to the on side"

"flat length ball, punched to deep midwicket"
"shortish on middle, curves in and he backs away and whips it to mid-on"
"just back of a length, flat, punched wide of long-on"
backs away and swings wildly at this back of a length delivery and misses. Gets past the keeper as well after missing leg stump
"gone, Kohli's gone! This is a huge wicket for Royals. You got the feeling Kohli was playing for the 15.5 over requirement. Charges down the ground to force the pace, not quite full enough and he swipes only for the ball to spin in from a length and flatten the stumps"
"full and flat on middle and leg, driven down to long-on"
"short of a length on off, gets an inside edge to midwicket"

opens the face to one outside off and misses
"full and wide, crunched to sweeper cover"
"oh, what a shot! Where do you bowl to this man! Advances down the ground and gets right under the ball before crunching it straight down the ground. Got so under it that his nose was over it"
"short of a length, cuts him in half and goes over the stumps after missing the inside edge"
"leg-side fuller ball, clipped to backward square leg"
swings wildly at this wide fuller ball and gets an outside edge that gets over short third man and carries to the boundary
"short of a length, backs away and punches to cover"
"sees AB back away and drops it at a back of a length on the leg-stump line, and AB pulls it away to square leg"
<b>dropped</b>. Would have been a stunning catch but Samson gets his hands to it but can't hold on. Samson isn't standing as behind as he'd like. Parthiv swings at this length ball from outside off and crunches it off the middle to deep midwicket where Samson leaps and gets his right hand up but the ball pops out at the last minute
""
"shot! Extremely full outside off, and Parthiv drills it through extra cover with exquisite timing"

"short and wide, cut to sweeper cover"
gets down to sweep a length ball and gets a top-edge through backward square leg
"<b>under edge that gets through first slip</b>. Not sure that carried. Nope, it didn't. Fell just short of him and bounced over him. They take three"
gets the front foot across and whips this fuller one through midwicket
"length, spins away outside off, whipped to long-on"
"welcomes him with a reverse sweep past short third man. Flatter one that spins away from outside off, so AB was hitting it with the spin. Easy, he just helped it along."
"to short again, he rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket where Archer makes a mess of it. Did all the hard work in getting to the ball, but as he tried to get up and recover to throw the ball back in, he ended up palming this over the boundary."
"shapes to drive, gets a thick inside edge past midwicket"
"leading edge but eludes the infield, on the bounce to long off. Parthiv looked to stretch out and work this leg side but was deceived by the googly."
"slides one from length outside off, cut away to deep point"
"too close to cut, goes through anyway. Can only squeeze this straight to point."
defended back with the spin to the bowler. Didn't get to the pitch as he looked to loft over
eased with the spin to long-off
"slides one across, Parthiv shapes to pull but this beats the underedge as he misses. In doing so, he dragged his back foot forward and it was on the line when the bails were whipped off. Stunning work from Klaasen. Parthiv's done his job though."
turns this gently towards square leg with the spin to get off the mark
driven with the spin to sweeper cover
"he's chipped this back to Shreyas, who leaps high to take an excellent return catch. The double-strike returns to stun RCB, the blue flags are out. The googly has done the trick. He's a short man, but timed his jump superbly."
steered with the spin to point
"driven nicely into the gap at sweeper cover, back for the second comfortably"
"the googly that rips back in from length on off, worked to deep midwicket"
"leading edge as this rolls to short third man. Mandeep was squared up, looked to work this to midwicket. <strong>Sharp turn for Sodhi</strong>"

works this gently past midwicket for an easy single
"dabs this to short third, looks for a single but is sent back"

eased with the spin to long off
chops this cut to cover. Sharp turn from length again for Shreyas
rocks back and pulls this short ball to Samson at deep midwicket.
"tossed up outside off, AB drives to a misfielding Samson at sweeper cover, ran in too quickly and couldn't bend down properly. Gives away an extra single"
"too short and he gets punished! So the single has now resulted in a boundary that brings up <strong>AB's sixth half-century this season.</strong> Too short, he stays his ground and flat-bats this into the gap at deep midwicket"
eased with the spin to deep cover as he jogs the single
"squared up, leading edge that rolls wide of point for a quick single"
"drives but the ball holds its line, thick inside edge to square leg."
"shapes to drive, doesn't get to the pitch, is beaten for turn, and gets a thick edge that has been taken beautifully by Rahane at slip. Excellent captaincy to have himself stationed there. Superb from Sodhi. Dragged him forward into the drive, deceived him in flight and thank you very much. RCB slide further."
"touch short outside off, punched to deep point for an easy single"
goes back into the crease and dabs this gently.
lunges forward and defends gently into the off side as they scamper a single
"misreads the googly, gone. That could be the final nail in RCB's coffin this season? Class from Shreyas Gopal! Lands this outside off, AB is sucked into the drive, but is done in by the length as well as the ball rips back in to beat the inside edge. Klaasen is alert as he pulls off another superb stumping."

lofted cleanly over mid-off. Picked the length up and went over.
"looks for the late dab off this length ball, but had no pace to work with, beaten. On the bounce to the keeper"
"ramps this up and over, but down to third man. Once again didn't have the pace to ramp this fine."
steps out to hoick but is deceived by the slower delivery that spins away past the outside edge to the keeper
"pulls too early, misses and the short ball hits him below the helmet grille. Seems okay, and we'll carry on."
"stunning from Klaasen! Catch of the match. Sarfaraz looks to play a late cut, but strangely to another slower ball. Surely he can't be trying dinky strokes like those without pace to work with? Doesn't matter, he has to go. Klaasen's anticipation is top notch as he moves quickly to his right, dives low and puts his right hand out to pluck that inches from the ground."
"the middle and off stump has been flattened. Right through Umesh's defence. Hits the hard length this time, he played all around it. Royals roar."
"slower one, dipped on Siraj as he lunges forward and blocks"
"shapes to squeeze this yorker outside off, beaten."
"he's walloped this pull to deep square. Too short, Siraj had decided he'll pull no matter what. Hit it cleanly too."

"walks across the stumps, holds his shape and hoicks this slower ball into the gap at deep midwicket"
"full toss, swung across to the leg side off the inside edge, down to deep square"
"lofted, but on the bounce to sweeper cover"
"slower length ball outside off, deviates away. Southee heaves but can't connect."
"he's got more elevation than distance, would've been six at Chinnaswamy but the boundaries in Jaipur are huge. Swung away and Gowtham takes a simple catch off the toe end at wide long-on."
"full ball that tails in to beat his defence, there's an appeal for lbw. In the meanwhile, the non-striker hares across to force Chahal into the bye. Klaasen fires a throw at the bowler's end, a direct hit and Chahal would've been gone."
"walks across to ramp this over short fine leg, beaten as he had no pace to work with."
"hit back hard but Archer stops it with his boot, they'll scamper a run nonetheless"
"superb yorker angled in towards the base of leg stump, Chahal somehow manages to keep that out"
"looks to muscle this short ball, toe-ends it and it rolls wide of the pitch"
"looks to back away and loft, can only get the bottom of the bat, rolls back to the bowler."
"reverse paddled past short third man. Lost his balance, was made to look ungainly but somehow connected. If he missed, would've been plumb in front of middle."
"swung away, but this is a steepler towards deep midwicket. Sanju Samson is running IN, K Gowtham is running back from the ingield, the ball curves in the air and as it comes down, Samson oses balance and fumbles, but Gowtham has the presence of mind to take this on the rebound. Stunning win for the Royals. <b> Bangalore boys Gowtham and Gopal have booted RCB out of IPL 2018. </B>"
