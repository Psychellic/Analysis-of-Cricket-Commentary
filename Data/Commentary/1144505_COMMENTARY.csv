"full, and he looks to go down the ground and misses. Didn't miss the stumps by much. The bails have come off, and the umpires have referred this to TV. <strong>Soft signal is not out</strong>. Thomas completed his swing of the bat and then hit the top of stumps after the ball had gone through, so this should stay not out"
"slogs this across the line towards long on, who does well this time to keep it down to one"
"looks for a full ball, wide of off stump, but goes too wide of the tramlines"
hits it hard on to his boot. Cannot cross over for a single
"short, and too wide for the umpires' comfort"
"goes wide of the crease again, and will have to re-bowl this. <strong>These are bonus freebies for West Indies</strong>"
steers a length ball away towards deep point
"slower ball, and he <strong>has got a good hold of this</strong> Aims to go over deep midwicket, and just clears the fieldsman there. Good effort, but he cleared him for a 72m six"
takes a hand off as he squirts this towards deep point. Refuses the single on offer
"full, wide and might have to rebowl this again. No? Gets away with it a bit, perhaps because Bravo was backing away a bit to the leg side"
"<strong>full, and rattles the timber!</strong> Probably needed to do this more often. Full, straight and beats the attempted slog down the ground from Darren Bravo. Third wicket, deservedly so, for Saifuddin, who's bowled decent lengths and variations through this innings"
"starts off with a short one outside off, moves away from the batsman and Tamim happy to let it go"
"more on target that time, short ball aimed at the head. Tamim ducks under it. Interestingly, it's called wide. Bit harsh that, I think"
"another short one, best one of the lot, outside off and rising up at his throat. Tamim keeps it down nicely"
"not as short that time, but well outside off and lets it go through"
"another short one, very similar to the one that was wided, but this one is deemed legal. Goes over Tamim on leg stump but well clear of him because he's ducked"
"back of a length and that sat up, didn't bounce much, Tamim punches from the crease and threads the in-field to find the boundary"
"good length on off, squirted towards point and they decided against the single"
"oooh, there's some carry there. Angled across him, back of a length and Soumya chases that, wants to flay it. Doesn't connect"
"<b>just short of Cottrell at third man</b>. Soumya not in control of that. Short ball outside off and he tries to ramp it, gets it too high. Cottrell was fine so was running around, can only collect on the bounce"
"<b>loud shout</b> for lbw but maybe too high. Shai Hope also indicates it would have bounced over. Lovely ball, on a length on leg and straightens, Tamim is caught in a tangle, flicks the top part of his pad and goes to the keeper"
"good length, pitches on middle and moves away that time, guided to third man"
"back of a length again, angling across but in the corridor, dabbed down to a widish second slip"
"<b>up and over</b>. Too full and Soumya comes forward to drive on the up, doesn't bother to keep it down and finds the cover fence. Not timed to perfection, but enough to get a boundary in the Powerplay"
"ooh some shape into him, and he's cleverly bowled this full. Tamim was probably expecting a short one and was caught a bit leaden footed. Manages to somehow keep it out"
and now he squares him up with the swing. It takes the leading edge and flies to third man. Was swinging into him and Tamim wanted to clip it to the legside
"oooh lovely, lovely bowling. Pitches slightly back of a length and jags away in the corridor, whistling past the outside edge. Soumya did well to keep his bat tucked close to his body and not go fishing"
"tries for the yorker but misses a bit, Soumya mistimes his clip and it trickles to midwicket"
"now comes the short one, but Tamim is ready for it and brings out the pull. Mis-times to deep midwicket off the bottom half of the bat"
"good length, on a line kissing the off-stump, bunted towards mid-on off the inside half of the bat. Wants the single but it's not on"
"length ball on off, Soumya guides it down to third man, keeping bat close to body"
"short ball from around the wicket, tucking up Tamim, who jumps up to defend this down"
"<b>another loud shout</b> not given. On a length and moving into Tamim, , strikes him above the knee roll but the angle would have taken it past leg stump"
"back of a length outside off, Tamim hops and steers to point"
"back of a length coming into him, he stands tall and punches to cover"
"bluffs him with a full one outside off, but Tamim is alive to it, and pushes it back, though off the toe end. Holder fields on his follow through to stop any thoughts of a quick single"
<b>clobbered</b>. That's gone over deep midwicket. The short ball didn't rise and was right on the slot for Soumya to transfer weight back and pull it powerfully
"bad ball and punished. Strays on the pads and all he has to do is tickle it very fine, get some bat on it and four."
"<b>diving stop by Hetmyer at third man</b>. Back of a length outside off and Soumya shows off his gift of timing, steers it fine. But Hetmyer prevents a third successive boundary"
"length ball on the pads, flicked to deep square"
"<b>bad ball and he's going to pay for it</b>. Dug it in short, very short, and it bounces way over the batsman, too high for Hope to also collect. Five wides"
"length ball on the pads, tucked to deep square leg"
"nice work by Pooran at point. Width offered and too short, he unleashes a fierce cut, but Pooran intercepts"
"length ball angled across, guided to point"
"Back of a length in the corridor, great touch by Soumya, who dabs it down to third man"
"goes for the wide yorker and has Tamim reaching out for it, but he toe-ends the slap to cover"
"short ball rises up to the head but not as quick, gives him enough time to get in position and control his pull to deep square"
"good length angling across him, steered towards third man again, but <b>Gayle dives to his left</b> and stops it at slip"
"went around the wicket but lost his line, too far down leg."
"goes across a long way, but Holder had bowled this back of a length on leg stump and Tamim wanted to hook it over fine leg. Doesn't connect"
"starts off with back of a length on the fifth stump, Soumya chops it down on the ground hard enough to get it to bounce over Holder leaping with his arms up at slip, and down to third man"
"140kph, length ball outside off again, carved over slips and once bounce to third man"
and there's the bouncer at the head. He sways out of the way and tries to ramp it over the keeper but misses
"back of a length on the fourth stump line, chopped into the ground in front of him, trying to cut it. Bounces towards extra cover"
"fuller on off, steered to backward point"
"length ball outside off, given some width and unleashes a cut but straight to point"
"back of a length angling into him, tapped into the offside and sets off but there's no single there so he goes back"
steered to third man
"back of a length, pitches on leg and goes across, he's quick to get his hands up and defend it towards cover"
"back of a length in the corridor and Soumya does that dab again - he plays it with a horizontal bat and very late, almost caressing the ball off the bat - to point. The man there misfields so they get a single"
lovely looking punch through extra cover off another back of length delivery for a couple
"short ball outside off, rises up to his head but he is in position to pull this to deep square leg, keeping the ball down"
"<b>take that!</b> Short ball outside off and Soumya almost nonchalantly cuts it over point, all the way. Used the pace and his own power to smash that"
"<b>he's guided this to Gayle at slip!</b> Good bowling by Russell but a bit of a gift with a loose shot. Dug this in short outside off and it came back into Soumya, cramping him for room. He's been playing the dab nicely but didn't have the width to do that. Didn't have the width to ramp it up and over either, and he ended up doing something in between, only guiding it to Gayle at slip."
"starts with a full ball outside off that Shakib drives down the ground. Oshane is after it, pulls it in before it reaches the fence"
oooh that was a steer to third man but not fully controlled. More like a half-edge. Length ball going across and he jabbed at it
"short ball outside off, pulled powerfully but Cottrell stops it at midwicket. That stung his fingers, was hit hard."
"and that's a quick bouncer, Shakib goes for the pull again but the ball is already to the keeper by the time he's through with his shot"
"back of a length outside off, too much room and not enough carry. Tamim stands tall and cuts this beautifully to the square boundary"
"yorker length outside off, driven straight, where mid-on goes to his right to collect"
<b>dismissed</b>. Shakib is showing off his insane form in this tournament. Backed away and clubbed this with a horizontal bat straight past the bowler. Back of a length ball  outside off
"over the wicket again, gets this one to bounce a bit more, Shakib guides it towards point off his chest"
"back of a length on leg stump, a mite quicker but Shakib manages to pull it to deep square leg"

"fuller on the stumps, clipped to midwicket"
"back of a length angling across, punched to extra cover"
"<b>peachy</b>. Tamim is hitting his stride now, full ball outside off and driven elegantly through cover to find the fence"
mistimes his pull off that back of length ball but gets enough to clear the man at midwicket and pick up two
"too short once again, this strategy will only work if you get it to rise up and hurry the batsman or tuck him up. This one sat up and Tamim pulls it disdainfully to the deep midwicket boundary"
"length ball, angling across him, slapped to mid-off from outside off. Russell takes a tumble on his follow through and rolls on the ground, but appears unhurt."
starts with one down legside and an extra run awarded
"on target that time, back of a length and rising up to higher than chest height. Patted down towards cover and they take the quick single"
back of a length again and Tamim fends it down in front of him. This time they decide against the quick single
"good length outside off, steered to point"
length ball but straying on the pads and he can easily flick it to deep square leg
"<b>top edge goes for four</b>. Back of a length tucking him up, Tamim short-arm pulls it, but it flies off the top edge very fine. Oshane Thomas was too square and has no chance of getting to it"

"back of a length on the stumps, tapped down towards square leg"
short ball but down leg side and he'll have to bowl that again

"back of a length on leg, defended into the leg side"
"ooh that's a quick bouncer. If you're going to bowl short, do it like that. On target too and Shakib ducks out of the way while completing his action for the pull shot as the ball goes past where his head was"

"length ball on the stumps, turned to square leg"
"length ball on the stumps angling into him, pushed to mid-off"
"that's some timing. length ball outside off and he merely seemed to let the ball hit the bat rather than play a shot, and it races to third man where a sprint by the fielder who is fine stops the boundary"

"<strong>WICKET, and a lucky one at that!</strong> Down the leg side, and he glances this, but doesn't get enough to get it past Hope, who takes it low to his left. What a wicket to get, and with a pretty ordinary delivery. Disappointing from Rahim, but an absolute bonus for Oshane Thomas. The two young men dragging this back for West Indies in tandem"

"<b>and there's the mandatory edge for four</b>.
