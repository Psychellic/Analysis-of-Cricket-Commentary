"full, sliding in on the pads, Roy clips it away through square for a single for the first ball"
"back of a length outside off, 85mph but no swing, Buttler forces to mid-off from the crease"
"pitched up, 86mph and Buttler steps out, SPLUT! goes the bat as he hits through the line and picks a gap wide of mid-off to send it skittering for four"
"full on middle, Buttler doesn't move this time, creams it up and over mid-on! Good pace, up at 89mph but dismissively lofted, bounces just in front of the rope"
touch back of a length and clipped to point as Buttler stands tall
"oh, that's unlucky, Buttler throws the hands and gets a thick inside edge that runs away through square leg, the man in the deep is fine and he won't get round. Third four in the over, tough start at big school for Chahar"
"superb line to start with, nibbling away a fraction as Roy gropes forward on off and is beaten"
"not quite as full, Roy moves across and lets it go"
"length ball, 85mph and pushed into the covers for one"
"pitched up, swings a fraction but right into the line of Buttler's bat as he clubs four more straight back over the bowler"
"four more! Slapped on the pull to deep backward square leg, a real crunchy connection and there's no protection out there"
"on the stumps, punched from the crease towards mid-on, they scamper the one"
"shimmy from Buttler, the back foot going as the bowler approaches the crease, pitched up and driven to cover"
"back of a length, this rises up and cramps Buttler, who taps it back to the bowler"
"drops short, maybe a slower ball but this time Buttler goes deep and clubs it away between mid-on and midwicket for four"
"swing! <b>Beautiful bowling from Chahar</b>, 86mph and shaping away from just back of a length as Buttler pushes down the line and is beaten"
"fullish, 87mph and this time he respectfully dabs down it in front of mid-off for one"
"pitched up and swinging a touch, Roy watches it works to the leg side, they hurry through as mid-on comes in to fire a throw"
"...but maybe not for long! Roy sashays down and just pushes through mid-off, lets the pace do the work for him, that races away for his first boundary"
"good length, 87mph and holding its line on off, this time it's watchfully blocked coming across"
"in the channel, length ball tapped down into the off side"
"uh-oh, spaghetti-ohs! Driven by Roy to mid-off, but Hardik Pandya's long barrier is short on effectiveness and it hits his ankle before deflecting to the rope"
"shortish, Roy pulls... and gets a thick inside edge on to his thigh. Owee!"
"WALLOP! Roy hits the first six of the day, <b>smoked down the ground into the crowd at long-off!</b> Princely batting - wasn't even a bad ball, just blapped off a length"
"full, 87mph and slamming into the pads, Kaul belts out an impassioned appeal... Tim Robinson merely signals a leg bye. Impact outside leg, never mind where it was heading"
"taking the pace off, maybe a knuckleball, Roy mistimes to extra cover"
"pace on, 87mph in the slot... <b>and mullered over the sightscreen at long-off!</b> Clean as a whistle, that shot"
"ooh, this straightens a touch, takes the leading edge into the off side... Kaul about to appeal for lbw again"

"fired in, up towards the blockhole and Roy chops down, squeezes out one to square leg"
"short ball, cutely played by Roy, just flicks it up over his shoulder to fine leg for four"
"again again, firmly slapped past fine leg! Roy rocking back to help this past the man"
"<b>and this one is into the stands!</b> Clubbed off a length, sailing yards back beyond the man vaguely positioned out towards deep backward square"
"deceived, hits it straight up... <b>but it somehow clears long-on!</b> I guess that might have to go down as a drop  by Chahar, but it was mighty tough, he was reaching back over the rope and couldn't get hold of it... would have needed a magnificent relay effort to effect a dismissal"
"shortish outside off and stabbed towards point, just a single"
"fullish, heaved down the ground, on the bounce to long-on"
"flighted, maybe the googly as Buttler comes out and is hit on the front pad"
"tossed up on the stumps, worked through square leg for one"
comes forward and clips this down the ground to long-off
"<b>dropped!</b> Buttler scoops a top-edged slog-sweep into the sky, it looks like it's landing in a vacant area of the pitch... only for Sid Kaul to get there, get his hands under the ball, <b>but fail to cling on!</b> Magnificent effort, but that'll go down as another miss"
"goes to his fifty with a brutal slap over long-on! Too full, Roy is on to the front foot, <b>mows it down the ground for six!</b> A half-century from 23 balls - just like our analyst Ravi Bopara, back in the day"
"tossed up and spinning in, half a shout for lbw but he was outside the line"
pitched up and driven down the ground for one
"pitched up, that's right where Roy likes it, never mind that it was a slower ball... <b>dispatched with aplomb (and a cheery) over long-off!</b>"
"adroit batting from Roy, goes back and dabs this towards short third man"
"short ball, 86mph and Buttler swings - gets a thick top edge over Dhoni for four more! Nothing going for the bowling side so far"
"bowled 'im! <b>Kaul rattles the woodwork</b>... Big swing and a miss from Buttler, who was aiming for cow corner, it was on a hittable length but the thing about hittable balls is: you have to hit 'em. The partnership is broken, Kaul's red bandanna to the rescue"
"good length on off, Hales defends carefully with an almost exaggerated straight bat. Suspect he won't be playing like that for long"
"tosses the legbreak on middle and off, defended back to the bowler"
pushed through and Roy goes back to cut in front of point for a single
"sends down the googly, Hales again defends on off"
"pushed through quicker, Hales can't get it away on the leg side"
"fired in, 60mph as Hales steps out and drills his first run to long-off"
"floated up and Roy uses his feet, works this into a gap at midwicket... but they don't push for the second, Roy keeps the strike"
"FETCH THAT! A clean golf swing off a length, <b>Roy has pongoed this over deep midwicket!</b> Majestic hit. Welcome back, Deepak"
"edged behind, <b>gets him with the slower ball!</b> Superb comeback from Chahar, gets him his maiden wicket for India...Short of a length, cutting his fingers over it, Roy went back and tried to cut it late to third man, just flicked off the toe of the bat through to Dhoni. Still, a mighty fine knock from Roy"
"angled across, Morgan prods and gets a thin edge down to third man"
"banged in, 86mph and Hales pulls out of his shot... not too high, though"
"short and again taking the pace off, Hales swirls his arms up and around but fails to connect... but that is deemed a second short ball in the over for Chahar, <b>and therefore a no-ball!</b>"
"full toss, Hales collars it, <b>clubbed over long-on!</b> Keep your peepers open in the crowd! More pain for Chahar, that was a bit wayward and dealt with accordingly"

"flighted, Morgan flicks back to the on side and the bowler can't quite  collect to prevent one"
tapped into a gap for one more

"tossed up, bit of dip and drift on leg stump and Hales prods to midwicket"
"pushes this through, possibly the Bosie and Hales has to block it on the back foot"
"rolled out, a touch leg side as Hales backed away, slugged up and over the ring, between long-on and deep midwicket, it bounces away for a boundary to end the over"
"back of a length on the hip, tucked to the man at midwicket"
"angled across, 82mph and Morgan drops back, guides it towards backward point - another dot"
"length, a touch wide and Morgan slashes a single away to third man"
"touch short, nipping in as Hales comes across and plays it down"
"beats the bat on the inside! Hales swings hard across the line, maybe nibbled in off a length and he failed to connect"
"oof, <b>that's smacked him on the helmet!</b> Bit of top edge and then into the bonce, the ball looping behind point... He was okay to run the single, though the umpires are calling someone out to check the protective gear"
"pushed through flat outside off, Hales drops back to cut"
"dragged down, Morgan whips into a gap at deep midwicket - just the single (still no twos in this innings)"
"flat legbreak outside off, Hales slaps it to cover"
"floated up on leg stump as Hales wanders down and clubs to cow corner, between two men but it won't go for four... and now England have run a two for the first time today"
"Hales backs away, Chahel lobs it up full and wide - but Hales manages to broomhandle it past cover, not a good bit of fielding and the man in the deep can't prevent four"
"floated up, Hales thwumps it down the ground, struck fine of long-on and that's back-to-back boundaries to end Chahal's otherwise thrifty spell!"
"<b>dropped!</b> Huuuuuuge top edge from Morgan, straight up to the edge of the ring - <b>but Chahal misjudges it, the ball clearing him as he falls back!</b> He's actually in some bother here, looks to have taken a nasty bump to the head"
"straight up again... taken this time, <b>though Dhoni demolishes the stumps in doing so!</b> That came down almost exactly where the batsman was standing, a wild hoick from Morgan, Dhoni trotted in to take the catch, then performed a little forward roll for effect after clattering the stumps. India all smiles this time"
"dug in short, Hales jabs at it uncertainly"
"slower ball, wide of the stumps and he swipes and misses"
"banged in short, <b>Hales nails his pull into the crowd at deep square!</b> Really sweet connection on that one"
"gottim, <b>tickled to the keeper!</b> Two in the over for Pandya, another cutter and it cramped him, Hales trying to guide it off the back foot, just deflected through to the keeper"
"shortish, on the hip and nudged away for Stokes first runs"
"angled across, 86mph outside off, Stokes just glides a single to third man"
"short, on the hip and it tucks him up as he flicks across the line"
"length on off stump, tapped down towards cover"
"that's outta here! No foot movement from YJB, <b>just skelped off a length and high over deep midwicket!</b> Nice way to get off the mark!"
"slower ball, Bairstow drops back and pulls for one - <b>that's the England 150 up</b>"
"length outside off, Bairstow backs off looking to carve over the covers, gets a thick inside edge past his stumps"
"full and wide, 82mph and Stokes has to stretch for it, squirted off the toe and it sneaks past short third man for four!"
"aims for the tramlines again, Stokes comes down and twocks one to deep cover"
"pitched up and clubbed down the ground, Pandya doesn't quite take it cleanly on the bounce at long-on - but it's just one"
"heads! <b>He's lost his bat!</b> Swung through the covers (the ball), and away to short fine leg (the bat)"
"full toss, just dips below the waits as YJB swats it into the leg side for one - decent over from Kaul"
"on to the legs, Bairstow just needs to get a bit of bat on it to send it fine for four"
"oh my! <b>He's smashed this over extra cover!</b> An extraordinary shot from YJB, going in to out, almost a perfect wide yorker from Umesh but somehow the batsman lofts it into the crowd!"
"fired in, 91mph, fiyaah from Umesh, hits the pad but they scamper a leg bye"
"Stokes skitters about in his crease, full and straight, at the stumps... <b>but ramped at the last moment for four!</b> Looked for all the world like it was about to lose his stumps, but managed to flick it past Dhoni!"
"fired in, this deflects off the pad, leg side though"
"did that nutmeg him? Full and leg side, Bairstow swings and misses"
"short ball, Stokes pulls but gets it high off the bat past the bowler for one"
"length outside off, taking the pace off, YJB rocks back and pulls flat to deep midwicket"
"cutter this time, in the channel outside off, Stokes has a big ole swing and misses"
"back of a length, Stokes swats at it... <b>and lobs a catch to mid-off!</b> Kohli takes the catch, that's another for Panyda, mixing it up well and bagging his third wicket. The dangerous Stokes departs"
"full, slower delivery... but this time Bairstow is ready for it, back in the crease and <i>flayed</i> over cover for four!"
"pitched up, Bairstow throws the bat - <b>and nicks to the keeper!</b> He's missed out on a half-volley there, really, not quite in the right position and reaching for it, pace was up and Dhoni swallowed the edge"
"full and wide, Willey jams down on it and gets one to third man"
"pitched up in the channel, Jordan bunts a single to mid-off"
"lights up the stumps, <b>Willey plays on!</b> Full, 90mph just outside off, Willey digs it out - but it deflects into the timber"

"Plunkett moves across, pitched up and hit without timing into the on side, they come scampering back for a second"
"goes for the ramp - <b>but deflects another straight to Dhoni!</b> Plunkett admonishes himself, tried to be cute when brute power is his, er, strength. Might have been a cutter from Kaul, gets his second wicket"
"wide full toss, Rashid swings and only needs to get a thick edge to squirt four to third man"
"length ball, Rashid goes hard but fails to connect"
"swing and a miss from Rashid... <b>and Dhoni then nails the stumps to run out Jordan!</b> Prophetic! Smart stuff from the guru Mahi, prevents a run off the final ball with a bullet arm"
"big appeal first up! This shapes back very nicely at Sharma, on a good length, takes the front pad. Perhaps pitched outside leg. Replays showed it pitched on leg stump but as going over"
"lovely delivery! Excellent start, this delivery angles across Sharma, even nips off the seam a touch, and beats the outside edge"
that's more like it! Takes a step down the pitch and effortlessly flicks this over midwicket and it's comfortably into the stands
"full outside off, pushed wider left alone"
"more swing, this is full at the stumps, tucked into midwicket"
"lovely graceful shot to get off the mark, it's full outside off, he takes a stride forward and places it through the covers. All timing."

"fuller, at the pads, but just costs him a single as it's tucked into midwicket"
"back of a length at off stump, no width offered, dropped into backward point with an angled bat"
"moves well outside leg stump, Ball follows him and it's clipped off the pads backward of square"
"<b>super catch!</b> Big bonus for England. This is full, angled into the pads, Dhawan goes to flick it away but sends it just within reach of Ball at short fine leg and the tall fast bowler pulls out a dive to his left. Hasn't been a great series for Dhawan"
"that's the shot of a man in form, eases onto the front foot and drives a delivery from outside off straight down the ground"
"good length, a fraction wider outside off, big stride forward and pushes to cover"

"much fuller, at the stumps, 85mph, turned into midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, goes for the square drive and bottom edges into the pitch then it bobbles to point"
"fantastic stroke! A good-length ball, he goes for the lofted drive and opens the face a touch to guide it into the crowd wide of third man"
a full delivery worked from outside off to mid-on
what a stroke! That's magnificent. Ball drops this short of a length and it's a wonderful pick-up pull short which goes over deep square leg
"<b>Don't believe that, it is a spectacular catch!</b> Jordan has pulled off one of the great catches. Rahul got underneath this, a fuller delivery, and aimed to send it over wide long-on. It looked to be travelling all the way, but didn't quite have the legs. Still, Jordan had to make huge ground from long-on and then flung himself full length to add another brilliant catch to his collection"
tucks a length delivery out to deep square leg
"back of a length outside off, opens the face off the back foot down to third man where Hales misfields and Kohli is alert to the chance of the second run"

"fuller, outside off, eases forward and drives to deep cover"
"short of a length, straight, good uses of the crease as he plays back then drives with an open face to beat cover"

"better length, brings the batsman forward and it's driven to deep cover"

"back to full and wider, it's a slower ball, skews off a thick outside edge and it goes one bounce to third man"
"back of a length, angled into the pads, swung down to fine leg...Kohli probably feels he missed out"

"full and straight, he's down the pitch and it takes a thick inside edge behind square"
"<b>just short of Bairstow at deep square</b> as the short ball nearly works, takes the top edge as he pulls but Bairstow can't reach it and the ball rebounds off him for a second run"
"another short one, pace off this time at 69mph, pulled to deep square"
that's outta here! Short of a length outside off and pulled high and handsome over deep midwicket
"that's a lovely delicate shot...he started moving around the crease, then angled a short-of-a-length delivery wide of the keeper"
"a low full toss, straight, chipped down to long-on...India motoring"
"out of the front of the hand, clubbed down to long-on"

"a low full toss is drilled down the ground, skims to Stokes at long-on who just manages to keep his feet away from the boundary marker"

"a slower ball, short of a length, picks out deep midwicket with a short-arm pull"
"full outside off, another slower one, skews off an inside edge to the on side"
gives himself room outside leg stump and drives a full delivery to cover
"low full toss, aiming for the yorker, clipped to deep midwicket"
