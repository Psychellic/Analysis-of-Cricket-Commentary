some carry and bounce straight away as he begins with a bouncer that is ducked by Babar
"oh, nearly chopped on. Lucky boundary to get going. Babar slashes at this wide delivery. Wide half-volley, gets an inside edge that misses the stumps and goes away into the fine leg boundary"
bowls this much straighter and Babar walks across the stumps before tucking it through the square leg region
"that's more like it. Tempter outside off and Babar comes forward and sticks his bat out, gets beaten for his troubles"
comes forward to meet this length ball outside off and drops it into the covers region. Thinks of a single and starts off but is sent back
"short of a length on off and holding its line, stands tall and punches off the backfoot back to the bowler"
"fuller ball on middle stump and coming on straight, clipped off the pads wide of mid-on for a quick single"
"short of good length and angling away outside off, stays in the crease and punches off the backfoot to the covers region"
"full and wide outside off, offers up just enough width outside off for the batsman to free his arms. Babr just takes a stride across towards the off-stump before crashing it past mid-off"
"full and angling away outside off, drops it in front of point where it is fielded cleanly. No run there"
"drags the length back and that's quite an effortless shot. Gets in position early, head firm as he lays into a pull shot and the ball sails over the deep midwicket boundary. Sat up nicely and Babar is in such tremendous form, he's not going to miss out on capitalising on those"
sticks his bat out and opens the face to run it down towards third man without any feet and cannot put bat to ball
"fullish length ball, tucked off the pads wide of deep midwicket and the fielder there runs across and picks it up"
tucked off the pads to deep midwicket
"good length, angling in from outside off, stays in the crease and presents a straight bat as he jabs it towards mid-on"
"slower short ball and that's sloppy work from Imran Khan jnr at short fine leg. Babar was swivelling around and pulling it, didn't try to hit it too hard and placement was going to be key. He does not get it wide enough of the fielder there but gets a boundary nonetheless thanks to the misfield"
defended back to the bowler
"turns it away from outside off straight to mid-on, didn't hit it too hard so the ball does not go to the fielder as quickly. But it is still a sharp single, called for it straightaway and completes it easily in the end"
"flights it but does not get it as full as he would have liked, drops it slightly short and width outside off. Nice bounce on the surface and Babar pulls it away between midwicket and long-on"
works it down to long-off to follow up the boundary with a single
cuts this short ball off the backfoot but cannot pierce point
eased down to long-on
comes down the track and looks to go big over the leg side but does not get the timing right and the ball lands on the bounce in front of deep midwicket fielder
worked wide of mid-on
"shorter in length, worked out to deep midwicket"
"slower ball wide outside off, tucks it away to the leg side, to the midwicket region. That one had no pace on it"
"very slow length ball outside off, comes forward and drops it into the off side"
"short of good length, much quicket at 124 clicks this time and it is pulled through square leg. Deep midwicket runs across and collects it"
whipped away off the pads through square leg and he has played that well enough for the ball to comfortably beat the deep midwicket fielder running to his right. Jumps back and moves across to use the depth of the crease to that one
similarly jumps back and whips it off the pads but this time to the man at deep midwicket
"sprayed down the leg side, or has it? Babar misses the glance but Babar was walking into the stumps and the umpire thinks it goes over leg stump"
"good length ball on off, jumps back and across and uses the wrists to flick it away to backward square leg. They momentarily think of the second but decide against it"
opens up at the sight of some width outside off and carves it through the backward point region. Third man is placed square and he runs across to collect it
"fuller and on the pads, tries to tuck it away off the pads but cannot beat backward square leg"
flashes his blade outside off and gets beaten in the channel
"full and wide, good yorker well outside off, around a set of stumps wide, jams the bat down and does not manage to squeeze it out"
that's such a loosener. Full and harmlessly coming on the pads and it is clipped away elegantly through backward square leg
"on the leg stump channel this time but this time it's slightly shorter in length. Sangakkara tucks it beautifully off the pads through square leg. Exquisite timing, that was silken"
"manipulates the field well, sees the packed leg side field and capitalises on some width outside off. Deliberately plays it of the splice by opening the bat face late and the ball goes past the third man region"
punched elegantly off the backfoot wide of sweeper cover
"length ball outside off, stays in the crease and punches it down to long-off"
"slower short of a length ball, rolls his fingers over the seam and it is pulled away through the midwicket region. Sammy's return to bowling in this PSL proves costly"
comes forward and punches this fuller ball to the off side. Sammy gets down to stop it and seems like he has hurt himself. He is up and limping but seems okay
"floated up outside off and Azam comes forward and crunches a drive through extra cover. Sohaib Maqsood wwith a brilliant stop, running to his right from sweeper cover and putting in a well-timed dive to keep the ball from crossing the ropes"
punched off the backfoot back to the bowler
comes forward and pushes this into the off side and Afridi hurries across on the follow-through and picks it up
"shorter ball, pulled away between deep midwicket and long-on. Shakib and Wahab converge on the ball and both of them put in the dive. One misses the ball but the other, diving behind, manages to stop it"
"tries to crunch this through the off side and does not middle it, ends up chopping it hard into the ground"
"flatter and fuller, driven to the right of long-off and they jog the single"
"sliding in with the arm, on a length, punched away between long-on and deep midwicket"
stays in the crease and whips this length ball away to wide long-on for an easy single
"slightly short of a length, uses the angle and punches it down to long-on"
"floats it up this time and gives some width outside off, Sangakkara gets down on one knee and nails a sweep but ther eis a man guarding the deep square leg fence"
advances down the ground and tries to loft this one over mid-on but he does not get the desired distance. Sends it in the direction of long-on where Hasan ali gets down forward and snaffles a sharp catch. That was really travelling and the fielder did well
pushes it across the left-hander on a fullish length from over the stumps and Sangakkara comes forward and pushes it into the off side
left alone outside off
"flat short of a length ball outside off, punches it straight down the ground off the backfoot. Solidly played"
"floated up and pushed across at pace outside off, Sangakkara leans forward and drives to covers"
"fullish and on the stumps, Sangakkara blocks off the front foot and the ball goes off the inside part of the bat to the left of Afridi who runs across and picks it up"
clipped out to deep midwicket
punched off the backfoot and Sammy at mid-off dives to field it
Sangakkara's lovely innings come to an end. He's livid with himself as he walks away. Came down the track but could not get on top of that as it was not as full as he would have liked. Around the length area and he miscues the attempted lofted drive and sends it straight into the hands of long-off
tucked off the pads to deep backward square leg
"skiddy fullish length ball that keeps a tad low, turns it away to the leg side"
floats it up but offers up some width outside off and it is crashed out to deep point
comes forward and pushes this fuller ball to long-off
"short ball, pulled away to deep midwicket"
"flat and wide outside off, turning away, leans across and pushes it out to sweeper cover"
"that's Gayle for you, hardly seems like he has tried to hit that. Just swings, bat meets ball and it spars clean over long-off. Full and wide outside off, asking to be hit"
tries to pull and ends up dragging it towards the bowler
"flat length ball and tries to rush him with pace, Gayle knocks it to the left of Afridi into the leg side and they take the single"
"short and wide, cut out to sweeper cover"
"length ball, sliding on leg, tucked away behind square"
"oh, that's a super catch by Eoin Morgan at long-on. Made it look so simple but he had to do some work there. Gayle comes down the track and tries to clear long-on. Morgan takes it revese-cupped, had to push back slightly to get behind that and he plants the foot just in front of the boundary cushion. The momentum takes him further back, so he throws the ball up, crosses the rope, gets back in front of it and completes the catch. They go upstairs to check if the foot has touched the rope when he first takes the catch. But I think the issue is when he catches the ball a second time. But it all seems fine and Gayle is already almost out of the ground. The big screen flashes the big three red letters and Gayle's poor PSL continues"
punched off the backfoot to covers
"short of a length, more attacking line, on the stumps, drilled back to the bowler off the backfoot"
"short again and width on offer outside off, Bopara cuts square of the wicket. Sweeper cover runs across to the left but Bopara comes charging back for the second and completes it quite comfortably in the end"
"<b>very tough caught-and-bowled chance, put down</b>. Bopara tries to make room to pull this length ball but it is not short enough and he ends up dragging it to the right of the bowler. Iftikhar gets down to his right but cannot hold on to the catch. Had very little time to react as that was travelling"
worked to long-on off the backfoot
drops it into the off side for a quick single
"short ball, swivels around and pulls but cannot get it past Iftikhar at deep midwicket"
"oh, beautifully played. Width on offer and it is shorter in length as well. Malik waits for it before opening the bat face really late and just carving it through the square third man region. Exquisite"
worked out to sweeper cover
"flat and short of good length, sliding in at pace, punched away to the off side as he backs away to make room"
"full and wide, tries to crash it through the off side and the ball takes the bottom edge to go past the third man boundary"
"slower ball, absolutely no pace on it. Bopara cannot guide it away square of the wicket as he opens the bat face. Plays the shot too early though he waited an eternity for it"
"slower ball, does not pick the drop in pace and mistimes the drive. Misfield at cover allows a single to be taken"
"goes for the wide yorker and offers up a dipping full toss outside off, still comes on at a decent height and it is played out to sweeper cover"
change of pace again. Bopara swipes hard against the line and the ball misses off-stump by a whisker as the batsman gets beaten
"low full toss, dabbed away off the pads to deep midwicket"
"rapped on the pads but seems like the impact was quite high. May have got an inside edge as well. He was looking to tuck this length ball away to the leg side but misses and the ball goes off the pad to the off side. Point runs in and fields it, fires a throw at the striker's end, misses the stumps. No one backing up and they get extra runs"
tries to tuck to the on side but is beaten by pace and the ball goes off the pad into the off side again
"full and on the stumps, drops it to the covers region and sets off for a quick single"
"fullish length ball outside off, angling away, swipes against the line and drags it away to deep midwicket"
"full and wide, crashes the front foot drive through the covers region but straight towards sweeper cover"
"walks across the stumps to this short ball and pulls it fine. Not a great effort from the fielder at short fine leg. Could have probably tried putting in the dive. Instead, he moves a step or two to his right and allows the ball to go past him"
backs away to make room early and pulls this short of a length ball to deep midwicket
"fuller ball, stays inside the line of the ball and drills it out to long-of"
clipped off the pads into the leg side
"comes down the track and finally an attempt to clear the straight boundary produces the desired result. Gets right on top of that and that has gine miles over long-on. Humungous hit. 'as big as Ian Bishop,' says Ramiz Raja on air"
the keeper came up to the stumps after that previous ball but it does not matter as Bopara stays in the crease and whacks this straight down the ground. Too full again
goes for an almighty heave again and this time Bopara gets a leading edge that is skied towards the fielder at backward point. Maqsood settles under it comfortably. This one wasn't as full and is slower in pace which does it as Bopara tries to carve it over the off side
"short and wide outside off, slapped hard square of the wicket. No one guarding the deep point fence and the ball crashes into the boundary"
overcompensates by firing it too full this time. And there is a lot of width as well and Malik frees his arms and hammers a drive over the fielder at extra cover
"even fuller this time and outside off again, almost a yorker this time and it is dug out through the covers region"
walks across early to try and flick this away to the leg side but wears it on the pad as the angle takes the ball in to him and the ball goes to square leg
"very full ball, went for a straight yorker but gets it wrong and bowls a half-volley on the off stump. That came out of the back of the hand but Malik picks up the drop in pace and stays leg side of the ball before thumping it down the ground"
stays leg side of this one again before drilling it down to long-off
"full, outside off, and it's lofted miles into the air over the cow corner fence. It's as though  Malik knew what was coming from a mile ago and gets in position early, keeps the front leg out of the way and responds with an almighty swing"
"slower ball, beats the edge of Malik's bat outside off as he fails to try and guide it away"
tries to slog and gets it off the toe end of the bat to deep midwicket
"slower ball again, Pollard waits for it before opening the face of his bat to run it down to short third man"
""
"slower ball, 97kph, Pollard nudge it to the left of the midwicket region. Calls for two and beats the throw at the striker's end"
"fuller ball on middle and leg. Malik was leg side of the ball, so it comes on straight to him and Malik crunches it through extra cover"
"wide ball, Pollard drags it from way outside off and sends it to long-on. Fetched it from a mile outside off and all he could do was to send it on the bounce to long-on"
"full, outside off, stays leg side of the ball. Gets the front leg out of the way and lofts it straight back over the bowler's head. Huge straight six"
"goes for a slower ball yorker and fires a full toss. Malik miscues as he tries to fend it away to the leg side and they take off for the single. Pollard is sent back, however, and the bails are off at the bowler's end. They go upstairs and he is well inside"
"short ball, tries the ramp shot after arching back but the bounce is too steep and Malik cannot put bat to ball. Not called a wide as the umpire seems happy with the bounce"
"short ball, stays leg side and keeps the front leg out of the way before laying into a pull shot and the ball crashes into the deep midwicket boundary after bouncing in front of hit. Tremendous hitting from Malik, <b>brings up his fifty</b> as well"
"short of a length, gets underway with a nudge through the forward short leg region"
"flat and skidding through, width on offer outside off and it is slapped away square of the wicket to point"
"length ball on off, backs away to make room and cut but cannot beat point"
sliding in with the arm. Akmal charges down the ground and miscues the loft which lands in front of mid-off running to his right
"short ball, gets down to sweep and the ball goes off the pad instead to the fine leg region"
nicely bowled. Kamran backs away and the bowler follows him with a fuller delivery on leg stump. Akmal tries to force it through the off side and does not make contact
"fuller ball, raps him on the pad with a fullish ball and Tamim gets an inside edge as he tries to clip it away"
"full and wide, drills it back towards the bowler off the inside part of the bat"
"length ball, angled away on off, squirts it down the ground and they steal a single as mid-off runs across, picks it up and has a shy at the non-striker's end"
tries to tuck this short of a length ball away and wears it on the pad instead as the ball goes away to the leg side
"fullish on leg stump channel, pushed off the front foot to mid-off for a quick single"
"<b>edged</b> and goes away to the third man boundary. good length ball, Tamim strides forward and the ball takes the outside edge, goes past Sangakkara leaping full-length to his left"
gets down to sweep and backward square leg dives to his right to keep it to one
"short and wide, point this time dives to his right but cannot get hands on ball and the ball screams into the deep point boundary. Picks the gap perfectly, beats three men patrolling that region"
"bowls it with pace and short of good length, punched off the backfoot down to long-on"
backs away and tries to cut this one but the bowler follows him and gets it to slide in with the arm. Akmal works it to extra cover
Kamran trying to force the pace and he manages to get a boundary. Drifting on to the pads and Akmal responds with a sweep shot as the ball goes through the deep backward square leg fence
"and this one's a lot more convincing. Poor delivery, full and width outside off. Akmal launches a straight missile over long-off and the ball sails into the ground. Sixteen off that over and this must break the shackles"
"good length, some bounce and getting it to nip away, lands on the seam and cuts away, beats the outside edge of the flashing blade of Tamim"
"Tamim gives the charge and takes this wider ball on the full, enough room, so he is able to free his arms and crunch it straight down the ground. Minimises the movement by coming down the ground"
walks across the stumps and tucks this away through square leg
"short of good length ball, Akmal swipes hard and it seems like he has played that pull shot to perfection. Gets it off the middle of the bat but just not enough distance. That's the longer boundary there. Ravi Bopara guarding the deep backward square leg fence and he snaffles it without having to move an inch. Straight down his throat"
"fuller ball, clipped off the toes to the deep midwicket region and deep backward square leg runs across and fields it"
that's a peach. Fires a tempter outside off and Tamim falls for the bait. Strides dangerously out and the angle takes the ball away from the left-hander. Gets a discernible outside edge that carries comfortably to the wicketkeeper. Tamim walked into that shot and Peshawar falter after a big over
""
stays in the crease and tries to punch this short of good length ball through the off side. He gets beaten as the ball goes to the wicketkeeper. Or has he? Appeal for caught behind and umpire Aleem Dar takes forever before raising the finger. Went off the inside edge that one. Lack of room does him in
"short and wide, cuts and places it to perfection as the ball splits cover and cover-point"
"fuller ball, swept away to long-on"
"fullish and pushed across on off, comes forward and drives into the off side"
"fuller, pushed off the pads down to long-on"
"good length on off, defended down the pitch off the front foot"
"fuller, holding its line outside off, Morgan comes forward and drives to mid-off"
"fuller on off, Morgan takes a long stride across to meet the pitch before driving to cover"
"fullish length ball, pitching on leg and middle, blocked back to the bowler"
"full and straight on middle and off, defended off the front foot back to the bowler"
raps him on the pads with a length ball and Morgan fails to tuck it away. Appeal for lbw but it is more optimistic than anything. Clearly pitching outside leg. Just the <b>second maiden over of the PSL</b>
"short and wide, cut square of the wicket"
punched from the crease to mid-on who runs in and fields it
goes for a reverse sweep and misses out
"short of a length outside off, punched off the backfoot to covers"
"fullish outside off, tries to nudge it away and picks out short third man"
"turn and bounce. Pitching on leg and spinning in, beats the attempted tuck by the batsman"
"full and angling in on leg, clipped away to the leg side"
backs away and the bowler does well to follow him. It straightens after landing on a length and beats the attempted flick
tucked away to short fine leg
Morgan's last outing with Peshawar will not be one he savours. Pitched right up on the stumps and Morgan tries to clear the front leg and go big over the leg side. Picks out Ravi Bopara at wide long-on who pouches it reverse-cupped. Peshawar in all sorts of trouble here. Morgan trudges off having faced 13 balls for his 3
turn and bounce from the length region. Gets it to grip on the surface and the sharp turn means Shakib is clueless and skews it inadvertently off the outside edge as the ball beats short third man to the boundary. Malik is standing there scratching his head. That certainly did not deserve four
defended back to the bowler
"short of a length and turning away, punched off the backfoot to long-on"
"full toss, swept away hard and the ball races away to the deep midwicket fence in the blink of an eye"
tries to back away and cut but the room isn't quite there. Beats the bat and narrowly misses off-stump
"full toss again, swept away wide of deep midwicket"
another attempted cut fails to meet ball as there is not enough room and the ball keeps a tad low as well
"pitched up outside off, lot of room on offer. Maqsood lofts and easily clears the in-field on the off-side. Sweeper cover runs to his right but has no chance of getting to that"
"short of a length, pulled past the diving midwicket fielder. There is a fielder at long-on who is placed slightly wide and he runs across and fields it"
"good length, attacking the stumps, Maqsood presses forward and knocks it back to the bowler"
"Kieron Pollard does it like only Kieron Pollard can. Man is this guy a genius or what! Full and angling in on the stumps, Maqsood lofts it straight down the ground and that never seemed like it was going to carry the distance. He did not have enough room to free his arms. Pollard takes it reverse-cupped inches in front of the ropes. The momentum takes him back as he was getting in position to take it and he does well to keep the foot inside the line. And makes it look like he took it in his sleep"
"quicker from Usman. Sammy is beaten by pace. It skids on as it cuts back in sharply from the short of good length and raps Sammy on the pads. But the angle suggests it was heading down leg. And given how short it was, height may also have been an issue"
tucked off the pads into the vacant midwicket region and they hurry back for the second
"good length, angling in on the stumps, tucked away to midwicket. There is a fielder in the deep and it will only be one"
"flighted outside off, tries to crash it through the off side and gets an inside edge to the pad"
tries to go big over the leg side and nearly gets an outside edge that goes to Gayle who takes it well. Turned a mile
"short and wide, slapped out to sweeper cover"
"flighted and on a length, stays in the crease and tucks it behind square for a single"
comes forward and defends back to the bowler
that is just raw power. Flighted and pitched up outside off and Sammy has absolutely flayed it. It goes flat and hard and comfortably sails over the head of long-off who does not bother going up
comes down the track very early and ends up getting beaten as he swings loosely
"straight down the throat of long-on. Like Karachi earlier, Peshawar are struggling to clear the boundary. Shakib pulls this short of a length ball and there is a lot of muscle on the shot. Does not get the elevation or the distance as Bopara takes it comfortably"
"short ball, ducked under"
walks across to protect off-stump. Usman gets extra bounce from the good length region and it is turned away to midwicket
"well-directed short ball, Afridi ducks under"
"no, we won't. Good length ball, stays in the crease before quietly nudging it away towards mid-on"
opens the bat face and steers it to square third man
"short of a length ball outside off, jabs it with a flat bat down to long-off"
"full, wide, room on offer, Afridi frees his arms and crashes it over covers. That's brute power, clean, flat hit"
"fuller and on the pads, tries to clip it away forcefully and wears it on the pads"
"full and wide, thumped hard off the backfoot by Sammy and long-off runs to his right and collects it one-bounce. That must have stung, was travelling real quick"
"Afridi pummels another fuller one with a flat bat and the ball sails over long-off, clears the boundary with ease"
"full and outside off, angling in, Sammy whips it with the angle but picks out midwicket"
slashes hard at this fuller ball without feet and squirts it off the inside part of the blade to the leg side
"short ball, walks across and hence does not give himself enough room, pulled away to deep square leg"
"slower full ball outside off, crunches a drive to sweeper cover, and the bowler has overstepped"
"very full ball, went for the yorker, it's actually a pretty good delivery but that is the incredible power of Shahid Afridi. Drills it hard, off the bottom of the bat, and the ball goes to the long-off boundary. Mid-off is slightly up and no chance for him to get his hands on that"
"fullish outside off, drilled down to long-off"
goes for a yorker and attacks the stumps but it is a low full toss that is driven out to sweeper cover
"short of a length, tries to tuck off the pads behind square and wears it on the pads instead"
fends it away to short third man
"length on off, Sammy pummels it down to long-off and the ball goes on the bounce to the fielder there"
swipes with the angle and looks to go through the leg side. Gets a thick inside edge and it goes through the legs to the fine leg boundary. Can't do anything about that
tries to back away and flays it with a flat bat over the umpire's head and the ball lands on the bounce in front of long-off
"short ball, tries to maul this away to the leg side and does not make contact"
"you don't bowl there to Afridi. Length ball, angling in from over the wicket and Afridi uses the angle to launch it into the night sky and that has gone miles into the air and clears the deep midwicket boundary"
""
"slower ball, good chance of pace, Sammy completes the shot early as he tries to whip it away through the leg side and gets an inside edge to the pads"
"slower short ball, Afridi is beaten by the lack of pace"
"short ball, ducked under. Afridi was hoping for it to be called a wide but the umpire thinks it's fine. Afridi looks to the square leg umpire and doesn't look happy. And he gets a tutorial from Chris Gayle, who is next to the umpire, on the height allowed on bouncers"
"short ball, tries to pull it away and does not make contact"
"tries to flick it away to the leg side and gets a leading edge to the bowler, drops short of Amir"
"short ball, sits up nicely for Sammy who swivels around and pulls, dispatches it over the deep square leg boundary"
"goes for the pull shot again but this one bounces more considerably, more than to his comfort and he gets a top edge on the pull as the ball goes over the keeper's head and on the bounce over the boundary"
"fuller ball, crashes it through extra cover and sweeper cover moves to his right and cuts it off"
"yorker on leg stump, Afridi jams the bat down and digs it out into the leg side"
another yorker and Sammy misses as he tries to turn it away to the leg side. Gets hit on the pad. Appeal from Amir but that hit him a mile outside leg
"full toss from Sohail and Sammy tries to flay it away over the leg side, gets a leading edge that lobs towards point who charges forward and dives but it drops in front of him. Great effort though"
"and Afridi's assault continues. Backs away early and actually gets more leg side of the ball than he would have liked, so he has to reach out for it quite a bit. It was the back-of-the-hand slower one and Afridi still manages to clear point boundary as he lofts it square of the wicket"
backs away and Sohail follows him with a fuller ball that is pushed down to long-on
"that's outta here. They just changed the ball and seems like we already may need a new one. That's 91 metres, Ramiz Raja says on air. Sohail's attempt at a yorker goes horribly wrong as he shovels this straight, over long-on and out of the ground"
"oh, what drama! Sammy cannot believe it. Stands in the crease and has his hands on his head. It was a short of a length ball and Sammy was swivelling around and looking to dispatch it fine. But he needed to get it a lot finer with short fine leg in place, does not do so and Gayle takes the catch. Seemed like it crashed into his chest as he rubs it. Still is as the new man comes in. Oh, yes, it hits him on the chest, bounces up and he takes the rebound"
backs away and crunches this full toss to extra cover
"run-out chance and the bowler has made a mess of it. What's more, he has hurt his neck as he crashes face first into the shoulder of Wahab running to the striker's end. That looked nasty. It was fuller outside off and Wahab drilled it back towards the bowler. They take off for the single and there is a yes and no. Usman tries to run towards his end and collides with Wahab running across to the right. The batsman gets back"
"misfield, and Pollard of all people. Pollard rushes into the ball which is driven hard towards long-off, probably slightly overran. Intention was to prevent the second run but he lets it slip past him and into the boundary"
"yorker outside off, flashes hard and the ball goes off the inside part of the bat to short fine leg"
leg stump taken out. Wahab was backing away and ends up exposing all three stumps. Bulls-eye by the bowler as he fires a yorker. Wahab swings wildly and Usman hits
"oh, dear, what has Usman done! Six and a no-ball. Length ball outside off and it is pummelled over long-on with a flat bat. Hasan Ali hits a six first ball and what a time to overstep"
"beautifully bowled. Yorker outside off and it is drilled down to midwicket off the inside part of the bat. They don't take the run. Afridi, perhaps thinking it was the last ball of the over does not take the single. Seems like the umpires have made a mistake when Afridi was checking with them about balls remaining"
you know what! Doesn't matter if they did not take the single the previous ball because it is a fabulous end to the over. Moves across the stumps and scoops it past the diving wicketkeeper to the fine leg boundary. Fantastic skill and great execution
"gets down for a slog sweep and gets it off the inside part of the bat to fine leg. Gayle makes a lazy effort at fine leg, sticking a boot out instead of getting down and using his hands. Allows the extra run and Afridi to come back for the second"
"flat on middle and leg, tries to slog against the turn and inside-edges it to the thigh"
Afridi keeps Peshwar's hopes alive and their hearts racing. Straighter ball and Afridi slogs it over deep midwicket and it has gone a long way into the stands
"Afridi's highly entertaining, equally valuable innings comes to an end after a slog gone awry. Chris Gayle makes amends for his earlier lapse by running to his left and taking a good catch. Afridi skews it off the splice to the backward square leg region and Gayle moves like he has never moved to take that"
"and this is how it ends. Fittingly, Bopara, who has arguably been the best fielder of the night takes the catch at long-off. Hasan was looking to loft it and ends up skying it but does not get the distance desired. Bopara runs forward and slides to pluck another superb catch. Sammy and the rest of Peshawar look dejected, jubilation within the Karachi camp"
