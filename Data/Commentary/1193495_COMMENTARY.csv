"<strong>what a way to start the match!</strong> Fullish length, around middle and leg, and he swings this over square leg, and wayyyyyyyyyy into the lower portion of the stands"
"length, pitches outside leg and comes off his pad as he shapes to flick. A bit of extra pace and bounce from Holder"
"shorter, straighter, and he goes back and punches this towards cover. Thought of a quick single, but the fieldsman was quick to converge on it"
"short, and he has hooked this away towards deep backward square leg. The ball sat up and begged to be punished, and Zazai obliged"
"fuller, and he backs away and looks to go over covers. <strong>Off the edge</strong>, and flies off over short third man, but pulls up short of the boundary"
"full toss, and he has driven this straight back past the bowler. What a start for Zazai!"
"length, but starts from outside leg, and a touch of swing further down the leg side. Gurbaz walks across the stumps, and misses out. Called wide"
"length, a bit of width, and he cuts this hard, but straight along the ground to point"
"short, angles into him, and he tucks this away towards short fine leg. Easy single, as the fielder has to move across to his left"
"shortish length, and he swings this away towards deep square leg. Protection there for Cottrell, which enables them to go through for a comfortable single"
"length, bounces away as it angles across him, and <strong>beats the outside edge</strong>! Gurbaz was looking perhaps to get the upper cut going, but missed out"
"length, and he bashes this hard into the ground and towards cover"
"length, outside off, and he <strong>swings across the line</strong> and gets an outside edge! Goes high, but far enough to go beyond the wicketkeeper, and plonks on the surface close to third man. They scurry back for the second"
"<strong>good ball!</strong> Just a little back of good length, and nips across him, and eludes the outside edge as Zazai looks to run it towards third man. Great carry through to Ramdhin"
"length, around middle and leg, angles across him, and he pushes this towards cover"
"full, wide, and he has <strong>swung this over the infield through the off side</strong>. Another boundary for Zazai, as he picks the slower ball from Williams"
"quicker, tucks him up by angling this from just outside leg. It goes off the inside edge and drops towards fine leg. Good call from the non-striker fetches them a single"
"length, angles in, and he plays it with the incoming movement to the right of short mid-wicket. Good running again between the two batsmen"
"length, angles away, and he looks to run it towards third man. Fielded by gully, who is the only man catchng behind the wicket on the off side now"
"length, angles away from him, and he plays it to the right of short third man. They set off immediately and go through for a single. A bit of a misfield from Walsh there, otherwise it could have been close"
"<strong>DROPPED!</strong> Length ball, outside off, and he swings this looking to bash it down the wicket. The ball flies off the top edge, and runs to the right of Denesh Ramdhin. Kesrick Williams comes flying in, and flicks it off the waiting gloves of Ramdhin, and it bounces off his arms and lands towards fine leg. There's a bemused expression all around, as Zazai survives a terrible shot!"
"length, angles in, and he drives this back down the wicket"
"short, and he has gone for a full-blooded pull. <strong>Off the edge again</strong>, and this time it runs away towards fine leg"
"<strong>this is gorgeous!</strong> Slightly fuller in length from Cottrell, and the line angles across him, and towards the off stump, but he clears his front leg and whips this towards long on"
"<b>a virtual replay of the previous ball!</b> Full and straighter this time from Cottrell, and he plays this whippy flick-drive again, and just about clears mid on this time"
"slower ball, full, and he moves away and drives this a bit to the left of mid off. They are able to get through for a single"
"another full-blooded shot, but this time Williams has struck! Fuller from Williams, but a change of pace too, and Gurbaz looks to go towards long on again. Skews the shot towards deep mid-wicket, and it's Pollard who tracks back and gets under it. It went miles in the air, and Pollard did well to hold on after an initial juggle"
"<strong>two in two!</strong> Slower ball again from Williams, and tossed up a bit wider this time for Zazai, and he checks an intended drive, and it goes straight towards cover-point"
"shorter ball, and he swings this away towards deep square leg"
"slower ball, full, and he drives this towards mid on. Asghar Afghan wants a single, but is asked to rush back, as that travels quickly"
"length, width, and he backs away and spanks this through covers"
"length on the stumps, moving inwards, flicked off the pads to short fine leg"
"fuller, still angling into the batsman and he tucks it to deep square leg"
"length outside off, squirted to short third man"
"goes shorter this time, and Janat controls the pull to play it to short fine leg. Can't beat the fielder so no runs"
"<b>picked the gap nicely this time</b>. Width outside off and a bit short, he flashes a cut and finesses the gap between point and short third man"
"the typical fast bowler response, a bouncer dug in very short, goes over the batsman's left shoulder. Holder a bit lucky to get away with that perhaps, could have been a wide"
"length outside off, steered to backward point"
"slows the pace up a bit, on a length on the stumps, he waits for it and turns it to deep midwicket"
"floats up a wide yorker outside off, and he gets low down to slap it to wide mid-off"
"back of a length on middle and off, turned to short fine leg off the back foot. Soft hands so there's enough time for a quick single"
"mixes it up with a bouncer, but it's not a pacy one, and he waits for it before pulling it from in front of his helmet and keeping the ball down, through midwicket"
"another short ball, this one didn't rise as much and sat up, he rocks back and pulls powerfully through midwicket. There's a fielder there so he cleans up"
"full toss outside off, leathers this to cover. Hit very hard indeed but Pollard at short cover manages to get a hand to it and takes the momentum off the ball. That would have stung."
"down the track, gets to the pitch and punches an off-drive. Flat one that bounces well before long-off"
"better length from Hayden Walsh, not full enough to invite the drive. He goes back to cut but misses the ball"
"length outside off, spinning away, pushed into the offside"
"and Asghar has made a conscious decision to attack the leggie. Shimmies down the track again and whacks this one straight, but it hits the stumps at the other end"
"goes back to cut this length ball but doesn't connect, and he's mighty upset with himself. He's hit two powerful shots in the over that, on another day, could have fetched 8 runs. Today, just 1 run."
"length outside off, cuts it through point"
"yorker on the stumps, he goes deep in his crease to try and helicopter it away, but ends up hitting it into his pad and it rolls back to the bowler"
"good yorker again, from slightly wide of the crease and homing in on middle stump. Digs it back out to the bowler"
"<b>Asghar is not going to be happy looking at that replay</b>. Short ball, went past him down the legside at chest height, he was trying to hit it too hard while moving across to pull, ends up getting a feather and Ramdhin takes an excellent catch, diving to his left. That ball could have been put away for four, but the accumulated dot balls led to poor execution"
"back of a length in the channel, defended towards cover-point"
"good length angling into him and straightens a touch, defended solidly back"
"looking to go inside out, but gets a thick outside edge that runs down to the third man boundary. Nicely tossed up, he was making room, but the ball turned more than he expected"
"quicker one, on a length outside off, he goes to cut but doesn't connect"
"length outside off, slaps it towards cover and Pollard dives to his left to stop it"
"<b>just over point</b> and finds the fence. Living dangerously is Janat. This one turned a fair bit but was shorter, allowing him time to rock back and slash it, but he didn't time it perfectly. Point was jumping up but it went just over"
"and that's the most convincing shot of the over. Tossed up outside off, too full, he gets down on one knee and corks an extra cover drive that clears the in-field."
walks into the flick to an over-pitched ball and plays it softly enough into midwicket to get a well-run two
"back of a length in the channel, defended to point off the back foot"
"length ball angling into him, pushed towards mid-on. Tight line"
"goes for the yorker on leg stump, but fractionally short and he pushes a straight on-drive to get off the mark"
"rapped on the pads, feet rooted to the crease and the umpire upholds his appeal. That came in very sharply off a length and Janat's shot selection was completely awry looking to push it but with his eight back when he should have been forward, but he's been a bit unlucky here because it looks like that would have gone down leg. Height also a possible issue."
"back of a length outside off, pushed to point"
defended towards cover
"length outside off, punched to deep extra cover"
"good length on a tight line outside off, steered to point"
"fuller outside off, looking to give himself room and flay this over cover but gets a thick edge that flies down to third man"
"length ball on middle and leg, he walks forward and tucks it to square leg. The fielder there - Keemo Paul - sprints in and fires in a throw. Pollard had not got back to the stumps, otherwise would have been tight"
"back of a length outside off, pushed towards cover"
"slows it up, back of a length outside off, and the batsman who was looking to come down the track has to adjust and play this off the back foot backward of square"
"<b>up and over</b>. Held his shape nicely on that. Length ball outside off, and he unleashes a lofted straight drive. Didn't quite time it perfectly but got it enough to just carry over the rope"
foxed him with a slower bouncer. He was looking to pull but has to drop his wrists and decide against playing a shot while letting it go through
"<b>excellent catch by Pollard at short cover</b>. Another good change of pace by Keemo, and he has Ibrahim playing the cover drive too early. Ends up popping it in the air and Pollard, injured finger and all, takes a good low catch in front of him, tumbling forward."
"back of a length on the fourth stump, steered to third man, staying beside the ball and hanging on the back foot"
"short ball, he ducks under it. It's called a no-ball for height."
"went for the wide ball outside off but it's just outside the tram line, so it's still a free hit"
"angling into him, swung away hard but without timing and it goes to deep midwicket"
"fuller on the stumps, clipped to short midwicket"
"scoots through under his big swing, outside off. He wanted to send this to cow corner, but connected with air"
"tries to mix it up by bowling it wide of off stump but it ends up beyond the tram line and he'll have to rebowl that. Marginal call, Pollard's not too happy with it"
"fuller on the stumps, tucked towards square leg for a single"
"slows it up, length ball angling into him, tucked to deep square leg"
"fuller on the pads, clipped backward of square"
"rolls his fingers over that one, slower length ball on off, bunted back to the bowler"
"goes very wide of the crease and angles it full on the stumps, clipped off his pads to wide long-on"
"<b>spoons a catch to mid-off</b>. You've to create all the pace by yourself on this surface and the West Indians have been bowling cleverly, with changes of pace. This one sticks in the pitch on a length, Nabi wanted to go big, but ends up hitting it too early, gets more height than distance - and not even that much height - for an easy catch."
"fuller on middle stump, flicked away but short midwicket is in place and fields it"
"another slower one, out of the back of the hand, on a length in the stump line, and he can only pat it back down the pitch"
"fuller, clipped off his toes with a flourish to long-on"
"normal pace ball, outside off and that's a good shot, cut through point. There's a fielder there who runs to his left, slides and stops"
good follow up with a surprise bouncer that he ducks under. Wasn't expecting that
"another slower ball, length outside off, worked backward of square"
"fuller outside off, glides it to third man"
"angling into him from a bit wider of the crease, punches it to long-on"
"digs it into the pitch but it sticks and doesn't come on, he has to wait and flick it to short fine leg"
"that one came back in sharply from outside off, bowled at normal pace - which his a good variation given the mode of slower balls - and Gulbadin is caught by surprise. Ends up in an awkward position while trying to cut it but being hit above the waist"
"length outside off, steered to point"
"short outside off, but no pace on the ball again, pulls it to deep midwicket without timing"
"valuable runs for Afghanistan and good shot. Too short and he swivels and pulls it backward square leg. Hit it well enough and didn't bother to keep it down, bounces down into the boundary"
"freebies from West Indies. Cottrell loses his radar and bowls it well down leg. Ramdhin had moved in place but somehow misses it, didn't' judge the bounce and it went below his gloves. Five wides"
"back of a length outside off, he opens his shoulders and slaps it back past the bowler, very straight"
"normal pace, length ball outside off, swatted to deep midwicket, playing across the line"
"pacy bouncer. gets it to climb a bit and he's a bit late on that, pulls it to long-on"
angling into him and he squirts it backward of square
"that's nicely played, flays a square drive through cover. There is protection in the deep though. This was too short and a bit too wide outside off"
"yorker length on the stumps, into him from around the wicket. He wants to go straight but gets a thick leading edge that flies to wide long-on. drops well short"
"back of a length, he swats a pull shot to long-on, but got it off the toe end of the bat"
"<b>top shot</b>. Slower off-cutter banged in too short, he rides the bounce and flays it over extra cover's head. Good timing and placement"
"normal pace ball, fuller nibbling around off, pushed to the bowler's left on the front foot"
"yorker on the stumps, goes deep in his crease and drives to long-off"
"length ball on the stumps, goes back and whacks a pull across the line to deep midwicket"
"saw him going across the line, and bowled it wide of off, off-cutter moving away, and not full enough to swing towards cow corner. Misses it"
"angling into him, this time he was looking to give himself room but he ends up inside edging onto pad and it rolls towards slip"
"length outside off, smacked hard but without timing, with a horizontal bat to wide long-on"
"fullish, flicked to square leg"
"<b>super shot</b>. Full on the stumps, and he connects really well with his heave to cow corner, pings off the bat and flies over the boundary"
"back of a length in the channel, wants to smack it across the line but misses it"
"slower ball on the pads, tried to slog it over square but no timing, edged onto pad and trickles away"
"tries to do too much while the bowler keeps it simple and wins the contest. Gulbadin well across to try and paddle it fine, but Williams kept it full and cutting in. Gulbadin has one leg on the tramline and one in line with the stumps trying to pull off the shot, he misses and the leg in line with the stumps is hit"
"clears his front leg and smacks a pull straight, but without timing. Pollard at mid-off collects on the bounce"
"yorker outside off, driven to extra cover"
"short ball outside off, had the width to cut, not exactly where he intended to send it, but he gets it a bit finer than he wanted to and it goes to the third man boundary. Got a little big on him"
"length outside off, punched to cover"
"fuller, angling into him, driven uppishly to the bowler's left. Hung in the air a bit"
"angling into him, flicked off his pads to midwicket's left"
"length ball spinning away a touch, defended on the front foot. Rolls off a thick outside edge"
"beaten outside off, had a waft at it without moving his feet much and it spun past. <b>uh oh, there was a faint nick there when it went past the bat</b>, so it'll go down as as drop. Went quickly to the keeper, bounced off his glove and to his left. Slip was too deep to be able to take it"
defended towards cover on the front foot
"too short and too wide outside off, could free his arms and slash this through point for a boundary"
"length outside off, punched to cover"
"length ball coming into him, takes the pace off, clipped to midwicket"
"rocks back, swivels and pulls this to the deep square leg boundary for a one-bounce four. Marginally short again, but sits up and Lewis is in form, he's not going to miss out on that"
"change of pace, similar length but doesn't come on as well and Lewis mis-times his pull. the ball pops in the air but falls short of mid-on"
"full outside off, walks into the on-drive, but can't beat mid-on"
"fuller on the stumps, lunges out and defends"
"full on off again, flicked on the front foot through midwicket"
"length outside off, cuts it to short third man's left"
"fuller on the stumps, goes to sweep but doesn't connect. Loud appeal, not given. Sliding down"
"is a bit late to transfer weight back, and ends up awkwardly slapping it towards mid-off"
"length on the stumps, flicked to long-on"
"floats up a slower ball on the stumps, and he waits for it, and flicks it to midwicket's left"
"how did that miss! Off-cutter and he hasn't read it, tries to swat across the line, it goes under the bat and is very close to off stump on the way to the keeper"
"normal pace, back of a length cutting into him, squirted to short third man"
"pace off the ball again, well outside off, he goes hard at it and slaps it to mid-off from the toe-end. Asghar has to run to his right - he's a bit wide - and slide to stop it. He doesn't do that and it bounces off him and allows the batsmen a second run"
"<b>knocked him over</b>. Another off-cutter, this one is bowled on a tighter line and a fuller length. King had no clue about that, was heaving across the line way too early. He misses, the bowler hits flush on middle stump."
"good length, on a tight off-stump line, tucked off his pads to deep square leg"
"length angled into him, pushed towards midwicket"
"fuller on the stumps, worked to midwicket"
"too short outside off, and he transfers weight back nicely and punches it through cover"
"floated up on the stumps, pushed into the legside"
"good length, turns a bit and the batsman's hanging on the back foot, defends from the crease, rolls off the outside half of the bat back to the bowler"
fuller and swept nicely to deep square leg
"<strong>nearly got through him!</strong> The carrom ball, and he played back a touch, and got an inside edge. It went just past the stumps and went past the keeper"
"floated wide down the leg side, and Hetmyer shuffles across to flick but cannot lay bat on it"
goes back to punch one angling into him towards cover
"shorter, angles into him, and he hangs back and flicks this towards deep square leg"
"<strong>this could be close!</strong> Shuffles across to sweep a ball pitched around off stump. Misses the ball completely, and they appeal loudly as they cut through for a leg-bye to short fine leg. Perhaps impact is just outside off, but that was close"
"flicks this towards short fine leg. Asghar Afghan has to move across to his right, and they pick up a quick single"
"defends a ball slanting in from wide of the crease, straight back towards the bowler"
"length, and he goes back and whips this towards deep mid-wicket"
"length, outside off, and he presses forward and plays it with soft hands towards short third man"
hangs back and cuts a shorter ball towards the sweeper at the deep point boundary
"length, and he punches this towards cover"
"length, and he walks across and wants to flick. <strong>Surprised by some extra bounce</strong>, and ends up skewing an attempted paddle shot. Goes in the air, but well short of deep square leg"
"goes back and plays this with soft hands towards mid-wicket. There's acres of space there, and he wants two, but Nabi is very quick to get to the ball after his follow-through, and he is able to prevent a second"
"short of a length, angles across, and he plays it back down the wicket"
"full ball, and <strong>given out leg-before</strong>! Did that pitch within the leg-stump line? It's a tricky one, but that's a good breakthrough for Afghanistan. Fuller, and a touch quicker, and Hetmyer justifiably shuffles across to try and flick this away. Beaten for pace, but at first glance, it did seem that this ball had pitched outside leg. To be fair, Janat himself had got a dodgy decision against Holder when he was batting, so this almost evens it out"
"<strong>beaten outside off!</strong> Just a tentative poke, as Janat pitches it up, and gets a bit of swing away"
"short, angles in, and he plays it towards mid-wicket"
"fuller, and he is able to drive this, leaning forward, towards long on"
"full ball, straightens a touch, and Lewis miscues an attempted straight drive, away towards cover"
"length, and he presses forward to defend. Wants one, but that lands too close to Nabi in his follow through"
"a touch shorter, and he goes back and whips this off his pads towards square leg"
"full, but down the leg side, and Lewis swings this around between short fine leg and deep square leg. Smart shot, as he used the pace and angle incoming towards him"
"skips down the wicket, and ends up taking a ball on the full. Drives it off the outer edge, and it is cut off by Naveen at point"
"hangs back and swings a flatter ball, straight into him, towards deep square leg. Cannot get this fine enough, and will only get one"
"length, and he presses forward and places this to the right of point. They go through for a single, and the bowler and the keeper aren't too happy that this single was completed so easily"
"slow off-cutter, pitching outside leg, and he flicks this towards deep square leg. The fielder has to come in from the deep, and that allows them to come through for two"
"shorter, angled across, and he plays it towards cover"
"length, just outside off, and he presses forward and defends this to the right of mid off. Quick single taken"
"short, and he looks to swing this across the line, and <strong>holes out to long on</strong>! Might have been a bit slower again, but it was a poor shot -- just had no shape as he looked to swat this away. Top edge, and it flew quite flat towards Ibrahim Zadran, who came in a few steps and took the catch comfortably"
"seam-up, a touch fuller, straight, and Rutherford plays it straight back towards the bowler"
"<strong>another wicket for Janat!</strong> That's a ball that any fast bowler would have been proud off. Angles across him, full, and just a hint of movement off the seam. The line and length were such that Rutherford was sucked into poking at it. A healthy edge through to the keeper, as Karim Janat lets out a scream in delight. <strong>This is an inspired selection by Afghanistan today!</strong>"
"length, and Pollard goes back to play it after it turns away a touch from him. Defended back down the wicket"
"<strong>well played!</strong> Flights this a little outside off, and Pollard takes the invitation, with a powerful drive uppish through extra cover"
"googly, and he goes back and flicks this towards deep square leg"
"length, and Ramdin goes back to defend this towards point, with the turn away from him"
"shorter, and he hangs back and drives this towards deep cover point"
"length, and he fetches this from outside off, and flicks it towards square leg. Rashid fields in his follow-through, with a slide for effect"
"uses his feet to advance down the track, <strong>even before Janat has bowled</strong>! Janat sticks to a good length, jagging back in, and Pollard can only defend"
"length, angles into him, and he plays it straight to mid-wicket. There's a direct hit from there, but he looks safe at first glance. It's been referred, but he was well in. <b>Good energy on the field, nevertheless!</b>"
"length, just from outside off, it angles back in and he defends"
"fuller, straighter, and he drives this towards long on"
"<strong>what a wicket!</strong> Janat in seventh heaven, as the finger goes up for a leg-before against Kieron Pollard. Fast ball, delivered from wide of the crease, but the line was spot-on, jagging back at Pollard, and giving him very little wriggle-room to get a shot going. The West Indies captain ended up playing from the crease, and the umpire has little hesitation in sending him on his way"
"full, outside off, and he drives this hard, but straight to point"
"flighted around off, and he drives this hard, taking it on the half-volley. Should have been stopped at cover, but Najib Zadran cannot take the sting off this"
"shorter, leg-break, and he goes back and punches this towards cover"
"flatter, shorter, and he goes back and punches this towards long on"
"length, and he goes back to punch this back to Rashid"
"wrong 'un, floated outside off. Ramdin goes for the drive, and gets it off the under edge. It eludes the stumps, though"
"length, plays it away between point and short third man. Wants a single, but that has travelled quite quickly"
"leg-cutter, short of a length, and he dabs this towards short third man. They run hard to complete the single"
"slower ball, nearly a donkey drop, and he hangs back and swings this around towards deep mid-wicket"
"slow leg-cutter, and forces Holder to fetch this from outside off towards long on. He'd cleared his leg and was in no position to go straight, as he inteded to initially"
"short, slow and he swings this towards deep mid-wicket"
"short, and he swings this towards fine leg. It wasn't far off from the man at short fine leg, but in the end, Holder got enough bat to clear the man there"
"short, and he swings this towards deep mid-wicket"
"<strong>Rashid strikes!</strong> He's done him in with the line of that ball, and Gurbaz has done the rest. Holder pre-meditates this a bit, skipping down the wicket, possibly aiming to go straight down the wicket. Rashid goes flatter and wider, and turns it past his outside edge. Once Gurbaz collected, there was only going to be one result"
"length, and he has swung this from outside off, well into the mid-wicket fence! <strong>Top connection from Keemo Paul!</strong>"
"shorter, and he goes back and flicks this towards deep mid-wicket"
"short, and he goes back and flicks this towards mid-wicket"
"loud appeal for a caught-behind, but more from the keeper than Rashid, who joins in belatedly! Not given, as the ball spun past the outside edge as Ramdin stretched forward to defend"
"length, turns away from him at good pace, and he can only defend this"
"slower ball, full, around the stumps, and he hangs back to flick this towards mid-wicket"
"slower ball, on the stumps, and he backs away to the onside and ends up swinging across the line. Only towards deep mid-wicket"
"fuller, slower, and he flicks it away towards deep square leg"
"slower ball, fetched from outside off, and played towards long on. Paul unhappy with himself, for not being able to generate any pace or placement on this"
"slower ball, and he swings this hard from a middle and leg line, towards deep square leg"
"slow leg-cutter again, and he thrashes this down, one-bounce towards long on"
"backs away and swings this inside out towards extra cover. There's a fielder right there, though"
"fuller, and some good turn away from Ramdin. He swings in hope, looking for long on, and misses out on contact by a country-mile"
"fuller, wider, and <strong>dropped</strong>! It was hit back really hard, and he just got a hand to it, and it deflected away towards midwicket"
"another swing-and-a-miss. Full ball, and he looks for the slog sweep, but gets nothing on it"
drives one closer to him towards extra cover. Some hard running will fetch them two
moves across to the off side and tries to flog one fired down the leg side. Called wide
"length, and he looks to slog this straight, but yet again the lack of pace means he has dragged this towards long on"
"slower ball, just outside off, and he plays it wide of cover for a single"
"<strong>five for Janat!</strong> Another full ball, just outside off, and Paul goes for an almight heave. Off the inside edge, and on to the base of off-stump. Janat is pumped, as he should be. It's been a fine team effort, but he is by far the Afghan individual that has stood out"
"looks to bowl a slower ball from the back of the hand, and gets it all wronng. Pitches well outside the tramlines on the off side"
"full, and just outside off, and Walsh hits this towards extra cover"
"full, and he plays it back towards the bowler"
"wide outside off, and drives to cover. Takes the fielder on, and <strong>a direct hit would have been close</strong>, but he gets through"
"length, played towards point. Wants a single, but turned back"
"short ball, outisde off, and he has cut this away over short third man. Too little, too late, one would think..."
"fuller, angles into him, and he plays this towards deep square leg. Janat is the fielder to get to it first"
"slower ball, angles across him, and he plays at this a bit early. Misses it as it wobbles away to Gurbaz"
"fuller, faster, and he hits it hard into the ground, but straight back at the bowler"
"short, moving away from Walsh, who looks to back away to the on side, and ends up looking at an ungainly heave across the line"
"slower ball, around leg stump, and he swings this towards deep mid-wicket. Fielded by the man at deep square leg"
"short, slow and he hits it hard but back towards the bowler"
"short, and he moves across the crease and gets it down towards fine leg. No protection there for Naib"
"slower, short ball, and he swings this again in the same direction. Takes more of the edge and goes towards long leg as a result. One bounce to the fielder stationed there"
"slower ball, outside off. A bit too wide outside off, and called a wide"
"fuller, still wide outside off, and Walsh has a mighty swing at it. Nowhere near the ball"
"length, slower ball, and he swings this across the line, and <strong>Rashid Khan takes it at the deep mid-wicket fence</strong>! Decent contact from Walsh, as he finally latches on to the slower one, but sends this higher than far enough, and Rashid calls early to take this ahead of the man at long on. Naib almost gets into his bodybuilder pose, with arms crossed, and then signals to Walsh that hitting him across the line for six was just not on"
"fuller ball, straight, and he plays this towards short mid-wicket, and Afghanistan have won!"
