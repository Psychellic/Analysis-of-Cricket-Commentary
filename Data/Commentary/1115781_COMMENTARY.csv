"back of a length, Wood drops his hands to let the ball fly through"
stoutly blocked on the front foot
"<B>flogged through the covers!</B> The counterattack is on! Wood dumps his front foot down the pitch, and rifles a drive to the rope. Stunning!"

"aggressive intent, but misdirected. On the hip and worked into the leg side"

"dragged down and Wood latches on again, <b>third boundary in the over!</b> This is whirled on the pull in front of square, moving Wood to the brink of fifty!"
"over the wicket, pitched up on off stump, tinkled towards mid-off"
"beautifully bowled, the slower ball dips under the bat... <b>and has that flicked off stump?!</b> Bairstow was done by that delivery, but the yorker has touched the stump without budging the bail at all! Batsman and bowler exchanges smiles, but NZ's frustrations mount"
short at the body and swatted for a couple
"dug in and YJB swivels on the pull, picks the gap in front of square for a boundary now"
"full, outside off, driven through the covers"

"floated up around off, dabbed towards backward point"
"floated up, <b>launched over extra cover for six!</b> YJB gets stuck into the legspinner now, a clean mow over the ropes - <b>takes England past 250</b>, too, which looked a way off when Broad fell"
"dragged down a touch, hoicked back in the air wide of the bowler through mid-on"
"flighted, Wood defends the legbreak on off stump"
"pushed through and glided off the open bat face wide of slip, that's going to run for a couple - <b>that's his maiden Test fifty</b>, up goes the bat to hearty applause from the travelling fans. He's changed the momentum here"

"fires in the yorker on leg stump, Wood does well to dig that out"
"through him, <b>stumps akimbo!</b> Southee collects his five-for, another full, straight ball that's rattled into the woodwork! Wood was aiming another expansive drive, it seamed in a fraction, past the bat and finally ended the No. 9's merry hack"

"short, sharp, whizzing through to the keeper as Leach drops his hands"
"that's excellently bowled, and pretty well played, Leach was looking to get onto the front foot, but was forced violently back by a sharp glove-rapping lifter. Keeps on top of the ball and plays it down into the cordon"
"a wild and woolly bouncer, Watling flings himself down the leg side and does brilliantly to get even half a glove on it"
through to the keeper at pace again. Aggressive lines this morning
"outside off, a touch fuller and nipping away. Leach is on the front foot but can't lay a bat on it"

"poked loosely into the cordon, bounces short of Southee at third slip"
cut firmly out to point
"<strong>edged and gone!</strong> Beautiful bowling, pitches middle and leg, holds its line, clips the edge, through to Watling, who has no concerns this time about the height at which the ball comes through.

"leg-stump line, squared up in defence"
stands tall on the back foot to push to mid-on
"beauty! Ghosting through Raval's defences, pitching middle and leg, climbing off the seam and past the edge"
"another fine delivery, slightly more of an off-stump line but the bounce lures him forward as it fizzes past the shoulder"
"<B>snorter!</B> Now you see it, now you don't. Simply has to play the leg-stump line as the ball angles across the left-hander, then roars past the edge as Raval is late coming forward. Lovely"
"aggressive full length, on off stump, forward in defence"
"outside off, and through to the keeper on a wider line"
"<B>edged and gone!</B> Beauty from Broad, full length, dragging Latham forward, then nipping away as a hard-handed drive comes through the line. A simple snick to the keeper and England are up and running!"

"full again, squeezed into the cordon with an angled bat"
"through to the keeper with good pace and carry, from back of a length"
"Anderson's ghost ball once again! That moved like something out of a quantum physics lesson. Once moment it was a leg-stump half-volley, the next it was beating the outside of the splice!"
"striding forward, a firm strike into the covers, lovely placement once again"
"left alone well in the end, but my goodness that was tight! Passed over the top of off as the ball bends in late. Raval was leaving that on line and was lucky the bounce was so true"
"full length, a calm punch down the ground, body behind the line, straight bat through the line"
"attempted clip to leg, doesn't quite time it"
"Well bowled again, very full, wide of off stump, dragging Williamson across his crease to meet it, before nipping past the edge"
"sharp lifter outside off, this is good stuff from England, lots of seam movement allied to the encouraging bounce in the deck. Williamson just about avoids contact"
"<B>the thinnest of feathers and England have both openers!</B> Full and threatening from Anderson, drawing the left-hander forward, beating him with late movement off the deck and grazing the edge of an already committed bat. England's old guard are brawling now!"
"fullish length, sliding in a touch and Taylor flicks it away in the air behind square for a single to get off the mark"
"pitched up, lovely line and there's a huuuuuuge lbw appeal from Anderson... Erasmus shakes his head but England decide to <b>review</b>, bat and whether it hit in line being the two questions for Paul Reiffel. This has beaten the inside edge, the two sounds was the ball hitting both pads... <b>but it's umpire's call on impact!</b> Superb ball, shaping and then seaming in late, but Williamson survives"
"sliding down the leg side, Bairstow leaps across and takes a magnificent catch, nothing on the flick from Williamson, though"

"touch shorter, shows it a straight bat as he gets across outside off"
"full, driven coming forwards, gets it wide of mid-off for a single"
"pitched up, draws a flash outside off - <b>taken at first slip!</b> England are right amongst them now! 'He's big, he's bad, he's better than his dad,' chant the Barmy Army, as Broad gets his second of the morning, full and fast and Taylor has had a dip when he would have been better off leaving. Instead, he's left NZ in some trouble"

"fullish, comes across this time and pushes safely into the covers"
"pitched up straight, 141kph and driven crisply, Broad fields in his follow through"
"pitched up and straightening, another loud appeal for lbw, Oxenford not interested this time - but England <b>review</b> again. Was there any bat? Looks like a no, beaten on the inside edge aiming a drive down the ground. This is going to be very close - <b>hitting top of off stump</b>, according to ball-tracking! Broad has a third, NZ sink further into the soup"
"shortish form over the wicket, Watling drops back and leaves"
"good pace in the channel, left alone once more"

"length, shaping back a fraction, 142kph but Williamson watches it closely and leaves"

"full, 142kph outside off, neatly dabbed in front of square and they scurry through"

deflected off the pads to backward square leg
"<B>edged and gone!</B> It was looking so promising for a moment, but Cook's woes continue ... lured into a stroke he needn't have played, in fact he was barely playing at it at all, in the channel outside off, and Watling tumbles to his left to complete the dismissal.

fired in straight and nudged to midwicket
"flicked in the air, <b>Malan picks out midwicket!</b> The waiting game pays off for New Zealand, and it's a new bowler with a notch in the wickets column! Malan doesn't look too pleased with himself as he heads off, he's gifted that to De Grandhomme, the catch snaffled at head height by Nicholls"
"full, outside off and left alone"
"gottim, <b>edged to the keeper!</b> Make that five down... Root fails to convert fifty once again, driving at Wagner and giving NZ a second breakthrough in as many overs! NZ's defensive tactics have paid off, Root starved and then sent back frustrated"

"round the wicket, on the hip and glanced fine for a boundary... he's overstepped, too"

"length ball, Stokes feels for it, <b>gets a thick outside edge wide of slip!</b> Southee flew after it one-handed but couldn't get there, Stokes gets another boundary - but he's living dangerously"

"solidly forward, head over the ball. Blocked to the off side"
"full length, a big waft, <B>beats everything!</B> Watling was standing up but had no chance to gather that as it nipped off the seam and past the edge"
"<B>stunning catch!</B> Stokes clips hard into the leg side, losing balance as he does so, reminiscent of Malan's departure, but the catch was a blinder, leaping to his left, clinging on in two hands, and England have lost their third of the day, and the most dangerous of the lot!"
"good finish to the over, a big inducker, climbing over the off stump as it nips through to the keeper"
"<B>huge appeal, but Erasmus is unmoved!</B> Perfect line and length, that was the offcutter, hopping through to the keeper and there was a sound as it went by... no reviews left though!"

"another meaty chunk of bat on ball, this time through midwicket with a thick inside-edge as Broad drove hard through the line"
"flicked into the leg side, a good sharp single, some fancy footwork to flick the ball towards the stumps"
"<B>wallop!</B> That's some top slogging from Broad, clears the front leg, opens the shoulder, slashes the drive through backward point"
"slower ball, Broad is through the shot so quickly he almost had time to pirouette through the stroke and come round for another try. Instead he wellies an ambitious slog to Sodhi at mid-on, who stoops low to scoop the chance!"
"leaning forward, poked to gully. There's some life in this game all of a sudden!"
"pushed onto the back foot, and blocked to the offiside"
"well bowled! This one pops off the seam, over the shoulder of the bat, as Bairstow just about stays inside the line"

"on a middle and leg line, solid defence on the back foot"
"<strong>smashed back at the bowler, who can't cling on!</strong> That was an extraordinarily tough chance, low to his left in Boult's followthrough. He contorted well and dropped a hand on it, but couldn't close his fingers on the chance"

"<B>smoked through midwicket!</B> Wood is seeing it like a lumberjack in this Test. Just back of a length, and thumped across the line"
"very full, leg-sided, pushed to mid-on"
"<B>fantastic flogging!</B> A big outswinger, but wide enough for Wood to free his arms, and lace a lascivious drive through the covers"
"and that's the end of that! A beautiful full-length inswinger does the trick for Wood, who was just starting to channel his inner Bradman there... which clearly contributed to his downfall! Through the gate and rattling the timbers. England's innings is starting to gurgle"
"on the back foot, dabbed into the covers"

"punched off the back foot, <B>in the air</B>, and just out of the reach of Williamson in the gully!"
"flicked off the hip, this will be stone dead if the shy hits, but <B>de Grandhomme misses!</B> Leach wasn't in the frame"
"full face, punched hard down the ground"
"<B>flogged through midwicket!</B> Short and straight, and Bairstow's forearm smash flies to the rope"
"on the pads, that's sharp running, taking on the throw from fine leg and winning comfortably. He is seriously quick between the wickets"
"on the pads again, a roundhouse pull, and four more valuable runs! England are putting their foot down now"
"an ambitious drive, not quite there for the stroke, but Bairstow is seeing it like a planet now."
"<B>battered through the covers!</B> Not a bad ball at all, but Bairstow was committed to the front foot, and swung his hands lustily through the line. Sixteen off the over, and the lead is now 375"
"an open-faced steer into the covers, looks like an easy single but Boult pounces brilliantly and forces Bairstow to scuttle back to his crease. In fact, a deflection off his bat probably saved him from a very tight call there"
on the back foot to defend

"fired down in the channel, Latham leans out and lets it zip through"
"pitched up, straying on to the pads and Latham connects cleanly with a clip behind square for a couple"

"back of a length, 136kph and tucked off the body, Raval was stretching for the line as the throw came in"
"oof, he's turned away here and been <b>struck right above the kidneys!</b> Saw it was short, wanted to leave but the ball veered back at him, thudded into the ribs... But he'll be okay after a short delay"
