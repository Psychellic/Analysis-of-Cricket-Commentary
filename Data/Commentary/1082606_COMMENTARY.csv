starts by whanging the first ball down the leg side
"back of a length on middle and leg, looks to work it into the leg side, playing from the crease, can't put bat to ball and it hits him high on the thigh pad"
"short, wide, slapped away, and it's straight to backward point, who catches it with both hands above his head. The ball was there to be hit, he just picked out the fielder, Nitish Rana"
"back of a length at the pads, stands put and tickles it to fine leg"
"low full toss, nicely offered outside off, but he gets it off the centre, high on the bat and straight to extra cover"
"good length, angled across from off stump, tries to open the face as he fends at it, bat turns and it's back down the pitch at the bowler"
"rolls his fingers on this, good length, at the pads. Plays the flick and finds deep square leg"
"back of a length slower ball in the corridor, punched to backward point"
"back of a length again, a bit of movement away from middle towards off, pushed off the back foot to the left of mid-off"
"again, back of a length, angling across towards off stump, punched towards cover point"
"this time he strays a little too straight, a bit of inswing takes this back of a length ball towards leg stump, and Raina shuffles across to tuck it fine. What's more, he's overstepped too"
"looks for the wide yorker, ends up delivering a half-volley instead, and Raina frees his arms and drives to the left of a diving extra-cover fielder"
"back of a length on middle stump. Looks to work it through square leg, and plays slightly early, pops it in the air but safely on the bounce down to the fielder in the deep"
"fullish outside off, punched to the left of long-off"
"short on leg stump, he rolled his fingers over but McCullum was waiting for it, just took a big step back and pulled it to the left of short fine leg"
down the track comes McCullum and McClenaghan bangs it short outside off. Chops down on it and plays into the covers
"back of a length on off stump, walks across and tucks this into the backward square leg region"
"not quite short enough to pull, maybe, and McCullum inside-edges it down, towards his stumps, and his lucky his front leg is in the way"
"full on leg stump, McCullum moves his front leg out of the way and drives - in the air but on the bounce to mid-off"
"slower ball, back of a length, angling across McCullum. Doesn't pick it and swivels through his pull before the ball even reaches him. Rolls down to the keeper after beating the batsman"
"back of a length, too close to off stump to cut, Raina bottom-edges into the pitch"
looks to make room again and Harbhajan denies him with a middle-stump line. Punched into the covers
this time the line is just an inch outside off stump and he opens his bat face to stab it to the right of backward point
"tossed up outside off, stretches out to defend into the covers"
"flat and full on middle stump, clipped down to long-on"
"back of a length on middle stump, worked away to deep midwicket"
"length ball angled across Raina, punched to mid-off"
"sees Raina looking to make room and follows him, bowls it right up at his feet. Whipped away to deep square leg"
"back of a length in the fifth-stump channel. McCullum looks to make room and slash, can't put bat to ball"
"down the track now and Bumrah bowls it full, angling into off stump. McCullum's given himself just a bit of room, and he flat-bats it powerfully down the ground, between bowler and umpire"
"ooh, good ball. Angled in, pitches on a good length outside off and straightens. McCullum looks to create room and hit over cover, and misses"
"full outside off, McCullum clears his front leg and flat-bats over cover. Doesn't quite time it and long-off runs to his left to stop it"
"slower ball on middle stump, worked in front of short fine leg"
"short, and that's not where you bowl to McCullum. This was not a slower ball, and McCullum made some room and slapped it over point"
"down the track now and he gets too close to the pitch of this ball from Malinga outside off. Can't get any elevation and he drags this flat-bat hit to mid-on, all along the ground"
"slower ball, length ball, on off stump. Picks it up early, clears his front leg, and just swats this over midwicket"
"fullish, wide of off, looks like another slower one. McCullum is through his flat-bat slap too early, and inside-edges it, bounces down to the keeper"
"full - almost a yorker - on leg stump, and McCullum gets his front foot out of the way quickly to clip this wide of mid-on"
"tossed up on off stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"length ball close to off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"fuller now, on middle and off, defended into the off side"
"quickish, back of a length, angling into middle stump. Steps across to tuck it into the backward square leg region"
down the track and Krunal shortens his length on a leg-stump line. Tucked to short fine leg
quickish length ball close to off stump. Checks his drive as this ball stops on him and it pops up in the air but bounces short of extra-cover
"tossed up wide of off, reaches out to drive to the right of long-off"
"tossed up slow and wide of off, looks like the topspinner, McCullum gets down low and plays a hard, flat slog-sweep to the left of deep midwicket"
"not short enough to pull, quickish ball outside off, ends up dragging it along the ground to long-on"
"short, wide, reaches out and chops it to the right of backward point, where the fielder makes a diving stop"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed down to the right of short third man"
"short, fairly wide outside off, slapped away to the right of deep point"
"down the track, gets too close to the pitch to get elevation, but hits this powerfully along the ground, to the right of long-on. Pollard sprints and throws himself full-length to his right to stop it"
"looks to sweep, and inside-edges into his boot. Balloons up but falls well short of the bowler"
"down the track and Krunal fires it short, across the left-hander. Looks to slog, and inside-edges it. Bounces up over the leaping wicketkeeper"
"back of a length on off stump, no turn, worked away to deep midwicket"
"flat, back of a length, fired quickly across the left-hander. Pulls from outside off, along the ground, to long-on"
this time the length is just short enough for McCullum to get under even though it was rocketed in at 109kph. Pulls it to the vacant boundary between deep backward square leg and deep midwicket
"tossed up slow and wide of off, stretches out to drive to long-off"
"fullish outside off, driven to long-off"
"tossed up wide of off, gets some dip and turn. Raina drives to the left of sweeper cover"
"flat and full outside off stump, McCullum had to move his feet quickly to get in position for the slog-sweep, but managed to do so and found the gap to the left of deep midwicket"
"short on off stump, makes room to slap to deep point"
"sees Raina stepping out and fires it in flat, cramping him for room. Punched back to the bowler with a straight bat"
"shortish on middle stump, pulled to deep square leg"
"tossed up wide of off, driven to long-off"
"back of a length on off stump, goes deep in his crease to work it through square leg and reach another half-century"
"not quite short enough to pull, and he's working against the angle Krunal is creating by slanting it across him from left-arm around. Drags it to long-on, all along the ground"
"quickish length ball on middle and leg, clipped to long-on"
"down the track and Krunal bowls it quick and flat outside off, driven to extra-cover and they risk a quick single. More accurate throw at the bowler's end and Raina might have been in trouble"
"Raina steps out, shows his hand too early, and Harbhajan outsmarts him. Floats it up slow and wide of off. Raina had to reach out to hit it, to avoid getting stumped, and wasn't close enough to the pitch of the ball to be in control. Ended up slicing it high, and cover point takes a good catch, overhead, falling backwards. Rohit Sharma the fielder"
"shortish outside off, chopped away through backward point"
"tossed up outside off, gets it to dip on Kishan as he stretches out to defend. Hits high on the bat, near the inside edge"
"once again a left-hander steps out a beat too early. This time Harbhajan fires it quick and wide. Reaches out, misses, and they've gone up in appeal for the stumping. Parthiv had to deal with quite a bit of bounce on this occasion, and Kishan managed to turn around and plonk his bat back into the crease by the time he gathered and took the bails off"
"shortish outside off, chopped down to backward point"
"full-toss at the pads, clipped to the left of long-on, and that's the end of a superb spell from Harbhajan"
"full on middle stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"low full-toss at the stumps. McCullum steps across, looking for the scoop over the keeper, but doesn't time it. Only manages an edge into the covers"
"superb slower ball, full and slanted across the left-hander. He clearly didn't pick it early, shaped to drive, then tried to adjust, and by then it was too late, the ball had slipped under his bat"
"on the pads now, clipped to long leg"
"full-toss, this one is thigh-high, though, and McCullum uses the pace and angle into him to simply help it over the backward square leg boundary"
"length ball outside off, flat-batted to long-off"
"slower yorker on middle stump. Looks to make room, can only manage to jam his bat down and inside-edge into his pad for a single into the off side"
"low full-toss close to off stump, whipped to deep midwicket"
"yorker again, the line's too straight this time, and McCullum clips it off his toes, and fine leg is too square to be able to stop it"
"timber! Shuffles down the pitch before Malinga has released, and Malinga simply adjusts his length to spear it in, right up to the batsman, with a bit of late inward movement off the pitch, to sneak between bat and pad and bowl McCullum as he tries to flick into the leg side"
"gives him the yorker first up, and that nearly takes out leg stump as he shuffles across to try and flick and misses the ball altogether. Missed leg stump by inches, and the umpire signals wides. Parthiv, for some reason, doesn't try and dive to stop it"
"walks out of his crease now, Malinga bowls full and outside off and he drives to sweeper cover"
"yorker on leg stump, clipped straight back to the bowler"
"length ball outside off, opens his bat face to steer down to third man"
"full, close to off stump, swiped away down to long-on"
sees him stepping out and bowls it short outside off. Gets some extra bounce to beat Karthik's attempted dab to third man
"looks to clip this fullish, middle-stump ball and it stops on him slightly. Gets a leading edge that falls just wide of mid-off running to his left"
"gets going finally. Nice bit of improvisation, steps across his stumps and gets a shortish ball outside off. He's so far across that he can scoop this over his shoulder and beat short fine leg to his right and get it to carry all the way"
"down the track and Hardik bowls a shortish ball into his body. Looks to work it leg-side and gets a leading edge that rolls away to the left of mid-off. Pollard's throw is to the bowler's end, and it runs away to the boundary for four overthrows after Harbhajan, backing up at backward square leg, misfields - he shaped to throw before picking up cleanly"
"back of a length on off stump, shuffles across to whip towards deep midwicket. They chance a second run as Hardik runs in from the boundary, and his throw is at the keeper's end. Karthik dives full-length and is flat on the ground, and that saves him"
down the track and McClenaghan slants it wider outside off. Karthik misses the attempted pull
"bouncer, given wide as Karthik pulls away from the attempt to hook"
"yorker on off stump, jabbed back to the bowler"
"slower ball, looks to cut and only manages an under-edge to the keeper"
"full outside off, squeezed away to the left of sweeper cover"
"short outside off, pulled to the right of deep midwicket"
"full-toss outside off, slapped away off the back foot to the right of sweeper cover"
"yorker outside off, not wide enough to qualify as a genuine wide yorker, and Karthik opens his bat face to squeeze this out to the left of point. Excellent placement and timing. It's a no-ball as well"
"yorker on middle stump, clipped away to long leg"
"slower ball, full, at Kishan's feet, and he finally gets a boundary away, swipes it away into the big gap to the right of fine leg"
"low full-toss on middle and off, clears his front leg and slaps to mid-off"
"shortish slower ball outside off, rolls his wrists over a cut to pick up two to the right of third man"
"low full-toss on leg stump, and Karthik puts it away - fine leg was back, square leg was in, and he placed it perfectly to beat both"
"slower ball wide of off, flat-batted to the left of extra-cover"
"short outside off, and Karthik has just smashed that. Stunning timing, takes a big step back and across and pulls and it carries all the way over the boundary to the right of deep midwicket"
"short again, chopped down to backward point"
"slower short ball, out of the back of the hand, and there's a bit of extra bounce on this. Kishan pulls in the air, and Krunal takes a simple catch, moving to his right from deep square leg. Hang on, the batsman's been told to wait. They're checking for no-ball. It isn't a no-ball, half his foot is behind the crease"
"down the track, gets a shortish ball without too much width, and slaps to the right of point"
"looks to reverse-sweep a straight yorker first ball - low full-toss, actually - misses, and he's lucky that's missed off stump"
"ha, DK earns his team a wide. Stepped a long way away from leg stump way before Malinga was even in his delivery stride, and then stepped back in line with his stumps. Malinga ends up bowling a wide down the leg side"
"does the same set of movements again, and this time Malinga attacks the base of leg stump. Clipped away through square leg"
"slower ball, right up to the batsman on middle and off, whipped away through midwicket"
"yorker on middle and off, jabbed down to mid-off"
"low full-toss on middle stump, clears his front leg and swipes along the ground to deep midwicket"
"another yorker, middle and leg, driven down to long-on"
"looks for the yorker again, underpitches, and that's the danger of the yorker - you miss, and you're likely to bowl a full ball that the batsman can get under and slog over long-on. Big swing from Roy, and he connects well enough to clear Pollard comfortably"
"Shapes for the reverse-sweep or reverse-scoop, and gets a slower full ball outside off, gets a top-edge that loops up over the keeper, to his left"
"low full-toss on leg stump and that's a super shot from Roy, makes a lot of room and drives back down the ground, to the right of mid-off"
"another low full-toss, this time he follows Roy with his angle and doesn't give him as much swinging room. Swiped down to long-on"
"slower length ball on off stump, opens his bat face to pick up a single to the left of extra-cover"
"slower length ball, wide of off, Roy flat-bats it to long-on with a lot of bottom hand"
"full-toss, thigh-high, on the stumps, Karthik swings hard and only manages to send it rolling along the ground to long-on. They only pick up two despite Pollard missing his pick-up after attacking the ball hard. Karthik was facing the other way, running to the striker's end, and failed to capitalise"
"good length, starts outside off and swings away, gently past the bat which is hanging away from the body"
Rohit will be as good as an opener today. Parthiv closes the face too quickly as he looks to flick across the line. This ball is full and swinging away from a middle stump line and it catches the leading edge. Taken on the second attempt at backward point by Roy
"good length at off stump, defended back to the bowler off the back foot"
"full at off stump, watches it closely and pushes to mid-on off the front foot"
"looks to surprise with one that swings back in, but the line hasn't changed. Down leg side from a length"
"good length, swinging in at leg stump. Gives him the charge and has enough time to keep his balance and lift this over short fine with the swing. That was 120kph"
"slower ball, good length at off stump, goes forward and drops it square into the off side infield"
"full and fast, 140 kph, but way down the leg side. Karthik dives one-handed to his right to take it"
"<b>nearly drags it to mid-on.</b> This was back of a length, angled across off stump. He wanted to pull on the front foot, but there was too much pace on this. Lands on the bounce to Praveen Kumar"
"this time he beats him for pace with a slower ball. Full at off stump, looks to power this on the up, gets it off the inside half into the leg side"
"shot. Full at off stump, 144kph, nicely in the slot and he slaps it back past the bowler without moving his feet"
"<b>dropped!</b> Oh Roy is anxious once again and this time he doesn't have a second attempt to hold on. Good length at off stump, he slogs across the line and is beaten by pace and bounce again. Skied to Roy's left at midwicket and he gets under it only to put it down"
"good length at middle stump, pushes on the up to mid-on with soft hands"
"back of a length at leg stump, taps it to deep square leg off his thigh"
"swings it in, back of a length at leg stump, stays deep in the crease and turns it behind square on the leg side. Deep square cleans up to his left"
"slower ball, dropped short at middle stump. He has enough time to pull this. Munaf runs to his right at fine leg and loses balance after stopping it. Allows them to come back for a second despite a mix-up"
"looks to bring it in, but this is full and starting at leg stump, down the leg side again"
"and down the leg side again, this one doesn't swing, angled from wide of the crease at a length"
and repeat. Praveen Kumar has lost his line completely. Another length ball down the leg side
<b>and a fourth!</b> This time Karthik can't collect it because it's angled further. Parries it to fine leg with a dive to his right
"back of a length outside off, opens the face and runs it down to third man"
"good length, shapes away from outside off, left alone"
"back of a length outside off, walks down the pitch to try and whip it through the leg side, it's moving away and he has to drop it down with soft hands in the end"

"full outside off stump, driven to point with an open face"
"back of a length outside off stump, hangs back and dabs it to third man"

"good length at off stump, driven on the up to extra cover"
"good length at off stump, walks down the track and pushes to mid-on"
"good length at middle stump, flicked off the pads to deep square leg's right"
"off cutter at a length, off stump line, finds short third man with a late cut"
"what a shot. This is quick and aimed at the stumps, back of a length. Buttler walks across his stumps to expose them all. He's still on the move as he ramps this, but the eyes are watching closely and the head is super still"
"leg cutter, drops it all the way down to 91 kph. Good length, outside off, he can't do more than tap that back to the bowler"
"good length, off cutter at middle stump, clipped to deep square leg off the front foot"
"<b>gorgeous.</b> This is a slower ball, full outside off stump. He's leaned in early, but has the skill to wait for it to land. Puts a glorious bat swing through the line from under it to launch it over extra cover"
"back of a length at off stump, taps it to short third man off the back foot"
"back of a length at off stump, drops it off the back foot in front of backward point"
"leg cutter, good length at middle stump, looks to drive on the up past mid-on. Chips it harmlessly to him instead"
"slower ball, good length, angling in at leg stump. Tickled off the pads to find short fine"
"good length at off stump, forward defence into the off side"
"superb. This guy is some player. He's seen a lot of slower balls this over, but has the confidence to hang back and go through with his pull shot. Nails it off the middle from back of a length and lifts it over deep square leg"
"slower ball, good length at middle stump, pushed past midwicket off the inside half of the bat"
"full outside off stump, leans in and pushes it to long-on with the turn"
"good length at off stump, pushed to extra cover off the front foot"
"good length at middle stump, steps out and pushes to long-on"
"arm ball, fired across off stump from a length, whipped to deep midwicket watchfully"
"good length, angled in at leg stump, pushed between deep square and deep midwicket"
"good length at off stump, taps this in front of deep square leg with soft hands...the fielder runs in and fires hard at the non-strikers. Long-off has to back up on the overthrow"
"short and wide outside off stump, climbs into this and hammers the cut shot in the air but rapidly past backward point"
"back of a length, slower ball at middle stump, tucked off the hips to deep square leg"
"good length, wide outside off stump at 131 kph. Buttler has shown all three stumps as he tries to flick this into the leg side. Gets it on the pads. Munaf appeals loudly and cannot believe that isn't out"
"back of a length outside off stump, dabs it straight to short third man"
"back of a length at middle stump, pushed on the up to deep midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, walks in the ball's direction to try and ramp it over short fine, has to adjust as it cuts away from him. Looks for the reverse ramp. Beaten."
"good length at middle stump, pushed to deep midwicket off the pads"
"arm ball, good length at off stump, down the track as he pushes on the up to long-off"
"arm ball, angled across off stump slightly short, he gets low and watches it very close to chop it late past backward point to <b>bring up his fifty</b>. Takes his helmet off and taps his chest"
"good length at middle stump, leans in and pushes it to deep midwicket"
"good length at leg stump, drops it to short fine leg's right off the front foot"
"overpitched, angled in at leg stump, clears the front leg and lifts it neatly over long-on the way he might have at a golf course on a Sunday"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off stump. Slides under his attemped pull shot to beat him"
"<b>got him.</b> Completely against the run of play, Tye gets another wicket with the knuckle ball. This one sits in the pitch and is what you would call tennis ball bounce outside off. It's short and wide, the cut was on, but the pace and bounce made it awkward. Very thin outside edge. Keeper and bowler are the only ones appealing, and they're right in the end. Up goes the finger"
"back of a length at middle stump, squares him up as he whips it and he gets a leading edge that lands into the off side"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off stump, hammers it off the back foot to sweeper cover"
"knuckle ball, good length at middle stump, glanced to short fine's left"
"leg cutter, good length at the pads, taps it late to push it past Karthik"
"good length outside off stump, pushed to extra cover off the back foot"
"good length, angled in at leg stump, steps out, not to the pitch but chips it over his partner at the other end"

"arm ball, 105 kph, good length at off stump, gets it off the inside half as he tries to punch on the up through the off side"
"<b>throws it away.</b> Buttler looked like he was setting up to hit this for six before Munaf made it to the popping crease. It's back of a length at off stump, he goes for the pull and drags it straight to long-on off the top half of his  bat"
"bounces him first up. At middle stump, gets it to move outwards too and raps him on the gloves"
"back of a length outside off stump, stands tall and punches on the up to sweeper cover's right"
"back of a length outside off, jams it on the up to long-off"

"back of a length in the corridor, hangs back and chops this between backward point and short third man"
"full at off stump, squeezes it down to long-off"
"inswinging yorker just outside off stump, digs it out and drops it in pitch area to steal a single"
"another yorker, nails it at off stump, but they make a single out of it again, dropped in front of point"
"goes for the slower yorker, 100 kph, but misses his length. It's a low full toss at middle stump and Rohit has time to get under it and sweep it straight to deep square leg"
"misses the yorker again. Low full toss at middle stump, 141 kph, flicked to deep midwicket"
"and a perfect yorker to finish. 141 kph, at middle stump, defended watchfully"
"low full toss at middle stump, pushes with the full face visible, straight to deep midwicket"
"leg cutter, short and wide outside off stump. He cuts it uppishly and <b>just</b> evades backward point. Munaf reckons there should have been a  catch attempt, but that was too high"
"back of a length outside off stump, dabbed to short third man"
"back of a length outside off, too easy for Pollard. Barely any effort to slot this 120 kph delivery past deep midwicket, flat"
"back of a length outside off stump, pokes at it away from the body, beaten. Karthik appeals and pulls out immediately, entices Patel to go up too and in the end, it's what you call inadvertent trolling"
"back of a length at off stump, dropped into the point area off the back foot"
misfires the bouncer down leg side. Pollard is walking at him and lets it go from under his arm pit. Bowler not happy with that call
"another bouncer, this one hits him in the chest. He's through the hook short too early"
"back of a length outside off, arches back to try and beat short third man with a late cut. Finds him."
"short ball at off stump, drags it into the leg side with a pull. It was a slower ball, couldn't get power behind it"
"overpitched at leg stump, nonchalantly lifts this wide of long-on. It wasn't off the middle, but he still had control of that"
no control on this but it's four anyway. Short slower ball outside off. Swivels and pulls this as one hand comes off the bat. It splits deep square leg and deep midwicket
"back of a length outside off, skids through from under the attempted pull shot"
"back of a length at off stump, pushed on the up to extra cover"
"round arm action, arm ball at length, middle stump, pushes it towards long-off but extra cover dives to his right to cut it off"
"good length, angled in at middle stump, tapped to deep midwicket"
"full and fired in at 105 kph outside off stump, slams this hard down the ground and even Jadeja can't react fast enough. Long-off is across to cut it off though"
"predictable from Jadeja. Good length, angled in flat at off stump. He backs away and slaps this on the up, wide of long-off. Just clears the boundary line"
"good length at off stump, backs away again and drives uprightly to long-off"
"back of a length slower ball outside off stump, mistimed chop on the up to fine sweeper cover"
"<b>ouch.</b> Rohit is on the floor. Tye has bowled a full ball outside off stump that Pollard has thumped back at his partner who can't get out of the way quickly. It slams him plush on the side of his right knee. He's on the floor outside the crease but Tye is not looking for the run out. In fact, pushes him back into the crease as he checks on him. He's back up now, but standing well wide."
"back of a length outside off, slower ball sits up nicely and he flat-bats this straight over the bowler. McCullum very straight at long-off and leaps up to his right, but it's too powerful"
"full and fast at leg stump, no feet, whips it wide of long-on who is also quite straight for Pollard"
"knuckle ball, full at leg stump. Looks to whip this again, no timing. Thick inside edge to long leg"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off stump, drags it out to deep midwicket with a pull shot"
"goes for the yorker, misses, low full toss at middle stump that is driven straight to long-on"
"in the blockhole outside off stump. He squeezes it out to point and takes off, but Rohit's dodgy knee means he has no interest in this. Sends Pollard back. Kishan runs in fast but releases the ball a little too late. Doesn't hit the stumps in the end and it's an overthrow to deep square. Pollard was halfway down the pitch when he was sent back"
"yorker at middle stump, squeezed down to long-on"
"another perfect yorker. This slams into Pollard's pad but it has struck him outside leg stump. Big appeal, but it's a leg-bye to short third man in the end"
"low full toss at leg stump, flicks it straight to deep midwicket"
"sees Pollard walk at him. Adjusts and still finds the full length, but it's clipped off the toes to deep backward square"
"starts with an overpitched ball at leg stump, clears the front leg and tries to lift this over deep midwicket. He's got a lot of elevation on it but he can't beat Jadeja at deep midwicket"
"slower ball, full outside off stump. Throws his arms at this and gets it off the outside half of the bat, between backward point and short third man"
"slower ball, full at middle stump, flicked gracefully to deep midwicket's left"
"overpitched at leg stump, lifts it off the toe-end to long-on"
"good length, angled down the leg side past his attemped flick"
"slower ball, full at off stump. He has hammered this uppishly past the bowler's left hand. But once more McCullum is really straight"
"full outside off stump, nice flourish on the cover drive, but it's straight to sweeper cover"
"oh great from Rohit. He has a sore knee, but he's bent down nice and low in anticipation of the yorker. Cuts the length on it, cuts the angle too. Takes it on the full and dabs it fine past the keeper"
"yorker at leg stump, clears the front leg and pushes it with soft hands in front of long-on....where Jadeja runs it rapidly and picks up and throws to hit the stumps direct as Pandya returns. It's been referred....<b>and he's not out.</b>"
"yorker at off stump, backs away, exposes the stumps and squeezes it to sweeper cover's left...hobbles back for the second and wins it for his team"
