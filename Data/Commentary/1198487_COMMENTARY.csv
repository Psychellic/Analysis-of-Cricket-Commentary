"broke in sharply and hit him on the pad. Big shout, not given. <b>Sri Lanka are reviewing</b>. That's a cracking delivery, drifts a tad and spins back, leaving him with bat hanging outside off.

"full outside off, leans in and drives to sweeper cover"
<b>taken at mid-off!</b> Hasaranga gets his revenge! Tosses this one fuller and closer to Fakhar's swing. He hit him wide of mid-off last over when there was more width. This time he's forced to drive from inside the line and he ends up getting it off the low part of the outside half. Bat swivels in his hands and this floats seductively to Udana's right.

They retain this one
"short of a length on off stump, flicked to deep square. Looked like a legcutter"

"getting some shape is Pradeep but wrong line. Another one that ends up on the pads and he flicks it powerfully but straight to the fine leg fielder. Not happy with that, he though the should have placed it better"

"back of a length, nipping in a touch, he plays with bat close to body to punch to cover"
"full and wide outside off, he sees the opportunity on a loose ball and cuts it hard past point and into the boundary. <b>11th ODI century</b> for Babar Azam. It's been lovely to watch his batting."

"fullish length outside off, punched to mid-off from the front foot"
"<b>Thirimanne scores a direct hit at the non-striker's end from extra cover</b>. Length ball, Sarfaraz had pushed at it but got it a bit high on the bat. Set off for a run, and it needed a direct hit to run him out, which his opposite number nailed."
"full on off, driven firmly to long-off's left"

"that sort of slipped out of his hand, but Iftikhar has missed out. Full toss outside off, he tried to power it through cover but didn't connect"
"slower ball on a length outside off, but expertly played. Waited for it and cut it through backward point late."
goes for the wide yorker but doesn't get it wide enough and the batsman goes down on one knee to carve it to the square third man boundary
"that's been <b>smoked over wide long-on</b>. Miss your length on the yorker by inches and you disappear. Stunningly executed, , waited for it and almost helicoptered it over the boundary, using his powerful wrists to get the elevation and distance"
walks across and flicks it off his pads to deep square
"fuller on off, drilled to long-off"
"bad ball and sloppy fielding. Down leg side and Babar will feel he's missed out, as it takes the thigh pad and goes under his attempted pull. The keeper does very well to dive to his left and save the ball. But then there is a shy at the bowler's end and the ball ricochets off the stumps"
"<b>caught at square leg</b>. Not short enough to pull but he has a go at it anyway. The bat turned in his hand and the ball swirled up high. Square leg latched on and held on. That was a tired shot, but he's done his job."
"full on off stump, driven to long-off"
"slower ball, well disguised, the batsman was forced to adjust late and ends up just patting it back to the bowler"
"full on off, driven powerfully but straight to extra cover"
wanted to put the ball out of Iftikhar's reach but ends up bowling it too wide and he'll have to re-bowl that
another full toss missed. Nippy delivery in the channel and he tries to force it through cover but can't connect. Surprised by the full toss perhaps
"another slower ball, well disguised again. He had already gone down to sweep and he does that but can't get great timing on it as it rolls to short fine leg"
"<b>super shot</b>. Low full toss outside off and Imad takes a big stride forward, goes down on one knee and sweeps it square with perfect timing"
"full on off, slower one again, dug out to extra cover"

"slower ball, superbly disguised, length on off stump and the batsman was completely fooled, ended up only defending it"
"and a yorker now on the middle stump, this is excellent death bowling. He can only dig it out towards long-on"
"<b>dropped by Udana at long-off</b>. Another slower ball, wide of off stump, and Imad has a thrash at it. Goes off the toe end and Udana needed to be very quick on his feet to come in and catch it diving forward. Ends up not managing to get there as the ball bounces in front of him and goes through for four"
"follows it with a quicker yorker, which the batsman can only dig back out to the bowler"
tries to manufacture something thanks to the excellent bowling by coming down the track and Pradeep bowls a length ball outside off that he bunts to mid-off for a quick single
"slower ball, fetches the sweep from well outside off but can't beat square leg"
"another slower ball, on a length and angling across him this time. He's setting himself up to whack by opening his hips, but has to adjust each time, ends up slapping it gently through cover"
"the strangulation works. Pakistan weren't getting the ball away, and Imad saw a normal pace delivery and went for it. It was not the easiest to hit, back of a length outside off and his slash ends up as a top edge that loops to deep point, where it's safely held."
"finally gets some meat on the ball. Another slower ball, but this one is outside off and he's clearing his leg, waits for it and thrashes it with all brawn over mid-off"
"full on the pads, goes across and whips to deep square"
"<b>dropped by Pradeep at short fine leg</b>. Wahab is standing almost square on and Udana bowls it short and on the stumps, he gets inside the line to try and paddle-pull it over short fine, doesn't get hold of it. The ball is not travelling too fast but it's to Pradeep's right. Did he need to dive to get it? Perhaps not, but he does it and it bounces out of his hands"
good ball but unfortunate result for the fielding team. Yorker that followed the batsman who was backing away but it flicks the bottom part of the pad and runs down to the fine leg boundary
"<b>wham</b>. He was setting himself up for that, clearing his leg and becoming more square on, got it short enough to leather a pull. Not timed so well but hit so hard that it clears deep square leg"
"full on off, and carved out to long-off"
"magnificent bowling, pin-point yorker that hits boot and stays near the crease. They get a single with the fielders on the edge of the circle"
"picked up the slower ball and he deposits it over long-on. Too full and he's got the room to swing his arms freely, having cleared his front leg. Makes good, meaty connection"
"yorker to finish, but he goes deep in his crease and flicks to deep midwicket. It's only a two, but they try for the third and the throw is accurate so Wahab is run out at the non-striker's end"

"length on middle stump, 139kph. Closes the face and nudges this to midwicket"
"<b>tonks leg stump!</b> Pace has gone up progressively the last three balls. This one is 141kph. It has got the inside edge as he looks to drive this length ball from middle without a big stride. A sweet sound as ball strikes stump. There was a slight movement in, and he just got in a terrible position to drive, with front foot locked across the stumps and the head way in the off side"
"length on off stump, defended to mid-on on the front foot"
"length on middle stump, defended to mid-on"

length and in at off stump. Blocked to mid-on from the crease
short ball down leg side. Ducks under it
"<b>is there an edge? Yes there is!</b> But they're checking if the ball carried to Sarfaraz. <b>Soft signal is out.</b> Short of a length and slanted in from outside off.

"short of a length just outside off. Looks for the cut, mistimes and it trickles into the covers"
"<b>looks plumb on first look.</b> Oshada has reviewed it. Lenth ball curves in from off stump. He plays the original line outside off and the ball sneaks past the inside edge in the end he's just swishing aimlessly in front of his body. There's no inside edge. And there's no chance. Hits him in front of middle, it's going on to comfortably take leg stump as well. That's the review gone. That's Oshada gone. There's not much that isn't gone at the moment for the visitors"

"<b>top edge falls just short of cover</b>. Dug it in short and quick, too pacy for Shanaka, who is in no position to play the pull and is late on it moreover. More than bat hitting ball, that was ball hitting bat, taking the top edge to loop up. Cover swooping in but can't get there"
"length on the stumps, stays legside of it and pushes it past point"
"another quick bouncer, but he ducks into it. Pings off his helmet and flies over the slip fielder and into the fence. That a ball banged in short at Wahab's pace keeps as low as that should be worrying for the batsmen"
"full on off, driven to long-off"
tapped to midwicket
"turning into the left-hander, who is not reading it. Pitches outside off and he goes to push but it takes a thin edge onto pad"

pushed gently to long-on

"floated up full and wide, slapped to cover"

"turn again, but too short and wrong line too, easily whipped off his pads to fine leg"

too full and driven comfortably to long-off
"googly, doesn't read it, goes to drive, it rolls to mid-off from the outside half of the bat"
"huge appeal and that looked close, but maybe it turned too much. Sarfaraz is not interested in the review. Pitched on middle, he was coming on the front foot to drive, bat is nowhere near ball as it spits sharply and hits pad."
"turn again, he plays with the angle this time but still pops it in the air. Fortunately for him, no one at square leg"
"flat outside off, he stays low and cuts it to short third man"
"flatter again, slightly shorter, he swipes with a horizontal bat but no timing. The bowler fields"

turned to square leg
"bounced well short of the bowler, but it's a moral win for him. Way too early into the shot, trying to work it off his pads and it pops back towards the bowler"

"<b>that's travelling</b>. Down the track and this is an impressive shot, picks it up and lofts the drive straight and true. Hit so well it flies over the sightscreen!"
"drags him across by bowling this across him and spins it into him, but he has covered the spin with bat and pad close together, and it takes inside edge onto pad"
flicked to square leg
"too short and he goes down low to pull this fiercely, but without timing. There is a sweeper back"

"back of a length, cutting into him, but he plays it well, tucking it backward of square"
"outside edge goes for four. Got it to straighten a bit and Shanaka was poking at it with feet static, gets an edge that sends it very fine"
"and that's a much more confident shot, to a bad ball though. Strays on the pads and he goes across to come inside the line and tickle it fine"
"<b>stunning hit</b>. He was hanging on the back foot, expecting the short ball and Shinwari did just that. Except it didn't really bounce and Shanaka was able to unleash a fearsome pull over midwicket"

"off-cutter, he plays around it and it strikes pads. Comfortably going down though"
"quick single to mid-on. Risky one, could have been run out if fielder had collected cleanly"
given room outside off and he cuts it through point to make me write two sentences I didn't think I would. That's <b>Jayasuriya's half-century.</b> That's also the <b>100-run partnership!</b> Good effort by Imad who ran and dived at the point boundary to keep the ball inside

length ball fired in at off stump. Hurriedly defended into the off side
"<b>finds deep midwicket!</B> In three balls, a potential miracle has been seriously dented. That's a terrible delivery if you ask anyone, including the bowler himself. Very short on off stump. Backs away and looks to pull this over the midwicket boundary. It comes off the toe-end and Fakhar runs in, lunges and slides with grace as he holds on to this. Shanaka kept the scoring rate ticking early on and barely did anything wrong this evening. But he won't be there at the end for Sri Lanka either"

short of a length just outside off and <b>left alone.</b> So they have a plan
"<b>and he's bluffed him comprehensively!</b> Oh Wahab, why'd you do that to the poor No. 10. Bowls it short of a length. Kumara is fending for a bouncer because of that field change. He's trapped right in front of the stumps, on the knee flap, as this slides on from the surface. They don't have any reviews left, but Kumara doesn't look too livid about this so we could assume there's no bat on it"
