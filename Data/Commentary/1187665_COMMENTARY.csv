"tidy areas from Curran, shaping back into the right-hander who responds with a solid, imposing front-foot block"
"<em>swish!</em> Lovely wobble from Curran, curling past a hard-handed drive and through to the keeper. There's a slip in place and he's in business on that line"
"flapping across the line, Curran's gentle shape and probing length causing bother as the ball bobbles into the covers off the pad"
"tucked off the legs, an easy single to open the account"
"flinched to the leg side, finds the gap square of the wicket"
"a hack across the line, that was aimed into the covers but hauled out to midwicket with a distinct lack of timing. Curran proving hard to line up in that over"
"a waft off the legs, out to midwicket. Slip comes out to short cover in response"
"a mad hack at a length ball, inside-edged onto the pad and away to the keeper. Interesting... no timing to be found anywhere"
flashed to the leg side
"inches back of a length, pace off the ball, just not quite there for ... anything. Cunning bowling as Munro drills hard to no avail"
"keeping the ball on a string again, sensing Munro advancing to the pitch, and just moving that point of contact out of his arc. Prodded to the leg side"
"back of a length again, pitches outside leg but slams the pad as Munro swings into another flaccid mow across the line. A maiden! Gold dust!"
"shuffling to the leg side, poked to the covers. No width whatsoever, and cunning tight lines"
"shovelled round the corner, but with no placement once more"
"punched on the up, but once more the ball's not quite there to be driven"
"galloping to the pitch, but ends up yorking himself a touch with a bottom-handed bunt to Jordan inside the rope at long-on"
"inside-edge, and that's <B>dragged onto the middle stump!</B> Huge breakthrough ... he had a woeful time of it in the World Cup, but Guptill's levers can never be under-estimated. But that was the pure product of pressure. Had to make something happen, but had no width whatsoever to make it happen. A touch short, but arrow straight, and induces the error"
"timing at last, that's a better looking stroke, an uppercut into the covers off the nearest thing to width all morning. But the sweeper limits the damage. One hell of a start from the Curran brothers."
"outside off, a teasing channel, induces a slash to nothing"
"dabbed to short mid-off, 'hit em!' is the cry from Billings behind the stumps, but he's safely home"
"fired down the leg side, Billings does well to break off his off-field mic'ed up commentary to gather with a dive"
"<strong>this one's in the slot!</strong> The first of the innings, a touch too full on the offcutter, and Munro kneels into a powerful slog-sweep, so square, too square for fine leg"
"pace right off the ball this time, out of the back of the hand, and dribbles to the keeper on the fifth bounce"
good injection of pace as Munro can't pick it in time to connect on a wild hoick to leg
"back of a length, jags off the seam a touch, into a delicate leg glance. Slightly more success for New Zealand in that over but the shackles are very much on"
"pinged to the leg side, the field is well set square of the wicket"
"chiselled off the toes, a mirror-image of Archer's World-Cup-winning delivery, and tucked in a similar direction, albeit left-handed. No danger of a desperate run-out this time though!"
"sits up and begs, and <B>that is pongoed onto the grass!</B> Standing tall on impact, and utterly butchered!"
finds the gap with another nudge
"<B>here comes Munro!</B> Curran's third over, and he's starting to pick him now, another gallop to the pitch and battered hard over the ropes at long-on!"
"shorter ball, and a <B>cunning flick up and over fine leg!</B> Just helped on its way over the shoulder, and now New Zealand are motoring!"
"slower ball to open his account, nudged to the leg side"
angled delivery across the left-hander's bows Just inside the tramlines
"slower ball, hard to pick up as Munro baseball-biffs another big wind-up across the line"
"yorker, cunning change-up, stabbed out to cover"
"back of a length, hits the seam and jags into a defensive block on the back foot"
"<strong>chipped to midwicket!</strong> Morgan pouches a lollipop off a low full toss, and Munro cuts a frustrated figure as he troops off... he was just beginning to enjoy himself out there"
"good wheels to launch his spell, back of a length, gentle twist to off, and pushed to the covers"
"pumped on the up, over midwicket, slightly short from Rashid and pounced upon"
"better length, much fuller, and pressed to the off side with the turn"
"googly, well bowled, not convincingly picked from the hand but pushed away off the deck well enough"
"back of a length, chopped uppishly to short third man"
"bottom-handed thump to the leg side, a decent sighter from the senior spinner. The only spinner today, in fact"
"back of a length , a bit of a nothing ball to start, and a fellow debutant fumbles badly on a one-handed pick-up. Lewis Gregory's first touch isn't much to write home about"
"lovely ball, just ghosting past the edge, and the edge of the stump. That's the knuckleball, engines off, just floating down to the deck"
cracked off the back foot to third man
"on the toes, chopped uppishly to wide long-on. Just another stock ball for now"
"that one was definitely held back in the hand, and it so nearly induced a mistimed poke to cover! One bounce to the man on the edge of the circle"
"full length, into the legs, flicked on its way to deep midwicket"
"flogged with intent, reversing the stance, using the wind to aid his approach"
nurdled for the single
"zips through on a full length, under-edged chop into the off side"
"tossed up, dips on a full length, blocked to the leg side"
"googly, hoicked with the spin to midwicket"
drawn forward on a middle-and-off line and blocked again
"full length knuckleball, chipped high into the leg side... anyone out there? Yes,  but he's bissected two men well, a decent relay gather to intercept the boundary"
clipped off the legs once more
another nurdle to the leg side
"sort ball, well directed, and a useful reminder that he's not all knuckleballs and powder-puffs. He's got a yard of pace hidden up his sleeve too"
"banged in short, and de Grandhomme is onto it in a flash, leaving his bottom hand behind in the process! But no, <B>he's smoked it!</B> High over midwicket and away into the grass banks!"
"another ambitious flog through the line, less timing on this occasion. New Zealand are brawling after a tough start"
"bottom of the bat, a thick outside edge... Vince steadies himself in the deep... <strong>and snaffles the breakthrough wicket!</strong> Rashid's cunning makes the difference, at a key moment too"
"punched firmly through the line, down to long-off"
"tossed up, into the toes, eludes a bottom-handed clip across the line"
"bottom-handed drill once more, down to long on"
"nurdled to the leg side, looking for two, but Jordan has a bullet arm and he's onto it quickly in the deep"
"back of a length, another wrong'un, repelled on the back foot as Taylor shuffles across his stumps. Fine over"
"round the wicket, into the legs, nudged off the pads and finds enough angle to bring on the two"
"round the wicket once more, hits the splice hard from just back of a length"
"closes the face on impact to tuck a leg glance to backward square, Curran cramping for room on the round-the-wicket angle"
"tucked with the angle once more, a single to long-on. This is a decent set so far"
"well bowled again, shaping into the off stump from round the wicket, nurdled off the legs, but Taylor has placed that well, with a lack of pace forcing a long chase in from the rope"
"closes the face, another single behind square on the leg side. Scurran is bowled out, and that's a handy spell... one damaging over aside"
"flogged into the covers, the throw could have been interesting, but it was off balance and they return safely for two"
"<strong>slog-swept, and brilliantly so!</strong> Fired down the leg side, at pace, but it needed a good contact to make the most of it. Taylor didn't miss out"
"better line from Rashid, faster and flatter but outside off and turning in. Drilled for the single to cover"
"sharp single again, behind square on the leg side"
"biffed to the off side, not a lot of width"
"held back outside off, no pace to work with as a slashing cut is unfurled to deep point"
"loose full-toss, flogged high across the line, high on the bat, and <strong>swallowed in the deep! </strong>But will this be a no-ball? It's touch and go ... definitely dipping at the point of impact, about a metre outside the crease... and Seifert has to walk! Looked like a back-of-the-hander from Jordan, so was losing pace all the time. Tough, but just about fair I think"
"slower ball, outside off, dabbed to the off side"
tapped to the on side
"slower ball, skids under the bat and past the off stump. England have bowled well today"
"pumped to deep point, very full length"
"decent line, top of off, blocked back to the bowler"
"slower ball, Taylor waits and waits on the back foot, and taps to the on side"
"dabbed to the leg side once again, singles won't cut it right now"
"<B>nudged ever so fine!</B> Slightly leg-sided on a very full length, and that races away"
poked with a very straight blade down to long-off. Tidy line and full length
"tapped to the leg side, the lack of pace in the shot earning the second run as the cow corner sweeper hurtles in"
no angle for Mitchell to work with there. Excellent holding over from Curran
settles for the single as Brown takes the pace off once more
"a hack across the line, the ball was there for the shot, but it never quite arrived. Midwicket gathers on the bounce"
"slow and straight, tucked to the leg side, and a single is all they can get from that flick"
"back of a length, clubbed to long-off as Brown pulls the parachute cord on another slow-floater"
"outside off, dabbed behind square, for a gentle tumbling stop at backward point"
"<B>that's the ticket for New Zealand!</B> Fractionally over-pitched from Brown, met with a firm stride and an upwardly mobile drill over long-off. Conventional power and plenty placement!"
"<strong>beauty from Jordan!</strong> Pace very much on the ball that time, tight line outside off, but it was through Taylor like a dose of salts... and Morgan has called for the <B>review!</B> It was a wild flashing drive, but was there bat involved? I don't think so ...probably bat on ground... inconclusive either way. On we go."
"bashed firmly out to square leg, as Jordan aims very full once more"
"crunched out to the leg side. Full, fuller, fullest"
"misses his mark this time, only fractionally, but Taylor finally had one he could crash through the line. Jordan almost got a hand on it to intercept, as only he can"
"back on a better fuller length, settles for the single"
"<B>flipped off the toes!</B> A hit to nothing for Mitchell, with the end of the over looming and wickets in hand. But Jordan strayed just a fraction onto leg stump to aid his decision-making!"
"flogged high over point, chiselling out the very full length on a fractionally wide line"
"back of the hand from Curran, well directed, full and straight"
"bashed out to deep midwicket, this is tidy work from England. New Zealand still not quite daring to cut loose"
"<strong>that's ferocious power!</strong> Big backlift, scything drive, hard through the bowler's followthrough as Curran opted to put pace on the ball that time"
"sat back in the crease, pulling with intent as Curran dropped his length back. Midwicket gathers"
"honked across the line, line and length and variation from Curran, putting the ball in the right area but at an indeterminate pace. Midwicket in play once more as a decent set of four overs ends for TKC"
"flashed hard into the covers off a full length, but intercepted on the edge of the ring. A precious dot"
"<B>pounded hard to deep midwicket, and Vince drops a low chance!</B> It was travelling, but he should have snaffled that, leaning forward"
"crunched into the covers again, an athletic intercept on the edge of the circle"
"too short, and <B>cracked murderously over midwicket!</B> You can't bowl there to Ross Taylor!"
"wide line, inside-edged as Taylor reaches for the ball"
"tidy line and length to finish his set, pumped out to extra cover, the conventional strokes aren't finding the gaps today"
"a yawning mow across the line, but they miss out on the second run as the ball plugs in space"
"short, but gets away with it as Mitchell gloves a swinging pull"
"pounded to cow corner, as Taylor fails to line up the cutter, and <B>that's Brown's first international wicket! </B>A big scalp too, as Jonny Bairstow stoops well to gather"
"flinched to the leg side, keeping a tight leash in this final over"
"an ambitious hack out to backward square, as Brown's improbable trickery just disrupts the timing on impact once again"
"short, pace on the ball this time, and Mitchell is slightly surprised as he top-edges his pull, but short of the man on the rope. That's an exceptional over at the death from the debutant, and England have done the needful in the field."
"gentle outswinger to start, checked drive from YJB finds the man at cover"
"very wide on the crease and angling in, just full of a length and Bairstow works it to mid-on"
"inswinger on a length, Bairstow looks to work it into the leg side and inside-edges into his pad. Stifled appeal but clearly bat first"
"hangs this outside off, Bairstow throws the bat at it and inside edges past the stumps to short fine leg where Ferguson makes a tumbling stop"
"back-of-a-length slower ball outside off, Bairstow looks to club it down the ground cross-batted but doesn't connect well"
"sends this one way down the leg side, rightly called wide"
"tighter to the stumps, slightly full of a length in and around fourth stump, defended back to the bowler. Tight start from Southee"
"short and wide to start, Malan square drives out to that man at deep point"
"fullish and wide outside off, Bairstow looks to pierce the infield but finds short cover"
"back of a length and hung outside off, cuts hard to Santner out on the fence at deep point"
"fullish and straight, strikes Malan on the front pad as he looks to work to leg but pitched outside"
"back of a length, <b>151kph/94mph</b>, hurries Malan up and he mistimes it back towards the bowler"
"fires in a leg-stump yorker, well dug out. Great start from the Kiwi seamers"
"length ball on off stump angling in, Bairstow whips it nonchalantly through midwicket for <b>England's first boundary</b>"
"a touch shorter outside off, looks to whack this through the same region but finds mid-on"

"length ball again, looks to work to leg but finds the fielder"
"back of a length slower ball outside off, Bairstow picks it early and <b>thumps</b> this over midwicket for four, one bounce. Nothing like a good old-fashioned mow!"
"full on fourth stump but something of a half-volley, Bairstow throws the kitchen sink at it and it squirts away through point for another boundary. Expensive over..."
"length ball angling across the left-hander, Malan looks hurried but clears the front leg and smears it through midwicket off the bottom edge"
"hurries him up again, Malan gives himself room but can't get it through the off side"
"slower ball, just about picks it and whips it away through square leg to the sweeper for a jogged single"
"runs his fingers across it again, gave himself room outside off, Ferguson hang it out there and Bairstow couldn't connect, falling over as he tried to cut. Wanted a wide, not given."
"length ball on fifth stump, Bairstow looks to <b>crunch</b> this through mid-off but only finds the fielder in the ring on the bounce"
"again Bairstow looks to give himself room, backing away, but Ferguson follows him and he can't get it away. Good cat and mouse, this"
"yorker just outside off stump, knocked back to the bowler off the toe"
"slowie which Malan doesn't pick, through the shot early and it skews out to midwicket"
"outswinger angling across the left-hander from over the wicket, tries to smash it over long-off but misses it altogether. Pressure on Malan"
"back of a length on leg stump and <i>nearly</i> a blinding catch from Guptill at square leg! Not dissimilar to that one at Lord's vs Australia in the World Cup, smashed at him but he can only tip it over the bar and it skews away for four"
clears the front leg and knocks a length ball to mid-off for one
"low full toss on middle-and-leg, Bairstow taps it to mid-on and they hurry through"

"uses his feet to give himself a bit of room, look to go through the covers again but finds the fielder this time"
"speared in towards leg stump, Bairstow gets down to slog-sweep but mistimes it out to square leg. 'Rate goes up boys!' cries an enthusiastic Seifert"
"uses his feet, Santner pulls his length back a touch and throws it wider. Malan looks to flay it away over long-off but can only <b>spoon it up to third man</b> off the outside edge, and Ish Sodhi isn't dropping that. New Zealand get the breakthrough!"
"length ball, slides on with the arm but Vince plays an elegant square drive off the back foot for four past the diving cover point. <b>Glorious!</b>"
"fullish on fourth stump, driven to mid-off on the half-volley"
"good flight, length on leg stump, Vince works it straight to the man at short midwicket"

"goes on with the arm from round the wicket, punched out to the sweeper at cover for an ambled single"
"length outside off, rocks back and whips this through midwicket for another jogged single"
"gives himself room outside leg and square drives through point. They aren't sure whether to come back, a bit of a stutter but the sweeper misfields and they get back"
"strays too short, Vince knocks this back to the bowler who fields well low to his right"
"thrown a little wider outside off, Vince looks to sweep but can't connect"
"length outside off, going on with the arm. Vince tries to pierce the gap but can only find short extra cover, and lets out a little groan of frustration. The squeeze is on..."
"length ball, tossed up above the eyeline. Plays a wristy flick out to Santner sweeping at midwicket, but the throw comes in to save a second"

"back of a length, outside the off stump, picks up the length early but doesn't nail the pull on the swivel and they jog through for a single"

"back of a length on off stump, and chopped down to third man on the fence"

"back of a length, angling across Morgan who dabs it down to third man like a mirror-image Kane Williamson, but without the glorious beard"
