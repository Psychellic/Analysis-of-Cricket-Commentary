"pitched further up and outside off, Amin strides out. He checks his drive and pushes it up to extra cover"
"back of a length and veering down the leg side again, grazes the thigh pad and rolls away fine past the keeper. Sanga had to endure a bad bounce too. Re-set the radar, Mr.Irfan. Okay replays suggest no contact with the pad. Five wides. Bonus runs for Quetta"
"good length on off stump, Irfan brings the batsman forward into a <strong>uppish drive to mid-off</strong>"
"good length on off, forward and scooped to mid-on hanging back for one"
"back of a length and speared at off stump, Watson plays late, and runs a single down to deep third man"
both the left-arm quicks aren't getting their lines right. Tanvir now slides a length ball down the leg side as Watson flicks and does not touch it
"dug in shorter on off, Watson stands tall and punches crisply but can't get it past extra cover. The ball is coming onto the bat nicely in Sharjah today"
"on a length and outside off, Watson drives it on the up but straight to mid-off inside the circle"
<strong>short and hits the bat hard</strong> as opposed to bat hitting ball. The ball rolls away to cover
"<strong>slower cutter, keeps low</strong>, thigh-high ball. Watson does not read the change-up. He slogs and misses, wearing it on the body"

"short and outside off, Amin sizes up the bounce and rides a single down to third man. Neatly done"
"just short of a good length and outside off, Watson is a touch early into the pull and drags a inside edge that flies over the stumps"

"good length and angling across off, gentle little dab with the angle to backward point"
"back of a length and outside off, punched through the line but straight to short extra cover"
"short and attacking the stumps, drop and run to mid-off"
"hint of width, Watson stands up tall and cracks the ball straight to backward point"
Watson stays leg-side of this back-of-a-length ball and smears it to short extra. The ball bursts through the hands of the fielder
"Tanvir has Amin holing out to Irfan at deep third man. Good length and put outside off, Amin aims a low-percentage slog across the line and only sends a thick outside edge to Irfan in the deep. Dolly catch"
"back of a length and angling away outside off, opens the face of the bat and secures a single to deep third man"
"bowled'im. <strong>Another low-percentage slog</strong>, this time from the new man Rameez. He races down the track to his second ball but is nowhere close to the pitch. He, however, aims to whack it out of the ground. Instead, he watches Junaid leave his stumps in disarray"

clipped off the pads to the left of square leg
"Sarfraz steps away outside leg, collapses his back leg, and drives it inside-out over extra cover. Delightful timing from the Quetta captain"

"darted outside off, cracked through the line to the covers"
"<strong>shot, Watson</strong>! Hip-high short ball on off stump, Watson sizes it up and swats it up and over midwicket"
"Another short(ish) ball, another pull from Watson, this time he holes out to the man in the deep. It was in the slot for the pull, but Watson gets more height as opposed to distance. He finds Maqsood at the edge of the midwicket boundary. Pretty, little innings from Watson. Quetta needed more from him"

"lobbed up on middle, Rossouw collapses his back leg and lifts it inside-out over the long-off boundary"
"Sanga misses the stumping? He juggles, has a second bite at it, and then breaks the stumps. That Sanga had so much time to recover gives an idea of how far down the pitch had Rossouw come. He dares to use his feet, Malik pulls his length back and holds this back. The batsman slogs and misses, Sanga misses too, but snatches at the ball, and catches Rossouw short eventually"

glanced off the pads wide of short fine leg for one

"full on middle, slapped down to long-on"
"<strong>Tahir knocks out the leg stump</strong>. The legspinner lures the batsman out of the crease, the ball dips and hits the stumps. The procession continues for Quetta. Poor shot selection from Hasan Khan"
Tahir is on a hat-trick on now. He sets off on a celebratory run. <b>Catch him if you can</b>. Quetta have lost four wickets in six balls. This was the wrong'un - fuller and breaks back in - the Big Duke has no clue about the variation. He plays outside the line for the legbreak. Gone
"Whoa!<strong> Imran Tahir claims a hat-trick in the PSL</strong>. Look at the celebrations. Back-to-back celebratory sprints for Tahir. Look at him go. He becomes the third player - after Amir and Junaid - to bag a hat-trick in the league. This was full and straight, the skidder, Rahat Ali plays back to it like most No.11s do. He is pinned in front of middle. Rahat reviews. Only he knows why. This was clattering into the middle stump. Quetta have been skittled for 102"
