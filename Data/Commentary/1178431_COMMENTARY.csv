"<b>huge appeal</b> from Mitch for lbw. Full ball catches Lynn in front of leg stump. Rohit says no bat to Mitch as they consider the review. <b>He is wrong, that is a big edge.</b> It's also pitched outside leg. They don't end up taking the review though, so it's all good in the end. Lynn just jabbing at this in front of the body"

<b>mistimed</b> drive and Pollard can sprint behind this from mid-off and keep it in. Full toss outside off and it came off the toe-end. Looked like he was a little too eager to get that away
<b>slipped out of his hand</b> and chopped over point. It's an attempted offcutter and it ends up a juicy full toss at chest height with lots of width

<b>that looks plumb.</b> It's given. And Lynn tells Gill that's not worth the review. Hardik starts with a slower ball that floats up full and at middle stump. Gill doesn't pick and is beaten as he looks to flick this. Caught dead in front of middle

"length at middle stump, hurriedly pushed to midwicket"
"slower short ball wide outside off, cut to sweeper's left"
<b>taken by QDK!</b> Yet another slower ball from Hardik to get a KKR opener. This dips at a length outside off. He makes room and has an ugly heave at it. Not anywhere close to the ball and gets a top edge that QDK has to go backwards to gather. He does it with some comfort. The wheels have come off for KKR

"Uthappa looks to run a length ball down to third man, but he's beaten on the outside edge. McCleneghan took the pace off that one"
"and now he's down the track, looking to thump another cutter at under 125km/h through the covers, but failing to put bat to ball"
"cracked hard to mid off, but Pollard is in that position and there's no run to be had. Another dot"
"four in a row! Uthappa sets himself for an uppercut at a slow, short cutter at 121km/h, but it's another <b>play and a miss</b>"
"five! Uthappa has really been backed into a corner here. Another gentle length delivery, in the corridor, but he looks to hit it rather too hard and touches only fresh air"
<b>it's a maiden</b> as Uthappa looks to run another one down and is beaten yet again outside off. There's a touch of panic starting to set in ...
"Krunal darts in a low full toss from around the stumps, but Karthik can't make much of it, sweeping out to deep backward square"
"another dot, and it's a full toss too, dipping in towards off stump to be driven down to long off"
"flicked off the toes into the leg side, just the one"
"Robbie looks for a big biff over the leg side, but the ball rushes on to him, beating the bat and hitting the pad"
"left alone outside off! Krunal pushes this through slightly wider of off stump, and Uthappa just lets it past"

"<b>sweet relief!</b> Robbie has finally got hold of one, smiting a full slower ball over long on for a pressure-relieving six"
"and he looks for the same again, but the ball takes a thick inside edge onto the pad and rolls to short fine for a single"
"Karthik looks to glance off his legs, but the ball zips in to hit him on the pad. It pitched well outside leg, Malinga continuing around the stumps"
"<b>a leaping Krunal snaffles one!</b> Malinga slung another full one in towards the pads, Karthik looking to flick him to midwicket but neither keeping it along the turf nor getting any real elevation in the shot. Krunal is in position at midwicket, inside the circle, and he times his leap just right to pluck the ball out of the air"
"dug in by Lasith, but it's misdirected down the leg side"
"there's an appeal, and it's given! Russell falls to the very first legitimate delivery he faces, and what was clearly a plan from Malinga has worked. He targeted Russell with another bumper from around the stumps, but this one was bang on target. Russell found himself in an awkward position, and he could neither get out of the way nor drop his hands quickly enough, the ball brushing the gloves on the way through to the keeper"
"another short one at just under 135km/h, and Rana does manage to drop his hands under this one as it fizzes through to de Kock"
"Bumrah's back, and he starts with a gem of a delivery just outside off that bursts off the track and past Uthappa's outside edge - yet another play-and-miss"

""
"runs, finally! Uthappa backs away to leg and slashes a length ball behind point, beating third man on his right"
"<b>picked up into the stands!</b> Uthappa is moving around a lot in the crease, and he goes really deep to this short ball, using the pace and the angle to lift it into the stands beyond deep backward square leg for a vital boundary"
"<b>lifted elegantly over long off!</b> The ball was in the slot, a long half volley just outside off, but Rana also struck it really well, holding his shape and letting the right elbow lead the shot"
"this one is a little more agricultural, Rana backing away to leg and hacking a full one over the covers. They hurry back for a second"
"<b>over third man this time!</b> Rana is all over the place in the crease, backing away to leg. Hardik follows him with a short one, but Rana shows excellent awareness with third man up, ramping the ball up and over the fielder. And in fact, he's hit it so well that the ball carries all the way for six"
"Hardik switches back to over the stumps, Rana shimmying into a leg glance. He doesn't get the best connection, but there's room enough for a quick single"
"Hardik takes some pace off this full one, outside off, Uthappa setting himself for an almighty heave into the leg side but playing too early at it and missing yet another one. <b>48 dot balls in the innings so far</b>"
"a bottom-handed slog into the leg side bounces down to long on, it's just the single and he'll keep the strike"
"Malinga stays around the stumps, slinging down a very full ball that's dug out down the ground"
"Malinga switches to over the stumps for the left-hander, Rana slicing a low full toss outside off out to the cover sweeper, on the bounce"
""
"well bowled, right up to him at 137km/h, but Rana's execution is equally good as he waits deep in the crease and angles his blade to work the ball behind point for a single"
"Uthappa can't lay bat on this leg-stump yorker, but they pinch a single off his boot. There's a stifled appeal from Malinga, but it pitched outside leg"
"canny bowling, pace off the ball to finish the over, but Rana waits on it and dead-bats a quick single towards point"
"and he shoots one across Rana's bows, the left hander making some room but missing an attempted thrash into the off side"
"Rana walks across to the off side, glancing off his pads and out to deep square for a single"
"nicely bowled, Bumrah bustling in and delivering a waspish full ball aimed at the off stump. Uthappa does well to dig it out, and gets a single for his troubles"
"<b>direct hit might have had him!</b> Rana pushed this just to the left of Rohit in the cover, who swoops and shies, but it goes wide"
"flung down well wide of off stump, wide of the popping crease, but it's not a wide as Uthappa had wandered in that direction too, missing an airy drive"
"<b>down the ground!</b> There was almost more height than distance on this as Uthappa slugged a full toss straight over Bumrah's head. Pollard is lurking at long on, and positions himself early, but the ball has just enough on it to beat him"
"<b>swatted over cow corner!</b> KKR need these runs so desperately. Rana fetches a length delivery cleanly into the leg side, the ball sailing well back into the crowd"
"<b>but now he's got to go!</b> Rana was looking to smash everything, and he went very deep in the crease looking to smear this over long off. But the connection isn't enough to get the ball past Pollard, who trots in and holds a simple catch at long off"
"Malinga loses his radar, and this one is called wide"
<b>and this one is called wide for height now</b> Malinga digging in a bouncer that balloons well over the batsman
"fuller this time, and Uthappa swings past it as he looks to wallop this down the ground"
"nicely bowled, very full and Uthappa can only dig it out back to the bowler"
"Malinga continues around the stumps, angling a full one right across Uthappa, who flings his arms through a booming drive but can't put bat to ball. The struggle continues"
"very full once again, and Uthappa clubs it into the leg side for a single to keep the strike"
"and he pushes his first ball too far outside off, and it's called wide. McCleneghan reckons its a harsh call"
"well, this is almost an identical delivery, but the umpire lets this one pass. And now Uthappa is the unhappy one"
"McCleneghan sticks with the plan of attack, pushing this full and wide, but this is too far and a clear wide"
"Uthappa finds this one within his reach, spanking it down the ground - but it's just the single"
"slapped out through the covers, but it's off the toe end and just the one"
"McCleneghan gifts another wide, pushing the ball too far outside off as he looks to keep it out of Uthappa's striking zone"
"short, quick and Uthappa gets an awful connection on his attempted pull. But in the end, that's what saves him as the ball cannot even reach long on"
"Rinku almost swings himself off his feet trying to hammer this back-of-a-length ball over the leg side, but fails to put bat to ball"
"another heave to leg, but this time bat meets ball and they take a single off the bottom edge"
"very full and angled across Rinku, who aims for the proverbial 'Row M' but can only cue-end a single to long on"
"<b>peach of a delivery!</b> This is a fine slower ball from Bumrah, who takes his pace right down to the low 120s, Uthappa through his shot hours before the ball gets to him"
"an attempted heave into the leg side instead brings a single down to long off, Uthappa playing a little too early at another slower one"
"Rinku swings hard to leg and the ball takes the top edge, but it's such a poor connection that it doesn't reach long on, Hardik running in from the boundary"
"<b>a leading edge, a simple catch!</b> Uthappa trudges off, his misery over. The disappointment is writ large on his face as he walks off. It was another slower one, it takes the toe end, and Sharma holds a simple catch in the covers"
"and Rinku holes out off the last ball, aiming to end it with a maximum but getting more height than distance in the shot. Hardik and Pollard are down on the straight boundary, and it's Hardik who calls early and holds the catch"
"length outside off, defended into the off side"
"short of a length outside off, mistimed cut to backward point"
<b>just clears fine leg!</b> QDK falls over into the off side as he gets underneath a short ball and hooks. His position means this ball is going to get more elevation than distance. But the distance to clear isn't too long here
