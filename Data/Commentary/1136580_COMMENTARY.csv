This was short and wide outside off, flat-batted away to wide long-off, where Pandey, one of India's best fielders, fumbles. Rayudu senses an opportunity for an extra run. Raina also (seemingly) calls for the second. Pandey throws the ball to Kaul, who fumbles too. He then runs after the ball, tags it to Williamson, who takes the bails off to catch Rayudu short at the non-striker's end. Rayudu can't undo his steps in time"
