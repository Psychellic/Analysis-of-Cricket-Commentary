"length, around off, and he lets this pass. Not a lot of bounce on this through to Pooran"
"shorter, straighter, and defended towards point"
"fuller, and he fails to connect with a drive. Slightly quicker at 131.7kph"
"length, just around off, and driven to cover"
"moves across to the leg side, opens up some space for himself on the off, and thrashes this over point. A couple of bounces and through to the boundary"
"straighter, driven to mid-on"
"length, a bit of movement back in, and played with a dead bat towards the on side, and they scamper through for one"
"length, sits up a bit around off, and he drives to cover. Good stop low to his left by Fletcher"
"swish and a miss. Guptill looks to move across to the on side again, and ends up playing outside the line of one that jags back from outside off"
"angles in, and gets to the pads, from where Guptill can tuck this away with fine leg inside the circle"
"<strong>this goes through Pollard at mid-off.</strong> It's fuller, and Guptill plays a lofted drive. It's away to Pollard's left, and he seems to have not picked this early. Just off his fingertips, and through for four"
"dug in short, but down the leg side. He'll have to rebowl this, as Guptill fails to connect with a hook"
"fuller, driven hard, but Hetmyer stops this, diving away to his left at wide cover"
"a bit of shape back into him, and he plays this towards short mid-wicket. Hetmyer goes for the underarm throw, but fails to connect at the non-striker's end. Could have been close if he had hit"
"cutter, goes across him. Guptill looks to load up and go down the ground, but is beaten by that change of pace"
"slower ball again, just around off, and he drives this to point"
"fuller ball, and Guptill goes across the line. Struck on the pads, and not given leg before. Pollard reviews, but I think the <strong>impact may have been outside leg</strong>. It's still a better line, when he gets it closer to the stumps, though he has a long-off in place. It is, in fact, pitching outside leg"
"fuller, on the pads, whipped away, but there's a deep square leg in place"
"dug in short, into the body of Seifert, and he wafts it away with one hand towards deep square leg"
"starts with a gentle full toss wide outside off, perhaps looking for the yorker, and he can squirt this past point, and to the right of short third man"
"lofts this over mid-off, and gets it through to the fence on one bounce. Too full for the field he has, with two men deep on the on side"
"length, angles back in, and he defends towards mid-off"
"fuller, straighter, and driven uppishly, but short of cover"
"short, but decent pace on this at 138kph, and Seifert can just fend this off towards square leg. Looks for the pull, but that hurries on to him, and forces him to just dab it away"
"short, through past Guptill before he can essay a little chip over the keeper's head. Mid 130s again"
"length, Seifert looks to drive. Off the edge, but placed perfectly between point and short third man"
"fuller, towards leg stump, and jams Seifert as he looks to play this towards the leg side"
"length, driven to Pollard at mid-on with the natural angle into him"
"<strong>SHOT!</strong> Goes into Guptill's arc, at just early 130s in speed, and he swings this over long-on. Didn't even move after hitting it"
"length, defended to point from around off"
"unlucky again for Paul. Guptill shapes to swat a length ball straight down the ground, but if flies off the outside edge and goes over point"
"length, drops this with soft hands to the off side and calls his partner through"
"<strong>top shot!</strong> Guptill moves across to open up some room on the off, Thomas responds with a sharp short ball, and Guptill just guides this towards third man. And it lands somewhere deep in the grass banks!"
"dropped with soft hands to the right of the keeper, and they pinch a single"
"plays this on to his stumps, in an attempt to paddle this to fine leg. Just three balls to go in the powerplay, and perhaps Seifert felt he needed to do something to match Guptill. Oshane Thomas kept it full and didn't follow Seifert, who had moved across to a second or even third set of stumps outside off. Ends up edging it back on to the stumps"
"fuller, angles across him, and he looks to dab this towards the off side, but is beaten by some late movement"
"length, angles across him, and he drives this to point"
"drags this a bit short, and it's pulled away towards deep backward square leg, and Oshane Thomas has let this slip through his legs"
"fired in, and he looks to flick this away. Collected by Pooran down the leg side, and he immediately goes up in appeal. <strong>Not given, and they review this</strong>. They might have actually gotten away with a wide here, as it doesn't seem to have hit bat or pad on its way through. <strong>Oh no, there's a very fine edge through!</strong> What a big wicket for Allen to pick up off just his second ball"
"fuller length, a bit more flight, and he drives this to long-off"
"drags this a bit short, and wide, but he can only cut this to the sweeper at deep point"
"angles into him with the arm, and he drives this to the sweeper at cover"
"fuller, swept, and goes down to fine leg. The bowler thinks he could have had a shot at leg before if he had missed"
"slow cutter around off, and he drives this towards long-on"
"cutter, and he walks across the crease to play this away towards fine leg"
"cutter, around middle, and he works this towards deep square leg. Played with soft hands, and they are able to get two"
flicked towards mid-wicket with the incoming angle. No pace to work with
"short, and he hangs back and places this to the right of deep mid-wicket. Good shot"
"length, angles in, and he can only drive this back towards the bowler"
driven back to the bowler
"a bit short, around off, and he can cut this hard towards deep backward point. A wayward throw, but Hetmyer backs up well at square leg"
looks to swing this around the corner to square leg. Off the pads
"reverse sweep attempted, and Hetmyer stops this at short third man"
"down the wicket, taken on the full, driven to wide long-off"
"short, and he drives this towards long-on"
"bowled at 119kph just around off, driven to deep point. They run with urgency, but can only pick one off this"
"slower ball, and he allows it to come to him, and then swings this away to deep backward square leg. Timed to perfection"
"slower ball, and he whips this away towards deep square leg. Takes the bottom hand off, and that allows them enough time to come back for two"
"short, around leg stump, and played away towards deep mid-wicket. They look for two, but have to settle for just one"
"slower, around off, and he looks to bash this through the off side. Off the inside edge, and drops just by his right leg"
"<strong>that's a good shot!</strong> Waits on this, and whips this over deep square leg"
pulls a short ball out to deep square leg
swats a good length ball from deep in his crease to long-on
the plan is definitely to take pace off - which is obvious on a slow pitch - but here Paul's offcutter is too far outside off
pulls a back of a length ball to deep square leg
rocks back - he's set up for the slower balls into the pitch. He waits - which is very important. Then right when the ball is under his eyes - short of a length - he pulls it over deep square leg. Outstanding batting
"this one's at full pace and Phillips is ready for this too. It's a gift really. Short. Wide. Hit me written all over it. And hit he does, through point"
"away to fine leg. Paul keeps going all in on these short balls, this time he gets one to climb on Phillips, up to his neck and shoulder. But the batsman is eager to take it on and hooks it away"
"works a shortish ball way outside leg right to short fine leg. That was a boundary opportunity, anywhere to the left of right of Cottrell, I think it was"
"he's set up for the reverse scoop over third man so so early. The bowler isn't even into the delivery stride. It's a mis-hit. They get one to Cottrell, whose throw ends up as overthrows"
dabs it between deep midwicket and long-on and he plays it so gently that he pinches a couple
launches it down the ground! Phillips' innings was disrupted by that freak injury last game. He is absolutely purring today. Targeting 360 degrees. This one is a simple length ball on off stump and he pumps it over Powell's head
angles it into the pads and manages to keep Phillips to a block
drives to extra cover
"looks for the cut, gets an inside edge that bounces over the stumps and past the keeper's outstretched right hand"
"whoa! Keeper doesn't know where the ball is. Phillips doesn't know where it is. It's about a foot away from the stumps and all this comedy could well have resulted in the big-hitter being run-out for no reason. Oooh, and in addition to all that action - which by the way was a good length ball wide of off stump which Phillips wanted to cart over long-on and missed - it's a no-ball too."
thundering hit over long-on. The free hit disappears into the crowd. Length ball. Room to hit through the line. Phillips says thank you very much. I'll send you an early Christmas card
"<b>half-century! With a monster hit over point!</b>. The WI plan is to hide the ball from his reach. Allen goes wide outside off stump, but Phillips is able to reach it and his hands - his powerful hands and insane bat speed - takes care of the rest"
thumps it down the ground now. Allen has no clue what to do here. Goes back bowling length onto the stumps and Phillips clears his front leg and goes bang.
goes over the wicket and manages to beat his bat with a pitched up ball on leg stump that turns just enough. Pretty close to off stump too
"<b>switch hit</b>! Man, this guy has every shot in the book. Allen thought he could mitigate the damage by changing the angle and bowling at his pads. So Phillips just flips himself around and, now suddenly as a left-hander, he has room to free the arms and sweep a full ball outside off (previously outside leg) over deep square leg (previously point). Outstanding presence of mind from Phillips."
"looks to nudge a good length ball through square leg but only gets an inside edge that barely travels past the pitch. Phillips though senses the chance for a single and with Thomas' kick at the stumps going too far past the keeper's left, there's overthrows as well"
"premeditates a scoop, but Thomas pulls his pace back, drags his line outside off, he's done really well. Conway responds to that well too, dabbing the ball to third man instead"
creams a length ball into the covers. But doesn't pick the gap. So the break hasn't messed with his timing.
"lashes a very full, slower ball outside off away to the boundary - there's protection out there, the sweeper running to his right and diving too. But Paul just can't get there quickly enough. Intense bottom-hand strength on that shot."
works a full toss on middle away to deep midwicket
"steps out of his crease, making room as he does so, and slashes a length ball way outside off over backward point"
nails the yorker outside off and even Phillips in this form can't lay bat to it
"this is a mis-hit, but it still clears long-on! It looks like a top-edge as Phillips clears his front leg and flat bats a short ball down the ground. It seems he may have made a slight misjudgment in length, but nope. He's strikin em so sweet"
"slower, short ball outside off, clatters it to long-off"
"looks to swing a back of a length ball on middle through midwicket, but gets only an inside edge onto body"
"full and outside off, looks to launch it over extra cover, but no contact"
"good length, outside off, smacks it to long-off"
"there - that's his strength - square of the wicket. The ball is only slightly outside off, but he makes room for himself and cuts it ferociously to the point boundary"
"loads up a reverse sweep, but Paul adjusts well, going full and very wide outside off. Phillips, far too committed to his innovation, is beaten"
walks across and works a near yorker outside off through to the right of long-on
he's standing way outside leg stump - the set-up to a reverse scoop. The shot doesn't come off again as Paul goes too full and doesn't let him get under it. Phillips yells out in frustration.
lashes a full ball on middle to extra cover
"full, slower ball outside off, swings it down to long-on"
carves a full ball on off stump to extra cover and sprints across to the other end
the angle across the right-hander keeps a good length ball away from Phillips' reach. Except they've overdone it
he's earned that. So many shots off the middle of the bat. This one off the top edge as he looks to cut a shortish ball outside off. Boundary past the left of short third man
"whooops! He's bowled a ridiculous beamer all the way to short third man. Knuckle ball goes horribly wrong, I think"
"inside edge to the fine leg boundary! Cottrell has his hands on his hips after doing well with the free hit ball, cramping Phillips for room as he spots him moving across the crease. The batsman looks to hack it through midwicket and gets runs elsewhere"
"taken at long-off, Phillips looks at the umpire, this slash is off a high full toss, and they're, meaning Shaun Haig, the umpire, going to review. Replay shows it's over waist high at point of contact."
"no bat on ball from Conway again. When they cramp him on leg stump with back of a length balls, he keeps going for the front foot pull and he keeps missing"
too wide outside off with the offcutter
clears long-on! He is so still at the crease when he goes for these straight hits. He doesn't press forward. He just shifts from his side on position of the batting stance to straight on at the ball and swings - a straight bat - down the line and somehow makes sensational connections
"he's 99! This is an easier put away. Short and barely rises up to his waist, so he swivels on his back foot and pulls behind square leg"
"<b>oh that is glorious!</b> He looks much more comfy when he can hit through the off side. He makes that opportunity for himself, backing away to take a length ball outside leg stump and lofts it over cover. Beautiful"
"over midwicket this time, a full ball on middle gets the treatment as he whips it away. The length - the length being full helps him. He's much more at home dispatching those balls"
"walks across his stumps and looks to deflect a full ball outside leg away to the fine leg boundary, basically with one hand, because he's moved himself so far away from the line. Meanwhile, the third umpire informs them that this is also a no-ball"
misses out on a low full toss outside off
full toss on leg stump and he just helps it away over deep square leg. Easily done. Poor Keemo Paul. This is a slower ball gone wrong. Everything has gone wrong for him this series
cuts a back of a length ball over deep point and brings up his first international fifty for New Zealand. He's raced to it in virtually one over. Been struggling all innings. But that's been okay because Phillips has gone berserk. Now he's got his range too
"another one that's too short and too wide and Conway slaps it to the right of the sweeper. Kyle Mayers is the man there helping out, but he may have been holding onto the ball while he brushes against the boundary. It's tough to get a clear picture though with the angles on hand. So the umps decide it's only two."
"yorker on off stump, he plops it down the ground, he wants two to get to that hundred, but Conway, wisely, says no."
back of a length with a bit of extra pace on middle and leg and Conway's swing out to deep square leg doesn't connect
"steps out and finds the point boundary. He's been very good with this shot, making room as he advances and always going through with the shot."
chops a back of a length ball into the covers
"<byeahhhhhhhh</b> he screams as he gets there. A cut to deep point gets him the single he needs for the fastest T20I hundred by a New Zealander. The first ever for Glenn Phillips! And it's been all breathtaking. His team-mates are on their feet. The crowd is on their feet. He can't stay on his, just jumping around in joy."
"length ball. You can't bowl that, even if you have pace, at this stage. Conway picks it up and slogs it away over deep midwicket"
swings a full ball on leg stump out to deep midwicket
too wide outside off with the slower ball
"slugs a slower ball away to the right of the square leg fielder. Reaching out, that little bit extra, in front of him to the ball helps make the connection better there"
"yorker on off stump, he squeezes it out to midwicket and gets two"
"<b>oooh, his right knee is a problem again</b>! Weird thing happened to it the last game. And now here, Immediately after he slogs a good length ball away to deep midwicket, he screams again, this time in pain and goes down. His back leg locked at the ankle, as he hit his shot, so the knee took a lot of stress, and that stole his balance and brought him down very very awkwardly."
"short, slow, wide, slapped, goes too high, taken at point. He fell soon after his injury in the last game and that trend continues here as well. Except, today he's amassed 108 in only 51 balls. That's the fastest century by a New Zealander and the whole crowd at the Bay Oval stands up to salute him. He walks off tapping his bat with the ones the kids are thrusting out to him as he walks up to the dressing room. They have a new hero now"
cuts a shortish delivery to point
"fuller ball, a hint of away movement, and Fletcher comes forward to defend one that starts around leg and middle"
"swing away from outside off, and he steers this towards third man. There's a short third man in place, though, and it goes quickly across to Ferguson, placed there"
"angles into him this time, and he defends towards short mid-wicket"
"fuller, towards leg and middle, and swung over between mid-wicket and wide long-on. Goes a long way"
"short, and he cuts this towards deep backward point. Jimmy Neesham gets across from deep point and dives to his left to save the boundary"
"short, and he backs away and cuts this towards third man. Neesham again gets across to this quickly and palms it away with his left hand to stop the boundary"
"<strong>strikes first ball!</strong> Oh, horror start for King, who is wearing the new jersey with greater amount of yellow. It's full, fast, and just swings a fair way into the batsman. That's too good a ball to get first up, to be honest, least of all when you are chasing almost 12 runs an over."
"length, straight into his pads, and he can play this towards mid-on"
"length, around off, and he defends"
"length, angles in, and he defends this"
"shorter, and he ducks in to this one, angles in across him"
"just short of a length, and lifts sharply from just outside off, angling back in, and he lets this go"
"length, angles across Hetmyer, who has a wild swipe across the line, and misses"
"fuller, around off, and he whips this away towards deep square leg"
"length, and flogged down the ground towards cow corner. <strong>Serious </strong>connection on that, especially the sound that the willow made when it kissed the leather!"
"how does that miss the stumps? Southee responds with a good yorker, into the pads, and it takes a deflection on towards the stumps, but misses as it trundles away towards point"
"backs away, and Southee responds with a slower ball. Fletcher cuts this through the infield, but two fielders go chasing after this. <strong>It's Phillips again</strong>, who dives in, and relays it to Neesham to pull it back"
"swing away from the left-hander, but starts outside leg and shapes further away"
"fuller, wider, and he slices this past point with authority. At his pace, Southee just cannot afford to offer width on this pitch"
"yorker, jammed in around off, and he defends towards mid-off, and has played it softly enough to steal a quick single"
"full, but wide down the leg side"
"slower ball, around leg and middle, and he defends from the crease"
"<strong>that's out!</strong> Short ball, and Hetmyer makes some room to cut this away, and ends up dropping it to point. There's some early hesitation, and in the end, Fletcher is down on the ground as Phillips strikes with a sharp direct hit from cover-point. Maybe they should give him a few overs today as well?"
"short of a length, brisk, and he ducks inside this. Perhaps just grazed his shirt as it went through"
"length, driven to cover-point"
"short again, and he ducks inside this one. Too high, according to the umpire"
"length, outside off, and he looks to go leg side as he prefers. Misses out completely"
"length, angles across him from around leg and middle, and he drives it back to the bowler"
"length, around leg and he plays this to deep mid-wicket. Hetmyer refuses the second, and Mayers has come a long way down the wicket. The throw is at the bowler's end, and Ferguson fails to collect, and that allows him to get back"
whips a length ball away towards mid-wicket
"short of a length, <strong>at 152kph</strong>, and he fends this off his ribs towards short fine leg"
"quick, fast, and Hetmyer doesn't know a lot about this. Seems to have hit his helmet and then gone through to the keeper. <strong>Whoa!</strong> It's 151kph, and short. That's a difficult combination to face up to. Hetmyer was looking to advance and then try and pull, but the ball went through before he could react"
"fuller, good length, and Hetmyer defends compactly"
"length, tucked away towards square leg. Conway gets to the ball, but cannot release it properly enough to pressure the batsmen"
"tossed up around off, and Hetmyer goes back to drive, but misses the line, as it slants across him"
"slower, around leg stump, and he tries to play this towards fine leg but it goes down the leg side"
"lofts a length ball towards long-on, and the fielder dives across to his right to stop this"
"first six in T20Is for Mayers, who gets a hold of one floated around off. Straight back down the wicket, and clears long-off"
driven towards deep cover
whipped away towards square leg
"brisk, full, but down the leg side. Hetmyer has a flailing attempt at getting it away, but it was way too far from his bat"
"length, around off, and he steers it to third man"
"151kph, a little short in length, angles across him, and Mayers swings across the line and misses"
"slower ball, around off, and he cuts this towards deep point"
"back of a length, <strong>153.3kph</strong>, and Hetmyer backs away to slash this past mid-off"
"a bit short, and he looks to guide this over the keeper. Looks for the wide, but the umpires think that's fine"
"fuller, as Hetmyer again backs away to create some room for himself. Beaten by the pace of the ball again"
"tossed up around off, and driven hard back down the ground towards long-off"
"floated wider, googly, and beats the outside edge of the bat as Hetmyer looks to cut this. Close to a wide, but not called"
defends with a forward press
"fuller, wider, and driven towards deep point"
"googly again, outside off, and he cuts this hard towards deep point"
"googly again, outside off, and driven hard to cover"
"fuller length, around off, and he lofts this straight down the ground. Shouts of 'Catch', but that has fallen straight behind the bowler"
"<strong>Phillips is having a bit of a day out, isn't he?</strong> Neesham holds his length back a bit, and Mayers looks to target the mid-wicket fence. Phillips sees the ball flying away to his right, and <i>flings</i> himself to his right with conviction. And guess what? The ball just sticks in there"
"length, around off, and he steers this away to the left of third man. Quick running fetches them a second"
"length, swatted away through covers. Top effort from Guptill, running to his left from deep point to save the boundary"
"shorter in length, and he looks to flog this across the line. Top edge, and it flies over the keeper, but lands short of the third man boundary"
"length, driven towards deep point"
"length ball, and he goes deep in his crease and gets this over the mid-wicket fence"
"angles across him, flat through the air, and beats the outside edge as he tries to run it towards third man"
"moves across the crease, trying to go over mid-wicket again, and Santner floats this a little wider and shorter. Just a top edge, and Santner takes this skier away to his left"
"length, a little slower through the air, and he steers this towards mid-wicket"
"fuller, driven down the ground to long-on"
"skips down the wicket a touch to smash this over mid-wicket, and misses. Seifert whips the bails off, but he's safe"
145 kph and very full on off stump. Pollard works it to mid-on
defends a good length ball outside off past point.
"146 kph bouncer from around the wicket. Hetmyer is comfortably behind it though, deflecting the ball behind square leg with ease"
"stays around the wicket and targets Pollard's body with a short ball at 146 kph. There's a leg gully lurking to take advantage of the situation, which is why the batsman takes extra care to keep the ball down"
slight mix-up after Pollard dabs a shortish ball into the covers and wants a single. His partner is not too keen on it. In the end. Pollard gets back in time for the throw from Taylor
nudges a 147 kph ball on leg stump past leg gully's left
"slides down the leg side, beating Pollard's flick shot"
gentle flick to a full legbreak on leg stump. Finds short fine leg
"google that he picks only off the pitch and ends up with a mis-hit that only dribbles down to the keeper, so he has to worry about the stumping now"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
another googly that wanders down leg
too far down leg again as Pollard doesn't even bother playing
"has the room to free the arms - he was desperate to avoid doing that, but that resulted in so many wides, that he has to change track. Loops it up and tries to keep it wide outside off this time, but Pollard reaches out and lifts it with one hand over long-on"
works it down to long-on
cuts the googly out to the sweeper
flicks a full ball on leg stump from around the wicket to deep square leg
backs away and clatters a length ball in line with the stumps into the grass banks behind extra cover boundary. Effortless. Imperious.
"down the ground! Pollard moves leg side again, and this time the bowler spears it into his pads. He is hoping to cramp him. But the batsman is able to get under the ball and launch it"
clips a low full toss and it sails over the ropes at deep midwicket. Pollard has his man. And he's not going to let him go.
"taken at long-on! Actually, Southee is right behind the bowler. IPL fans will remember this field for Pollard. Dhoni uses it quite a bit specifically against Pollard. There's a quick check to make sure Southee hasn't trod on the ropes while taking the catch and we're good. Excellent comeback from Santner. Slows it down. Keeps it fullish. Pollard though stays on his back foot and tries to flat bat it down the ground but can't clear the man in the deep"
nudges a good length ball on leg stump into the midwicket region
whips a flatter ball on middle through midwicket
mis-hits a googly outside off to long-off
nudges to long-on
pulls a googly on the stumps to deep midwicket
"pulls a slow, shortish delivery outside off to long-on"
"taken at deep point, diving forward! Gorgeous work from Santner. He tracked the ball all through, times his dive perfectly and takes it in two hands and does the roll so his elbows are safe and the ball doesn't pop out. Googly from Sodhi does the trick as Hetmyer succumbs to the scoreboard pressure he himself had created... 25 off 32 while chasing 239..."
drives the full ball outside off to mid-off
"wants to lash a good length ball over point, but Jamieson's pace and bounce is too much for him"
"<b>dropped at deep point</b>. Tough one though. Ferguson's the man there. But he ran in, and that's cost him. He has to track back. The sun's in his eyes. He's got his shades. He reaches out with his right hand, diving back, gets finger tips to it but the ball pops out"
""
works the short ball off his hips through midwicket
"backs away but Jamieson follows him, the fuller ball going off his pads to fine leg"
"147 kph, full on off stump, drives to long-off"
slower ball that bounces right over the off stump as Allen slogs away
"147kph, slashes at a good lenth ball outside off for a single to point"
bouncer at 144 kph wanders way down leg side and it's too high even for the wicketkeeper to pull it in
"goes wide of the crease for a back of a length ball outside off at 147, but Powell stands firm and slices it behind point. Gorgeous shot."
<b>rippaaahhhhh!</b> He keeps saying he doesn't swing the ball. He keeps saying his only strength is pace. But what about this ball. This one moves in the air. It is angled into the right-hander. It is full as well. That length. That angle. It makes Powell stuck in the crease. And then the swing. The late away swing beats the outside edge and takes down off stump. Spectacular stuff.
defends a fuller delivery at 147 kph to mid-off
"too short, too leg side, Allen wallops it over fine leg"
pushes a length ball on off stump through point
steps out and gets cramped as he swings a back of a length ball away to deep midwicket
taken at cover - Phillips has another catch to his name! This one's a dolly as Allen backs away and tries to lift a good length ball on leg stump over the infield. Can't get enough connection
"bouncer that is angled into the right-hander, that keeps following him as he tries to hook it. Seems to come off the helmet and fly to the keeper's left. Seifert does exceedingly well to track it, dive and catch it and so New Zealand appeal for the catch. The on-field umpire Chris Brown says no so they review. Replays show it bounces over the bat and comes off the side of the helmet grille"
"slower ball outside off, he slices it to the left of short third man"
heaves a length ball outside off to deep midwicket
"full, with a hint of inswing, Cottrell works it to mid-on"
comes off the pad as he tries to flick a shortish delivery on leg stump behind square leg
pulls a short ball that comes up a little too high on him away to deep midwicket
too quick for Cottrell as he tries to pull a back of a length ball on the stumps
"top edge. Skier. Bowler sprints up to claim it. Keeper's on his way too. So Jamieson backs off and Seifert takes it cleanly. Short ball that follows the tailender as he makes room. It comes off the high part of the bat. It's also too quick for him, which is why the ball skews back behind the wicket."
"ooooooh! He nearly had it! Santner nearly had it. He was so close to pulling off such a spectacular catch! Paul thumps a pull shot to the left of deep midwicket. Santner races after it, dives full length, has it in his hands and then as he comes down and hits the ground, it pops out"
"flat, hard, six over wide long-on. Southee going short is allowing Paul to clear his front leg and smack it over the top"
"so he isn't quite perfect after all! Phillips running back from cover, tracking a mis-hit loft, is done in as the wind catches hold of the ball and takes it away from his reach"
pushes down the ground
