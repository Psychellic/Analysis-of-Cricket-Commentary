draws the batsman forward with his flight and Rohit respects it with a simple block to cover
"<b>quicker delivery</b>, surprises Rohit by coming on with the arm and pinning him on the thigh. He isn't even ready with a shot by the time he's struck"
rocks back and flicks a shortish delivery on the pads to deep midwicket
"stays around the wicket to the left-hander as well, and the short ball, wandering down leg, is pulled straight to short fine leg"
"spears in a fuller delivery on leg stump, Dhawan sweeps, but the arm ball beats his bat swing"
"flatter delivery on middle and leg, punches it back to the bowler"
"<b>beats him</b>! Pretty line (outside off), sexy length (good), sensational movement (away) and Dhawan, coming forward to drive on the up, can't make the connection"
"goes back of a length now, angling the ball at the body and Dhawan is able to get a little glove on the ball and let it slide away to the long leg boundary"
"sweet timing! There is no movment on offer and the length ball, pitching on middle stump, becomes fodder for the flick shot through midwicket"
"spears a drive, on the up, to short cover. The ball's coming onto the bat b-e-autifully"
"<b>dropped</b> at point! Santner is the man there, going for the reverse cup, over his head. It's fairly straightforward - even with Dhawan cutting the ball as hard as he could"
"shortish and outside off, the batsman waits on his cut shot a little longer this time and places it to deep third man"
"gets into the pull shot way too early, and the 126 kph slower bouncer strikes him, possibly, under the armpit"
on the pads and Dhawan clips it behind square leg. A direct hit might have made things interesting at Rohit's end
"a massive effort from Boult at deep third man, waiting on the edge of the boundary, tracking the upper cut, leaping as high as he could, but the ball sails over him. Outstanding shot"
nudges a back of a length delivery to the right of midwicket
"offcutter outside off, Dhawan reads it well, strikes it sweetly, but finds mid-off with his drive"
"full and outside off, spears a drive to extra cover"
steps forward to defend a fuller delivery angled across him
"mistimes the front foot pull, which is a rare thing indeed. Credit to Boult for putting in more pace and bounce than the batsman had anticipated."
"fine leg is up, and Dhawan takes full advantage. Sits on his back foot against the short ball and simply helps it around with a short-arm pull"
"races down the pitch and Boult, spotting such enthusiasm, dares him to go through with the shot against a really fast delivery, cramping him on middle and leg. Dhawan is hit as opposed to the other way around"
"waits in his crease this time, and so has that little more time to deal with Boult's pace. He gets the benefit of width as well and cracks the ball behind point"
"shortish on middle and off, Dhawan tries to tap and run, but Rohit, wisely says, yeah right and sticks his tongue out"
"back of a length and outside off, Rohit dabs it to deep third man"
"plants his back leg away outside leg, to make Southee think he will make room. The bowler is suckered into the trap as Dhawan resumes his normal position and the good length ball down leg becomes a wide"
"opens the face and slices a shortish delivery outside off to the left of deep third man. Sodhi is the fielder there, putting in a slide, but it isn't quite cricket-ball proof"
chops the offcutter outside off to deep point
presents the full face to a pitched-up delivery outside off
"clears the front leg to try and flay the ball through the off side, but there isn't enough width to pull the shot off."
"tries to cut a slower ball on off stump, and as well as his timing is working today, that is asking too much"
"<b>big turn</b> as he finally decides to indulge in the orthodox left-armer's delivery, which pitches around off stump and breaks away from Rohit's reach"
nudges a flatter delivery on leg stump through square leg
"sweep, which beats backward square leg and Sodhi has to race after it. Gave away a boundary last over, saves one this time"
"whoa, that couldn't gone wild. Dhawan races down the track, and having pulled the trigger too early, it allows Santner to go for the arm ball. Only it comes out so slow, and short, and wide. Dhawan, in slog mode, has to check his shot and ends up dragging it through midwicket"
"goes for the sweep shot, the decision made in light of the ball being outside off. But the length is not quite right. Too short, and it spins past the bat swing"
"lifts it over extra cover! It's only just cleared the fielder, leaping to his left"
"full and just outside off, Dhawan tries to work it through the leg side, but ends up with a leading edge behind point"
"tries to cut a shortish delivery, a shade outside off. But it simply bounces a lot more than Rohit expects"
"<b>dropped</B> by Southee at long-off. Rohit looks to force the pace, but he only toe-ends the cutter. Doesn't get the distance. The fielder has to run up, dive forward, and mucks up all that effort in the end"
sweeps the medium pacer away! Plants his front leg outside off and smuggles the good length ball outside off away into the gap
"back of a length delivery on middle and leg, tries to clip it away, but can't"
"nudges a fuller delivery, from around the wicket, to long leg"
starts with a short ball and Dhawan hammers it out to deep midwicket
"flatter delivery a shade outside off, Rohit clips it towards short midwicket"
"goes for the sweep towards fine leg, but the ball, pitching on leg stump, rags away from the bat looking to hurt it and into the loving embrace of Latham's gloves"
"shortish and slow, Rohit half sweeps and half pulls it to deep square leg"
cuts past point
"after turning the ball past the edge of the bat, Sodhi makes this dip on the batsman. So Rohit, attempting a drive through extra cover, is reaching too far in front of his body and has no timing to offer"
"paddle sweep, against a fairly full delivery on middle, and the ball waddles off to long leg"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives to long-off"
strays in line and Rohit pulls it to the right of deep square leg
"steps out, but he's foiled in his attempt to put pace on the ball by it being wide of his reach, and excellent work from point"
evidence of the dew as de Grandhomme sends a full toss soaring over the batsman and the keeper. The knuckle ball goes awry - how are they even trying such things with so much moisture?
"launches a back of a length <b>free-hit delivery</b> outside off seeking the boundary behind Southee at long-off, but he hasn't got enough power on it"
"another beamer, and Rohit, trying to cut the ball, inside edges it past the keeper. This time it's a cutter, but the dew is causing problems here as well"
"superb shot through the covers! The <b>free hit ball</b> is in the slot and Dhawan has been timing it splendidly tonight. This time, he also makes sure to beat the sweeper to his left"
pushes through cover
gets down the track and heaves a fuller delivery outside off to long-on
"googly, turning into middle and leg, but Rohit, by backing away, is able to dab the ball to short third man"
"fuller delivery outside off, jabs it through the covers"
drags his front leg back so he can punch a shortish delivery on leg stump to long-on
comes down the track and yorks himself as Sodhi keeps tossing the ball up and drifting it away from the left-hander. Dhawan drives to long-off
works a good length ball on off stump to long-on
"it doesn't look like the usual Rohit six. They soar away, gaining height and distance. This one goes straight up, keeps gaining distance in that direction, but somehow lands beyond the long-on boundary"
steers it to short third man
"deep midwicket runs in, searching for the catch, but the pull shot is hit quite flat and so it doesn't carry"
pummels the half-volley outside off to the long-off boundary. Fielder there can just watch
pulls the shortish delivery from outside off to deep midwicket
taps a shortish delivery from outside off to long-on
"<b>nearly bowls him but in the end, he gets to celebrate a half-century</b>. A good length ball that he tries to cut skews off the inside edge out to fine leg. The around the wicket angle cramps him, but not fatally"
opens the face against a length ball coming at his stumps and deftly steers it to third man
"full on off stump, whips it to long-on"
"another short delivery, spinning away from Rohit. He still whips it to long-on"
"tossed up on off stump, Dhawan pushes it down to long-off"
"picks the googly and launches it over deep midwicket. There is a fielder posted there, and it goes almost perfectly over Munro's head."
"sweeps against the turn, and times it outstandingly well. The googly has been pulled to the square leg boundary, and even Guptill isn't quick enough to stop it"
"quicker and flatter through the air, Dhawan defends on middle"
"well bowled - he spots Dhawan racing down the pitch and sneaks a flatter googly outside off. The batsman has to adjust, while on the move, and tap it through cover"
"short and outside off, Rohit slices it behind point"
plays with the turn and slices a back of a length delivery to sweeper cover
"slower ball outside off, Rohit chops it to short third man"
"flat-bats it to long-off! A very slow delivery, meant to tax Dhawan's reach has been pummeled down the ground"
knocks it down to long-on
"steps away to leg and if not for the form he's shown tonight, this slower ball should have knocked over leg stump. But somehow, Dhawan is able to slice it away, with half a bat, towards cover point"
"swings hard at a back of a length delivery, but it bounces a lot more, skews off the bat maker's label to long-on"
"plenty of air time on that! Dhawan realises the bowler is only willing to try slower balls, so he steps forward, sets up a stable base and launches the good length ball outside off over midwicket"
"grip, turn and bounce, all foiling Rohit's attempt to come down the track and slog"
"backs away, Santner follows him, but offers length that Rohit can get under and launch it straight over the top. He's clearing the boundary without middling the ball"
"the ball spinning away from him helps as he backs away, lets it spin, and heaves it away past the right of long-on"
"he has got everything behind this ball - a full toss outside off that is simply caressed to the boundary, left of long-off"
"tosses it up on leg stump, Rohit swings it away to deep midwicket. <b>That brings up India's highest opening stand in T20Is</B>"
"attempts to reverse sweep, but this quicker delivery, from around the stumps, beats him"
goes down on one knee and the smitten ball does Rohit's bidding. Takes a top edge and even then the scoop shot sails over the boundary behind fine leg
nails a length ball outside off to point - and he really did nail it
"shuffles just that tiny bit outside off to whisk the offbreak, of a perfectly good length, in line with off stump, away to the fine leg boundary. Outstanding hitting"
low full toss and it's been pummeled down the ground. Boult nearly lost one of his legs with the way that ball pinged off Dhawan's bat
"pulls a short ball outside off to midwicket. Seems like a dot ball, but the throw at the non-strikers' end goes awry. New Zealand have been awful on the field."
short arm pull to wide long-on
"opts to reverse sweep a good length ball on off stump, but he misses and is struck on the pad"
"gorgeous work! It's the googly, a last resort for Sodhi as he sees the batsman advancing. He pitches it short, makes sure the line is wide outside off. Dhawan is charging, while making room to leg and has no chance of making contact. But it would seem that he has feathered a nick through to Latham, who also breaks the stumps to stump him"
"shortish delivery on off stump, chops it towards point"
"<b>ripper</b>! That's the dream delivery for a legspinner. Drifting in towards leg stump, drawing the batsman forward, dipping before he can get to it and spinning square to take a bit of wood through to the wicketkeeper"
shortish delivery on off stump and clips it to deep square leg
"shortish and outside off, cuts to deep point"
"another top edge, another boundary behind the keeper. Rohit must have charmed his bat before walking out to the crease. Sweeps it away"
"length ball outside off, Rohit tries to flay it over cover, doesn't make contact, and the ball lobs off the keeper's gloves to short third man"
"picks the offcutter and launches it into the stands over long-on! Among the cleanest hits of the night, in front of his hometown fans. His own eyes bug out at the distance the ball travels"
whips a fuller delivery on leg stump out to deep square leg
leg-stump half-volley and Rohit whips it away disdainfully to the deep square leg
"<b>dropped</b> at deep midwicket!  Guptill is the man, another excellent fielder, but he hasn't picked up that he needs to run in, that Kohli has mistimed his swipe. By the time he compensates, putting in the big dive, he can't get under the ball"
"back of a length and outside off, smacks it to mid-off"
"sails over midwicket. Stands still in the crease, somehow gets on top of short ball and whips it away over the boundary. Sensational"
"low full toss outside off, Kohli drives to extra cover. A few yards either side and it could have been another boundary"
"back of a length and outside off, Rohit tries to upper cut it away but is unable to"
"outside edge trickles away to the third man boundary. It's the slower ball fairly wide outside off, Rohit wants to smack it over mid-off but he'll take this outcome anyway"
"<b>big appeal for caught behind</b>, but the keeper doesn't and now the umpires are going to confer. <b>Third umpire is called in, soft signal is out</b>. This is an attempted yorker from Boult, wide outside off. Rohit tries to flay it away, but it's too quick for him. The reason the two on-field umpires wanted a second opinion was because they wanted to check on the bump ball. But instead, Anil Chaudhary comes back with, 'bat hit the ground' and rules not out. That prompts New Zealand <b>to review</b> and the same man who ruled this not out has to change his decision because Ultra-Edge shows a spike as ball passes bat."
"he's come out with the express purpose of treating his hometown! Steps out of his crease and even though it is a delivery meant to cramp the swing of his arms, he is able to send the ball soaring over long-on"
"back of a length, heaves it out to deep midwicket"
"sends his first ball flying out to deep midwicket - reads the slower one, the one off the back of the hand, gets that big backlift going and once he makes contact, well...."
"short ball now, Dhoni seems to be expecting it as he hangs back and pulls it to deep square leg"
"falls between mid-off and deep cover! Williamson chases after it to his left, eyes up, but might he have done better to leave it to Bruce coming up from the boundary"
"a slower ball, outside off, which is perfect with Kohli running at him, making room down leg. Somehow the batsman is able to reach across and slap it down to long-off"
"shortish, angled across wide outside off and straightens slightly, left alone"
"shorter and wider, no straightening this time as it holds its line and drifts away outside off"
slashes at this shortish ball but gets tucked up for room and ends up chopping it to covers
"short, wide, jabs hard from the crease and the ball lands just short of Manish Pandey at point"
"what kind of a shot is that! That is unorthodoxy at its most extreme. Slower short ball around off, takes ages to come on to Guptill who stays in the crease and stays leg side of it before thumping it straight down with the flattest of bats"
"length ball, pushed across the off-stump of the right-handed Guptill who lets it go"
"short of good length, angled across around off, punched hard. Three fielders in the in-field on the off side and he cannot find the gap"
"fullish on the pads, clipped along the ground for one"
lovely delivery. Flighted slider on middle and leg. Guptill can't get underneath and gets an inside edge. Almost chopped on
"WHAT. A. CATCH! Super-Hardik with a stunner as the Kotla roars in appreciation. Length ball on middle. Guptill gets the front leg forward but makes sure to stay slightly leg side so he gets room to free his arms. Launches it straight down and Hardik Pandya hares across to his right from long-off, puts in a full-blooded, full-length dive and snaffles it with both hands outstretched., Still slides for a few seconds as the momentum carries him along. You won't see too many better catches"
"good length on middle, nudged through midwicket"
"flat and full, sliding on middle and leg, pushed down the pitch to the bowler"
"similar. Flat and full on middle and leg, Williamson quietly pushes it out off the front foot"
"<b>was that a drop?</b> Dhoni with a full-length dive this time. Back of a length, Munro walks across and tries to swat it away behind square and there is a noise as the ball goes towards the right of Dhoni who leaps up and gets a glove to it. Nah, off the thigh pad, seems like. But the keeper saved four nonetheless"
""
"length ball, lets it come on and opens the face of his bat to run it down to third man for a single"
"short of a length on top of off, punched solidly off the backfoot to the covers. Nehra has overstepped. Ah, no. Not the bowler's mistake. They had an extra fielder outside the circle"
"short, wide, opens up and carves it over the in-field on the off side. It's a free-hit, so he can afford to take the chance. Chahal now with a full-speed chase and slides in front of the boundary to pull it back"
"shortish, comes on awkwardly at helmet-height and beats the batsman on the pull. Nehra once again with an affable smile to the batsman. But it doesn't last long as the umpire has deemed it a wide. Harsh call, just over the shoulder"
"<b>dropped</b>. So we have learned that Pandya is human and capable of dropping catches. Munro comes down the ground to this short ball and finds the toe-end of his bat as he slashes over the off side. Pandya runs back from cover and gets more or less under it but ends up shelling it. Tough, tough chance, but he's set the bar so high. Had to reach back slightly and that left him in an awkward position"
looks for a big heave over the leg side and inside-edges it into the thigh pad
"short of a length on off, punched back"
"short, wide, slapped hard off the backfoot and Pandya makes a sharp save at covers"
"short of good length, comes into Williamson who closes the face of his bat and chips it over the midwicket region"
"yorker. That's an inch-perfect delivery. Good pace, that's an 87-miles-per-hour missile. Munro is late in bringing the bat down and gets a bit of an inside edge before the ball crashes into the stumps"
"short of good length, around off, gets on top of the bounce and punches back"
"fullish length ball on off, punched to mid-off"
"very full, angling in on middle and leg, nearly a yorker, squeezed out through midwicket"
"<b>in the air and just short of point</b>. Shreyas Iyer leaps forward as he charges in but the ball bounces. Short of a length, extra bounce catches Latham by surprise and he fails to keep it down"
"that has just flown past second slip. Scrambled-seam back of a length delivery, nips away from Latham who closes the face slightly and the movement takes the ball off the outside edge all the way to third man"
"beautiful! Lovely nip away from the left-hander, Latham is forced to stick the bat out and gets narrowly beaten on the outside edge"
"fuller ball, sprays it down the leg side and Latham misses the attempted glance"
"these are excellent lines and lengths. Very tight good length ball on middle, Latham is forced to defend back"
"just short of good length, Latham watchfully blocks into the covers. Another tight over, pressure on for New Zealand"
"short of good length, punched off the backfoot to covers"
shot! That's a fine piece of timing. Walks across towards off and gets down on one knee before scooping it very fine. Carries all the way
charges down the ground and is forced to make a late adjustment by opening the face of his bat for a single down to third man
"length ball, flicked from the off the hips to deep midwicket for one"
"length, outside off, opens the face for a single to third man"
that's an outstanding delivery! Incites Latham to walk into the shot by landing it on a length and firing it seemingly within his arc. Latham closes the face and the ball nips away ever-so-slightly to miss the outside edge by inches
"back of a length, cut late to point"
"non-turning back of a length ball on off, makes some room and punches through the covers"
"length ball, spinning in on leg, flicked behind square for a single"
"back of a length, not much turn again outside off, cuts to sweeper cover for one"
gets down for a sweep but not the right length to be playing that shot. A bit shortish for the sweep and the ball grazes the upper body and trickles down to short fine leg
"fullish slider on middle, pushed out to covers for a quick single"
"short of a length on off, gets on top of the bounce and punches down to long-on"
"short of a length, a bit of zip away outside off, runs it down to third man off the outside edge"
"short ball, too short, that's a poor delivery. Williamson swivel-pulls and swats it away behind square. Axar runs across and dives to his right but can't get his hands to the pull"
<b>in the aiiiir and put down</b>. Kohli puts down a tough chance. Would have been a blinder had he got it. Pedals back slightly and leaps up to get his right hand to it but the ball slips past him. Nehra has to further wait for a wicket in his final game
""
"fullish ball, flicked from off the pads to deep fine leg"
slows this down through the air and makes the batsman impatiently charge forward looking for a flick but he can only wear it on the pad
reverse sweep. Brilliant stop by Kohli running to his right and diving to stop it
"backs away to this short of a length ball, not much turn, flays it through backward point"
"full on middle and leg, reverse sweep to short third man"
"short of a length, backs away and cuts to extra cover where Chahal lets one go through his legs. But sweeper tidies up"
driven straight to Chahal again who this time is on to it in a flash and has a shy at the stumps. They take off for the single and make it as Chahal's throw doesn't hit anything
"edged and taken. Short and wide, just gets a bit of extra bounce that results in Williamson getting the outside edge as he slashes hard. Brilliant seam position on that delivery which enabled him to generate that extra bounce. Simple catch for MS Dhoni. New Zealand plunge further"
"short, wide, slapped hard to sweeper cover"
can't get away with that line and length every time. Too short and too wide and slapped uppishly over backward point
"that's much better. Length ball, angling in on middle and leg, punched down to long-on"
that's a punishing shot. Pandya's short lengths aren't really working for him. Backs away to manufacture some room and just frees his arms to thump it over point
backs away and the bowler follows him which results in Bruce getting an inside edge to the left of the keeper
"short, non-turner, backs away and chops his cut"
and again he backs away to try and force a cut through the off side. Gets it away to backward point
"conventional sweep to this fullish ball. Straight to short fine leg and they take off for the single. The throw comes in at the keeper's end. Genius Dhoni susses out the accuracy of the throw and lets it go despite having his back to the stumps. Sure enough, it goes through his legs and hits the stumps. But the batsman has made it back"
backs away to powerfully cut away to sweeper cover
advances down the track and punches it uppishly to long-on. The throw comes on at the bowler's end and deflects off the fielder's hand as they concede an overthrow
backs away and carves out an inside-out drive
backs away and chops a cut as the ball doesn't get up as much as he anticipates
"shot! Googly. Too short, though, and Latham has all the time to rock back and hammers a pull over deep midwicket. Sails comfortably over the head of the fielder running to his left"
"full, flicked from off the pads into the leg side"
backs away again to make room. But it's the googly. Short and he just about manages to jam the bat down to keep it out
"gets down for a slog sweep. Loses balance and it makes for an ugly sight, off the inside part of the bat to deep midwicket"
"short of a length, rocks back and drags a pull down to long-on"
"length ball, advances down and chops a punch to wide long-off"
backs away to this short of a length ball. The bowler follows him and he tries to force it to backward point
shapes up for a big heave over the leg side and the bowler fires it slower through the air. Latham gets it off the inside part of the bat to midwicket
"Axar slows it up again and Bruce does not get the pace he's looking for at all. Gets down for a big slog sweep. All muscle but very little timing. Doesn't find the middle and offers a simple, straightforward catch to deep midwicket. He was really struggling to get behind the line and that's the end of his pained stay"
"fullish, Latham gets down and sweeps to deep midwicket"
"Dhawan takes a simple catch and that's two wickets in the over. Take a bow, Axar. He's making life miserable for New Zealand's batsmen. He knows they really have to go for it and he's offering them next to no pace. And de Grandhomme has paid the price for wrong shot selection. It's not the ideal length to be slogging, slightly short for that and he gets a top-edge that settles into the hands of Dhawan at deep square leg"
backs away for a cut and chops it to cover. Iyer swoops down and fires a direct throw but they capitalise on the deflection for an overthrow
comes forward to this length ball that spins the other way and gets an outside edge down to third man
"full on middle, gets down and sweeps to backward of square leg"
floats one up across the left-hander and just goes down the same line. Doesn't spin in and beats the attempted sweep
this time it does spin in and he middles a sweep to deep midwicket
"slog sweep, middles it and Dhawan and Kohli converge on it at deep midwicket. Dhawan, running to his right from deep square leg gets down and flicks it back to Kohli. Just some slight miscommunication there which resulted in a slight delay in the fielder getting down"
tries to glance this length ball fine and the ball grazes the pad instead as it goes to the keeper
"short of good length ball, Latham pulls it away from off the hips. Does not quite time it as he is tucked up considerably. Shreyas Iyer charges in and over-runs as the ball spins away the other end. He can't recover in time to pull it back in front of the boundary"
""
"is that gone? Yes, surely. Direct hit from Kohli. Full toss, angled across off, driven straight to mid-off and they take off for the single. Kohli has a clear sight of the stumps and nails an accurate throw. No need to refer that upstairs. New Zealand unravelling quite spectacularly"
backs away to this short of a length ball at a slower pace and drills it back to the bowler
"yorker, squeezed out to square third man for a single"
floats one up outside the off-stump. Latham gets down for a sweep and gets a top-edge that gets over Dhoni and runs all the way down to third man
"goes hard at a reverse sweep, gets nowhere near it and misses"
that's the end of Latham. Dhoni effects those kind of stumpings in his sleep. Latham gives a blind charge and Chahal has fired this flat and taken it away from him. It's the wrong'un and does not meet the swipe of Latham
"Nehra makes a characteristic stop and it's much to the amusement of everyone, Nehra included. Southee triesa flick and the ball goes to short fine leg. Nehra jogs across casually and plants the boot across to lob it in the air, catch it and hurl it to the keeper"
"fuller, driven to wide long-off"
floats it up outside off and Southee throws extremely hard hands at it. Gets an outside edge that goes well over the cordon and down to third man
"short ball, pitches outside leg and goes over the arched back of the batsman"
"fullish length ball, punched straight back at Bumrah who threatens to throw sending Santner scampering for cover and then actually throws. Misses Santner and misses the stumps"
"fuller, flicked away to deep fine leg"
tail-ender's shot. Southee gets a short of a length ball at a comfortable height and responds with a flat-batted thump straight down the ground
"tell you what, took a couple of seconds to realise that he had nicked it. Seemed like he had merely been beaten. Stays leg side of the ball, makes no effort to get close to it and swipes blindly to get what turns out to be a healthy edge. Dhoni gleefully accepts the simple offering"
"extremely full outside off, squeezed out down the ground"
"length ball, gets an outside edge that races away to third man. Bumrah smiles wryly. New Zealand need 88 off three"
backs away and tries to reach out for a drive. It's slower and pushed across him and he gets beaten
"short of a length, swivels and hammers a pull to deep midwicket"
that one's even better. Bhuvneshwar overcompensates with his length and offers up a full one on the pads that is nonchalantly flicked over deep midwicket by Santner
"short ball, tries to back away and force a pull but it gets too big on him and he misses"
"yorker, bang on the stumps, squezzed out straight back down the ground. Excellent delivery"
"fuller ball, flicked out to deep midwicket"
"slower length ball, flicked into midwicket and they sprint back for the second.Throw at the bowler's end. Bumrah does not collect the ball. Had he, Sodhi would have been run out"
turns it away to deep midwicket again and Santner wants a second again. But Sodhi firmly and loudly sends him back
"short, not much room outside off, tries to cut and gets beaten"
"length ball, drilled straight over the bowler. Throw comes in from long-on and they take an overthrow"
"very full ball, Santner flicks it over wide long-on and the ball hits the ropes on the full. Dips but carries just about all the way"
this one's even better. Nothing full toss and Santner clobbers it well over long-on. Sails into the stands
Sodhi swipes hard without making an effort to get behind the line of the delivery and gets beaten
"geez, Nehra's having some real fun. Bangs this one short and Sodhi takes the eyes off as he looks for a pull and gets beaten.Wide, ear-to-ear smile from Nehra"
the Kotla is briefly excited as this one's in the air. Chipped straight down but well past the fielder at mid-off and it runs away to the boundary to silence the crowd
drags the pace back and fires this wide outside off. Sodhi walks across and lets it go
"shortish ball, Sodhi looks for a pull and gets hit on the back of the shoulder"
"short of a length, Santner does not middle his shot as he drags a pull down to the mid-on region. The fielder is positioned in the deep so the ball goes on the bounce to him"
and he ends with a dipping full toss that Sodhi fails to get his bat on as he reaches out for it
