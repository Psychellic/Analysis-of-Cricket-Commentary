"tossed up on the leg stump, de Kock drives it down to mid off"
"length delivery well outside off, he leans forward and pushes it to point"
"quicker, flatter and closer to off, defends off the back foot this time"
presses forward and blocks the length delivery into the covers. What a start from Chawla
"length delivery towards the off side, de Kock defends it carefully off the back foot"
outside the leg stump now and he tries to sweep but misses
"sweeps it well this time from well outside off, he had to reach for it a fair bit and slapped it away. Uthappa ran across to his left, put in a dive, got a hand and slid the ball in but it went for four"
same shot but on the other side and same result. Shuffled a bit towards off and this time he swept it much finer for four
tries to sweep again but gets an edge back to the bowler
"some width on the off side, he pushes it to cover point and comes back in time"
"innocuous looking ball on the pads, McCullum tucks it carefully to leg for one"
tries to slog the incoming delivery towards his legs and he only gets an inside edge to leg
"dances down the tack, Mitch bangs it in short and McCullum smacks it with a full swing on the off side for a cracking four"
comes down again and Mitch tries a slower one this time but down leg for a wide
"length delivery on the stumps, McCullum makes some room and pushes into the covers"
"pretty full on the off stump, de Kock closes the face of the bat to drive it straght to mid on"
"makes width because the ball doesn't have any, he lofts the full delivery from the stumps, up and over the off side to the square boundary all the way"
nobody on the leg side in the deep and McCullum reaches out from outside off to sweep the googly to deep midwicket for a one-bounce four
"on middle and leg now, he pushes it towards mid on for one"
"short outside off, he cuts off the back foot and gets one as Kuldeep misfields at point. Looked like a wrong'un"
"darts in one at <strong>122.4kmh</strong> according to the TV, it was on off stump and McCullum did well to get his bat down in time"
"usual leg break, which hardly spins, much slower on the off stump and he defends again"
"reverse sweeps it straight to short third man, quiet end to the over with three dots"
"offbreak outside off, slices it to backward point and they sprint across for a quick one"
"much slower than what McCullum expected, he's through with this sweep when the ball reaches him and takes it on the pad outside off"
flat bats the short ball back to Narine
"pitched up, he heaves to the leg side and doesn't quite middle it but gets enough to make it past midwicket and deep square leg"
"<strong>extra bounce</strong> as he goes back to cut on off, DK also can't collect it"
"top edge as he sweeps, goes right behind DK on the leg side and they take one"
"tries to loft the ball off his pads, it was fullish, but he can't get bat on it"
shares down to make it a half volley on the off stump and smashes it along the ground to deep point
"<strong>145kmh</strong>, a wide yorker outside off, de Kock stretches out and only gets a bottom edge"
tries the same delivery but it's a low full toss this time and de Kock slices it to deep point
"away-swinging bouncer outside off, he tries to reach out for it but misses. That's the first bouncer for the over"
"low full toss at 146kmh, driven hard and fast to mid off where birthday boy Russell dives and saves a few"
pitches the first one short and McCullum pulls it to deep midwicket
"slow and on length outside off, de Kock waits for it to turn and then cuts it past point for one"
a touch fuller and he goes back in the crease again to cut it square
"a fumble at deep midwicket, KKR's fielding still a beat wobbly. McCullum had swept this one with the turn to the leg side"
"Kuldeep bowls this one much slower as de Kock comes down, he waits and cuts yet again"
spoils the over for Kuldeep! It was pitched up a bit and McCullum slog-swept that one with the turn over the fielder at deep midwicket!
"hardly turns around the leg stump, de Kock tries the reverse sweep but doesn't connect at all"
"tries to loft it with the turn this time, doesn't quite middle it but gets one to deep midwicket"
"<strong>beaten but he gets four</strong>! Flatter one on the middle stump and it turned just enough to deceive McCullum, but he made a late adjustment and got it fine on the off side"
"shorter and quicker, and it's short enough to give McCullum the time to go back and chop it between point and short third man"
tries to find the gap again with a back-foot cut and finds point this time
"short again, not sure what Chawla is trying here! Forget the off side, McCullum rocks back this time and pulls it high and wide over long-on"
"<b>aesthetically beauty</b> is where de Kock's inside-out loft over extra cover stops. He's not fully to the pitch and as a result, he's ended up slicing a very good looking shot to sweeper's left. The fielder runs a few yards to his left and watches carefully before completing the catch"
"length ball on middle stump, presses well froward and gets deflects this into the leg side with a bat-pad"
<b>loses control</b> against this loopy ball from Kuldeep. Looks like a googly. Kohli has to wait a long time after shaping to flick and ends up chipping to long-off
"googly, pushed at a length and wide outside off. Looks to slog sweep, misses"
"length ball at the stumps, dragged into the leg side with a heave"
length ball tossed up at off stump and nervous flick straight to short midwicket
steps out and creams a square drive straight to sweeper cover. A full ball wide outside off and he steps out to get this out there
short of a length and some shape way off the pitch. Follows with his hands and jabs it past point
<b>falls short</b> of long-off. Length ball just outside off. He can't get elevation as he looks to loft this straight
"short of a length in the corridor, allows it to come on and guides towards third man off the face of the bat"
"<b>got him!</b> Through the hook shot too early, is McCullum, and he ends up getting a feather off the toe of the bat which carries comfortably to the keeper. A short ball and he made plenty of room for the swing, but the timing is just off"
"another bouncer. Slower ball too, it appears. But it's too high for him to connect"
"<b>gone!</b> A full toss! Vohra skips down the pitch and gets a shin height full toss tailing in at him that is ripe for a drilling through midwicket. It's what he was looking to do as well. Except, there's a gap between bat and pad and the inside edge sneaks through to smash the stumps...oh it takes his back boot on the way too"
good length ball turning in at the stumps. Tapped to midwicket
"full on middle stump, and yet another watchful drive from Kohli. This one to long-on"
"googly, short of a length and going away from off stump. Gets on the back foot and tickles it through square leg"
<b>leading edge.</b> This is why Kohli is tentative against Kuldeep. Hasn't picked this googly as he looks to flick through midwicket
half-tracker and he gets an inside edge after getting on the back foot for a pull. Was really looking to launch this. Ended up getting two runs down at fine leg
"googly, back of a length at middle stump. Tapped to midwicket off the back foot"
full and very wide outside off. Russell got some swing on that one too
<b>swing</b> in at off stump from back of a length. Mandeep looks to steer it to third man but can't get it past the keeper
"short of a length at off stump, nudged through square leg off the back foot"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off. Punched to long-on off the back foot"
<b>dropped!</b> Mandeep's attempted ramp is poorly timed. It looks like Russell's getting bouncers to stick in the pitch. It's a lob that goes behind Rana who is at fly slip and he can't hold on after pedalling backwards and tumbling
"<b>glorious</b> from Kohli. Leans into this full ball outside off, makes use of the allowance - mid-off is in - and makes him fetch it. <b>Hobbles immediately after</b>. Looks like an ankle thing."
"length ball outside off, opens the face and runs it to third man"
<b>big turn</b> into the pads. Kohli can't get bat as he looks to flick off the back foot
"<b>beaten</b> by big turn again. A googly, pitched short and outside off. Turns even further away as Mandeep shapes to pull"
"tossed up at off stump, gets on the front foot and drives to long-off"
"<b>slugs it</b> off the inside half of the bat. Kuldeep has Kohli in some bother tonight. Another loopy one has Kohli excited, but the slog sweep is not timed well at all. Trickles out to deep midwicket"
"length outside off, steered to point"
<b>beaten.</b> Unplayable right now. Googly goes high enough in the air before landing that Mandeep expects it to bounce as it goes past him. Brings out the late cut but is well beaten
"oh yeah! Gimme that, he says. It's an offcutter, but the pace is enough. Waits for this length ball outside off, leans in to meet it on the up and punch it past extra cover"
another offcutter. At a length and across the corridor. Steers it to third man off the front foot
<b>leading edge</b> but safe. Short of a length at middle stump and he closes the face too early on the flick. Sweeper cover cleans up
bouncer at his helmet. Doesn't come on smoothly. Hooks to deep square off the inside half of the bat
sliced uppishly to sweeper cover. Length ball slanted across him and he meets it on the up
slower ball at a length on off stump. Steps out and drives to long-off
"<b>sliced over extra</b> cover. Not timed well at all from Kohli. It's a length ball going away off the pitch. He wants to go in that direction, but the poor connection means it's one bounce and into the boundary"
"<b>sensational fielding</b> by Russell at long-on to stop a typical Kohli whip down the ground. He sprints to his left, rotates anticlockwise and stops this ball behind him, one yard in front of the boundary"
length ball whipped in front of deep midwicke from the stumps
cramped as this length ball spins into him. Can't get bat on the whip
length ball spinning into middle. Gets an inside edge onto pad as he looks to flick
length and coming in again. Taps through square leg off the back foot
superb. It's a different game when the pacers are one. Even though they're bowling cutters. It's a length ball wide outside off. He waits for it to arrive and chops it between backward point and short third man
"short ball going away wide outside off, beaten as he looks to open the face and get this square"
length ball lifting up as he looks to punch to long-on. Can't get it off the pitch
"shot. Pace, width. Everything you need on this pitch. Waits for it to arrive again and guides it over point"
"short of a length and wide outside off. Slaps it on the up, straight to extra cover"
"full outside off, gets the front foot stride out and drives to sweeper cover"
"short of a length outside off, punched straight to cover point"
"very short ball on the stumps, mistimes the pull shot and it lands short of deep midwicket. Not done very well against half trackers this season..."
"<b>swatted</b> over deep midwicket. Mandeep has nailed this slog sweep against the offbreak. Good stride, clean hit. That's the fifty partnership"
short and turning into the body. Punches to long-on off the back footsh
"short ball at middle stump, pulled to deep midwicket"
"<b>lovely!</b> Mandeep hasn't had too much of the strike but he's been very productive with it in this over. Skidder at a length outside off, with some swing in. Stays deep in the crease and gets his bottom hand under this to whip it over long-on"
""
"short ball outside off, looks to clobber this cut, but loses shape and timing because of it. Gets it straight to extra cover"
"<b>Mavi keeps his cool</b> at deep midwicket, and takes this with a reverse cup right at the edge. Mandeep hits the pull nicely, to be fair. But the elevation is missing and it's a smart catch"
Kohli shuffles because there's a chance behind square on the leg side. But this yorker is perfectly done. Gets him at off stump. He jams it wide of long-on to come back for the second
short of a length and up at middle stump. Mistimed pulled again. Off the high part of the bat and to Mavi's left at deep midwicket. <b>That's fifty</b>
"yes. Yes, yes, yes. That bottom-handed whip again. Wide of long-on. Russell misses his length yet again and despite this being a slower ball, he is punished. Kohli barely moves his feet to get this right off the middle"
"<b>misses a full toss.</b> So much for my build up, Mr. CDG. It's juciy, knee-height, with plenty of room outside off and he completely misses it"
yorker. Nicely done. No room at all this time and he jams it out to sweeper cover
"sweetly timed, but not adequately placed. Overpitched ball just outside off and he gets it along the floor to long-off"
sliced to long-off's left. Another full toss. The old low full toss. Can't get a swing under this
"short ball at off stump. Gets deep in the crease and pulls it to deep midwicket's right . Rinku Singh puts in the slide, keeps it to two"
<b>beaten</b> outside off by a nicely done legcutter. But it has just gone wide of the marker. They sneak a run
"short ball outside off, cuts to sweeper cover off the bottom of the bat"
"overpitched outside off, looks to pummel this down the ground but as he's done all evening, he goes too hard at it and it trickles past the non-striker off the toe-end"
<b>sweetly timed</b> but Karthik has the field set for the full wide ball. Gets on his knee for this square drive and finds deep backward point
"<b>carved over sweeper cover!</b> Poor length from Mitch, but it's an offcutter so this is not an easy shot. CDG gets leg side of it, uses his reach to get under and puts in a lot of core strength to clear the fielder"
"<b>beaten</b> by the offcutter this time. At a length, not the worst ball to play that same shot again. But he looks to club this over midwicket this time"
"<b>beaten again</b> with the offcutter. Hits back of a length, finds grip and climb as Kohli brings out a square drive on the up"
<b>anticipates the slower ball</b> going across him and shuffles right into the off side. Mitch drops this cutter shorter than the others. This means Kohli's momentum moving backwards can be used to spring at the ball as it climbs up at his hips. He duly lofts it over deep backward square
"full ball at middle stump. Looking for the shape away from there, but there's none on that first ball. Lynn taps it back to the bowler"
full and straight. Lynn gets his legs out of the way and jams it to mid-on. Siraj fires a low-arm throw and the ball rolls through to the keeper who is backing up
slower short ball in the corridor. Climbs on top of it and dabs to backward poit
"finds some swing this time, but he can't get this to pitch. A floaty full toss outside off and he crunches it on the bounce to long-off"
<b>falls short of Kohli</b> who runs to his left and in front after Narine awkwardly fends this short ball uppishly. Another slower short ball. Kohli runs from slip but this sneaks through from under
another bouncer. Giving nothing to Narine today. He's hurried as he backs away to try and pull. Beaten but that's given wide on height
<b>skies a slower ball</b> but it clears mid-on and lands wide of long-off. <b>Another offuctter</b> but this one is back of a length. Narine wants to swat over midwicket but this goes away from him
"<b>shot!</b> What a shot! Umesh offers a length ball in the corridor, with all his pace. Narine is grateful for it on this slow pitch. Stands tall, merely taps from under this and sends it over long-off"
using that pace again. Short of a length again. Time for him to get leg side of this and lift it over short third man off the thick outside edge
"short of a length at off stump, dabs it into the covers with soft hands and steals a single"
full. Angled in at leg stump. Backs away and taps it to mid-off
changes it up. Low full toss outside off and Narine looks to run it past point with an open face. It lands in front of him on the bounce
"<b>slices it</b> but no one to take it as it lands near short midwicket! Narine can't get the hook away against a quick bouncer. It looks like Umesh has pulled something in his leg, because this wasn't too far from him for the catch. He couldn't get anywhere near it"
"<b>top edge</b> over short fine. Goes down leg side along with the bouncer, swings from under it. Clears the infield"
"<b>clears mid-on!</b> Will Royal Challenges ever figure this guy out? Even when they have a plan, it isn't working. Short of a length ball, he backs away and swings it over the diving McCullum off the toe-end"
<b>fends aerially</b> but there's no short leg. Of course. Another well-directed bouncer
"bouncer. Too short, too high, and a touch down leg side. The perfect wide?"
<b>beaten</b> outside off as he slashes on the up against an offcutter. It's on a length and lifting past the outside edge rapidly
"<b>lifts it just over the infield</b> on the off side. No, we have not switched to permanent bold tags to start commentary lines. Narine living on the edge but doing a great job. Couldn't quite get under this overpitched bal and got it over cover off the toe-end"
slower ball at a length. Back down the pitch off the inside edge as he looks to heave
nicely placed. Length ball outside off. A legbreak. Not too full. And there's bounce on it. But Lynn shuffles and sweeps from under it to get four at long leg
<b>inside edge</b> onto pad. He hasn't picked the flipper. No forward press as he punches late at this length ball on off
"length ball outside off, looks to sweep and gets an inside edge onto pad. Loud appeal for lbw from the bowler, turned down"
"<b>dropped!</b> Kohli has his face covered at slip as M Ashwin puts down a sitter at extra cover. Chahal has done superbly to induce a leading edge from Lynn -  a dipping legbreak at off stump that he looks to lift over midwicket. There was no pressure on Ashwin, apart from anything he put on himself. He got under it, couldn't complete it"
"length ball on middle stump, looks to slog, thick inside edge to deep midwicket"
"length at off stump, blocked on the front foot and a single stolen past the bowler"
"looks to go straight, looks to go full. Lynn knows and is backing away. Makes room and clubs it wide of mid-off after taking it on the full"
yorker outside off. Backs away but can't get this drive away. Jammed back down the pitch
bouncer outside off. Looks to climb into the pull but it's an inside edge to short midwicket
"<b>shot!</b> Lynn with the quality! Predicts the line and length again, has his front leg out of the way, a strong base as he waits like a boxer. Umesh delivers, full at off stump, and he bludgeons this straight and flats"
"slower ball, length and width on it outside off. Slapped straight to cover point who misfields"
bouncer at leg stump. Awkwardly defended
<b>beaten.</b> Nicely bowled. Length ball turning away from outside off. He's not to the pitch as he looks to drive
"length ball at leg stump, exposes the stumps and sweeps as this spins towards him. Gets it straight to short fine"
length ball at off. Very slow. Look to sweep and cops this on the back the thigh
"slaughtered. Lynn slowly getting back to his best. Length ball on off stump, backs away into the leg side this time. Exposes the stumps and drives over extra cover on the up"
"short of a length outside off, punched to extra cover"
"<b>oh so close!</b> What a delivery. Drift, flight, dip at off stump. Lynn backs into the off side and looks to swipe over the infield. It fizzes past off stump as he misses"
starts the over with a bouncer on the leg side
"full and straight at 145kmh now, Narine drives it uppishly down to long off"
"<strong>148kmh</strong>, short ball to Lynn, he pulls a bit swkwardly to long leg"
"neatly in the block hole, driven down with hard hands to long on"
"angles it in nicely towards the stumps, Lynn blocks it back"
shot ball outside off and Lynn scythes it mercilessly behind square on the off side. That raced to the boundary in no time!
full on middle and leg now and worked to midwicket. He sends Narine back
"strikes first ball, Narine <strong>holes out to long off</strong>! Tall man de Grandhomme takes a couple steps back at long off and raises his arms over his head to grab the ball and just keeps his feet inside the boundary. It was pitched up, Narine went straight down the ground but didn't get enough for this small ground"
the ball turns into him and he tucks it off the back foot to leg to get off the mark
bit of flight outside off and Lynn paddles it away to long leg
<strong>turns it a mile</strong> outside off! Uthappa went back in the crease to asses the turn and couldn't get close to it eventually
"de Grandhomme at the same position, long on for right-hander, he jumps with a big stretch near the rope and just gets a hand to it. Was really really tough after Uthappa lofted it straight almost effortlessly"
beats him on the last ball with a beautiful leg break from length on middle and leg and there's good turn to take the ball past the outside edge
"bangs in a bouncer at 143, too high and called wide"
pulls the short ball but doesn't get hold of it and gets a single to long on
"back of length and angling into him, Uthappa defends it back"
"looked like he rolled his fingers over that one, on length around off and Uthappa finds Umesh at cover"
"short fine leg dives but it <b>goes through him</b>! Siraj angled it a bit too much into the batsman and Uthappa did well to glance it fine, although it should have been stopped"
taps this one square on the off side for a quick single
"slower one bordering on the wide line, not called a wide and Siraj must be relieved"
reverse sweeps it straight to Kohli at slip after it was pitched up on off by Ashwin
"what timing and wrist work! Bit too full on the pads and he used those supple wrists so, so nicely to flick it and that bisected long on and deep midwicket. Rolled all along the ground"
Ashwin pitches this one shorter and Uthappa reverse-sweeps this one in the air and wide of Kohli to the third man area. Four more for the placement
leans into the legbreak and pushes it to cover for one
"too short, pulled in the gap, not with much power and four more! Lynn went down on a knee when he saw the short ball and hit that one right between long leg and deep midwicket"
"shortish again, pulled again but to deep midwicket this time"
sweeps that one from outside leg to deep fine leg right from the middle of the bat
<strong>what a beauty</strong>! You pitch it up to Uthappa and he will swing that bat absolutely straight and with such elegance. It goes straight and high for six
pushes this one with the turn to off for one
takes a step towards the off side and sweeps it hard against the spin to deep midwicket
"<strong>beaten</strong> outside off! Beautiful leg break from Chahal around middle and off, tempting Uthappa to lean forward and defend, and then it turns away past the outside edge"
brings it shorter and he goes back in the crease to whip it to leg for one
starts with a full delivery and Uthappa drives it back
runs the short of length ball down to third man nicely
that's a mean bouncer towards Lynn and he just about sways his head out of the line of the ball. One for the over
"short and wide at 113kmh, thrashed to deep point with those strong arms"
"nice and straight towards the off stump, Uthappa says 'wait' after steering that to midwicket"
"two from five balls and a short ball to end the over. That's sailed over square leg into the crowd! Uthappa did a little pivot on the back foot for the short one, and opened himself up to pull-swat that away"
"nicely flighted outside off, Lynn moves towards the ball and bunts it down to long on"
"too much flight, too wide outside off with the turn and it's a wide"
"the flight has worked, he holes out to long on! It was pitched up with a lot of revs, Uthappa got near the ball nicely, struck it hard and straight but Southee was waiting there at long on with his long arms. Ashwin is pumped!"
a wrong'un around off and he goes back to push it into the covers for one
sweeps it <strong>in the air </strong> but it lands safely beyond square leg as Lynn went a fair bit across to off
"much flatter and quicker, Lynn tries to sweep again and misses!"
he is sweeping everything. Pitched up outside off but Lynn plants his long leg across and...sweeps
"a bit too short and Lynn puts his knee down and sweeps that with some power, from outside off and it's raced to the square-leg boundary. Wasn't too far from the umpire"
"full delivery just outside off, misses the sweep this time, good reply from Chahal"
"reverse-sweeps this time from middle and leg, straight to short third man"
"excellent effort from Umesh at deep fine leg. The flat delivery on middle and leg was swept again and past short fine leg, Umesh ran across from deep backward square and rolled along to get both hands on it"
sweeps away to bring up his fifty with that single
"too short, Rana rocks back and pulls it to deep midwicket"
"looked like an offcutter outside off, Rana gets a thick inside edge to cover"
short enough for Rana to stay back and punch it square for one
"big heave for the fullish ball around off, doesn't middle but sends it to long on"
"pivots on the back foot to pull, it's a slow bouncer and Rana mistimes it completely, it hits his arm and they run across for one"
tucks the ball with the angle to leg for one
chops the ball off the back foot to point and say 'no'
"<strong>superb wrong'un</strong>, Lynn sweeps as usual and that turns in dangerously to just miss the off stump"
sweeps that to chip it in the air towards the vacant area in square leg
"excellent running effort to catch that at deep cover but it's jut out of his reach! Rana didn't pick that googly, he miscued that with a leading edge and it went very high, Umesh ran a long way to his left, put in a dive but can't blame him for not taking that"
""
"tries to sweep that one from waaayy outside off against th turn and QdK can't hold on to it, bye"
goes down on a knee as the ball turns in and he paddle-scoops that fine and high to the fine-leg boundary
tries the wide yorker and it's gone a bit too wide
uses a strong bottom hand to drill that through the covers. Have to settle for one
"Chahal gets to the ball but it's gone for four! It was full outside off, Rana jammed his bat in to steer it just behind square to make Chahal run to his left from third man. He rolled to get his hands on the ball, but it went through"
"<strong>gone first ball on his 30th birthday</strong>! The crowd has come alive, I tell you. Siraj banged it in and Russell went hard at it with a swing of the arms, got only a top edge and de Kock ran a long way back to complete a superb catch"
"sends a wide on the off side, outside the tramlines"
gets the wide yorker right this time and Lynn jams his bat in for a single to deep point
"Southee has a shy at the stumps from point, he can see only one of them and he misses as Lynn is miles away, he finally makes it and then even comes back for the overthrow. DK drove that straight to point and took off, Lynn wasn't sure and was nearly stuck on the pitch but DK was a long way down before Southee misses. No back up, little more mix up and that's two runs"
"two full to DK, he brings out the cover drive and drills that along the ground, just wide of deep cover. Four!"
the big back lift sees the low full toss with a wobbly seam outside off and he whacks it straight down to beat long on. Strong arms and shoulders coming into play
"full and wide, drives that away to deep cover for one"
"We have a <strong>direct hit</strong> and the third umpire comes into play, but he's safe. DK closed the face of the bat to tuck the ball to leg with soft hands and said 'two' repeatedly as Vohra rain in from the leg side, they can back just in time"
"it's a slow and short cutter, short enough for DK to pivot on the back foot and pull it fine behind square. It's beaten depe fine leg too. The captain is not wasting any time here"
chips the fullish ball down to long on
"low full toss lofted down the ground, long off runs to his right and they come back for the second easily"
"slices that one high on the off side and it lands beyond backward point, wide of sweeper cover for two"
"oh my, how did he hit that! It was a short of length ball, mid off was in and DK lofted it straight over his head for a six!"
"lands it short this time, and DK pulls it square for two more"
"he's hitting those drives and pulls so well, tries a reverse paddle now and misses"
"<strong>what a catch by Kohli</strong>! DK lofted it straight down yet again, Kohli's eyes spot it and he sprints across full speed in front and to his left from long on. Puts in a full-length dive just in time and gets both his hands under the ball"
little full towards the pads and it's worked to leg for one
"<b>Gill hits the winning runs</b>, takes his helmet off immediately and swings his bat in the air with his right arm, such passion! Gets a hug from Lynn. Short and wide, he stays on top the ball and cuts it square and fast"
