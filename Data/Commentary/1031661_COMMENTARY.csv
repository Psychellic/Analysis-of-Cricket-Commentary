"tremendous bowling! Hugely well deserved wicket, as Broad is completely cleaned up by a pinpoint yorker. Crashes into the middle stump, and England are nine-down!"
"beats the edge, quite an over!"
"outside off, left alone"
"wide on the crease, but defended with confidence on the off stump. What can Woakes do to reinflate England's innings?"
"outside off, a flat-footed poke into the off side"
"driven into the off side, without much timing"
"edged and gone! England's tail goes meekly, as Roach picks up one of the hardest-earned four-wicket hauls of all time. Good carry outside off, a loose flash from a batsman keen to keep the scoreboard moving"
good shape straightaway from Anderson. Outside off and bending past an upraised bat
through to the keeper once more. Anderson finding conventional swing from the outset
"straighter line, bending into the pads, and tucked to leg. Miss those, and it'll be a big shout ..."
"through to the keeper this time, as Anderson recalibrates for the left-hander"
"angled across the bows, gathered at chest-height by Bairstow"
"close! But a slight inside-edge probably ends all doubt in umpire Ravi's mind. Might have pitched outside leg too, but a full length and it seamed appreciably back into the left-hander."
"back of a length, angled into the pads, tucked smartly through midwicket"
"full length, booming late swing once the ball had gone past the bat. Bairstow tumbles to gather in front of slip"
"back of a length, a cherry-picked single to midwicket"
"round the wicket, outside off, through to the keeper"
through to the keeper on a tight off-stump line
"well bowled, and decently played, rising delivery outside off, angled into the left-hander, who manages to keep his bat just about inside the line"
"outswing from a full length, left alone"
"stabbed into the off side, up on the toes on the back foot"
"straining for the swing, and fires this one into the pads, tucked to square leg"
"big outswinger, Brathwaite plays the line well"
"fuller and straighter, watches the swing onto the bat and jammed into the leg side"
"attacking the top of off with good shape, blocked"
too wide to tempt a stroke. Left alone
tighter line but another good leave on a good length
"bashing out a good rhythm outside off, but still not quite demanding a response from the batsmen"
"left alone again, too wide to lure a stroke"
"round the wicket, Powell lines it up and lets it go"
"through to the keeper. A maiden, but a relatively staid one"
"inswinger, the first of his spell, but picked early and jabbed to the leg side"
"good follow-up, an outswinger on a much fuller length. Cramped defence"
"well played, big outswinger on a full length but met with a very straight bat. Anderson stoops in his followthrough to gather"
"left alone outside off, back of a length this time"
"better length in this over from Anderson, dragging Brathwaite forward to defend on the front foot"
"outside off, no stroke this time. Solid from Brathwaite"
"edged, but clean through the gap at fourth slip! Full length from round the wicket, a hint of movement, and at least Powell is off the mark!"
up on the toes to defend on the back foot
"outside off, shoulders arms"
"beaten, big nip off the pitch, and Powell does well not to follow the movement and nick it"
"pushed into the off side, Broad is starting to feel in the mood"
"attacking the midriff from back of a length, there's a short leg in place but it lands safe"
"outside off, nibbling off the seam, through to the keeper"
"swinging from leg to off, gathered by the keeper"
"there we go! Anderson took his time to find his range, but Powell's tentative footwork made that unplayable in the end. Full length, swinging late, and climbing off the seam to boot. Kisses the edge and Cook tumbles backwards at first slip to claim his 150th Test catch!"
"massive inswinger to the left-hander, whose crease-bound footwork makes it tough to keep out"
"outside off, climbing off the seam"
"defended on the back foot, the end of a successful over"
tapped to the off side
too wide to tempt a stroke
"round the wicket, jagging off the seam, but too short to tempt the edge"
"big nip off the seam, but too wide once again"
"much fuller and straighter, dug out with determination on the crease"
pushed onto the back foot and blocked. Another over survived
"up on the toes, defended off the back foot to cover"
"bending back in a touch, but well enough played off the back foot"
"Sizzler! Cuts Brathwaite in half with the wobble-seam, climbs off the deck and over the stumps. Lay a bat on that!"
stabbed tentatively through the off side
"full and threatening, but well watched onto the bat. Miss that and it's plumb"
"nibbles off the deck and past the outside edge. It's tough going out there, but West Indies are digging in well"
"round the wicket, on the back foot. Blocked"
"banged in short, sails harmlessly down the leg side"
"on the pads, they settle for the single. Now then, Bishoo could be exposed to Jimmy's wiles if it stays like this..."
punched back down the pitch
"on the hip, tucked square, they pick off a couple as the fielder drifts in from the rope"
"back of a length, dabbed back to the bowler"
"round the wicket, that's a good length, attacking the top of off"
"back over the wicket now, mixing the line up as Bishoo leaves alone"
"fuller length, solid block on off stump"
down the leg side
attacking the stumps with outswing to the left hander. Defended
too wide. Last over of the day coming up
"decent exploratory delivery, on off stump with a threat of outswing"
"lifting off the pitch, dabbed into the off side"
"too short to really threaten, punched off the back foot to short leg"
"big jag off the seam, but started wide and went wider"
"on the pads, clipped fine, they rush back for two, which once again undermines the point of the nightwatchman, but still... one ball to go"
"edged...! But down into the cordon, and that is <B>stumps</B>"
"good start from Anderson, angles across just short of a length and Bishoo is uncertain as he leaves alone"
"back of a length at off stump, defended to cover...some sun bursts through the clouds, that's what West Indies want"
fiddles away from his body at a delivery which moves away off the seam and is beaten
"there's the other one, the inswinger, Bishoo leaves and the ball ends up travelling over off stump...could still be a touch fuller, though"
"this one is a little further up, moves away from the left hander, left alone"
"pushed across outside off, a more comfortable leave this one...most of that over was just back of a length"
"short of a length at off stump, touch of extra bounce, he takes the bottom hand off the bat as he defends to the leg side"
"width outside off, short again, he can't take advantage as he slaps to mid-off and then Broad has a kick of his take-off area"
"on off stump, short of a length, defended on the back foot"
"that's a better length and finds the edge, fuller outside off, Brathwaite feels for it and the ball dies in front of second slip then bursts through Root at second slip"
"a bouncer, reasonably gentle pace off the surface, he ducks"
"some seam movement back in at Brathwaite from a fuller length, takes him high on the pads"
"this is very full outside off, hint of swing back, left alone"
"that's a beauty! Pitches around middle and leg, turns Bishoo around as it starts to swing away then moves further off the seam"
gets behind the line of this short-of-a-length delivery and defends to mid-on
"on off stump, he's able to play this off the back foot to the covers"
"full and straight, Bishoo standing around leg stump, gets his bat down in time and pushes to mid-off"
"full at off stump, shaping away, defended towards backward point"

gets onto the front foot and defends a full delivery quite late
zips past the outside edge from short of a length
"gets this fuller and beats Bishoo all ends up again, misses the edge by a long way in the end"
"that's the spot, full outside off, encourages the drive from Bishoo and he's playing at fresh air again"
"<b>slashes and edges to the keeper!</b> Not Anderson's finest delivery, dragged it short outside off stump, Bishoo saw the chance of a cut shot but just got a top edge to Bairstow. Well, so much for pitching it up!"
"short of a length outside off, left alone"
"full outside off, Hope a little static as he tries to get forward and drives to mid-off"
"full at off stump, defended to the bowler"
"edged, but short of first slip! Good length outside off, Brathwaite just as a fiddle, reasonably hard hands but the ball falls well short of Cook"

"pulls the length back a little, nice carry at waist height to Bairstow"

"that's a decent nut, starts just outside off and moves away to beat the outside edge"
"touch fuller, at off stump, Hope tries to get forward and defends towards point"

"touch wide outside off, 85mph, left alone"
"back of a length at off stump, defended to the covers"
"fuller at off stump, plays a little across the ball and drives it wide of mid-off...the second run was actually pretty tight, Brathwaite pretty lazy and that would have been tight with a hit! Would have been gone!"
"<b>edged, and superb catch at second slip!</b> Gets it on the full length at off stump, it's actually the inswinger, Hope pushing off the front foot, thick edge and Root dives across to his left to hold a sharp one"
"a booming inswinger! Shai Hope is just about alert to hit and gets the ball, albeit at an angle, slicing into the off side"
"back of a length outside off, defended to cover"
across to off stump and plays to the off side
"fuller, nice swing away outside off, left alone"

"on the stumps this time, defended to the covers"
"wider outside off, left alone"
"a straighter delivery, think it was the inswinger, tucked off his pads to long leg"
"in the channel outside off, full length, shapes away and Hope makes sure he doesn't chase it"
"a shorter delivery, rises past the outside edge as Hope just manages to drop his hands"
"and now this one is full and moves a mile, Bairstow ends up taking it in front of first slip...pitched not far from off stump"
"just gets a little too straight this time, worked off the pads into midwicket"
"good length outside off, that's good batting as he taps into the off side and rotates the strike"
"wider on the crease, good length at off stump, slides off a thickish outside edge through gully to third man"
"not a great start, short and wide outside off, dispatched through the off side with a strong square drive"
"bit more effort in this one, good length outside off, Brathwaite across his crease and defends towards mid-on"
"full, wide outside off, a tumbling take for Bairstow"
"nearly gets an edge on this, wasn't a great delivery, width outside off but Brathwaite missed his cut shot...there was some late movement"

"adjust his line, full outside off, defended to the bowler"
"good delivery, full outside off, zings through to the keeper as Hope plays with his bat behind his pad"
"edged, and another falls short of the cordon! Hope actually did well to not push too hard and the ball skids under Westley's hands"
"beats him this time, good length outside off, this one just straightens a fraction"
"that's a ripping delivery! England appeal for a number of things as Hope is completely squared up. Think they mainly went for the catch. Beat the edge, clipped the back pad. An excellent decision by Gaffaney. Too high for lbw as well"
"a jabby defensive shot outside off, played to gully"
"back of a length at off stump, defended on his toes"
"better length from Broad, fuller and attacking the off stump from wide on the crease"
"huge appeal, and up goes the finger! An immediate <B>review</B>, which suggests there might have been an inside edge. Nothing else is going to save him as that was smashing middle! And sure enough, HotSpot coughs up the evidence!"
"drawn forward outside off, and pushed back down the pitch"
"short and wide, and spanked through point. No missing out on those"
"much fuller, much better. Blocked on the line of off stump, back to the bowler"
"rising a touch on off stump, punched into the off side"
"gosh, you can't lay a bat on that! Full and swinging, explodes off the pitch and past a whooshing drive"
"over-pitched a fraction, Hope checks his stroke and waits for the swing to kick in before pushing to mid-on"
"zippy full length, this one holds its line and says good morning to the off stump as Hope leaves alone"
"squared up on the crease, and blocked into the off side"
"good stride forward, a smothered angled steer, down through the cordon and away to third man. Well played in the end"
"beaten by extra zip off the pitch. Well bowled, well played"

"inside edge from a full length, crashes into the pads"
"up on the toes, punched firmly through point. Good strike"
"back of a length, hint of movement, no stroke offered"

"on the back foot, waiting for the ball to arrive and punched into the gap in the covers"
whistling through to the keeper once more
"clipped off the pads, out to midwicket"
"full, straight, blocked late, and down into the pitch. The ball bounces worryingly back towards the stumps, but safe in the end"
"down the leg side. Good take from Bairstow, but another poor ball. Broad is straining to make things happen this morning"
"more big inswing, but on the wrong line. Hope walks inside the line and flicks casually through fine leg"
solidly onto the front foot. Blocked once more
"wider outside off stump, hits the seam but never a danger of luring a stroke"
"good exploratory line and length, outside off"
"on the pads, tucked into the leg side"
"leg-sided once more, but cut off this time by a diving square leg"
sliding down the leg side. Again. Stokes is trying to cramp the right-hander for room but hasn't found his line yet
that's better. Hitting the seam just outside off stump and climbing through to the keeper
clipped into the leg side again
"driven calmly back to the bowler, who can't gather cleanly and surrenders the single"
"sharp spin from back of a length, punched with the turn to wide mid-on"
"outside off, chopped through backward point"
"big turn, and up goes the finger! Brathwaite <B>reviews</B>, as well he might, but unless that hit him outside the line, he's in big trouble here. Trapped on the crease, height is unlikely to be an issue... and yes, he was outside the line! Wow... a vital let-off!"
"a contemptuous smite over the leg-side to celebrate his let-off, and he's brought up his fifty with a six! Tremendously gutsy innings, and there's a lot more of that to come, he'll hope..."
"striding onto the front foot, and blocked into the off side"
through to the keeper on a good length
looks like that kept a touch low ... but safe enough as the ball fizzes past off
"back of a length, fended away with caution"
"another huge appeal, but not out once more. A zippy full length, and a clear noise as the ball passes the batsman, but Chris Gaffaney reckons that was back pad, and he's spot on!"
"<I>huge</I> inswing from Stokes! Has that struck pad first ... no, it hasn't ... a fat inside-edge, and England do well not to review that one"
"much wider this time, Hope leaves alone with gratitude"
"a measured drive to mid-off, feeling for the length"
onto the front foot
dumped over long-on! Have some of that!
onto the front foot to block once more

"up on the toes, tapped to cover"
"rising on off stump, punched to cover"
"shorter, ducks"
"big inducker, fenced into the cordon. That's the sort of ball that would have been a pre-ordained wicket in the first Test. Much more watchful now"

clipped to silly mid-on
"onto the front foot, blocked back to the bowler"
"onto the back foot, defended"
clipped firmly into the gap at wide long-on

"gets this fuller at off stump, Hope comes forward and takes the bottom hand off the bat"
"this is a thick outside edge to a full ball as he drives but it skews fine of gully to third man...Anderson had conceded 10 runs in 12 overs, now eight in three balls"

"full outside off, sweetly driven to mid-off"
"back of a length outside off, defended to the covers and there's a jogged single on offer"

"goes for the yorker, it's a low full toss which is clipped to mid-on"

"fuller, left alone...80mph"
"tighter to off stump, Stoneman holds his bat inside the line"
"good length at off stump, defended"
comes forward and drives to mid-off
defended square into the off side

back and across to defend on off stump
"swinging across the left-hander, left well alone"
through to the keeper on a wide line once more

good signs of turn from a full off-stump length
"wide outside off, no stroke once more"
through to the keeper

drying up the runs with three close catchers on the off side

"up on the toes, pushed out to point"
"good constraining line, tight to the off stump but angled away. No stroke offered"
pushed back down the pitch
"firmly forward, pushed to cover"
stabbed forward defence. Deflects into the leg side to bring up the fifty stand
round the wicket and squared up on off stump. Fenced to the gully. This is a decent holding role from Holder

solidly onto the front foot this time
tucked to midwicket
"forward and blocked, bat in front of pad"
"firm punched drive into the covers, well placed as the sweeper slips as he gathers"

"ooh, a flinch from Cook outside off, as Holder finds some extra lift. Uncharacteristically loose, but survives"
"well bowled! Lovely follow-up, very full, nibbling away, perfect line and length"
bat and pad together to smother the length delivery. More like it from Cook
"gone this time! Dangling it out there, four balls in a row on that perfect line and length, and Cook, most unusually, can't prevent himself from taking the bait, a tentative poke outside the line for Dowrich to gather a vital edge!"
"nibble off the seam to greet Westley, but back of a length so no danger of an edge"
stays low outside off. A good leave in the end
now then. That is sharp turn from a good length. And Stoneman is comprehensively beaten
"more turn, more easily left, but plenty to think about"
"another good delivery, pitching on off and tweaking away"
"left alone again, Dowrich leaps behind the stumps to gather a big turner"
slapped into the covers. That's a very fine maiden. England are in some bother in these conditions
"nips off the seam, beats the edge. It's like facing a slo-mo Curtly Ambrose!"

wafted into the leg side to get off the mark
"on the pads, flicked into the gap at midwicket"
big stride forward
"flicked off the hip, walking across the stumps"
big turn from outside off
compactly onto the front foot
good judgement from Stoneman as he lets this one fizz harmlessly by
"tight line, good length, no stroke offered"
"sliding down the leg side. A rare loose one, but Westley can't connect with a flick"
a wild swing through the line. Looking for the pull that wasn't there
"back on a probing length, left alone tight to the off stump"
"nips back into Westley, who judges the length well and lets it go by"
"solidly forward, another maiden totted up"
"<strong>edged, but safe!</strong> Just about down into the ground, through the gap at third slip, but not the shot he was looking for..."
"big appeal from Gabriel! That looked to have pitched outside leg, but Holder is going to use a <B>review</B>. No bat involved ... but yes, outside leg it is. On we go"
through to the keeper
"wild and woolly, way outside off stump"
"up on the toes, defensive poke to the on side"
"flicked through the leg side, a decent yorker but fended away well from round the wicket"

"round the wicket, good length outside off, left alone"
"good delivery, short of a length at off stump, squares up Stoneman and finds the edge but it's well short of gully"
"that's a nasty one! Comes back a long way from outside off, short of a length, jags in at Stoneman who gets cramp for room and hammers into his glove"
"good response from Stoneman as he clips a ball away off his pads through square leg...not the best follow-up from Holder, although it did move late"

edged! But short of slip...Stoneman coming forward to a full delivery
"a little shorter again, cut off the back foot to cover"
"oh, my goodness! What a shambles out there. Westley should have been run out. A complete mix-up between the batsmen. It started with a nice cover drive towards deep cover, Stoneman always wanted two but Westley wasn't moving. Stoneman was almost all the way back for the second so Westley had to start running, the throw was wide, Bishoo dropped it initially but still had to get to the stumps but decided to shy at them instead. And missed"
defended to mid-on

"back of a length at off stump, 76mph, defended to cover"

"full outside off, left alone"
"81mph, left alone"
"fuller, brings him forward, drives to mid-off"

"that's quite a tight leave, just outside off stump...when it doesn't hit the woodwork it's good judgement"
"full at off stump, defended to cover"
"full outside off, pushed to mid-on"
edged! But short of second slip. A full and straight delivery which Root was aiming to work to leg
"full outside off, gets forward and drives back to the bowler...West Indies drying things up superbly"

"good delivery, nips back off the seam past the inside edge and takes him above the pads"
"outside off, tails back but is wide enough to leave"

"round the wicket, very full, dug out to mid-on"
"short of a length, pushed down the leg side, and he's overstepped for the first time in this spell"

"<B>what a ball!</b> Takes off stump. But they are checking for the no-ball! It's very close. Is there anything behind that line? Jeepers, he gets away with it. The delivery, itself, deserved the wicket. Pitched on off stump, straighten to beat the edge and clatter off stump"
"stays round the wicket, full and straight, dug out to midwicket"
works a length delivery to the leg side
"full outside off, 87mph, defended to cover"
"short of a length outside off, played off the back foot and well fielded at gully"

"up on the toes, cut hard to backward point"
"edged and <B>dropped!</B> Oh dear, so much pressure being built up by the bowlers, and this time it's Root once again with the let off! A forcing stroke off the back foot, straight at Kyle Hope's face at the first of two gullies, and the rebound nearly reached the second too!"
"outside off, ploughing that furrow"
"up on the toes, punched to cover"
"wide on the crease, attacking off stump, fenced to gully"
"good stride into line, crunched through the covers. That's better from Root"
"on the back foot, fenced to point"

"fuller and straighter, blocked"
"in the slot for the cut this time, but can't beat point"

punch-drive to mid-off
a stride into line and left alone
"sumptuous drive. A swinging half-volley, and pumped through the gap"

"up on the toes, punched to point"
forward and turned off the pads to backward square
"looped up, on the toes, clipped behind square"
"back onto the stumps, clipped very fine, and Holder continues to leak boundaries. If only he had another specialist bowler to turn to?"
"pinned in front of the stumps and up goes the finger! That came from nowhere, Holder sheds the powderpuff balls of most of this spell, and spears in a faster, straighter one that Root is exceptionally late on... but hold on, it's <strong>missing leg!</strong> Wow. That looked plumb to the naked eye... Root knew better ..."

"round the wicket, another huge shout as Malan is pinned on the crease, and West Indies are <B>reviewing</B>. Probably sliding down, but who knows after that last one ... yep, clipping leg. Unlucky for Holder. If Umpire Ravi had given it it would have stayed out"

"outside off, through to the keeper"
"width outside off, crunched to deep point"
"good start, full length, threatening to turn, smothered on the front foot"
a wristy drive to deep cover
"short and crushed through midwicket. That was a dirty long-hop. But, a bit like my cat spraying all over my Wisdens after I've failed to feed her for an hour, that may have been a dirty protest from the bowler"
forward and pushed to mid-on
tucked off the hip to square leg
"wide outside off, turns inside the edge of a loose cut"
"bouncer. Well intended, but too short to threaten Root"
"short, wide, leg-sided, eludes Dowrich, and that's six runs from no balls so far ..."

"through to the keeper, and an ironic round of applause for the legal delivery!"
"outside off, and left alone once more"
leaning forward and clipped to the leg side. Looking for the single but Root is having none of it with three balls of the day remaining
"short and wide, Malan sets himself for the cut and leaves well alone"

"watchfully pushed to mid-on, and England close on an effective 2 for 3..."
"full outside off, left alone"
"good length outside off, takes the outside edge but goes to ground and scoots through the gap between second slip and first gully"
across his crease and pushes a length delivery point

"in the channel outside off, Malan holds his bat inside the line and the ball doesn't carry on the full"

"full at off stump, it's a no-ball and nicely driven straight of mid-off. Lovely piece of timing to get Malan going for the day"

"short outside off, left alone"
"fuller, he keeps his bat inside the line, close to his pad"
comes across his crease and then leaves a full delivery
"makes him play this time, squirts off a thick outside edge towards backward point"
"shorter, wider and harmless"
"well bowled, this nips off the seam to beat the edge although there is a small appeal...plenty of daylight between bat and ball. That would have been like Flintoff and Auckland in 2002 to give that (of course we have DRS now)"
"speared down the leg side, keeps moving as it reaches Dowrich who can only palm it away to fine leg with an out-stretched glove"
"pushed way outside off, gathered in front of second slip and called wide"
"tight run! Malan had to get the dive out...he pushed a very full delivery almost straight to mid-off. Holder collected and threw, one stump to aim out. But Malan's dive could well have saved him even with a hit"

"short of a length outside off, pushed off the back foot to the covers and a well-judged single. Gabriel not impressed"
"length ball outside off, steered to backward point with an open face"
"just over square leg! The ball angled in at Malan, he flicks it away off his body and just gets the elevation to beat a leaping fielder. Gabriel goes to his knees"
"goes full and straight, aims for the yorker, it's a low full toss which is sweetly timed through square leg"
"wide on the crease again, full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"has a bit of a fiddle outside off and this, beats the edge, and then practises the leave"
"back of a length outside off, punched to cover"

"back of a length outside off, driven to deep point"
"full outside off, considerable movement back as it passes the stumps"
gets a stride forward into a full delivery and blocks to cover
"<b>he's gone, at the second grab!</b> This is a huge moment. A short ball outside off, Root is cramped for room as he tries to play it down through gully. Can't get over the top of the ball, picks out Shai Hope at gully who needs to grabs to hang on"
"pushed across full outside off, left alone"
"good length, through to the keeper"
"full at off stump, defended to mid-on...another no-ball, but he probably won't mind one more delivery at the new batsman"

"round the wicket, short of a length, defended to cover on the back foot"
"there's the movement! A full delivery outside off, shapes away late from Malan to defeat the drive"
"<b>dropped!</b> Oh, no, West Indies! Another full delivery, wide outside off, shapes away a touch again. Malan drives, gets the edge, Dowrich dives across in front of first slip who then grasses the chance"

"flogged across the line to mid on, but no way through"
"appreciable turn, helped round the corner but the man on the 45 is well placed"
flicked to mid-on
"dropped short, and walloped gratefully over the leg side. That's a rank pressure-loosener. And Holder probably has a wry internal smile"
"round the wicket, tight line to the left-hander"
pushed into the covers
"tight line outside off stump, well left once more"
"well bowled again! Just nipping around on a full, tight length. Malan tries to drop his gloves but can't help flinching towards the ball"
"wider line, an easier leave this time"
probing away. Another maiden for the diligent Holder
"turning down the leg side, left alone"
"stands tall on the back foot, punching with the spin"
"solidly onto the front foot, neutering the spin with a dead bat outside off"
"flicked off the toes, right across to off stump for that stroke as backward square gathers"
a compact drive to cover
"looped up, and blocked to midwicket. Tight over"
through to the keeper from round the wicket. Holder keeping it tight again

"tidy line, outside off and threatening to go straight on. Stokes goes back to defend"
"outside edge, playing for the turn but it eludes the lurking slip"

"through to the keeper on a wider, outswinging line"
pushed back onto the stumps to defend with an upright stance
"punched to cover, Holder giving nothing away"
"very full, very straight. Blocked for another maiden"
"a loud appeal, but a hopeful one, as Bishoo turns one into the pads, but it's outside the line. Would have been clipping, mind you"
tucked to the leg side
"working with the spin, on the back foot"
"spanked. That's lovely, reaching for the ball, head right over it on contact, and crunched through wide long-off"
"worked to the leg-side, using the spin to rotate the strike"
"on the pads, easy pickings as Malan rushes through quickly and makes one into two."
"over the wicket, across the bows, through to the keeper"
"punched firmly to mid-on, right behind the line"
driven with a compact stance to mid-off
"right behind the line once again, punching back to the bowler"
into line to defend once more. Holder giving nothing away
"a fraction wider, but not so wide that Stokes dare free his arms. Poked towards gully to tot up another maiden"
turned into the leg side
"drifting towards the pads again, worked behind square"
punched urgently out to point
nudged off the straight and narrow to midwicket
forward and blocked to mid-off. Good from Bishoo. Tight lines
"ooh... a tip and run to midwicket, might have been close had the pick-up been true, but it was a fumble"

solidly met on the front foot with a diligent block

swinging through to the keeper
tight and straight once more

"crunched down the ground, a very full delivery, he doesn't bother moving his feet much, swings through the line, strikes the ball into the pitch and it skips straight back past the bowler"

"slips down the leg side, started too straight"
pushed a length delivery into the big gap at cover
"full at off stump, defended to mid-on"
"wow! That is a superbly judged catch from Brathwaite on the long-off rope! Stokes gave it some serious welly, but got more height than distance. Even so, it looked as though it was six all the way, but Brathwaite balanced on the edge of the rope, pocketed the chance as it plopped from the heavens, and managed to avoid over-stepping. Top effort!"

nudged off the hip
"bowled him! Well done Roston Chase ... his line today has been appreciably tighter to the stumps, and this one worms its way through Malan's defences.

"on the back foot, punched to the off side"
"through to the keeper, left well alone"
hardly any bounce this time. This pitch is getting capricious
solidly behind the line to defend
"firmly forward, onto the front foot"

"that's superb. A decent length outside off stump, and whipped with power and timing through mid-on. That's a stroke and a half"
"<B>dropped in the covers</B>, but to be frank, it was a brilliant goalkeeper's save of four runs. <em>Smashed </em>on the up, and Kyle Hope made tremendous ground, high to his left, but couldn't cling on"

into line to defend
"makes room with a soft-shoe shuffle outside leg, and flogs a back-foot punch through point. Fast feet, fast hands"
"on the pads, flicked with the spin to midwicket"
"reverse sweep, and Bairstow has dragged on! A bottom-edge, rolls past the back pad, into the timbers, and Jonny is so livid, he nearly takes out the keeper with a wild swing of his axe. He couldn't have looked more like Jack Nicholson if he tried ..."

driven compactly to cover
"hello, what's happened here? A definite noise as ball passes bat ... but no-one really appeals! Nope, nothing doing. Must have been bat on pad"

"<B>walllllooooopppp!</B> Clears the front leg, and utterly pans Anderson back over his head and into the stands! This is what Blackwood can do, hang caution, and just tonk it, son"
"up on the toes, and pushed to point"
"crashed on the up once more, a more conventional drive on the up, and long-off is lurking ... but it lands short ..."
"a good compact drive down the ground, is this the hundred? No, a good save at mid-on keeps Hope on 99..."
"a wild wallop, but it's the slower ball. And Blackwood nearly has time to pirouette in his stance and have a second stab by the time it dribbles by!"
"firmly struck on the front foot, but straight to mid-on. Hope remains ... on 99 ..."
lifting delivery outside off stump. Left alone
"inside-edged drive into the covers! That must be the hundred... <B>it is the hundred!</B> No signal from the umpire so up goes the bat, the first man to make two hundreds in a first-class match at Headingley. Ever! Talk nah, Geoffrey Boycott"
clipped off the legs
"feisty! That's a very good-looking ball from Broad, nipping off the deck and past the shoulder of the bat. Arguably a foot too short to threaten the edge, mind"
"leaning back, attempted back-cut through third man, but straight to point"
"outside off, nothing doing with that delivery, left alone"
"crunching drive! Pierces the covers as Anderson offers up just a hint too much width, and reaches the rope"
"curling delivery outside off stump, but back of a length so easily left"
"tucked into the gap, excellent nurdling"
fully forward and defended to the off side
"drilled into the off side, picks out cover"
"back of a length, bashed back at the bowler"
"makes room, too much room, Blackwood has a desperate stump-saving mow, and <B>just</B> toe-ends it down to third man! He's keeping it real out there!"
"edged and <B>dropped!</B> Wow. Cook again, Hope again. A slash outside off, he sighted it late in front of his face at first slip, and it spangs through his palms. It's getting dark out there too, which won't have helped!"
"a sharp, furious follow-up from Broad, who roared rather in the manner of Allan Donald at Trent Bridge 1998. You know the one..."
"slashed across the line, Blackwood wants two, but Hope is still in his pirouette, and settles for the single"
"on the pads, flicked backwards of square. A good calm accumulative nurdle. He hasn't played many of those!"
a swipe - what else! - and toe-ended in the air down to third man. It'll do ...
"on the pads, tucked square"
"a hallelujah mow for glory, beats the outside edge, and Bairstow whips off the bails! <B>We're going upstairs</B>. But his back foot is anchored. Not out!"
"tossed up, attempted nudge to leg, bobbles down the pitch and back to the bowler"
tucked more comfortably into the leg side
"good delivery, teasing flight and biting turn, worked with the spin to midwicket"
"good line outside off, with a touch of away movement. 'Come and get me' is the message"
"on to the front foot, firmly punched to deep cover for the single"
"on the pads, worked square, 'push, push, push' is the cry, but just the single"
"banged in short, that'll be tough to pick in this light. But ducked well enough"
"clipped in the air for a little while, Broad tracked it down and threatened a shy for good measure"
"up on the toes, tapped to short cover, good sharp opportunistic single"
"skids onto the back foot, that might have been close, but the bat comes through just in time"
"short and filthy from Moeen, but the shot is equally bad. A scuffed pull to midwicket"
"better ball, attacking the pads and chiselled out"
"on the hips, tucked square"
"turning down the leg side and <B>beats Bairstow!</B> West Indies don't care how they come, but there's no-one at fine leg!"
"turns again, attacking the stumps, flicked to square leg"
"banged in short, following the batsman down the leg side"
"back of a length, <strong>flashed through third man!</strong> Only one slip in place so that's a no-brainer shot, and up comes the 300!"
"now this is interesting. The ball has gone to the boundary but umpire Ravi has signalled <B>dead ball</B>. He wasn't leaving the ball, he just played an incompetent stroke to a late inducker, and got his bat tangled in his pad. Wrong call, I reckon ..."
"tucked into the leg side, more convenient flick"
"<strong>slashed high and mighty over third man!</strong> West Indies are galloping home now! Short and wide, a perfectly timed uppercut, and we're nearly into single figures!"
forward and pushed to the off side
forward and blocked through third man
defended on the back foot
"tucked off the pads, a strange calm has descended in this over"
calmly down the ground to mid-on
tapped into the off side. West Indies allow themselves a breather as if to compose themselves for the final push
a big striding dot-ball
"dangled outside off stump, Blackwood gives himself room, then can't reach it"
"yeehar! Attempted mow off a good length, he could get them in singles now, but that's not his style ..."
"a genuine wide! They are rare in Tests, but that was barely on the cut strip. It's into single figures!"
"up on the toes, pushed into the off side. Eight needed"
worked to the leg side
easy off the pads. England are gone. That final six killed their resolve
tapped on the up to mid-off
"smashed into the deep and <B>dropped!</B> Well, how fitting is that! And it's Stokes of all people, he doesn't drop many, but the gloom has descended in every sense!"
onto the back foot and defended
"flipped off the front pad, four more needed..."
"off comes the helmet, Blackwood wants to be seen in the hour of glory! Smashed to mid-off"
worked to the leg side. One to tie ... but they aren't looking at that ...
"down the track, Blackwood wants the glory blow, and he's <B>stumped by a mile!</B> What a glorious, ludicrous, perfect way for an unhinged matchwinning hand to end!"
"Woakes isn't done yet, hanging the ball outside off and drawing a calm push"
"up on the toes, clipped square, and<strong> there it is!</strong> West Indies have won an extraordinary, historic Test match!"
