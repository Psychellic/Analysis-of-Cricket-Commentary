"goes back of a length, but still manages to move the ball into Simmons. Nudged to square leg"
"shortish and outside off at 129 kph, Rohit slaps it into the covers"
"square leg dives, but he can't pull this effortless flick back. Some inswing again from RP, this one was planted fuller. Ishant's throw comes through in front of the stumps, Dhoni runs forward and flicks the ball back at the stumps with one hand."
width on offer and the 130 kph delivery has been cracked through the covers. All he had to do was pick the gap
"135kph, full and straight, turned to long leg"
"shortish on middle, defended. I hear KP saying 'good finish' on his mic."
"strikes first ball! It's a good length ball that Rohit plays around, struck low enough on the front pad and in line with the stumps, but he wasn't entirely happy with the decision."
"well, that's not the best ball to follow up. But he is working on his angle into the right-hander, looking for more lbws. This one just strays too far down leg"
"137 kph, that's near his top pace now and he's getting lovely inswing too. Started it outside off and it hooped towards Simmons. Steers it to point"
leans forward and presents the full face as Pandya drives into the covers. Top shot for a pinchhitter
"beaten! This is at 142 kph! Ishant gets this to hold its line, often a measure of him being in top form. Pandya plays a lazy drive and gets nothing on it"
shortish and down leg side. Pandya lets it go and chews his gum like he just don't care.
"good length just outside off, defended into the covers"
"that cuts back in and Pandya's going to have a big bruise on his upper thigh. Goes down on one knee to get a measure of himself. Lots more pace on this pitch, it seems. Back of a length ball just surged"
"fuller ball outside off, driven to to mid-off"
"that's enough of that, says Simmons. They've been playing orthodox cricket so far, knocking it around, getting used to the pace of the pitch. Now he runs down the track and lofts RP right over his head"
tucked away to deep square leg
"134 kph, good work from RP. Saw Pandya walking at him and dug it in short. Had a little nip back in too, and the batsman struggles to work it to square leg"
"definitely a lot more pace on this track. This is RP bowling in the mid-130s and he gets a shortish one to zip past Simmons' outside edge, outside off"
"134kph, shortish and outside off, Simmons feels it would bounce a lot more - both his feet are off the ground as he tries to cut - and gets a bottom edge to the keeper"
"slashed over the covers! This was a length which allows Pandya the liberty to get under. That offside infield looks solid, but that needed a 30-foot tall man to rein it back"
"backs away and chainsaws the ball over third man. More of a top-edge, but with him going so hard at the ball and Ishant's pace, all is well"
"but without any room, Pandya can only block a shortish delivery down the pitch"
"another huge appeal from Ishant, with his hands up in the air like he just doesn't care. Pandya was flicking across the line, but this full ball was going down leg"
"141 kph, hoo boy, Ishant is pumped up! He's shattered Simmons' stumps with a peach of an inswinger. Bowled it full and on off stump, the batsman lazily attempts to flick it through leg. The resulting bat and pad gap is more than enough for the ball to surge through"
how bout that for a 360 degree batsman. Pays respect to a back of a length ball outside off by leaving it quite well alone
"buh-bye, that's the second Pune bowler to strike first ball. Pandya went into the pull shot a touch too early - it's a slower ball from Marsh, takes the top edge and flies up into the night sky. MS calls for it, gets under it and takes it without any fuss"
"shortish and outside off, Rayudu opens the face and guides it to the first slip"
has to get up on his tippy toes and blunt a shortish ball behind square leg
"fuller ball outside off at 131 kph, some awayswing as well, Rayudu lets it go"
"would have been out had Rahane hit the stumps direct. He hared in from point, picked up the ball with his right hand and underarmed it all in one motion. Buttler was a long way short"
duck on IPL debut! This is an absolute ripper from Marsh! Seemed to be following a straight line for the longest time - which is why Buttler wanted to flick it away - but then the outswing starts. Kisses the edge and settles in R Ashwin's hands at first slip. Good low catch too
"back of a length on off stump, defended"
"zips in off the deck, Rayudu was moving across and ends up finding the shortish delivery away."
"this is a mean Ishant Sharma! Pollard was going for a jaunt down the pitch, but the fast bowler unleashes a bouncer and its got too much heat even for Dhoni behind the stumps"
"back of a length and slanted into the right-hander, Pollard was looking to nudge it off his hips but the movement's defeated him. He was adjusting and was trying to whip the bat away from the line of the ball, which hits the thigh pad and wanders to square leg. Pollard runs a leg-bye, but its called a dead ball because he played no shot"
"ooh, tough call. Back of a length and outside off, left alone"
"strides out to meet a good length ball outside off, but he doesn't play a shot thereafter"
"that seems to be his thing today. Taking a few steps down the track, and then not playing a shot. This time it's an inswinger and it leaps up off his thighs to land beside the pitch"
"back of a length and outside off, defended into the covers"
that fuller length he is bowling isn't all that easy to get away on this pitch - especially with its extra bounce. Rayudu nudges towards midwicket
"sneaks outside his crease again, but he isn't given the liberty of freeing the arms. Defended"
"that's a full toss - and because of its late awayswing, and dip, Pollard misses it completely! He was hit on the back leg, it was right in line with the stumps. Marsh belts out a superb appeal, but Umpire Nandan says it would have missed leg though. Didn't seem like it. That would have decapitated middle and leg"
"follows through with a legstump yorker, worked through square leg"
"back of a length and outside off, left alone. Appreciable awayswing still for Marsh"
"plants the fuller ball a little too far down leg, looking for the magic awayswinger. Flick and miss from Rayudu"
"strides forward and pushes a fuller delivery, tinged with outswing, back at the bowler"
"third Pune bowler to get a first-ball wicket! Pollard is again caught on the back foot, and tries to adjust with his hands with a seam-up delivery darts back in at the right-hander. Struck in front of leg, struck low enough and sent off by umpire Dharmasena. They check the no-ball, it's fine. Mumbai sinking rapidly"

low full toss on leg stump is met with a flick to deep midwicket
"that's a thick outside edge, skipping off on its merry way to point. Bhajji was thinking about a single, a non-existent one, and finally cottons up to that. Nice ball that was - tossed up to pull the drive, and when it turns it gets the edge"
"fourth Pune bowler to get a first-baller! And this is a rank one. Pitches it short, setting up the batsman for a pull shot. Rayudu gets into position, but he inside edges it. Faf take a good, low catch and has a very amused smile on his face"
"tossed up just outside off, smashed back at him"

"another short and flat delivery, cut away to the backward point boundary. Lovely footwork for it - went way deep in his crease"
"this one seems to move the other way. A little bit of a leggie, pitched fuller and yet the batsman was deep in his crease. Struggled to pick it and just about blocks"
"turns into the leg side and they set off, Faf is a pretty quick fielder, gets across and sends in a flat through to the keeper and Dhoni just slaps it at the stumps. Doesn't hit the mark though"

"bottom-handed maul down the ground! He just walked away after making connection, knew that was a four immediately."
"has he been run out at the non-strikers' end? Ashwin's asking for it, which means he might have got some connection to the ball as it was driven back at him. Nope, no contact. Vinay was outside his crease - he was backing up - but Ashwin who thrust his right boot out, did not make any contact"

"wanders outside off, gets down on one-knee and sweep slogs it to long-on. Marsh made sure the length was really full to ruin his timing"

"slower ball, but he's placed it on a length and Bhajji makes room and belts it down the ground."
"140 kph, shortish ball outside off, Bhajji laces it through the covers but there is protection there"
"143 kph, spears in a yorker on middle stump, McClenaghan - batting with a huge backlift like Lance Klusener - cant get it down in time. Inside edge onto boot to nullify Ishant's appeal. Could have run Bhajji out had he gone after the ball instead"
"carved straight into the Pune ice box! The men in the dug out had to run for cover there. Low full toss, slapped down the ground"
"he punches the air after smashing 17 runs off the over. This was short and wide, Bhajji had cleared his front leg and drums it through the covers. Far too much heat on that shot for the man in the deep"

"targets the body, but Faf isn't fazed. Gets up on top of the bounce and defuses it by his feet"
"the next one's full and Faf directs it into the covers. Throws his head back when he realises he has hit it straight to short cover. Was already setting off for a single, and had to rush back"
"pull shot, not quite off the middle, signs that some balls are sticking in the pitch."
"oh, that seemed close enough to catch, but it had to stick. Rahane went for a little push. Didn't overhit the ball. And, thankful of that fact perhaps, the ball simply races away to the boundary. With some help from the ump, of course. He was ducking first - and that would have been terrible had he stayed like that. Finally he moved away and saved himself"
"fuller ball outside off, driven towards point"
"back of a length, defended"
"looks for the ball - which is why his hands are leading away from his body. Inside edges a swipe to mid-on. Whaddya know, good length ball outside off works even in T20"
"oooh, did that zip away? Bumrah's not traditionally known for awayswing. But this one does. Weaves past Faf as he tries to play with an angled face"
"runs down the track for a good old fashioned slash over mid-off. Made a bit too much room, I thought. Clever bowling from  Bumrah to make sure it was wider"
"back of a length on off stump, Faf gets an inside edge towards mid-on. Bhajji is the man running up to get the ball, and he takes his eyes off it just as he prepares to throw. Misfields and allows Faf an easy single"
"did he even have the room to play that? The thing that worked for him is that he was so well balanced. Waited for the ball to come to him, and then simply gave it direction. Four through cover. Bumrah pitched it short, and that was his only mistake"
kept out and he gets ready for the next over
"Pandya dives full length to his right to get hand on this glide towards point, but that doesn't stop the single."
"that's a top-edge, folks. McClenaghan thuds a short ball into the middle of the pitch and it hurries Rahane as he plays a pull. Hands on his head for the bowler as Bumrah the fielder at deep square leg watches it just about lob him"
"shortish and outside off, runs it down to deep third man"
"not off the middle again, but its enough for the long-on boundary at the Wankhede. McClenaghan came around the wicket and bowled the offcutter. Faf gets down the track, and perhaps gets under it a bit too much. Loads of height, and <i>just</i> enough distance"
"thats the slower short ball, Faf comes down the track, goes for a hack, and walks back without making a bit of contact"
this time he stays put - if a little leg side of the ball - and pokes his bat at a lifter outside off. Nothing again
"back of a length and just outside off, Rahane goes for an on-the-up straight drive and mistimes it"
zips through past the outside edge! It's back of a length and it leaps off the pitch at rapid pace. Rahane was coming at the bowler and is beaten for sheer speed
"one-bounce four. Rahane is not backing down, even if he isn't middling the ball with these pull shots. He looks a fine player when he looks to time the ball, But when he goes for those big hits, it just doesn't look as good"
"both batsmen were at the same end! This should've been a run out! Rahane nudges the ball off the inside edge through square leg. They were happy to take a single, but Faf wasn't keen on a second. Took a few steps down, but then turned back and tried to make his ground. At which time, Rahane had completed his second run! Buttler was coming up to the stumps to try and collect it, can't take it cleanly. Looks for the rebound and then goes for an underarm throw at the bowler's end. By then Faf had run across, dived and saved himself"
"back of a length and outside off, dabbed to third man. Oh, and it appears Bumrah's overstepped. We have our first free hit of the IPL 2016"
"sliced away! That's a superb shot! Bumrah walks away shaking his head, he knows a few inches further and that would have been in the blockhole. As such it was in the slot - if a little wide - and he stayed nicely balanced and simply timed it"
"oooh, that's a fearsome short ball. Beats Faf for pace - mostly because he had premeditated and ran at the bowler. Bumrah just did not like that and makes Faf worry about his safety. The pull shot was more the instinct to protect himself and the top edge helps the batsman come out on top again."

"that's a legcutter - and it looked superb too, mostly cause it made the batsman look so silly. Faf had run down the track, and had made massive amounts of room outside leg. So Vinay took all the pace off and bowled it wide. As it turned out, too wide"
