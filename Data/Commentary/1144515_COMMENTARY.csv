"excellent over. Finishes with another teasing line around off-stump. Latham looks solid enough in defence, but will need to get some runs to take some pressure off his captain"
"sharp single. Short ball, and Williamson keeps it down, and senses an opportunity for a run. Latham agianst Shaheen again. This should be fascinating"
"steps out and drives to mid-off. Middles it, but it's straight to the fielder."
"gone, <strong>this is much too good for Latham.</strong> Shaheen's on fire. Pitched on a length just outside off stump, and shapes away ever so slightly, taking the outside edge of Latham's bat as he attempts yet another defensive stroke. Never quite looked like getting a move on, and now New Zealand are four down. It might really be on!"
"nearly nicked that one, too. Shaheen is unplayable at the moment. Pitched at that same nagging line once more, and whooshes past the outside edge"

"Too full, and Neesham squeezes a single on the offside"

was that a googly to end up? I reckon it might have been. Neesham defended. Decent start
"as he's done against Hafeez, he helps it down to long-on and turns the strike over"
good delivery. Pulled his length back and let the ball dart into Neesham. Batsman steps away and just about keeps it out
turned down to long-on again. Such clear-headed batting by Williamson
good length. Hafeez not turning it much when he bowls to the leftie
"and just as I say that, there's drift and turn. Pitches on off and spins away, beating Neesham, and almost Sarfaraz, all ends up"

"<b>inside edge!</b> Oh so close. Length ball in the corridor and for the first time today, those feet don't get Williamson behind the line of the ball as he looks to punch through the off side. Narrowly misses off stump and is too much for Shaheen down at fine leg"
<b>past the outside edge.</b> Slams it in at a length on off and KW is now wary of playing close to the body. So much so that he's inside the line of this

"<b>has he got him? He's got him!</b> Shadab Khan has done it! Length ball, dipping outside off and drawing Williamson forward. he stabs at it away from the body as it turns and gets big off the surface. A faint edge on it and keeper holds on. Lovely bowling but also uncharacteristically loose from Williamson, who was getting a bit weary outside off in the last 15-20 minutes. Still, it takes some doing to get him out there and Shadab has produced the perfect delivery. Just a lovely pace on that"

"<b>beaten.</b> Overpitched ball wide outside off, slashes at it and doesn't connect. Wahab smiles at the batsman. Perhaps in disbelief that this plan to get an expansive drive nearly worked at 86 for 5"

<b>beaten.</b> Length and pushed wide outside off. CDG has a swipe at it and doesn't connect

"<b>past the edge.</b> Angry stare from Wahab. Length in the corridor, defends inside the line"
"<b>direct hit at the non-striker's end</b> from Shadab, who was at point. <b>Looks like CDG has JUST made it in.</b> Wow this is close.Or has he? A flip on the angle and this is even closer...this is now about whether the umpire believes he's got the toe-end just behind the line. He thinks it has. <b>Not out.</b> That was sloppy of him to plonk the bat in like that. He'd poked this bouncer into the off side with soft hands. Shadab was down at it rapidly and throwing with barely any time to get himself balanced."

<b>mistimed slug</b> over mid-off. Plonks into the turf and rolls out weakly as long-on comes around. Length ball from Wahab but once again he escapes because of the late movement in
"<b>finally nails one!</b> Wahab goes slower ball for some reason, and short. Sits up nicely for Neesham and he slaps from underneath to clear the midwicket boundary"
"good start. Movement in the air, pitched up, and only an inside edge saves a certain lbw"
"length delivery this time, and Imam turns it away to the onside"
"fuller. Boult wants to give this new ball achance to swing. Imam gets on the front foot nice and early this time, and makes good contact"
"short delivery, and that was nearly a run out! Imam ran it down to third man, but Guptill dived in the slips to prevent it going there, and nearly caught Imam napping"
crisply timed to point. This is a good start by both batsman and bowler
"brilliant shot. Picked up the short length early, and swivelled to the onside, dispatching the ball to the square leg boundary, First runs for Pakistan, they're off and running"
"full and wide. Not quite timed, but straight back to the bowler"
"loose delivery. Full and wide, and Henry just doesn't have the pace to get away with it. Fakhar caresses it through extra cover, and it races to the boundary"
"tighter to the stumps, and Fakhar can't get this one away"
"carved through extra cover, but doesn't quite have the timing on it to go all the way to the boundary"
"glorious batting. Pitched up to Imam, whose eyes light up at that length. Leans into that straight drive, and there's no stopping that speeding away"
worked away to square leg. Good running; the pair come back for two. Excellent start by Pakistan
"width from Boult, and Fakhar hasn't any patience for that line. Crunched through cover, and the ball smashes into the fence before the offside field even turn around to admire it"
little risky from Fakhar. Turned his wrists against the swing and it nearly carried to Colin Munro at short midwicket. Boult won't mind seeing that
"lovely delivery. Movement in the air but the ball held its line in the end, slicing Fakhar in half and barely missing off stump"
driven right back to the bowler
"good line and length. Pitched on middle stump and threatening off, but Fakhar keeps it out with the outer part of his bat. Good comeback from the bowler after the first ball"
"and caps the over <strong>with a wicket</strong>! Wasn't the best delivery, in truth. Dragged it down to the legside and didn't get the swing he was hoping. But Fakhar, who wanted to loft it over midwicket, found the leading edge and saw, with horror, the ball going to point instead, where Guptill's bucket-like hands sent him on his way"
defended back to the bowler
"on a length and going away from Imam, who allows it to do just that"
"Henry's keeping it simple. Stump to stump line. He hasn't found the swing that Boult has, so this is clever bowling"
driven to mid-off and the pair steal a single. Good running. First look at Babar now
"good start. Off sump line, forcing Babar to dead-bat it"
"down legside slightly, Babar defends"
shaping away. Imam gets onto the front foot and drives to extra cover
"probing delivery, gets the outside edge. NZ don't have second slip, and Boult watches in agony as that one runs down to third man for four. NZ must attack, especially with Boult moving it about"
"straighter on this occasion, and Imam blocks stoutly"
"short ball, where has that gone? Turns out it hit Imam and snuggled into his pad. Imam asks the fielders if it's okay to take it out with his hand. NZ aren't going to appeal, of course, so no harm done"
short and fast. Pushes Imam back who fends it away to the leg side
"Boult continuing to pitch it up. Another good over. Exciting start, this"
"driven through the offside, but can't beat the man stationed at mid-off"
"gets on the back foot and punches it through the offside. After a loose first over, Henry is supporting Boult really well"
"and NZ might just have had another wicket! Short delivery, and Babar ran out of patience, skying an attempted pull. Colin de Grandhomme raced back and was just a yard away from completing a remarkable catch"
"better shot. This is what he should do. Slices this through the offside field, and gets himself off strike with three"
punched down the ground and Pakistan scamper through for a quick single
"too close to cut, which is why Babar doesn't quite get the timing. Six off a very eventful over"
"shaping away, but Imam steps into the off-drive and just about splits the cover fielders. good cricket from the left-hander."
"straighter ball, defended to the onside"
blocked into the offside
"kept slightly low, but Imam was equal to it, and drives it back to the bowler"
pitched up again and Imam defends through the offside
excellent over from Boult. two off that one
"Henry keeping his lengths tight. Babar tried to cut again, but no real timing"
pitched up for once. Babar drives to extra cover. Struggling to get it away for now. Needs to remain patient
"wicket-to-wicket, Babar offers a defensive stroke"
"driven on the up, but Neesham ensures Santner's slight misfield won't yield any runs"
"angled to point, where the fielder closes in sharply"
"pulled to square leg, ensuring this won't be a maiden. NZ have pulled things back nicely since that Fakhar wicket"
"absolute jaffa, that one. Babar closed the face of the bat but the ball moved at the last moment. Just missed the off stump, the outside edge, as well as the pad. Boult gets one over Babar"
"and Babar gets his own back! Full and wide and Babar latches onto it in a flash, carving the point and cover-point fielders"
"fantastic battle, this. Boult pulls the length back and beats Babar's outside edge. Absorbing stuff"
"wisely, Babar shoulders arms. Boult is a threat Babar wants to negate as much as possible. No point fighting fire with fire just yet"
"excellent shot. Boult came around the wicket to angle it in, but this was much too straight for Babra to miss out. Leans into the classical drive, and Boult lets out a cry of anguish"
"back over the wicket, and Babar blocks to close out the over. Round one Babar, I'd say"
"Henry continues his fifth over, and Imam drives to extra cover, only to find the fielder"
"uppish, got Imam's leading edge. But far enough away from Henry"
"worked away to fine leg. Batsmen think about two, but never on"
Babar lets it go. The pair beginning to settle now
"came back into the batsman, but a thick inside edge keeps it out"
"tucked away to mid-on. Quick single, and the Powerplay's done. To take you trough the next ten, here's Varun"
"short of a length just outside off, on the back foot and sliced to third man"
"<b>Guptill you absolute monster!</b> Big strides forward, big limbs reaching out, but the grace of a much smaller man as he dives and gets his fingers under this at point! And this following an absolute scorcher of a bouncer from Lockie, jumping up at Imam's grille from middle stump. Remember, he'd caused him problems in the UAE, even hit him on the head not so long ago. Goes straight for the bouncer option. Imam just fends at it with no clue and it pings off the shoulder of the bat. Just brutal fast bowling"
"<b>Hafeez nearly runs himself out of the contest!</b> Geez. Pakistan's most experienced batsman, looked like a newbiew there. Length and in at off stump. His feet are rooted and he pokes at this nervously. It rolls into the leg side weakly and he's just taken off without a call. Neesham can't hit direct"
<b>onto his glove.</b> Short bal lrising into the corridor. Hangs the bat out and hopes. It's into his body. And then a sheepish grin
<b>beats the inside edge.</b> Short of a length and angled in. He cuts from over it
<b>inside edge</b> again as he takes the bottom hand off and hangs the bat out to protect his mid-riff. This short ball gives him no room. It flies down to fine leg
"length ball outside off, driven on the rise to sort extra"
"full on middle stump, flicked straight to square leg"
"length on off stump, has him hopping as he defends into the off side"
"length on middle stump, deep in the crease as he taps this to mid-on"
"<b>aerial</b> but not enough on this to carry to the bowler. Full and driving length, but he gets tangled by his own forward stride and ends up hitting more of his pad than the ball"
"length on middle stump, flicked to deep square's left"
"<b>past the outside edge.</b> 146kph, length and angled in at off stump. Then it straigthens off the surface as he looks to defend this with half a stride"
"<b>shot!</b> Short ball stays about hip height and Hafeez gets on his back toe, swivels, and launches this to the square leg boundary. Classy"
"<b>beaten.</b> Hangs inside the line again, bigger stride, but not any closer to nailing the forward defence"
"length and in at off stump, defended down the pitch off the inside half"
"<b>past the outside edge again.</b> 146kph length ball, both straightens and jumps past his forward defence"
"length outside off, dabs it down to third man with an open face"

"length and in at middle stump, defended off the back foot"
"<b>slapped away</b> but sweeper cover is there to cut that off to his right. Length ball, hooping away outside off. Flat-batted on the front foot"
<b>across the line</b> but effective in the end. Shuffles and flicks this length ball to fine leg's left from off stump
"<b>beaten.</b> At the moment, Hafeez is the U-15 starlet playing his first U-23 match. Not able to figure out a way against this back of a length delivery Lockie keeps getting in the corridor"
"<b>but he's figured this out!</b> Glorious weight transfer to get on top. In the corridor, a tad shorter than before but he makes enough room and opens the face to get it past point"
<b>yorker</b> from wide of the crease and he manages to keep the front leg leg side of it to jam it out
"<b>oh beautiful.</b> Another short ball at waist height. Not too different in line from the one he punched through point, but this time he's swiveled and used the angle to find the long leg boundary. Rolls the wrists on it to keep it down"
"<b>bouncer hits him on the grille.</b> 142kph. Ferguson's had enough of the short ball that doesn't rise up. This is banged in, a proper bouncer. And Hafeez is swiping hopefully from under it. Flush in the grille. He's on his feet though"
"short of a length just outside off, tapped into the covers off the back foot"
"<b>deftly deflected</b> to third man's left for two. Short of a length in the corridor, waits for it to come on and runs it off the surface, very very late"
"overpitched on middle stump, whipped out to deep square"
"length on the front foot, blocked on the front foot"
"length on leg stump, flicked to midwicket off the front foot"
"length and just outside off, opens the face as he defends to point"
<b>smash.</b> Short and wide at 117kph and he will not miss out. Gets the weight on the back foot and chops it past point
"<b>oh, so elegant.</b> Length ball just outside off and he seems to have enough time to get forward to this and open the face at just the right moment. On the up, flies past point"
"short and in the corridor, gets leg side of it and dabs it past slip"
"full outside off, looks to drive but doesn't get enough weight into the forward press. This rolls out to mid-on"
<b>past the edge.</b> Again. he keeps straightening the incoming ball to beat Hafeez's outside edge. At 147kph
short and very wide. Called for the height and the crowd erupts
"<b>outside edge</b> falls short of Taylor at slip! Oh Lockie must be seething right now. Hafeez has managed to get bat on one, another one that has straigthened, but there's no luck for him still"
"length and in at off stump, tapped to cover off the back foot"
"<b>what a start.</b> Santner with the drift in towards off stump, the dip to land well in front of Babar's big stride, and the turn to beat the bat"
"short of a length outside off, punched to extra cover's right. Dive and parried to long-off"
"short outside off, steered into the point region off the back foot"
"length on leg stump, tucked into the leg side"
<b>beaten again.</b> Santner is doing nicely here. Luring him in with plenty of flight. This one is wider. He looks to drive on the up
<b>squared him up</b> with big turn from a middle stump line. Babar circumspect as he gets deep in the crease and closes the face on this. Leading edge goes past slip
"overpitched just outside off, driven back to the bowler on the bounce"
"short and wide outside off, classy back foot punch, but straight to point"
"length and in at the corridor, solidly blocked on the front foot"
<b>beaten.</b> Loose from Babar. Short of a length outside off and he has a stab at it outside off to try and get it to third man
"<b>leading edge</b> trickles past the bowler. Slight mix-up as mid-on gets down at this, but he says no in time. Short of a length on leg, closes the face too early on the flick"
"oh yes. More of that, sir. Short and up in the corridor and he plays just about the perfect square drive. Right on top of it, contact right under his eyes, elbow nice and high and the bat face not opened till it was required. Blazes to point's left"
"short and turning away outside off. Follows with his hands and gets this to sweeper's left. A poor throw from there, both in terms of delivery and choice. Babar was rooted as Hafeez came running back. Throw went to the keeper, which was probably the wrong option"
"full on middle stump, pushes with hard hands and gets it down the pitch"
"<b>under-edge</b> drops into the turf, next to off stump. Short ball doesn't turn as much as he looks to cut"

"run down to third man, gets it quite fine, and only sharp work at the boundary saves two runs"
"driven on the full, but straight to a fielder"
"dragged down legside. Every run matters for Pakistan. And for NZ, for that matter"
"Neesham isn't quick enough to bowl that length. Short of a length, but sat up for Babar and begged to be spanked. Babar is too good not to oblige, and bludgeons it to he midwicket boundary"

"attempted reverse sweep, Hafeez gets nowhere near it"
"and that's the most Hafeez way to get out! The man who holed out to Aaron Finch and lost his wicket to Aiden Markram now charges down the pitch to Williamson, and smashes it right down cow corner's throat. In the xact spot he gave it away against Australia"

"spins back in and pops up off the pad. The keeper reckons there might have been an edge, but can't complete the catch in time anyway"
"were there two noises. Ripped back into Haris off the rough and cannons off the pad into Taylor. Big appeal, but umpire unmoved"

"was that out? Haris races down the wicket, and comes off his pad and goes through to Taylor. NZ sounded more confident this time, but the umpire disagrees"

"good shot. Opens the face of the bat and scythes it past the man at 45, and sees it race down to the boundary. Williamson is easier to play for Haris, with the ball going away"

"straight to mid-on. Babar will not hit the winning runs, it seems. <strong>We're going to the final six balls</strong>"
"full toss, and<strong> Sarfaraz smashes it through point</strong>. Massive win for Pakistan!"
