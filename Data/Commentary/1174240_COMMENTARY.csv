"tapped to point, and they set off straight away for a single"
"<b>keeps slightly low</b> on off stump, but Imam gets his bat down in time to keep it out"
"angled down just outside off, and it's chopped through gully for one"
"<b>Imam breaks the shackles</b>, shuffling down to get close to a length delivery and hammering it high and handsome over long on - first boundary for 45 balls, and it's a big 'un"
"Behrendorff keeps it short of a length, Imam defending it back to him"

"Stoinis aims this one much fuller, Imam digging it out to mid on"
"<b>surprise bouncer!</b> But it's also taken Carey by surprise, or at leas the extra bounce is too much for him as the ball loops over the batsman, over the keeper and down to the boundary"

angled down to third man for one
Malik keeps his bat inside the line as Stoinis gets one to leave him outside off
"he comes around the stumps, Imam flicking against the spin into the leg side"

"glanced off the hip, slightly uppishly but well away from any fielder"
"Malik drives straight, without much power but with the placement for a single"

"nicely flighted, the ball lands on middle and leg and is met with solid defence"
"there's a yelp of excitement from Carey as Lyon gets one to rush on, but it's inside edged onto the pad"
"<b>and big spin this time!</b> In fact, there's an appeal - though not a very expansive one as Australia think he's edged it to Carey - and Michael Gough's finger shoots up! Imam doesn't think he's hit it, and sends it upstairs, <b>reviewing</b>. Gosh, replays show a <i>massive</i> gap between the ball and the bat, that's definitely not out, and the decision is over-turned. The bat might have hit the pad, which is what the on-field umpire heard"
and solid defence ends the over
"full, but it's driven straight to mid off"
"tucked into the leg side this time, but mid on is there to stop the run. Lyon in that position"
"Stoinis attacks the stumps, but he's kept out by Malik"
"floated up outside off, but Malik's weight is back so he's late into his drive"
"drifting in towards the pads, and Malik clips him smartly out to deep midwicket, where Cummins comes charging around the boundary and slides to stop it, saving a run. Committed stuff"

"full on off stump, leans forward and dabs towards cover"
worked off the pads but straight to square leg
"on off stump, goes straight on, pushed square to the off side"
"<b>given lbw, but he's called for the review!</b> Back of a length, slides on with the arm, don't think there's any edge so it's all about the height. It is at the top of the pad, but is hitting the top of the stumps. That's very out"

"back of a length, straight, tucks this wide of midwicket with the turn"
"shorter, turns quite significantly, played off the pads to the on side"

"this turns from short of a length, Umar adjusts and taps to the covers...a good over of batting"

<b>dropped!</b> Bit happening at the moment. Behrendorff has put down the chance at long-on as Umar came down the pitch and didn't get the distance. Was pretty regulation. He ended up trying to take it too low

punched down to long on for one
"slightly short, but Yasir's pull goes straight to midwicket"
"<b>Imad runs past a googly</b> and is easily stumped. He was also slightly done in the flight, having jumped down the track. And Pakistan sink a little further. The take from Carey is very close to the stumps ... in front of them? Will have to see a replay. Anyway, Imad marches off"
"slightly quicker at 88km/h, and it's pushed defensively to off"
