"dramatic start! Hafeez's age old problem of poking at away-going deliveries results in his downfall. This one is full and angling away, he plays a loose drive, no feet movement whatsoever, and the thick edge is pouched at second slip. Straightforward catch, as simple as they come"
"gets this to lift off the deck from middle, steered down to third man to get off the mark"
"gets this to nip away off the seam from the good length area outside off, Malan looks to punch but withdraws his bat late. Through to Haddin"
"snakes this back in from wide of the crease, Malan's feet rooted to the crease as he pushes at that away from the body, dabbed to the off side in the end"
"sideways movement from outside off again, left alone"
"lucky to get away with that half-volley, driven firmly but straight to mid-off"
"skids a length ball on the stumps, Akmal is clearly hustled for pace as he defends"
cut away towards square third man where Imran over-runs and nearly parries the ball to the boundary. Recovers well to pull it back in but concedes an extra run
gets back into the crease and turns a length ball on middle to square leg
"too full and sliding down leg, Akmal is late on the flick, the ball deflects off the pad to fine leg"
width and crashed into the point boundary at the rate of knots! The ball had already passed the point fielder even before he could dive. Too easy
"looks to force this off the back foot behind point, but this wasn't as short as he expected it to be. Beaten in the end"
"oooooh, imperious! Too short and Akmal climbs onto that. Pulled in front of square off the middle of the bat. Once it beats the infield, there is no way that can be stopped"
"slides a short ball across Akmal, who slaps this over the infield, cover fielder runs across to pull it back in."
"squared up by a beauty that jags away late. This one's a short of length delivery that fizzes across, he looked to steer it down to third man in the end, but is lucky to not get a nick"
"too full, feet rooted to the crease as he stabs that to the off side"
"this is stunning! You can pay a lot of money to watch someone hit a fast bowler coming in at 140 clicks inside-out over extra cover. Not all that bad a delivery. Full, angling away. Akmal clears his front leg and lofts through the line. What timing, super stuff"
"angles this into the pads, tucked to deep square leg"
"too short, punched off the back foot to point. A meter to his left or right and it would have been at least two"
"in the slot, looks to crash that over cover but ended up hitting it flat and straight to the fielder, they scamper through for a run nevertheless"
"short of length delivery on middle and leg, look to whip it behind square, ball deflects off the thigh pad to short fine leg"
gift of a delivery. He'll pick those away even in his sleep. Full toss on the pads that had 'hit me' written all over it. Flicked effortlessly into the fine leg boundary
"tucked away towards the man coming in from midwicket, they complete a quick single. The call was Kamran's, his partner responded immediately"
"play and a miss. Looked to smash that over cover, it was full and the shot was on. He was a little too early into the stroke"
"squared up by a length ball that leaves him late, gets some bat on it as it rolls towards point. An overthrow at the striker's end gives them an extra run. No need to throw, really"
bullet drive down to mid-on
"steps out to a short ball, goes through with the pull. Looks like he top edged it but the ball still had enough for it to sail over fine leg. Frustration for Watson. Saw the batsman give him the charge and banged it in, and still watched the ball sail over"
"yorker-length delivery outside off, shapes back in a wee bit, he looks to drive and misses"
crashed into the extra cover boundary. There was a man in the deep precisely to stop that but he stood no chance. Delightful
"another yorker-length delivery, this one on middle, squeezed back down the pitch"
"short, wide and cut away between cover and point. Bisected the gap superbly. Picked the length early and boom"
"way too early into the pull, deflects off the body to third man"
"too full on leg stump, looks to flick but gets some pad on the way. Haddin can't stop that despite the dive, into the fine leg boundary"
"arches back to upper cut that, but was beaten by the pace of that short delivery"
"full toss outside off, looks to go over cover, but the bat face turns in his hands and he ends up slicing it towards point"
gets on top of the bounce and runs it down to third man. Was shaping to cut but adjusted well with the steep bounce
"steps out, gets underneath the flight and lofts him inside-out over extra cover, goes all the way nearly. Terrific use of the feet. Timing, top notch. Kamran means business!"
"it seems to me as if he was batting somewhere else before coming out to bat here. Tossed up on middle, he gets down on one knee and sweeps him into the deep midwicket boundary. Exhilarating stuff"
"short on middle, slaps it straight to point"
makes a bit of room and cuts the short delivery to deep point this time
driven inside-out to long-off
swept firmly to deep square leg. This was pushed through quicker but a touch short.
"short outside off, cuts it straight to backward point"
"fetches the sweep from outside off, down to deep square leg"
"slapped away to deep point. This was short and sliding away, he picked the length early and forced it off the front foot"
"he's cleared the cover boundary without much fuss. This wasn't a bad delivery at all. Dipped on him just a bit, but he made room to open up the off side and swatted that."
"paddled with the angle to deep square. Half-century for Kamran Akmal. Believe me, this has been a super knock. Lifts his hand and bat to acknowledge the dressing room. He's looked in total control"
"full and flat outside off, hit to the cover fielder"
backs away and lofts the full delivery over the infield to sweeper cover
"checks his shot at the last moment, just short of Ajmal on his followthrough. Looked to punch but held back for some strange reason"
"massive hit, 10 rows back at deep midwicket. Gets underneath the flight and slog sweeps him out of the ground. One million rupees up for grabs for whoever catches it in the stands. A number of them went for it but none could get their hands on it."
"bowls it from a lower trajectory this time, with a slingy action, worked with the angle to deep midwicket"
"punched back to Ajmal, who moves swiftly to his right to stop that"
"clobbered into the stands at deep midwicket. This is a poor delivery, too full, he gets underneath the flight and lofts him. What power in his strokes. There seems to be no stopping Akmal today. He's either been too full or short."
eased down past the bowler to long-off
"swung across the line, looked to hit it to Sharjah. Could only hit it flat to long-on"
"looks to swing across the line, gets a thick edge that flies past short third man. Lucky boundary, but does it matter? Islamabad are staring at a 200 target here, at least"
"this is some exhibition of fierce hitting! Nowhere near being too full, he comes forward to sweep, but stops and play a half-pull. Generates tremendous power as he clears deep square leg"
"flatter delivery on middle and leg, whipped to deep square leg"
punched into the gap at cover as they jog the single
"wow, what a welcome to the bowling crease. Starts off with a short ball and has been deposited into the stands at deep midwicket. Ball-striking of the highest class. Fetches the pull from outside off. Phenomenal striking"
"slips this into middle and leg, whipped into the gap at deep backward square leg. Superb touch this, hitting them really sweetly"
"yorker length delivery outside off, squeezed to cover"
"too short, he rocks back and pulls him over short fine leg. Helped it on its way. Too easy"
"drives, gets a thick edge to short third man, who misfields, to concede a single"
"can't bowl there and expect to get away. Full toss on the pads, Akmal will pick those away for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Tickled nice and fine, no chance for the keeper and the man at short fine leg."
flayed to deep cover where Ruman Raees slides across to save two runs for his side
"too full and angling away, looks to squeeze this behind point but is late on the stroke"
"top edges a pull towards midwicket where Khalid runs around, comes up with a juggle and eventually hangs on. End of a fine knock from Malan, largely played support act to Kamran. Did what he needed to. That should come as a relief for Islamabad"
chopped down to point for a quick single
"angles a length ball across Morgan, who bunts it to cover to get off the mark"
flicks a full length delivery on the pads to deep midwicket
"short ball on middle, he makes room and crashes that to deep point"
"drifting into middle, pushed back tentatively to the bowler"
"Ajmal lets out a roar. Plays for the turn when there is none. This was full and drifted back in, Morgan looked to work it across the line and missed it altogether. The umpires conferred to see if the ball hit the stumps off the keeper's pad, but replays indicate there was absolutely no doubt. Morgan's first outing here today has been far from a memorable one"
"works it with the angle to short midwicket, off the mark immediately"
"delicate little late cut to short third man. Touch of risk but he's in fine form, and so had the confidence to play it off the keeper's gloves"
worked across the line to the man coming in from deep midwicket
firm push down the ground to long-on
"right into the blockhole from wide of the crease, squeezed to long-on"
backs away and lofts the length ball into the gap at deep extra cover
"looks to make room to pull, bowler bangs it into the body. Sohail is cramped for room and ducks under it in the end. Skiddy bouncer at 134.3kph on that occasion"
"steered down to square third man, poor throw allows a second. Sohail has come out with intent, which is good to see"
"full delivery on off stump, drilled to long-off"
"advances down the pitch but didn't get underneath the flight as Ajmal shortened the length, adjusts well to ease it past cover"
"this has been hit into the second tier between deep midwicket and wide long-on. Too much flight from Ajmal, Akmal got to the pitch and swung clean. What a sound the bat made as it made contact. Generates tremendous power in his swing"
"way too early into the sweep, went leg side but the ball drifted away and he was beaten"
"low full toss, he backs away and spanks it into the gap at extra cover. This is magical stuff. Carved superbly. He's picking his gaps with ease"
flat-batted pull to deep midwicket
"punched to the man coming in from deep midwicket, wanted the second but Kamran wasn't keen"
gets it too high on the bat as he looks to pull. Sami followed the batsman b digging it in
carved to deep point. Not timed as well as he would have liked
"it was short, there to be hit. Kamran struck it well but found square leg. End of an exhilarating innings. Pays the price for trying to fetch it from outside off. Extra pace of Sami did the trick there for Islamabad Stunning knock"
"cut away, but straight to point"
"play and a miss. Looked to slap that over point, but it was too full"
"yorker that tails away late, squeezed to long-off"
"superb bouncer angled into the body from around the stumps, Sammy arches out of the way and sees the ball whizz past his helmet"
"pulled, and pulled well. Ungainly looking swing, but he managed to get enough bat on it to clear deep midwicket. For a moment it looked like the timing was off there as the bat face turned in his hands, but he's got strong forearms"
"excellent comeback, right into the blockhole, Sammy somehow managed to squeeze that out"
"Dhoni-like helicopter shot which he reached out to play, but found the lone man at deep extra cover. Hit really well, but picked out the fielder."
angles the short ball down to third man to get off the mark
"poor end to what was otherwise a good spell, short ball down leg, he ducks underneath it and still gets four byes as the keeper couldn't get around to stop that. Hands on his hips for Misbah"
"tickled down leg, Ajmal comes around to cut that off at fine leg. Afridi went a long way across to whip that away"
"waist-high full toss on leg stump, swung away to deep square leg"
"low full toss angling away, pushed wide of the man at cover"
"oh, dear. Full toss that slipped out of his hand. Just out of Afridi's reach. He tried to stretch out and ease it over point"
"dolly for Misbah at midwicket. The short ball has done the trick for Watson again. Afridi looks to pull but is once again beaten for pace as Watson dug this in short, got it off the top half of the bat and Misbah made no mistake. Afridi reacted a fraction of a second late there, really at this level, that's all is the difference between a big shot and a miscue"
"healthy nick through to Haddin. Once again the short ball has done the trick. Looked to pull off the front foot, but the ball got big on him and flew off the edge to the keeper. How Zalmi have collapsed!"
"low full toss outside off, driven to sweeper cover. End of a fine over"
steered away but straight to backward point
beaten by a full delivery that moves away late from off stump. Shaped to play an expansive drive
"back of length delivery outside off, looks to play a flat-batted pull but is late on the shot"
chopped wide of Haddin on the off side as they scamper a run
"sensational from Haddin. Retired from international cricket but still has enough in this old legs. This pull was top-edged, it flew straight over his head. Fine leg was running in, but Haddin, who ran nearly 30 yards backwards, called for it and made it look ridiculously simple. These kind of catches - running backwards - can't be easy"
flicked with the angle to the man at deep midwicket
"lofted one bounce to the long-off boundary. Low full toss, he made room and simply hit through the line. The key there was he didn't try to hit it hard"
"picks the bones out of the pull, but one bounce to deep midwicket"
digs a short ball in but way down the leg side. Excellent call from the umpire
"smacked into the deep midwicket boundary. Too short, it was almost as if he had decided even before he came out to bat that he will play a flat-batted pull come hell or high water"
"floats this full but well outside the wide line, left alone"
"gets this wrong again, looks to fire this full and just close to the wide line, bowls this around the eighth stump."
"lofted, mistimed, cover calls for it and takes it easily. Watson continues to pick wickets. This was bowled at length outside off, he went for a big biff over the infield but couldn't get much bat on it"
"way back into the stands at deep midwicket. Too short, this was sitting up nicely for Jordan to pull in front of square, connected cleanly. Hit that off the middle"
"low full toss outside off, driven towards the man coming in from deep cover, Jordan hares back for the second."
"what a welcome to the bowling crease. Nothing wrong with the delivery, a length ball that nips away off the seam from off stump, Smith plants forward and plays a sumptuous off drive that beats mid-off"
gets forward and bunts this to cover
"too full and angling back in, Smith gets to the pitch of the ball and loft him through the line, clears mid-on, couple of bounces into the boundary. Touch too full from Junaid"
"pulls but doesn't entirely get hold of it, down to square leg"
"typical whip off his hip from Sharjeel, to deep square leg"
"flayed on the up between cover and point. Ah, the confidence to simply hit through the line without worrying about swing and seam movement, something else"
punches a length ball to cover point
gets to the pitch of the ball and drives to mid-off
"big appeal for lbw and they've got him. Interesting to see if the ball pitched outside leg. Sharjeel looks to whip it across the line but misses it completely. That surely would have gone on to hit the stumps. Big, big wicket first up for Peshawar Zalmi"
"driven uppishly and into the gap between cover and point. Didn't get to the pitch, but he went through with the stroke. Sliced it over the infield as the bat face turned in his hand"
"jags back into middle from length, defended back down the pitch"
"bunts this to extra cover, quick single taken. The fielder was lat to get off the blocks"
"floats a full length delivery on off from wide of the crease, eased into the off side for a quick single"
"induces the edge but put down at slip by Darren Sammy. Minute deviation off the pitch. He jabs at the ball with hard hands, gets a thick edge. Oh, dear. Should have been taken."
"lofted but not timed all that well, deep point goes around to deep cover to stop that"
"just over mid-off. Not timed all that well but enough to clear the infield and get a boundary. Intention right from Haddin, that of going after the bowlers and maximise the powerplay overs"
"leg-cutter that is fuller in length, looks to flay that through point, gets a bottom edge that rolls to slip"
"dabs a full delivery gently to the man coming in from cover, quick single taken"
"pulls and misses. Was way too early into the stroke, although I must say the shot was on"
"full delivery on middle, dabbed to short cover as they scamper a quick single"
play and a miss. Beaten by the late movement. Feet glued to the crease as he threw his bat at that length ball that nipped away
"short arm jab this time, and wow, the punch in that stroke is something else. Races away to the midwicket boundary. Played it off the front foot too. Big no-ball according to replays. <b> free-hit coming up </b>"
looks to swing this over the long-off boundary but played too early. Beaten in the end
"brings his wrists into the picture as he fetches a length delivery from outside off, down to deep square leg"
sliced down to third man. Intended to hit it over cover
uses the pace to run it down to third man
"bangs a short ball on middle and leg, Smith ducks under that one"
"runs his fingers across the seam this time, lands it on middle and gets the ball to move away a bit, Smith was too early into the pull. In no position in the end"
"looks to slash this over point, but doesn't have the room. Beaten"
"off-cutter again, Mustafizur style. Smith is premeditating his shots and it's clearly not working. Beaten again"
"rip roaring bouncer, but the umpire thinks it's way over the batsman's head. I'd say that is a harsh call on the bowler."
"pulls, misses. Through with the shot early, got some pad along the way to the keeper on the bounce"
"slapped over cover, no protection in the deep. This time the timing is immaculate"
"knuckle ball, was it? Held on to the surface as Haddin jabbed at that delivery, manages to get this towards mid-on for a quick single"
"looks to fetch a whip from outside off to midwicket, gets a thick inside edge on the pad instead"
"late on the stroke. The ball snakes back in late from wide of the crease to beat the flick and hit Smith on the pad. Angle would have take it down leg, and so they didn't bother appealing"
"picked away, but straight to deep midwicket on the bounce"
"sliding down leg, helped on its way but can't beat short fine leg"
"cleverly done. Sees a bit of width, opens the bat face late to glide this past short third man"
"this has been clobbered over deep midwicket. Drifts this in from wide of the crease, Haddin swings across the line and gets enough elevation"
chopped to short third man as they scamper a quick single
"clubbed down the ground, long-off does well but can't stop it cleanly to give away a second"
"looks to cut, didn't have the room. Hit back to the bowler"
forced off the back foot to point. This one spun away a little more and took the splice of the bat
"short ball outside off, slapped down to long-on. Looks like he's broken his bat. He's looking at the handle"
"this one keeps low and so the attempted pull is thwarted as Smith is hit low on his pad. The ball was sliding down leg, however"
"flicks and misses, the ball deflects off the pad to square leg"
pulled in front of square to Hafeez at deep midwicket
"right into the blockhole, it was the slower delivery as well, squeezed back down the pitch"
biffed into the deep midwicket boundary. Monstrous hit! Too short and Smith was waiting for the release shot
"too wide. Short, the ball drifted away to beat the cut"
"looks to hoick this over midwicket, ends up getting a thick inside edge that flies past leg stump and beats short fine leg to the boundary"
"solid defense that time, bat firmly behind the line of that quicker delivery"
steered wide of short third man as they scamper a quick single
short and he's hit that hard to the man at the edge of the ring at cover
pulled but all along the ground to long-on
"cut away uppishly but into the gap, down to deep point"
slapped across the line to wide long-on
"gets into an awful mess as he looks to pull an incoming delivery, hit on the pad but they steal a run nevetheless"
"walks across the stumps to slash that over point but misses. And because he made that early movement, that hasn't been called wide"
"innovative, cheeky, outstanding! Haddin gets outside the line of the stumps and picks this away behind square on the leg side."
"angles a full delivery on middle, defended back down the pitch"
"swung across the line to wide long-on, excellent running to get back for the second"
"short and wide outside off, cuts it straight to the man at the edge of the ring"
width on offer and he's clobbered that into the deep point boundary. Easy pickings.
"plays outside the line, gets a thick inside edge onto the pad, rolls towards point and they sneak another run"
toe-ends an attempted lofted hit to long-on
"can't bisect short third man and point. It was short, he hit that hard but straight to the fielder"
"fires this in but loses control of the direction, far too wide for the batsman to reach out"
gets to the pitch of the ball and eases it to sweeper cover
"looks to play a short-arm jab but the ball skids on to hit the pad, looks like there was an inside edge"
"picked the bones out of that one! Sitting up nicely for him to play the pull in front of square. Latched onto it in a jiffy, just manages to clear deep midwicket"
"drilled down to wide long-on, the man there had some work to do, the throw was weak to and they were back for the second comfortably"
"flicked, one bounce to deep backward square leg. Lucky to get away with a leg-stump half-volley"
"into the blockhole, squeezed off a thick inside edge to square leg"
"swung leg side, gets a thick inside edge to short fine leg, one run is all it will be"
"that is a stunner. Did someone say Haddin has retired? Wow, is he available to play in India? Makes room and goes inside-out over extra cover, timed it so beautifully, Sohail was the man in the deep, but he had no control over the ball as he tried to pull it back. One bounce into the boundary"
steered to short third man as they complete a risky run
"right into the blockhole, squeezed past midwicket"
makes room and then uses the pace of the bowler to glide this over short third man. What awareness
"once again goes over cover, Sohail was lurking around the ropes in the deep, but was off balance as he landed. His back foot was touching the rope even before he could release the ball. Multiple replays can't prove conclusive, so six it will be."
"walloped over midwicket, down to wide long-on"
"the change of bowling has done the trick. This was slower and fuller outside off, he looks to go over cover but is deceived by the change in pace, plays too early and ends up getting a thin edge that is gleefully accepted by Kamran Akmal. End of a super knock that has kept Islamabad alive"
"poor delivery first up to a new batsman. Full and sliding down leg, all Watson needed to do was get some bat on it, which he did. Raced away into the fine leg boundary. Jordan knew immediately that he had erred"
steered off the back foot to deep cover
sliced down to third man. Bat face turned in his hand as he tried to dig the yorker out
"length too full and straight outside off, Watson looks to run it down to third man but plays inside the line of the ball"
"full toss down leg side, Watson misses a little tickle. Four runs were there for the taking. Wide called"
toe-ends an attempted drive to mid-off
"skids a full ball back in from wide of the crease, Smith looks to play a short-arm jab but is hurried onto the stroke. The ball deflects off his pad into the third man boundary. Lucky runs, Sammy can't believe how that went to the boundary"
swept down to deep square leg
flayed on the up to deep cover
"wow, that's as interesting as they come! Absolutely smashed down the ground off the middle, but Watson can't get out of the way of that rocket hit at the non-striker's end. Hits the bat and deflects into the wide long-on boundary"
"yorker-length delivery down leg, looks to flick but can only get some pad on it. Sammy runs to his left quickly, picks the ball up and hurls a throw at the striker's end. <b> Smith was miles outside his crease and would have been run-out had that hit </b>"
"length ball down leg, Smith gets across and helps it to the left of short fine leg. Poor, poor bowling this. Easy pickings"
"into the blockhole, squeezed to long-off"
scythes this into the gap between deep cover and long-off. Stand and deliver. Too full and he got underneath the line to muscle that away
"yorker-length delivery, turns out to be a low full toss that has been squeezed to long-on"
"play and a miss. Looks to carve this over cover, but played too late."
"looks to hoick this across the line over cow corner, gets a thick inside edge onto the pad, ball deflects to the off side"
drilled to long-off. What punch and timing
"low full toss on middle from around the stumps, pushed to long-off"
"<b> Terrible, terrible delivery. </b> Full toss over the waist, umpire had his hand out even before the shot was played. Watson sees the opportunity and biffs this into the stands at deep midwicket. Is that the turning point? Islamabad into the home stretch"
"comes back to over the wicket, but the result is the same. Another full toss, another swing across the line. This time it's over long-on. Poor from a man of Junaid's experience. Surely that's that as far as the game is concerned?"
"this time he pitches short, Watson is waiting for it as he pulls him in front of square, one bounce into the deep midwicket boundary"
"doesn't get hold of the pull as well as he would have liked this time, down to wide long-on"
"looks to slash over point but was cramped for room, beaten"
"dolly of a catch to long-on. What was the need to look for an ugly hoick, you must ask. Smith looks to back away and slog across the line but it was a slower delivery and so he's completely deceived by the change in pace. Was through with the stroke, which he checked at the last moment, as the ball lobbed to the fielder. He's played well though, a half-century during the course of two important partnerships"
starts off with a poor delivery down leg. May have been distracted by Billing's movement outside the line of off stump.
"into the blockhole, squeezed to long-on. Sensible from Billings"
"slashed to point, they steal a run. Good stop there but Billings was halfway through the run when Watson took off. Watson wasn't running to the danger end and so was happy to get across anyway"
"steered into the gap at deep extra cover, easy two there"
"pulled into the gap, signs off with a boundary! Crunched that into the gap superbly. First win of PSL 2017 belongs to defending champs Islamabad United"
