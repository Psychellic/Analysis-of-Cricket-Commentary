"starts off with a full delivery that swings back late into middle, Warner squeezes it to mid-off"
"length ball on middle and leg, whipped to M Ashwin at midwicket"
"outstanding stop by Smith at cover point. Saved a certain boundary. It was short, enough width on offer, Warner slapped it and expected a boundary till he saw his mate dive full length to his left and stop it with one hand"
"not the kind of ball that deserved a wicket, but try telling that to Dinda! He's delivered a big, big wicket. The in-form David Warner can't believe what he's done. This was short and wide outside off, Warner went for the cut and managed to hit it straight to Ajinkya Rahane at backward point. The leap is back, the celebration is back. Supergiants couldn't have asked for a better start"
"first runs, and off the pad. Poor ball first up to a new batsman. Sprays it full and down leg, Tare misses the flick, but the ball deflects off the pad into the fine leg boundary"
"bangs it in outside off, Tare sways out of the way. Not a bad first over, that"
"Dinda in action again, and this time with an outstanding save at third man. Dhawan went for a drive, only managed a thick edge that flew towards third man. Superhero stuff, saved it with one hand"
"tails back into middle, Dhawan just managed to get his bat down in the nick of time"
"back of length delivery just a touch outside off stump, bounces over his waist, Dhawan lets it go"
Thisara dives full length to his right to stop a thumping drive at mid-off
"shapes away from the back of length area on middle, Tare shoulders arms"
"uppish, but just short of Thisara at mid-on. He floated that full on middle, the ball curved away late, Tare flicked it, and was lucky it didn't carry. He didn't have full control of the shot"
"length ball back into his body, tucked off his hips to square leg"
"whipped uppishly, just wide of mid-on. Once again, he wasn't in control of the stroke which he had to fetch from outside off"
gets half-forward and bunts it with a straight bat
"cut away, but Rajat Bhatia manages to cover good ground at third man, but it was only a half-stop, which meant the batsmen had enough time to get back for the extra run"
"drive and a miss. He went for the drive with an angled bat face, perhaps to play it past cover point, was beaten by the away movement"
flicked uppishly towards fine leg
"lucky to get away with that poor ball. Full and way down leg, clips Tare's pad on the way through to Dhoni. Any bat on that and it would have raced away into the fine leg boundary"
"Mumbai's Ranji Trophy winning captain is struggling against the swinging ball here. Goes for the drive, no feet movement whatsoever, beaten by the outswinger again"
"slices it to Rahane, just short of him at point. Once again stayed back inside the crease to play it over point, lucky to survive"
"that should relieve some pressure. Length ball on middle, he rolls his wrists over ball nicely to generate power as the ball sped away between square leg and midwicket. Top shot, he should feel a lot better"
stands tall and punches it straight to point
"lucky break, he's already had a couple of lives. Marsh digs it in short, Tare fetches the pull from outside edge, but gets top edge. Dhoni anticipates that and hares backwards to pull it back in just before it crossed the advertising triangle"
"unlucky for the bowler. Floats it full, the ball swings back into middle and leg, Dhawan drives, but gets a thick inside edge that flies past leg stump and into the fine leg boundary"
"looks to whip it over square leg, the ball deflects off the thigh pad to the off side"
"tests the bounce of the surface by banging another short ball, this one was outside off, Dhawan watched it through to Dhoni"
"pulled, not of the middle as M Ashwin does the mopping up at deep square leg. Was into the stroke a little too early on that occasion"
"pushed back to mid-off for a quick single, the run was possible because the non-striker trusted Dhawan's instinctive call. Well done"
"he's run out of luck. This was banged in short outside off, Tare looks to pull but there was no conviction in the stroke, only managed to top-edge that one to Thisara, who judged it well at cover. It was swirling in the air for a while but Thisara called loud and clear, and then took it the Aussie way, with his palms facing the sky."
tucked past square leg for an easy single
hops back and plays it back down the pitch with soft hands
"another one bites the dust. After testing him with a short one, he floats it full and moves it away off the seam, Morgan went for the drive, but his feet was nowhere near the pitch of the ball, only managed a thin edge which was gleefully accepted by Dhoni. When he throws the ball up after catching it, you know it means something. Supergiants are on a roll"
"stays back inside the crease to a delivery he could have played forward, squeezed to point"
gets back and across before defending it with a straight bat
"shapes away from the length area outside off, left alone"
"short ball on middle, Dhawan hops across and wrists it wide of midwicket"
"hustles him once again with that short of length ball on middle from wide of the crease, defended with soft hands"
"mistimes a cut to Rahane at point. He's always in the game, isn't he? Fires a throw at the bowler's end to have the non-striker put his bat back in"
gets on top of the bounce and dabs it to midwicket
"a direct hit from Smith at cover and Hooda would have had all the time in the world to think about what made him look for a run that wasn't on. Defended it and took off, he slipped on the turn. Smith perhaps went at it too quickly, could have taken a second before firing the throw. Opportunity lost"
eased wide of point for an easy single this time
"and he strikes with his first ball, again. This one drifts back in from wide of the crease, Hooda is early into his reverse paddle, the ball lobs off his glove to Dhoni who dives to his right to complete the catch. Trouble for Sunrisers"
gets onto the backfoot and defends with a dead bat
"lucky to get away with a slider that goes wrong, looks to help it past short fine, didn't get enough bat on it"
"appeal for lbw as Dhawan stabs outside the line of the ball, gets an inside edge. Would have been very close otherwise"
"cuts it wide of cover, Ashwin's extracting some bounce here"
"it's the carrom ball this time, a touch short on middle and leg, whipped to deep square"
"Ir's a strangle down leg that has got them a wicker here. Marsh can afford to smile now, but he would have cringed the moment he delivered the ball. Juicy half-volley down leg, Henriques tickles it fine, only to see MS Dhoni diving full length to his left to take the strangle. All smiles in the Supergiants camp. The lower order will be put to a severe test tonight"
"full and swinging away from outside off, left alone"
leans forward and steers with an angled face down to third man to get off the mark
bunts it to Thisara at deep cover
"rip-roaring bouncer on middle, it gets big on Ojha who awkwardly fends it to the on side and gets across for a single. He got into a tangle there"
"squeezed back to the bowler, who misfields to allow a single. Casual effort from Mitch Marsh, simply put his hand out instead of getting his body behind that"
"it's the slider into middle and leg, turned to midwicket"
"uses the depth of the crease to whip it into the gap at deep square, Dhawan was strolling down the pitch, but had to rush back in as the throw was a quick one"
gets half-forward and bunts it to the off side
""
gets to the pitch of the ball and eases it with the spin to long-off
"reads the carrom ball off the hands, defended back down the pitch"
"takes ages for it to get to Dhawan, looks to force it past cover, inside-edges the drive back to the bowler"
thumped on the up to mid-off
"slower and fuller on middle, worked away off his pad to deep midwicket"
"chipped back down the pitch, but was hit wide of the bowler"
"looks to work it wide of square leg, but the ball nips away late to square Dhawan up, somehow manages to get some bat behind that one"
tucked towards Dinda at deep midwicket
steps out and works it across the line to deep midwicket
"loops it up nicely on off stump, Ojha lunges forward and turns it with the spin to midwicket"
"the carrom ball on middle, driven down to long-on"
"fired down leg, paddled well, but straight to Saurabh Tiwary at short fine leg. A metre on either side and it was four"
takes it on the full and turns it to deep square leg
"nicely tossed up, Ojha had to stretch forward to smother the spin. He plays back to the bowler"
Dhawan's decided enough is enough. Skips down the pitch and lofts the length ball over the bowler's head. It didn't matter to him that Dhoni was standing up to the stumps.
eased wide of point for a quick single to raise the 50
punched past the bowler to long-on
"drops it with soft hands to the off side and sets off for a run that wasn't on, Dhoni moves to his left, takes the gloves off and fires a throw at the batsman's end, he was gone had he hit"
"excellent stop off his own bowling, this was punched on the up"
"uppish, but safe as he punches it to Rahane at long-off"
"fires a carrom ball on middle, swept to deep fine leg"
"slows it down nicely, Dhawan is caught in two minds, but finally decides to dab it to point for a quick single"
"lands the carrom ball where he wanted to, finally. Ojha gets forward and defends"
"another carrom ball, this one was full outside off, driven to long-off"
"slows it down again, Dhawan skipped down the track but had to readjust, crunched towards point where Smith dived over the ball"
tucked behind square on the leg side for an easy single
"walks across the stumps and sweeps it fiercely towards deep backward square leg, where M Ashwin pulls out a tumbling save"
flicked off the pad to deep midwicket
"he's biffed that over cow corner. Too full on middle. Ojha cleared his front leg and swept that over the infield, amazed at how far that carried. Pressure on the bowler for the first time. Is that the momentum switch Sunrisers have been after? That has certainly got the crowd back on their feet"
""
"the attempted leg-cutter goes horribly wrong, bowls it on a seventh stump outside off, easy call for the umpire"
whipped to deep midwicket
drilled down the ground to Tiwary at long-on
"slides a quicker one on middle and leg, whi"
"the wrong-un is pitched too short, enough time for Dhawan to read that one and pull it towards deep square"
"looks to slog that across the line, bottom-edges it towards Ashwin at deep square leg"
"not too often you see Rahane put one down at long-off. Dhawan was deceived in flight as he skipped down the track, but went through with the lofted hit, Rahane perhaps came running in too early and was on the move when the ball bobbled out of his hand. What happened next was astounding. Disappointed, as he was, he quickly recovered to fire a throw to the bowler's end. Ashwin broke the bails off but Ojha was just in."
gets back and defends with soft hands
mistimes a pull to square leg
"sees Dhawan walk across to scoop and floats it short and wide outside off, he looks to ramp it over short third, but is done in for pace"
"thumped, but a super stop by Tiwary at extra cover.  He threw himself to his left to save three runs"
"excellent bouncer, Allan Donald-like, on middle. Ojha is hurried into the pull, the ball whizzes past his left glove. Dhoni likes that"
"softened him with the short ball, and then the death rattle. This one was floated full on middle, Ojha looked to loft that over long-on, but missed it completely. The middle and leg stump was flattened. CR7 celebrations again. What a night he's having"
"length ball outside off, dabbed to point"
"uses the pace of the bowler and helps it down to third man, where Ashwin took a split-second longer to release the ball. Enough time to get back for the second. Dhoni is unhappy with that effort"
"excellent yorker, Dhawan fails to get underneath that one, squeezed to mid-off"
uses the depth of the crease to hop back and whip it into the gap at deep midwicket
"back of length delivery outside off, slapped to deep cover"
"he's picked the bones out of that one. Brings up his half-century too. This was too full and right in Dhawan's hitting arc, and he swung through the line to get enough elevation and distance to have the ball soaring over long-on"
drilled towards Mitch Marsh at long-off
"short on middle, he pulls and misses"
"squeezed to Thisara at short fine, but Bipul was running towards the danger end, and a direct hit only made matters worse as he was a good three inches short of the crease"
"floats it full and well outside off, perhaps in his quest for extra pace, easy call for the umpire"
"look to pull over midwicket, the ball gets big on him, but the ball flies off the top edge into the third man boundary. Dinda has a look of disbelief. Why bowl short when the full ball has yielded success today?"
"bangs another angry bouncer on middle, Bhuvi does well to sway out of the way. It was well-directed on middle"
"this was coming, or was it? Predictable from Dinda. After two short ball, Bhuvneshwar was waiting for that full ball. Once it was there, he simply swung hard at it to send it soaring over long-on. He got that off the dead centre off his bat. Sweet sound as it made contact"
"tries to improvise by playing the paddle, the ball takes an inside edge and rolls to the off side"
"looking to bowl a yorker on the base of middle, but slips it down leg"
"Dhawan looks to make room by walking towards leg stump, Dinda sees him make the initial movement and spears a full ball that sneaks through the gap between bat and pad. End of his spell. Terrific spell, but could have ended it better. He knows it too. Snatches the cap from the umpire and lets out a few expletives"
"too full outside off, Bhuvi makes room, opens the face of the bat and slices it wide of short third man. Clever"
"almost a repeat of the previous delivery.  Dhoni isn't happy with the ball. There was a man at 45, but Bhuvi once again backed away and backed himself to play it wide of the man. That brought a smile to Warner's face too."
"low full toss outside off, he walks across to flick, gets a top edge that falls in no man's land at long-on. The important bit is they squeeze the second one in"
"not a ball that deserved a wicket, but Bhuvi has done his job. He swung that high full toss on middle towards long-on. The only mistake was he didn't get it off the middle, and Faf took the simplest of catches. This has been a terrific cameo nonetheless."
"looks to go over long-on, but can't get underneath the delivery, somehow manages to find the gap at wide long-off, enough time to get back for the second"
"excellent yorker on the base of off stump, Dhawan looked to go over midwicket but quickly adjusted to jam his bat down in time to play it towards cover"
"back of length delivery on off stump, defended off the backfoot"
"shapes away but Rahane is assured in his footwork, stretches forward with bat close to the pad and defends"
"driven firmly, but an excellent stop by Warner, diving to his right, at mid-off"
"walks out of the crease to negate the swing, but Bhuvi floats it shorter in length, Rahane has the line well covered as he pats it towards cover"
"there's the early wicket, and the buzz in the crowd is unmistakable. Rahane saw the width and threw his bat at that, only managed to hit it straight to Morgan who took it on the second attempt at backward point."
shuffles across to play it back down the pitch
"hops back and punches it to cover, that one was bowled at 126 kph"
"banged in short, and that has sped away into the midwicket boundary faster than it came at him. Pulled imperiously in front of square. Faf is up and running"
"back of length delivery on middle, this skids one onto Faf who takes his bottom hand off the handle as he bunts it to point"
"lands it full on middle, this one holds its line, Faf defends with a dead bat"
"this has the zip, but was well down leg. Naman Ojha does well to move swiftly to his left to collect that"
"crunching cover drive, but an excellent stop by Moises Henriques. Hit hard into the group, he had to leap in the air to stop that"
half-forward as he bunts it to cover
"back of length delivery outside off, Smith hops back and across before opening the bat face to steer it behind point"
"this one nips back in a touch from outside off, solidly defended to cover"
"unlucky for the bowler, applause from Warner. Looks to force that length ball outside off through cover, plays outside the line and gets a thick inside edge that races away into the fine leg boundary"
"advances down the pitch in his quest to throw Bhuvi off guard, works it wide of mid-on"
"this one cuts back in sharply from outside off, Smith hops back but is almost defeated by the low bounce, somehow manages to keep that out. Things are happening"
"whipped past a diving Dhawan at midwicket, he was late to get off the blocks there"
"raps Faf on the pads immediately, but the lift on that one meant the ball would have gone over the stumps. Faf played outside the line but managed to scoot a leg-bye in"
"what a ball, this one grips on middle and has Smith squared up as the ball fizzes through to Naman Ojha. It wasn't far away from the edge. There was a stifled appeal, the umpire has a wry smile"
"tries to bowl the short one on leg stump, gets it way over Smith's head, easy call that"
"another slow off-cutter outside off, eased to the gully fielder"
"authoritative from Smith. Too full and on the pads, it was flicked towards Nehra, whose gingerly movement at mid-on meant he only got a bit of hand on that. While he took the pace off the ball, there was still enough for it to race away into the boundary"
"deliberately done, very cheeky. This was another cutter, but was too short, Smith hopped back into the crease and dabbed it past the diving wicketkeeper."
"low full toss on middle, squeezed past the bowler, he'll keep strike."
"banana swing, but sliding down leg, Smith lets it go"
"poor effort by Aditya Tare at deep square. It was too short, Smith plays a full-blooded pull, nearly carried to him at deep square. He got an awkward bounce alright, but should have stopped it nonetheless."
whipped off his hip to deep square leg
"he follows Faf, who makes room to slash over point, but the ball bounces over the batsman's head, Ojha's leap can only take the pace off the ball. Umpire thinks it was way too high. Nehra isn't happy, Warner is annoyed too. Right call, though"
"punched to cover, a misfield gives them a single"
"slower one on off stump, pushed back to the bowler"
"looks to force one through the off side, but doesn't have enough room to work with, jabbed instead"
"deflects off the pad to third man. Smith played all around it, but the ball pitched outside leg and would have missed the stumps too"
"surprisingly a seam-up delivery on middle, tucked to square leg"
"nearly through, Smith was shuffling across, but the ball was dipping on him, he missed it completely. It wasn't far away from leg stump. The ball clipped his pad on the way through to the keeper"
"whipped away, no chance for mid-on. This was like a helicopter shot played all along the ground. Too full, and Smith pounded that away with his powerful wrists. Delightful!"
"floats it full and far too wide outside off, wide called. Suddenly, he's under pressure"
"the slower one on middle, but punished. Classy from Steve Smith. Picks the one off the hand and whips it over midwicket, one bounce into the boundary. Supergiants are powering ahead. Wonder if this is a calculated attack in a bid to boost their net run-rate"
"gets across and flicks it into the gap at deep midwicket, made the second very easily"
"back of length delivery sliding across, defended to the off side with soft hands. Another productive over for the batting team"
driven with the spin to long-off
"steps out and whips it uppishly over the infield, one bounce to deep midwicket"
"swept across the line, but it bisects the gap between deep square leg and wide long-on. Too full, and the sweep was a powerful one. He knew it was four the moment it left the bat"
"he's muscled the pull, and boy, has that carried. Too short, Faf was somewhat off balance when he pulled, but the ball flew off the sweet spot. This is poor bowling, they are motoring along"
waits for the turn and punches it down to long-on
"width, and cut away late and behind point. He waited for the turn and played it so late that the point fielder had given up even before the ball went past him"
"floats a length ball on middle, played back down the pitch"
"full outside off, squeezed back to the bowler"
"driving length outside off, Smith goes after that one but gets a thick inside edge onto the pad, they scoot across for the single"
"steps out to slog that over long-on, done in by the late swing, beaten!"
reaches out for that short ball and steers it to point
"when he hit that, I must tell you, it didn't look like it would carry, but it has. Nonchalant from Faf. He floats a length ball on middle, he walks down the pitch and casually flicks it over the midwicket. Tremendous use of the bottom hand"
bunts a short ball to point
whipped off his hip to Bipul at deep square leg
flicked from outside off towards long-on
"length ball outside off, driven on the up towards sweeper cover, excellent running between the wickets. Smith was always in it for the second"
"why would you want to test the bounce on this surface at 130kph? Way over Smith's head, Ojha sticks his right hand out to take the pace off the ball"
"stands tall and then angles it down to Nehra at third man, can't prevent the second. Tad slow, but understandable considering he's coming back from an injury"
wrists the length ball from off stump to midwicket
"extra bounce has done the trick. This was a length ball on middle, it nipped away off the seam, Faf looked to run it down to third man but the extra bounce meant a feather off the shoulder through to Naman Ojha. He's done his job though. Something to cheer for the crowd, but they know it's a little too late"
"slip in place, so what? Walks down the pitch and hammers the length ball over mid-on, one bounce into the boundary. He wants to finish this off soon, no doubt about it"
"gets forward to go over cover, got it off the bottom of the bat this time, jammed back to the bowler"
"too full and outside off, gets a bit of swing away, carved to third man"
"flicked past the diving midwicket fielder, Hooda had some work to do in order to get to the ball from deep square. Risky from Smith, but the confidence shines through"
"another whip, this time Hooda comes around quickly to keep it down to a single"
"poor start to a new spell, floats the length ball down leg"
"turned to midwicket, Dhoni wanted the run but there was loud call of 'nooooooo' from Smith"
"short and down leg, nearly called wide, he shuffled across though"
hops back into the crease ad bunts it to the off side
"wonder why he's continuing to stick to that leg side line. Smith hops across to tickle it fine, the ball deflects off the thigh pad and into the fine leg boundary. Nehra went up in an appeal, but the bounce saved Smith"
punched wide of Warner at cover
"that's a blinder from Tare at backward point. It was short and angling away, Dhoni unfurled his wrists to play a fierce cut. The ball was dying on Tare but he kept his eyes on the ball and his reflex action took him nice and low as he pulled off a wonderful catch. Nehra has won the battle of the veterans here. It was hit really, really hard"
