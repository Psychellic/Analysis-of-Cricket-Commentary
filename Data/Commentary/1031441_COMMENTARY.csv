"round the wicket, Morkel does his little twirl at the top of his run and then bangs it in back of a length, holding its line outside off and left alone"
"fuller, 88mph and met with a doughty front-foot block by Cook"
"oof, that's a nut and a half, testing length in the channel, 90mph and zipping through as Cook begins to prod at it and then checks himself at the last"
"pitched up and nibbling a fraction away as Cook steps out to drive, thick-edged past the cordon but he kept it down and picks up four, England's first runs of the day"
"good line from Morkel, 88mph and straightening a touch again, flies to gully on the bounce as Cook reaches forward in front of his pads"
slightly back of a length outside off and this one is allowed to fly through
"pitched up, in the corridor of bamboozlement, not coming back much yet and left alone by Keaton Jennings"
"fullish, shaping a touch outside off, wide enough to leave"
Jennings again shuffles on to the front foot and shoulders arms
"woof, that's an absolute boy of a ball... Good length, decking away late, fractionally past the edge as Jennings was caught fiddling on the crease"
"pitched up, gentle pace at 78mph, wide enough for Jennings to stick his nose out, sniff the wind and ignore"
"on the stumps this time, looking to sneak one through, clipped to midwicket"
"sharp lift from Morkel, angled in and hitting the thigh pad as Cook hangs back"
"spanked through the covers, Cook strides out and pings his second boundary, just a tad too full from Morkel that time"
"four more, cracked off the hip! Morkel drops short and Cook waits in the crease to swivel it away through square, no chance for fine leg to get around"

"fullish, around off stump and blocked on the front foot"
"shorter, Morkel getting it through, defended hopping on the back foot"
"shouts of 'catch!' from Philander as Jennings shovels an inside edge on to his pads, falls short of square leg"
"yeesh, he's done him like a kipper there, angled across and flying into the gloves as Jennings feels for it unsuccessfully"
"<b>gottim, snapped up by third slip!</b> He definitely got bat on that one, a brief but troubled stay is ended, Jennings falling for a duck to give SA another early opening. Textbook working over from Philander and Jennings wasn't up to it"
"woah, that's gone a mile, pitched up well wide and boomeranging towards slip as Westley comes across and ignores it"
"touch shorter, outside the line of off and that's a well-judged leave"
"close, this one nips back, Westley didn't want to play and he survives all right as it flies through just outside off. Welcome to the jungle, Tom"
"length in the channel, Cook watches it through"
"ripping from Morkel, 90mph and holding its line, thudding into de Kock's gloves as Cook leaves it be"
this is pushed a little wider and Cook can ignore those all day
"straighter line, back of a length, defended in front of the stumps"
"tapped into the covers, Cook sets off for a stolen single... and Heino Kuhn then hurls it past the stumps at the non-striker's end for four overthrows!"
"over the wicket, banged on a length, presses forward defensively and turns short into the leg side"
Philander gets his first look at Cook today - he knows his way around the old stager's strengths and weaknesses - defended coming across on off
"pitched up, holding its line on off and blocked"
now this one swerves away as Cook lunges on to the front foot and shoulders arms
"good length, pushed across the bows, no need to play at that one"
"now Philander attacks the stumps, straightening a touch, Cook defends"
"pitched up in the channel, this murmurs back in to the left-hander, who judges it well and leaves"
"whippage! Tom Westley is off the mark in Test cricket with a trademark leg glance, striding across his stumps to ping four to deep backward square - Indiana Jones would have been proud of that"
"short and in the channel this time, Westley jumps across and leaves very deliberately"
"back of a length, 83mph and a foot outside off, again he can comfortably ignore"

"in the corridor, nothing doing"
"and now he goes too straight, allowing Cook to clip him firmly past the diving midwicket for a couple"
"short and climbing through outside off, 140kph/87mph but again wide enough for Westley to leave be"
"fuller, gets him coming forward, Westley is tempted by this one but picks out extra cover with a crisp drive"
"short of a length, flying through to the keeper in the channel"
Morkel hammering away in the channel but it's still a fraction short and wide and the batsman can throw his hands up out of the way early
"good length, 86mph and holding its line outside off, Westley walks across and then shoulders arms again"
"oooh, strays into Westley's zone again, although any Test-match batsman worth his salt would put that away... Length on the pads and tickled fine to the fence"
"over the wicket to Cook, gets this to swing but the ball whirs harmlessly down the leg side"
"length ball, 84mph and sliding behind the pads again"
"on the pads, meat and drink for Cook, who waits for it, waits for it, waits for it... and then zips a leg glance through square leg for four"
"length ball sliding on to the pads again, not found his line yet, Cook flicks one to fine leg"

"length ball in the channel, left alone"
"lovely stuff from Morkel, veering in and then straightening, like a police car sliding around a corner, past the outside edge"
short and angled down the leg side this time
on the hips and worked away
"<b>big lbw appeal from Morkel</b>, did he get a scratch on it? Fullish length and Westley went across the line, <i>just</i> feathered it on to his front pad as the bowler went up... Faf knew, no thought of a review"
"length ball, again leg side and through to the keeper as Cook glances unsuccessfully"
"good length, on middle and off, blocked back down the track"

round the wicket and that's a wayward start as he sprays it miles outside off
"on off stump, good length at 87mph, defended to the covers"
"back of a length, wide outside off, left alone"
decent carry on this one but again too wide
"gets this a little closer to off stump, comes in at Cook on the angle and left alone"
"that's well bowled, brings him forward and he plays with a slightly open face into the gully...Elgar seems to have taken a painful blow, in a delicate area, as Kuhn collided with him. A few smiles around. Not from Elgar"
makes a late decision to leave this alone
"that's a sharp bouncer, 86mph, but it's very short and carries miles over Westley's head"
"full at off stump, 91mph, defended to mid-on"
gets inside the line of a short-of-a-length delivery and works to midwicket
"fuller, outside off, hint of swing and left alone"
"wide again, 85mph, a comfortable one to leave alone"
swings away but started on a line that meant Westley didn't need to play
"back of a length outside off, 84mph, left alone and carries at waist height to de Kock"
"that's a wild one down the leg side, evades a diving de Kock and is parried away for byes"
"this time it's sprayed wide outside off, he hasn't quite got it right so far"
"back of a length at off stump, defended on his toes to the bowler"

"this one is speared down the leg side, Cook tries to flick it away but can't catch up with"
"we have a <b>review</b>...big appeal for lbw, a full ball angled in at the stumps, Cook falls across a little. This looks to be heading leg-side on the angle. Ah, he's hit it as well. So that's that. But it was smashing leg stump, so that edged saved him"
clipped from off stump out to deep midwicket
"some late swing there, Westley's feet caught in the crease as he reaches out for a full ball"
"on off stump, plays forward and takes a thick inside edge to the leg side"

"on off stump, Cook presses forward and nudges into midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, defended down by his feet"
"that's nicely played, gets forward into a full delivery, which swings late, and drives through the covers although not quite perfectly timed"
"good length, but too wide outside off, left alone"
"full, wide outside off, need to make him play a little more"
gets it a little closer to off stump but again left alone
"nicely bowled, this dips in late from round the wicket, Cook jabs down with a closed face into midwicket"
"gets forward into a drive, this was an inswinger at 86mph, finds mid-off"
"flicked in the air! But he gets it over square leg. Was another inswinger, quite a big one this time, Westley's flicks it with his wrists"
"well bowled! Finds the outside edge with a full delivery on off stump, Cook comes across it a little, bottom hand comes off the bat, runs through gully"
"that's a very neat stroke, in full control this time, takes a length ball wide of mid-on with another leg-side whip"
"back of a length at off stump, defended into point"
deflects off the thigh pads behind square on the leg side
"full, down the leg side, de Kock has to dive to his right"

"touch shorter, again there's some lateral movement but Westley covers it and dabs into the off side for one"
"round the wicket, slanted in on the pads and Cook shovels it firmly past the diving fielder for one"
"pitched up, gets him driving and <b>taken at second slip!</b> Morris punches the air, he has separated England's second-wicket pair after a gritty stand... Westley perhaps needed to take his time getting in again, instead he went hard at a ball he might have left, Morris shaped it away and du Plessis pouched a thick outside edge"
slides this down the leg side and Root swishes at it unsuccessfully
"round the wicket, hits a shortish length, Cook lets it fly through a foot outside off"
"fired down the leg side, maybe some unexpected swing for Morkel and de Kock can't quite hold on to it diving to his right"
"goes full on off stump, Root is equal to it, pulling up the drawbridge in time"
"touch short and wide of the stumps, left alone"
"tempting length, Root comes forward and is then beaten on the inside, bit of nibble and bounce and he wears it on the body, maybe via the edge"
"short and wide, Root doesn't much about here, leans back and clouts it up over point, in front of the catcher and away for his first runs"
"angled full on off stump, Cook shows it a straight bat"
Cook comes across and dinks into a gap on the off side
"Morris drags this down and Root is swiftly across, opening the face and guiding four more through backward point"
"fuller, tighter to off stuimp, Root pushes at it and <b>gets a thick outside edge that doesn't carry!</b> Du Plessis went down to his right and took a blow on the finger as it raced away for another boundary to the England captain"
"ooh, nicely done by Morris, gets his length right this time and beats the outside edge"
"touch short on off stump, Root rides it and dabs to the left of extra cover for one"

"length ball, slightly wide of off stump, no stroke"
"Morkel still a fraction short and wide, Root stays back and shoulders arms"
"Root moves across early and Morkel seems to spot him coming, jams it in short of a length and the batsman draws himself out of the firing line"
"Morris goes round the wicket and loses his line to Cook, curving off the cut strip again"
"now, like an enthusiastic Tippexer, he overcorrects, on the pads and flicked very fine for four"
"turned short into the leg side and they hustle through, Morkel the fielder and he's not the quickest, nor the best thrower"
"slightly full in the channel and Root is well forward, over the top of the ball as he strokes a couple back past mid-off"
touch too straight this time and Root continues his busy start with a wristy clip through midwicket that Morkel eventually chases down

"Morris fires the ball down the leg side, flick and a miss"
"that's a victory for the bowler, though he only gets a gold star for his notebook, pitched up and swinging away, past the outside edge"
this time he's a fraction short and Root stabs it through point for a couple
"good pace from Morris, jumps at Root as he hangs back in the crease"

lets this one go in the channel
"squares him up again, <b>this time the edge falls short of gully!</b> Morkel is giving Cook a thorough going over, he was playing back and the ball straightened on him, didn't quite carry to the diving Elgar, though"

"flighted, spinning in and defended in front the stumps"
"Morkel has found a groove here, superb length, befuddling Root, who is beaten prodding outside off half forward"
"touch shorter, angled in and holding its line, throws his hands up this time"
"woof, the nip-backer, Root didn't want to play at it, the ball a fraction short but perilously close to off stump as it veered in"
"nearly kippered again! Lovely length, Root beaten feeling for it"
"oh, that's a jaffa, curling in and away as Root attempts a booming drive and misses again!"
"short of a length, stays back and hit on the thigh pad"
"tossed up, spinning in as Cook thrusts out his front pad... was that coming back enough? He certainly wasn't playing a shot, but there's no appetite to review"

"given some air, dips and spins to hit the inside edge as Cook drives, runs to midwicket"

"full at middle and off, defended into the leg side"
he takes a stride down the pitch and defends a length ball to the bowler

flicks this behind square on the leg side and scurries between the wickets
leans forward and defends
"full and straight, strongly clipped to deep square leg"

what a comeback by Big Vern...he didn't like that boundary. This is on off stump and nips away to beat Cook's outside edge. Excellent cricket at the moment

"full outside off, swings away, left alone"
"a bouncer outside off, it's very short and Cook forgets any thought of attacking it"
jabs this away from off stump into midwicket
"full outside leg, Malan doesn't make contact as he tries to flick it away"

"a powerful pull, quickly in position and he pings this to deep square leg"
"<B>given lbw and Cook reviews straight away!</B> Round the wicket, nips back and takes him on the knee roll. No bat involved. Is it too high? It's taking the bails, he's gone!

round the wicket and beats the outside edge as Moeen pushes forward
"<b>big appeal</b> for caught behind (or maybe lbw as well) given not out and Faf eventually <b>reviews</b>. Third umpire says the review is for lbw. Good length, angling in at Moeen, and there's an inside edge here...he will be caught behind because de Kock held the catch. Very similar to Alastair Cook at Trent Bridge"
"full at off stump, he gets forward and defends to mid-on"
"short outside off, left alone"
tight leave! This one seams back off a good length and travels over off stump

leaves alone again
"nips back from short of a length, spears into Stokes' thigh pad and flies behind square"

"on the pads, neatly flicked away to the short boundary and it beats fine leg"
"another nice whip off the pads, a fuller delivery this time, finds long leg"

"a short delivery, he tries to cut and it's a bit close for the shot, gets beaten"
"a bouncer, well directed over off stump but TRJ watches it closely and pulls his head out of the line"

"full at middle and leg, flicked sweetly off his pads down to long leg"
"full outside off, drives square through point and he's able to get back for the second...there was a fumble in the deep, but Stokes would have made two in any event"

"back of a length at off stump, 82mph, angled towards gully"
"<B>all the way</b>! A short ball on leg stump, Roland-Jones sees it early and swings it high over the short fine leg boundary. A hint of top edge in the pull, but it was very safe"
"round the wicket, on a good length, pushed to the covers"
"full at the stumps, pushed to mid-on"
"short of a length, played to the covers"
"excellent yorker, although doesn't do the damage of the one to Malan as Roland-Jones is able to squeeze it to the leg side"
"he likes the pull! A short ball, not a full on bouncer, and Roland-Jones pulls it powerfully behind square. Went like a rocket"
full outside off and driven flamboyantly straight to cover
"on the back foot, whipped through midwicket"
"<B>lbw</b>, round the wicket, a full ball slides on and beats Roland-Jones' inside edge as he plays forward, takes the front pad low down. He has a quick chat with Stokes before not reviewing. Was smashing leg stump"

worked into the leg side

"Maharaj goes over the wicket, tossed up outside off, Broad defends coming forwards"
"big appeal here, not sure if for lbw or a catch at slip... Aleem Dar shakes his head and SA decide against reviewing, he was well outside the line and it appears as if the ball spun in past the bat on its way through"
"on the stumps, worked with the turn to the leg side"
"pushed through, defended on the back foot"
"oh my, <b>he's hammered that miles into the crowd!</b> Stokes rolls out the slog-sweep and dumps Maharaj waaaaaaay back over the deep midwicket boundary to move into the 90s"
"tossed up on the stumps, tapped away"
shortish and Broad tucks it off his hip for one
"pitched up and clipped firmly off the pads, races straight to deep backward square for just a single"
"pitched up, Broad is stuck in his trench and <b>flicks a straightforward catch to slip!</b> Once again, it's the full ball (and the looming threat of the short one) that does for Broad... Still a decent ball, full and tailing away from round the wicket, Broad closed the face attempting to work it away to the leg side and a thick deflection flew to Amla"
"short and wide of the stumps, Anderson stays well away from it"
"pitched up, 88mph on off stump, blocked defiantly back down the track, to ironic applause around the ground"
"back of a length, in the channel outside off, flies through to the keeper"
"pushed through on the stumps, nudged back along the carpet to long-on but he turns down the single"
"tossed up, Stokes goes for the slog... and picks out du Plessis at wide long-on... who takes a good catch <b>but then falls back on to the rope!</b> The momentum took him backwards, just far enough for his shoulder to brush the boundary marker! Good catch from du Plessis but he can only smile ruefully, he knew straight away"
"nailed back down the ground, <b>there's his hundred!</b> No doubt about this one, Stokes mullers it straight into the stands to raise his fifth Test hundred and his second against South Africa"

"angled in from round the wicket, dabbed down into a gap and they take the single this time, giving Anderson one ball to survive"
"pitched up, aiming for the yorker on off stump, Anderson keeps it out"
"dug in short, Stokes doesn't get hold of his pull but manages to put it right between deep midwicket and deep square leg and they belatedly realise two is on"
"slogged up into the air <b>and taken by long-off running in!</b> Stokes' fun is over, he walks off with his bat raised, a fine innings that went from watchful to wrecking ball... Morkel gets this third, he has bowled well, though this was a simple slap into the air, well taken by Rabada on the move"
"pitched up, hint of swing away, Elgar covers it and gently dabs into the off side before scampering a run to get off the mark first ball"

"pitched up closer to the off stump, Elgar gets across to stifle it in defence"
"good length, curving away but the line was a touch wide to begin with and Elgar can strike a pose as he leaves"
"oof, Broad thought that had done the job! 'How did you not touch that?' he asks Elgar as he finishes his follow through... Pitched up and leaving Elgar as he felt for it, past the edge and into the gloves"
"another beauty to finish the over! Shorter, fired in and then straightening, Elgar fending blindly and trusting to luck"
"Anderson goes a little straight, extra bounce and Kuhn punches it off his body"
"Anderson has to adjust for the left-hander and remains too straight, Elgar gets a boundary fine off his pads"
"slanted across from over the wicket, allows this one through"
"good length, shaping away as Elgar hangs back and pokes it towards gully, where Stokes leaps to cut it off"
"probing in the channel, defended square from the crease"
wide of the off stump and Elgar shepherds it through
over the wicket for Broad to Kuhn and this is left alone in the channel
"pitched up, a little straight this time and Kuhn glances firmly through square leg for his first boundary"
"angled in, Kuhn is stuck on the crease and the ball flicks something on its way through to Bairstow... Umpire Joel Wilson shakes his head and Root decides not to review. Which turns out to be a good call, the ball just brushing the pads"
"length delivery, fourth-stump line, Kuhn holds his nerve and holds his bat out of the way"
"touch shorter, gun-barrel straight in the channel, shoulders arms again"
"continues to bang away in the corridor and Kuhn remains focused on his off pole, leaves"
"trundles in, hits a good length, defended from the crease in front of the middle and leg stump"
"pushed wide of the stumps, heading towards first slip and Elgar ignores it"
"shortish, Elgar reaches for it and <b>gets a thick outside edge short of point!</b> The ball bounces a yard or so in front of Tom Westley, nearly a similar dismissal to the one Elgar fell to in the first innings at Trent Bridge"
"drops short, there's width for Kuhn to swing his arms and he swats a second boundary calmly through point"
"length ball, sliding down the leg side as Kuhn walks across"
"tapped into the leg side, they think about one but quickly have to make alternative arrangements as the fielder races in"
"in the channel outside off, not close enough to make him play"
"good length, angled in and then curving away, again Elgar is happy to watch those through"
"homing in, closer to the stumps, 86mph and holding its line, Elgar sticks his head out and holds his bat in at the last moment"
"zoinks! <b>That's pretty much the perfect ball for no result</b>... Broad was beginning to point to the sky, Elgar threw his head up in the knowledge there was nothing he could do, the ball doing the Hokey-Cokey on a length but missing everything as he reached forward"
"a touch wider, you can't replicate that line easily, comfortable leave from Elgar"
slightly straighter and nudged off his pads into the midwicket area
"back of a length, 136kph/84mph and rising around off stump, blocked back towards the bowler"
"dangles the carrot outside off, Elgar keeps his stick to himself"
"nicely bowled, slanted across and hitting the seam, the ball fades away past the outside edge as Elgar chases after it"
"testing line again, Elgar presses forward and the ball ends up in Bairstow's gloves... <b>the cordon appeals in unison, TRJ isn't sure - but the finger goes up!</b> Aleem Dar heard a nick and, although <b>Elgar reviews</b> it's to no avail, Ultra Edge quickly revealing a faint spike! Elgar was left shaking his head, convinced he hadn't hit it... and Roland-Jones' reaction was somewhere between uncertainty and disbelief, but he has his first Test wicket and England will walk off having made a vital breakthrough"
"good length, some nibble back in to hit the pad... <b>Not given by Dar but England review</b>, TRJ again seemed uncertain but Root decides to gamble. Looked a touch leg side on first glance but here we got with Hawk-Eye: <b>umpire's call!</b> The ball is projected to have clipped leg stump, but not with enough certainty to overturn the original call. so Amla survives"
"in the channel, this wobbles through to the keeper as Amla gets into Automated Leaving Mode"
"floaty half-volley and Kuhn doesn't miss out, big stride and he splunks four through the covers to get the SA scoreboard moving again"

"good length, nibbling in towards off stump, Amla gets a stride in and throws his bat in the air"
"another in-ducker, that's even closer to the timbers...! Again Amla's judgement is shown to be impeccable, didn't <i>quite</i> come back enough and SA's zen master chalks up another point in the psychological war"
"moves this one away on a good length, left alone once again"
"back of a length, slightly straight and tucked down into the leg side"
"good length on off, Kuhn moves into line and defends"
"some swing for Roland-Jones, leaving the batsman as he hangs back and leaves"
"<b>full and straight, trapped in front!</b> Dar doesn't hesitate on this one, though they decide to check the no-ball... It's <i>very</i> tight but the TV umpire is happy there was a scrap of rubber behind the line and Kuhn is on his way! TRJ has his second and T'Oval lets out a jubilant, throaty roar... Kuhn just missed this, trying to work across the line, it struck him on the back leg and would have torpedoed leg stump"
"stays over the wicket, pitched up and defended softly coming forwards on off"
"zippedy-doodah in the channel, de Kock leaves it alone"
slightly back of a length and down the leg side as the batsman wanders across and watches it by
"hits a length in the channel, no lateral movement and it whizzes through the keeper"
"good length, decking back a little off the seam, Amla comes across and shoulders arms"
"fractionally overpitched by Broad and this is laced through the off side, Amla just leaning on a drive in front of square for his first runs"
"probing away in the corridor, Amla ignores it"
"good length, shading back in a fraction, 86mph and met with a resolute front-foot block"
"shorter, Amla draws himself up to defend on off stump"
"fullish length, on middle and off stump, de Kock covers the line and blocks"
"raps into the pads, little bit of nibble back in as TRJ hits the seam, big appeal but that looked high... and Dar thinks much the same"

"over the wicket, in the channel, 80mph and defended on the back foot"
"pitched up, not been much swing for Roland-Jones and Amla chops down on it, gets a couple out towards the cover boundary as Moeen gives chase"
"<b>AMLA'S GONE!!</B> Roland-Jones has his third, a snorting ball flicks the glove and England have squished Hash...! Brilliant ball, it simply took off as Amla moved back and across, only a faint tickle of glove, I think, but he wasn't hanging around to quibble with the decision from Dar"

"back of a length on off stump, defended towards the bowler"
"on leg stump, clipped off the pads to long leg"
"another huge appeal for lbw! Dar says not out, England ponder the review but then decide against it. Back of a length, nipped in at de Kock and he fell across the ball. Pitched well outside leg"
"now he plays and misses! A short, wide delivery which de Kock goes after with a cross-batted stroke"

"full at middle and leg, makes him play, worked to midwicket"
"full at du Plessis' boots, clipped to long leg"
"that's another lovely drive, walks forward and sends it straight of mid-off but this time it gets hauled in"
"<b>he's got four as de Kock edges to gully!</b> Full at middle and off, de Kock trying to work to the leg side and the outside edge is snaffled by Stokes."
"huge appeal for lbw! A good length ball nips back at Bavuma who is caught on the crease. Hits the knee roll, but height didn't look an issue. Perhaps sliding down. Ah, well, he may have hit it. Was the catch taken? I can't tell. Do much happening! No, it fell short of Stokes at gully"
"outside off, left alone"
"edged! But short of third slip. Jeepers, he's all over them here. On off stump, Bavuma getting forward but manages to play it softly enough that it doesn't carry"

defended back to the bowler
"another play and a miss! Full outside of, a booming flat-footed drive and he doesn't make contact"
"full at off stump, defended and it runs to the leg side"
"that's magnificent, he's all over Morris. This is a leg-break at about 83mph. It's just short of a length and squares him up as it beats the outside edge"

"<b>back to the bowler!</b> He's been tested and teased by Anderson, who then pitches this up at off stump again, Morris tries to drive but the bat twists a little in his hand and it spoons a catch which Anderson gobbles in his follow through. They check the no-ball, it's tight but he's okay"
"beaten! Just short of a length, Maharaj feels for it away from his body"
"squares him up with some late movement, defended to the off side"

tries to withdraw the bat from a wide delivery outside off and the ball runs off the face into the slips
"fired short down the leg side, a rare occasion where Bairstow can't gather the ball down the leg side...and it's a no-ball. Not England's best 30 seconds"

"targets the stumps, Bavuma defends responsibly from the crease"
"pitched up, Rabda throws the hands and gets a good chunk on it, skimmed away through backward point for four"
comes across on off stump and defends

"teasing line, again Rabada tries to take the bat away, thick-edged towards gully where Stokes snags it on the bounce"
"<b>timbah!</b> Beautiful from Broad, just about unplayable, especially for a batsman of Rabada's calibre... Immaculate length, sliding in and then snaking back to kiss the top of off stump, precision bowling to a lefty from round the wicket"
the crowd gives Broad the build up but this is slung down the leg side and Morkel off strike with a shovel to fine leg
"pitched up and twonked over cover for four! Flowing lofted drive from Bavuma, who may try to play a few more shots now he only has Big Morne for company"

"fired in straight and Morkel swings it to the leg side, in the air but short of the diving Anderson at mid-on, who gets a hand on it to stop the ball racing away for four - Bavuma then declines the single, trusting Morkel to see out the final ball of the over"
"back of a length, curling away in the corridor outside off as Morkel throws his hands in the air and survives"
tossed up on off and defended solidly

floated up and tapped into the covers

left alone in the corridor
"angled in, full of a length, jabbed towards mid-on"
"pitched up, still searching for that nibble, Bavuma drives with an open face through backward point, possibly three on... but Bavuma stops Morkel early from coming for a second, worried he will lose the strike, so it's just one to the total"
"dangles the ball up outside off stump, Bavuma coolly watches it through"
"straighter line, 138kph/86mph, defended coming across"
again Bavuma is forward on off to block
"fired in, aiming for the top of off stump, Bavuma calmly defuses another"
"sliding on to the pads, flicked to fine leg for one, which he is happy to take now, with one ball left in the over"
shot! Morkel gets moving with a firm slap past mid-off for four
"full, touch overpitched and there's no movement, Bavuma eases it back down the ground to long-on, super timing on the stroke"
"pitched up again, in the channel, driven back down the track and TRJ fields in his follow through"
"oh, close for Roland-Jones, extra bounce and it zips past the top edge as Bavuma goes to cut!"
"slanted in, back of a length, 81mph and dabbed defensively into the leg side"
"pitched up on fourth stump, driven to mid-off"
"tight lines from TRJ, length on middle and off, Bavuma works the wrists but sends it to midwicket - which means Morkel stays on strike for the next over"
"back of a length, wide of the stumps and curling away as Morkel woofs at it off the back foot and again fails to connect"
"dug in short now, 134kph/82mph and rising to hit Morkel on the body, maybe via the inside edge, dropping safely into the off side"

"gentle away-nibbler in the corridor, still no bites from Temba"
"slides this one in with the arm, started a fraction wide and he shoulders arms"
"diligent probing from Roland-Jones, 129kph/79mph but Bavuma respectfully watches it through once more to see out a maiden"

short and rising towards the chest as Morkel hangs back and blocks
"back of a length again, this is helped around the corner for one"
"splice-jarring length (at least to Lil Temba), he stays tall (relatively) on off stump and blocks"
"pitched up, 85mph tempter wide of the timbers, lets it go"
"<b>dropped!</b> It was a tough chance in the gully but <b>Ben Stokes couldn't cling on flying to his left!</b> Bavuma was drawn into a loose drive, after all that self-denial, he sliced the ball behind gully, Stokes seemed to be standing quite close and it went quickly - but he's a fielder who expects to hold those"
on the stumps and pushed towards mid-on
slightly short of a length and Morkel shows more streetfighting ability with a bottom-handed shovel through midwicket to bring the up the SA 150

"pushed across, shortish length and steered towards backward point"
"touch back of a length on middle and leg, 82mph and worked off the body"
"short again and whacked through the leg side, 'No! No! No!' yells Bavuma as deep backward square cuts it off quickly... Surely you can trust him now, Temba?"

pushed through on off stump and chopped into the turf going back
on the stumps and blocked from deep in the crease
"flat and sliding in again, close to another lbw shout as Morkel swipes at it and gets a thin edge on to his pads"
tossed up and Morkel keeps another one out
"fired down the leg side, Bairstow juggles it and ends up appealing on his knees... What happened there? Dar once again isn't interested, think YJB was asking for a tickle of bat on its way behind the legs, but replays suggest it only brushed the pad"
"starts off with a length ball in the channel, left alone"
"pitched up, quite wide and Bavuma can free the arms, he watches it closely and blaps four through the  covers, moving ever closer to his fifty"

"angled in, straightening a touch, worked to the on side"

"fullish on off stump, prodded firmly towards mid-off - Philander holds it together to see out the over"

"that's a good one, just short of a good length and it moves away late to beat Bavuma's outside edge"
"a little fuller this time, finds the middle of the bat as he defends to cover"
"edged! Finds the gap, wide of third slip...pushing away from his body, bottom hand comes off the bat. Would have been swallowed by a fourth slip"
"blimey! That takes off from a good length, wide enough to leave, thankfully for Philander, and Bairstow has to jump to take it above his head"
"tries to go over the off side, spoons the ball in the air but it loops over Broad at mid-off"
"<b>caught behind, five for Roland-Jones!</b> A good length ball just outside off, delivered from wider on the crease, so credit to TRJ, Bavuma pushes forward and gets an outside edge which Bairstow takes to his right"

"touch shorter, wide enough to leave alone"
"fuller, outside off, Cook tries to get forward and forces the ball into midwicket as the bat face closes"

"good length, at off stump, defended"
"just short of a length, played into the off side"
"he's off the pair, in a roundabout way! Gets inside the line of a shorter delivery and works to the leg side, midwicket cuts off the run but Kuhn, at the stumps, can't gather the ball at the stumps"
"good length outside off, defended to the covers"
"well bowled! Saved by the inside edge...a full delivery nipping back, Cook trapped on the crease and it's a huge nick into the pads"

"a touch fuller, 75mph, left alone"
"gets some fortune here, he brings his bat down quite late against a length delivery and gets an inside edge past leg stump"
"<B>dropped</b>, at third slip! Lovely delivery, just short of a good length at off stump, makes him play and the edge flies quickly at head height to Elgar who barely gets a hand on it. They are stood pretty close"
"good ball, in the channel outside off, angles in then nips away to beat the edge"
"finds the edge this time, full at off stump, Cook is squared up but plays with soft hands to send the edge to ground and between the slips"

gets well forward to a good length ball
"touch shorter, Cook goes back in the crease and flicks out to deep square leg"

"round the wicket, full and wide outside off, left alone"
"angled into the pads, flicked sweetly but cut off by Maharaj in front of square"
driven into the off side
"what a ball! That's unplayable. Short of a length, angles in at off stump, then nips away off the seam to turn Cook around. He just shrugs. Too good"

"on off stump, defended"
"full, pushed across outside, left alone"

"shorter in length, defended to point with a slightly open face"
"length in the channel, 84mph and Cook gets a stride in and leaves"
"<b>bowled him - that's a jaffa!</b> Morkel takes his tally of Cook dismissals to 11, and it's a rare bowled for England's redoubtable opener; not much he could do about that ball, though, angled in before pitching and seaming and switching on to the Bakerloo Line to shiver the timbers and send Cook on his way"
"criminy, that's a tough ball to get first up, too! Morkel goes over the wicket and fires the ball in, again it hits the deck and moves away, past Westley's groping outside edge"
"length ball, seaming towards the cordon but it was wide enough to ignore"
"goes a bit straighter, Westley prods at it and gets a thick inside edge for one"
"round the wicket again, 140kph/87mph and defended solidly coming forwards"
"crunched through the covers! Confidence-boosting shot from Westley, stepping out and proving he's not just a leg-side merchant, made sure he got well forward and larruped it past the diving extra cover"

opens the face and angles a length ball through point
swings across the line of a length ball and it travels over the stumps
"clubs this down to long-on, one bounce to the fielder"
"<b>run out, direct hit from Bavuma!</b> Moeen has been a bit lazy here. Was flicked into the leg side, Bairstow was hurrying for the second and didn't really seem to stretch until the end. He's a few inches short. Bavuma the fielder, hit with just one stump to aim at. Terrific work from him"
tapped to the leg side
takes the pad as he uses his feet
drives to backward point
"slides on with the air, driven off the back foot to cover"
pushed down the ground to long-off
"full and straight, flicked at the stumps into square leg"
a loopy full toss which is clipped down the ground
"a strong sweep from outside leg stump, finds deep backward square"
pushed back to the bowler
"plenty of air, flicked to midwicket"
"uses his feet, makes it a full toss and drives back to the bowler"
worked off the pads through midwicket
drives a shorter delivery out to deep cover

nearly gets through as this skids on and TRJ pushes to cover

pushed to the off side
"down the pitch, hammers a full toss down the ground wide of long-off"
"brings out the reverse sweep against a full, straight delivery"
"swings hard at a full delivery, Elgar gets a hand on it but can only parry it down to long-on"
"heaved through midwicket, long-on gets round"
"this time he connects very nicely with the reverse sweep, gets it wide of short third man to the deep point boundary...a nice half-century"
"full at the toes, flicked through square leg"
shovelled through the leg side wide of midwicket
"goes for the sweep, loops off the top edge over the keeper"
"that's a mighty sweep over deep square leg, into the crowd"
"gives himself room outside leg, and Bairstow has a problem here. Hobbles through for the run"
"driven down the ground, Bairstow limps through again"
driven to cover
and now it's Roland-Jones' turn as he sweeps into the crowd at deep square leg
"uses his feet, makes it into a full toss and clubs down the ground to long-on"
driven down to long-off and Bairstow not moving well
"<b>all the way again</b>, slotted down the ground by TRJ. An uncompromising thump as he gets underneath a loopy full delivery"

driven to long-off
moves outside leg stump and drives to cover
swings this off the pads behind square on the leg side
"full, wide outside off, jabbed out to deep cover for a walked single"
"clubbed down the ground, dragged it from wide outside off to long-on"
"<b>finds long-off, taken at the second attempt</b>, Bairstow tries to go down the ground, it's a low full toss, gets it off the toe of the bat. Rabada juggles it and manages to stick out his left hand to grab the rebound. <b>England have declared</b>"
"strides in, back of a length and a little leg side, helped away behind square for one to get Kuhn off the mark and off strike"
"<b>rapped on the pads, England go up... Not given!</b> Aleem Dar thought long and hard about it, height probably the main issue. No review from England, Hawk-Eye shows it pitched in line and was clipping, but that wouldn't have been enough to overturn the original decision"
"angled across in the channel, Elgar pushes with an open face and picks up a couple through backward point"
lets this one go in the channel
"good length, shaping away, comes forward and shoulders arms"
"length ball, 81mph around off stump, jabbed away defensively towards point"
"goes full in the channel, the ball hard and shiny as it leaves Broad's hand, Kuhn drives and gets an inside edge through backward square leg"
"round the wicket, 135kph/84mph on middle and off, tapped down into the leg side and they hare through as Malan comes in from midwicket to field"
"fullish, fourth-stump line, defended coming forwards"
"full and a little wide, punched firmly coming forwards, gets it away through the covers and picks up four, nicely timed"
"pitched up a little straighter, Kuhn mistimes a drive back to the bowler... and then Broad fuzzes the ball wide of the stumps for some reason, still irked about that four. Bairstow has to be alert"
in the channel outside off and left alone
"bit of width, Elgar prods one through point"
fired in and then holding its line as Kuhn comes across
pitched up and defended on the front foot
"comes forward on off stump, no lateral movement and Kuhn blocks"
goes a fraction too straight and he works a single off the pads
"that's a sweet nut to finish! Full, quite wide but Elgar was drawn into following in, darting away late and into the gloves after beating the bat"
"Broad hits a length just outside off, blocked solidly enough"
"in the channel, back of a length, no stroke offered"
gets him driving again but Kuhn is in control and strokes this nicely for four more through extra cover
"good length, in the channel and holding its line, left alone"
"<b>nip-backer, hits the front pad as Kuhn lunges forward</b>... Wilson shakes his head again, was it outside the line? There's a lot of deliberating about whether to review but Root eventually decides against it. Think they run a leg bye from an overthrow, amidst it all"
"round the wicket, dabbed into the covers for a quick single"
"stroked down the ground, that's a good shot... Lovely timing on this, leaning forward and nudging it fine of mid-off for a boundary"
comes across to defend
"length ball around the line of off, Elgar is into position and blocks again"
"shaping away outside off stump, lets this one go"
"ooh, turned around, that's a super ball, not much Elgar could do other than shrug it off, sliding in and then fishtailing away past the edge!"
"<b>dropped!</b> Low chance for Jennings at third slip but he shelled it...! Pitched up and Elgar's bat scissors down, takes the edge and it flies to the left of Jennings, chance spurned"
"length around off stump, defended from the crease"
"<b>bowled 'im, off stump is flat on the ground!</b> The Oval laps it up, forgetting all about the drop a few moments ago... Broad's initial response to being hit for four by Kuhn was petulant but that's the only sort of comeback that matters for a bowler. Hurtles back off a good length, clocks off stump right in the mush"
"line and length outside off, Amla watches this impassively through"
"straighter, angled in on middle stump, turned down to the leg side for one"
"round the wicket, pitched up and met with a front-foot block, Elgar plunging out to defend"
gets a little straight and he's worked away for a couple through square leg
"Anderson probes around off stump, testing length and Amla covers it watchfully"
"extra bounce this time, fended away off the glove, would have been a straightforward catch to short leg... if there was one in"
"angled across wide of the stumps, left alone"
fullish and blocked solidly around the line of off
"full and tailing away, 137kph/84mph and Elgar taps it in front of point for a single"

"Broad charges in and hits a length, bowling over the wicket to Elgar now, defended"
"fired across the bows, pitched up in the slot to drive, keeps his impulses in check"
"full and a touch wide, 85mph and zipping through as Elgar ignores it again"
"squares him up a touch, this looks ungainly but Elgar at least keeps it down, stabbed through the slip cordon and it runs for four"
"full, tighter to the stumps, pushed towards mid-off coming forwards"
"slightly overpitched and Elgar eases this through mid-on, past Moeen and away for a couple"
"well bowled, Anderson gets it to straighten and flash past the outside edge as Amla feels for it"
"follows up with the in-ducker, struck on the pads but looked high... That jagged back like an angry bee, inside the groping bat and he copped it just above the knee roll"
"angling in on the stumps again, worked around the corner for a single"
"hits the pads again, this looked leg side but Anderson goes up enthusiastically again... Nothing doing from Dar"
presses forward to a fullish ball and taps into the covers
"straighter line, 81mph and Elgar nudges it into the leg side from the crease"
"length ball around off, Amla defends softly"
"good length and in the channel, lets this one go"
"fired down the leg side and Amla flicks at it, came of the pad and diverted wide of Bairstow to the rope"
maybe a fraction short and Amla gets across to defend on off stump
"sharp from Broad, 87mph and dug in, rising up towards the splice - maybe hit him on the bottom finger, actually, Amla defending securely back in the crease"
"touch short of a length on off, comes across to block"
"probing line from Anderson, this comes back and hits the inside edge as Elgar defends"
"similar line, he's causing him problems here, thick-edged into the thigh as Elgar reaches for it"

"length ball, 83mph, on the stumps and defended"
"back of a length on the stumps, moves across and dabs down to the leg side"
"touch short again, around off stump and Amla watches it carefully, blocks"
angled in a little straight and Amla battens it down past short leg for a single
"teasing line outside off, full and showing Elgar a bit of ankle... Left alone"
"steams in and hammers a length, Amla is across and shows it a straight bat in defence"
defended from the crease... and Stokes had overstepped
"goes a touch wider, good pace, 89mph and fired in over the top of off, Amla blocks - and Stokes is penalised for another front-foot no-ball"
"pitched up a foot or so outside off, this is touching 90mph... but Amla calmly watches it through"
around off stump and defended coming across
"slung down in the channel, wide enough for the batsman to ignore"
"good length, 139kph/87mph and blocked with a straight bat on off"
"line and length, top of off stump, Amla is across early and shows it the Stop sign"
"Roland-Jones goes full in the channel, nothing doing from Elgar"
"closer to the stumps, none of that TRJ nibble as yet, defended"
touch full on off and scooched into the covers for a quick single
"good length on off stump, again Amla is well prepared, has all his homework done in advance, defends"
tight lines from TRJ and Amla is across to block again
"good length on off, shows it a straight bat... best get used to that BAS bat logo, on this evidence"
"pushed across the left-hander, who again drops a cheeky one into the covers"
"dug in short, sharp bouncer from Stokes, Amla is down in the crease early"
sliding into the body and worked fine for a single
"pitched up around off stump, Elgar lines it up to defend"
"round the wicket, full and on a fourth-stump line, met solidly coming forwards"
"yeow, that's a ripping bouncer, a real throat ball! Elgar did really well to ride it, threw the hands up and prevented it from ballooning towards point"
"cat and mouse here, TRJ nibbling away around off stump, Amla block-block-blocking for his life"
"trundles, length ball on off, defended"
"fractionally shorter, 82mph and Amla again hops across to defend... This duel has the capacity to become a thorough exploration of the principles of inertia"
"dug in short and climbing through, wide of the stumps and Amla ignores it"
"<b>oh Hashim, what have you done?!</b> Tries to withdraw the bat, he's late making the decision and it flicks the toe, flies low to second slip... Amla starts heading off, although the umpires tell him to hold on a minute while they check the catch. This looks good, Dharmasena happy he can see fingers under the ball, and Amla will be on his way! Roland-Jones' fast-medium velocity is enough to overcome Amla for the second time in the match, the great blocker budged"
pitched up and prodded into the off side to get off the mark first ball
"length outside off, de Kock gets into line"
"flashed for four! Touch short and wide from Stokes and Quinny throws the hands, thick-edges over the slips and away"
angled in and worked to the leg side from the crease
"in the channel, good length and holding its line, left alone"
"<b>splat! The yorker does it...</b> Bails go pop and de Kock is off! Stokes just grins to himself, that was full and fast, exposed a lack of footwork, actually thundered into the boot first before rattling off stump... Again it's tight on the no-ball line but there's something behind it. England getting their claws into SA now"
"<b>plants the front foot, playing no stroke, hits the pads... and given!</b> It's a first-baller for Faf, though he decides to <b>review</b>, more in hope than expectation, I reckon; yes, it's coming back a long way, struck well outside the line but that doesn't matter and umpire's call on clipping the top of off stump. Almost identical to his first-innings dismissal, du Plessis is in and then out and Stokes is on a hat-trick!"
"puts it on a length around off stump, blocked watchfully from the crease"
"slanted across, fullish length and trying to get him driving, Elgar leaves it alone"
"short and on the body, tucked off the hip and it runs to the fine-leg boundary for four"
"bit of extra lift off a length, Elgar takes his bottom hand off after jabbing it down in defence"
"pitched up and driven this time, gets a good connection on it and picks up another boundary through point"
pitched up and defended on off
"angling in to Bavuma, who mooches across and calmly flicks a single to fine leg. No drama"
"round the wicket to Elgar, goes for the yorker again, it's sliding down the leg side and flicked away fine"
"length ball, Bavuma comes across on off to defend"
Stokes oversteps as he slings down an 89mph thunderbolt wide of the stumps
shuffles across and lets another one go
"good length, this comes back menacingly from wide of the stumps, well judged and left again"
"oof, that's hit the bat hard, short of a length and Bavuma drops it like it's hot into the off side"
"comes across to defend on off, hastily jabbed away"
"TRJ probes away in the corridor, wide enough to leave"
"tight lines, Elgar doesn't look all that comfortable but he blocks back towards the bowler"
"fullish around off stump, 79mph, pushed back down the track"
"hammering away on a length, tight lines and Elgar again takes his bottom hand off as he prods it away"

"on off stump, takes his bottom hand off the bat as he defends"
"tight leave, Stokes has got this ball moving both ways, this one shapes back in late at off stump"
flicked off the pads to long leg
"round the wicket, short of a length, jars the splice of the bat as he fends it down in front of short leg"
"full outside off, pushed square into point"
"full outside off, more late swing, left alone"
"targets the gloves again! Short of a length, fends it down by his feet and manages a wry smile. It's a tough battle out there"
"full at off stump, solidly forward and pushed to mid-off"
a bouncer which sails over his back
works this from outside off to the leg side and Malan makes a very sharp diving stop from short leg
"short of a length, nudged wide of short leg this time into midwicket"
"hint of width, pushed squared into the off side"

"nicely behind this one, short of a length, pushed past Stokes to mid-off"
"finds the edge, the bat coming right across the line, flies towards gully but falls well short"
"whack! That's a good response from Elgar, gives something back to Stokes with a rasping pull from outside off"
"width outside off and he drives it square through the off side, not actually timed that well and it gets chased down by Westley"
"short of a length, pushed through the vacant mid-on area"
"good length, nips back at Bavuma and takes an inside edge into the pads"
flicked neatly off the body to short leg
"that's a good one! Just short of a good length and zips past the outside edge, continuing to rise as it reaches Bairstow"
"outside off, left alone"
"short of a length, jumps into line and defends"
"nearly dragged on! For a second I though that had taken off stump. Goes after the short, gets the bottom edge which scoots past off stump to fine leg"
worked between short leg and leg gully
"full outside off, left alone"
"comes forward and drives into the mid-on area, the fielder is more at midwicket"
"nearly through him again, this is a top contest, a fuller length and nips back off the seam, takes Elgar on the back leg"
works a straight ball to short leg
"he's back and across, defends a ball from outside off to the leg side"
"fuller, slides on outside off, Bavuma leans forward and tries to hide the bat behind the pad but think he was beaten"
"comes forward again, slides off the face through backward point"
"this spins a touch from outside off, takes the pad but he's got outside the line and is playing a shot (sort of)"
"full toss outside off and he doesn't miss out, driving through the covers"
pushed down the leg side
"full outside off, pushes with an open face into point and it takes Elgar to a very gutsy <B>fifty</b>, he's taken some blows but has fought hard"
"huge appeal for caught behind! Given not out and they decided not to review. Full outside off, Bavuma drives and it appears he flicked his pad, so a good decision from Root not to challenge. Excellent decision from Dar"
"this time he finds an inside edge, Bavuma trapped on the crease, squeezes down to long leg"
"now he's back over the wicket, goes for the yorker, it's spot on and Elgar does well to get the toe of the bat on it"
"on the pads and flicked firmly through midwicket, still able to take advantage of the odd loose ball but this has been some spell from Stokes"

"fuller, worked away from off stump into midwicket"

"at the stumps, pushed to mid-on"
"back of a length outside off, he's well across the crease and defends with soft hands"

"down the leg side, Elgar flicks at it but can't catch up"
"down the leg side again, closer to leg stump, Elgar pushes at it and there's a small ask about an edge. There was the tiniest of noises. Well, well! There's a mark on Ultra Edge. Has Broad missed another?"
"on the pads, flicked down to long leg...Elgar was battered and bruised yesterday"

"<B>gone lbw after a review!</B> An appeal for lbw, this takes the pad as Bavuma plays forward, did he get outside the line or was then an edge? We have a <B>review</b> from Root after Dar says not out. It's pad first, but looks like he's got outside the line here. No it isn't! It's hit in line with off stump and it's three reds! What a review from Root. At the moment of impact Bavuma was still on the move, so was hit more in line than it first appeared. What a game for TRJ"
"<B>first ball, lbw padding up!</b> What a horrible leave from Big Vern. Good length, nips back a touch, takes the back pad and it's right in front of off stump. South Africa's don't seem too keen on using their bat early in an innings. First Faf, now Philander"

pushed across the bows and Elgar again waves it through to the keeper
"floated up outside off, Morris plunges forwards in defence"
"overpitched and cracked through the covers, Moeen seeking drift outside off, turned into a half-volley as Morris came forward and larruped it in front of square"
"flatter, homing in on off stump, lined up well to block from the crease"
"this one goes on with Morris playing for turn, edged but keeps it down and the ball runs wide of slip for a couple"
"tossed up and he charges out to slug four over mid-off, pretty safe shot with this field - and Morris strikes the ball pretty cleanly"
"gives it some loop again, leg side and straightening behind the pads as Morris lets it go"
"slightly back of a length and fended away off the hip for one, no bat involved"
"glides in and brings this back on a length, worrying the front pad as Morris brings his bat down to block"
"length ball, 80mph outside off, lets this one go"
straighter and worked to the leg side as he shuffles across
"pushed down the leg side, flick and a miss from Morris"
"that's the Right Area, maybe a touch short as it gave Morris a fraction longer to size up the seam movement, but he was pretty much kippered, whistling past the outside edge"
"fired across the southpaw, who leaves it alone in the channel"
"around off stump, good length and this time Elgar props forward to block"
"slightly short, 134kph/82mph outside off, goes for a short-arm jab and gets a bottom edge down into the pitch"
"'ooooh' gasps the cordon as he entices a loose drive from Elgar, can't have been far away from the outside edge"
"pitched up wide of off stump, Elgar is mindful of his lapse to the previous ball and doesn't go anywhere near it"
"length ball around the line of off, blocked"
comes across to block
"length ball, no great seam or swing for Anderson, defended again"
"touch shorter, 134kph/82mph and blocked stoutly from the crease"
"probing away on off, Morris shows it an impressively straight bat"
fired in on the stumps and defended again
"that's a feisty nut, straightening a smidge, past the outside edge...Bairstow appealed but he was a lone voice. Close, though"
"a little straight from TRJ, good length and worked off the pads square for one"
"fullish, sliding in and Morris drives... sending the ball to fine leg for four! Not where he was aiming but runs all the same, Roland-Jones perilously close to sneaking that one past the bat and into pad"
gets across on off and blocks
"length ball, aiming for the top off of, Morris shows it a straight bat in defence"
"pitched up and driven, decent connection but it runs to mid-on"
"TRJ continues to harangue the batsman on and around off stump, like a very polite debt collector, 82mph but giving nothing away, Morris defends"
"length ball from over the wicket, lets this one go outside off"
"dabbed down into the covers, Elgar sets off but that would have been a suicidal run to cover as Moeen Ali swooped and he is rightly sent back"
"pushed across the bows, length delivery that veers away a touch, no stroke"
presses on to the front foot and blocks
"sliding towards first slip, Anderson continuing to take the ball away, nothing doing"
"pitched up a touch, 133kph/81mph in the channel, Elgar gets on to the front foot and ushers it through once again"
comes across to defend a length delivery
touch shorter in the corridor and Morris lets it go
"good length, holding its line but no need to play once again"
"gentle pace from Broad, 77mph as he gets warmed up again, blocked"
"pitched up and Morris shows intent, punches back past the bowler, mid-on can't quite cut it off and has to give chase"
on the stumps and tapped away
"Anderson pitches the ball up around off, defended by the ever-stoic Elgar"
"full and inviting the drive, met with a firm connection but mid-off dives to make the stop"
"round the wicket, full and straight... and whipped for four, nicely timed as he transfers the weight forward and it scuttles away to the deep midwicket rope"
"draws his length back, lets this one go in the corridor"
trundling away in the channel but wide enough to leave again
"bit of extra lift from a length, Elgar's bat comes down at that awkward angle as his bottom hand lets go, but he manages to prod it safely down towards gully"
"banging away on a good length outside off, still the pitch is pretty sleepy, Morris leaves"
"not a bat ball, this, driven on the up but Morris pings it right out of the middle and picks up four back down the ground"
"length in the corridor, gun-barrel straight and left alone"
"back of a length, Morris frees the arms this time and jabs a couple in front of point"
"digs this one in short, Morris flinches his head out of the way"
lets a shortish ball go outside off
"pitched up from round the wicket, lets it zip through"
"full in the channel, Elgar gets a stride in and leaves, the ball keeps low and bounces again in front of Bairstow, who can't prevent it from running away to the rope"
"good length, 135kph/83mph a foot outside off, no lateral movement and no stroke either"
"angled in a little straighter, worked through square leg and they come back for two"
"pitched up in the channel, The Oval has become a fifth-day desert for swing and there's no stroke"
"over the wicket again, Elgar jabs at it in defence and then takes his bottom hand off and wrings it in pain"
"tossed up outside off, <b>edged but not taken!</b> Morris went for a big drive, got an appreciable nick but it deflected into Bairstow's knee... Hard to call it a proper chance"
comes forward and pushes the ball away
tossed up and stroked into the covers
gets on to the front foot and defends
"floated up on off, blocked coming forwards"
"<b>takes the edge, Stokes snaffles it at slip - Moeen strikes with the final ball of the morning!</b> Morris falls with the interval looming after a committed knock, he just played the wrong line, the ball skidded on and again the edge evaded Bairstow - possibly flicking his thigh - and looped to the left of Stokes, who plunged gratefully to scoop it up"
defended into the point area
worked off the pads to backward square leg
"fuller at off stump, closes the face into midwicket"

"round the wicket, on off stump, defended"
driven to mid-off
worked into the leg side
"very full, driven out to cover"
left alone outside off
uses his bottom hand and flicks to mid-on
"short of a length at off stump, knocks into the gap at cover and that will frustrate England that he gets off strike"
"angled into the pads, flicked away fine and beats Westley's scamper and dive at long leg"
defended from off stump
that's a lovely piece of timing as he punches a full ball with a straight through mid-on
"shorter in length, played with an angled bat towards gully"

"fuller, flicked to mid-on"
worked off the stumps into midwicket
defends a length ball to the overs
"fuller, a touch wider, and that's nicely played by Elgar as he leans forward and drives through the covers"
"that's a loose shot, pushes at a ball wide outside off and is beaten"
"full outside off, very compactly but away as he gets forward and drives it through mid-off...the fielder is stationed quite square"
"and again! Maharaj fancies this chase? A drive on the up outside off this time, threads it through the off side"
"a short ball, he's had enough of being driven, nips back at Maharaj and takes him on the thigh pad"
"banged in short, at off stump, he's jumping in his crease and defends down by his feet"
"full toss outside off, takes the toe end towards mid-off"
"short outside off stump, hint of width, this time he goes after it, up and over backward point"
flicked from outside off through midwicket
"back and across, defends"
"full outside off, driven firmly to cover"
"a little shorter, he plays back and pushes square to the off side"
"tossed this up outside off, brings a drive from Maharaj and it bounces, takes Bairstow on the shoulder"
forward and defends
neatly worked off his pads through midwicket as TRJ gets too straight from round the wicket
edged! Through the slips. Don't think it carried. Pushing at a length ball outside off and he somehow finds the narrow game between third and fourth slip
"full and straight, forced through the on side"
"steers this through backward point, touch too much width"
and now he goes straight down the ground with a nicely timed punch
that's a good one! Gets it closer to off stump and it straightens off the seam. Elgar committed to the shot and is beaten
"short outside off, he rocks and cuts square through the off side...positive intent since lunch"
"tossed wide outside off, driven towards cover where Cook dives over it...England getting a bit sloppy"
whipped off the back foot into short leg
worked off the stumps into midwicket
"some sharp spin there, from short of a length, rips into Maharaj pads"
"well bowled, beats him with a quicker delivery outside off which goes in with the air"
"round the wicket, back of a length, left alone"
"a short ball outside off, he plays back and defends into the covers"
punches off the back foot to the covers
"fuller at off stump, he's well across the crease and works to mid-on"
gets inside the line of a shorter ball and works through square leg
"full, very wide, left alone"
"full at off stump, defended on the front foot"
"another good stride forward, blocks to the covers"
"wider outside off, left alone"
"that's a tighter leave, this one slides on with the air rather than turning"
"<b>edged to slip!</b> Elgar's defiance is over. Tossed into the footmarks, a little slower from Moeen, Elgar can't resist the drive this time and sends the edge to Stokes who rarely misses them"
"<B>and it's a repeat, edged to slip!</b>, almost a carbon-copy, Moeen floats one up outside off, Rabada just pushes forward and sends a regulation nick to the hands of Stokes. Another bowler on a hat-trick, third of the innings but that's the end of the over"
"full at off stump, some late shape, defended to cover"
pushed down the leg side
pushes this length ball into the covers
"full outside off, left alone"
a sharp bouncer over off stump which he ducks
"gets an inside edge into his pads, so Moeen will get another over"
"<b>Moeen wins it with a hat-trick!</b> Huge appeal for lbw and it's given not out but looks so close, England have reviewed. Round the wicket, slides on with the arm, Morkel only gets a small stride forward. Joel Wilson waited an age then said not out. It was smashing leg stump. What a moment to Moeen, the first hat-trick at The Oval in the ground's 100th Test"
