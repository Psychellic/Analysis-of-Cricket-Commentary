"shortish, too much width, and Kohli easily slaps it away to the right of backward point"
"back of a length, a tiny bit of movement in towards off stump, blocked into the on side. Was looking for the bunted single into the leg side but Sandeep moved quickly in his follow-through to cut it off"
"overpitched, on the pads, but square leg is on the boundary so Kohli's clip is kept down to one"
"too full, no swing, lots of room, and Rahul flows into a drive to the left of mid-off"

"fullish, a bit of width, driven to cover point"
"back of a length outside off, guided down to third man"

"this time there's a bit more width and he can free his arms to force that away off the back foot, in the air to the left of backward point and the right of third man, and it absolutely hurries to the boundary"
"back of a length close to off stump, blocked towards point"
"back of a length, on the pads, clipped to deep square leg"
"ooh. Length ball outside off, a bit of away movement, and Kohli doesn't move his front foot at all. Just reaches for it away from his body, the bottom hand comes off the handle, and the ball skews in the air but between backward point and cover point"
"what have you done, Marcus Stoinis? Kohli came down the track, and once again reached away from his body to drive. Ended up slicing it to backward point, at chest height, not too far to his left, and that wasn't a difficult chance at all. Simply bounces out of his palms"
"back of a length on off stump, worked away through square leg"
"short, angling down leg. Fine leg is inside the circle and Rahul swivels to put it away to the right of the fielder"
"short outside off, he hasn't really timed this pull, but he's got it over the infield, and that's enough to take it all the way to the vacant midwicket boundary"
"down the track, makes himself room, and the ball is just at the right place for a massive carve over extra cover - it carries ten rows back, at least"
"back of a length outside off, and Rahul is in the zone here. Just lets it come on, and it's almost in the keeper's gloves when he brings his bat down to dab it away with an open face, to the left of short third man"
"back of a length at the body, tucked away to short fine leg"
"back of a length, close to off stump. Stops on the pitch a touch and he has to push well in front of his body and hits that punch in the air, for a short duration, to the left of mid-off"

"tossed up slower and wider, and Rahul inside-edges the sweep into his pads"

"slowish length ball on off stump, pushed quietly to long-off"

"length ball angling into the pads, clipped towards deep midwicket"
"legcutter wide of off stump. Kohli throws his bat at it, away from his body, hits it hard, but in the air, and straight to short cover!"

"flat, angling into middle stump, just short of driving length. Pushed to long-on"
"back of a length, goes with the angle towards leg stump. AB goes on the back foot and punches to long-off"
"bowled him! Watson is too early into the pull - I've seen this happen before, during the 2013 Test series in India - and Axar's flat, shortish ball holds up on the pitch, keeps just a touch low, and takes out middle and off stumps"
"tossed up outside off, gets forward for a push into the covers"

"length ball close to off stump, driven towards mid-off"
"shortish outside off, pulled to the left of deep midwicket"

"fired in on a fullish length on off and middle, clipped away through square leg"

"looks for the yorker, and that's a pretty good ball, but AB walks across, gets down low, meets it on the full to sweep it over the backward square leg boundary"
"in the blockhole on middle and leg, jabbed down to long-on. Ball rolled slowly enough to the fielder for the batsmen to hurry through for a second"

"full on middle stump, makes room again to drive towards sweeper cover"
"slower ball, shortish, close to off stump. Makes room and swats it in the air, but in the gap to the left of extra cover"
"inswinging yorker on off stump, stabbed away towards sweeper cover"
"slower ball, back of a length. Makes a lot of room and chops it down into the off side. Mohit sprints to his left in his follow-through, dives, and gets a hand to the ball, but can't hold on. Behardien runs in from long-off, and throws at the bowler's end, and Baby dives to complete the second. Not sure he was in if that was a direct hit"
"another slower ball, and it wasn't a bad ball by any means, it was on off stump. AB makes room again, moves away from leg stump and then stands nice and still, makes himself a stable base, and uses the swinging room he's created to flat-bat it back over the bowler's head"

"full-toss on off stump, clears his front leg and clubs it down to long-on"
"gone. That's the wide yorker, and AB looks to steer that wide of short third man. Makes a bit of room, slices it away with an open bat face, middles it perfectly, and picks out the fielder"
"wide-ish slower ball outside off, back of a length. No footwork from Head, just stands and slashes, and he can't connect"
"shortish slower ball, and Baby swivels and times the pull really well. Anureet has to sprint quickly to his left from deep backward square leg and dive to cut off the boundary"
sees him make room and follows him with a low full-toss. Jams his bat down and squeezes it out into the leg side
"follows his movement away from leg stump with a yorker, and Baby can't connect with the flick. The ball shoots between his legs"
"Mohit isn't amused. He bowled another yorker outside leg stump, and the batsman cleared his front leg to be able to flick it. The ball clipped the outside of his pad through to the keeper, and Dharmasena signals wide"
"full on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"low full-toss on leg stump, whipped to deep midwicket"
"another yorker outside leg, another wide signalled. This time Baby missed the flick and the ball missed his pad as well"

"low full-toss wide of off, Head reaches out, scoops it in the air, but on the bounce to long-off"
"wide yorker again, a little too wide. Only way Head could have reached that would have been if he'd dived"

"full and wide outside off, gets down low to slap it away towards sweeper cover"
"what a catch that is! Length ball, and Head looks to hit across it, clearing his front leg and aiming over midwicket. The ball isn't quite as full as he'd like, and because he's going at it with a diagonal bat, it means he hits it off the outside half of it, slices it in the air, and Vijay, running towards the boundary from short extra cover, does brilliantly to take it while it drops from behind him, while running at full tilt"
"full again, chipped towards long-on. They go for the second, it's the last ball after all, and Baby is nowhere near the crease when Saha picks up Miller's throw and removes the bails"
Starts with a short ball close to off stump and Amla shuffles across to nurdle it into the leg side
"length ball outside off, just a bit of outswing. Vijay pokes it gently into the cover point region"
"back of a length close to off stump, Amla gets behind it and pokes it back towards the bowler"

shortish outside off. Amla walks across to work it to deep square leg
"starts with a flat one sliding down the leg side, and Amla just tickles it away to the right of short fine leg"

"full, sliding down leg. Vijay plays for turn, looking for the clip through the leg side, and the ball beats his inside edge and hits his pad"
"once again sliding down leg. Cab't put bat to the flick, and it hits the outside of his pad and rolls to short fine leg"

"short outside off, Amla uses his wrists to flay that to the left of backward point, down to the man at third man"

"slower ball on the pads, clipped away towards deep square leg"
"down the track comes Vijay, and Binny achieves a bit of outswing, making Vijay slice his attempted loft over mid-off high over point instead. Falls safely enough"

"slower bouncer, and Anil Chaudhary signals wide after Vijay just stands there and lets it balloon to the keeper"
"back of a length outside off, steered to deep point"

"tossed up on leg stump, and Amla whips it in the air, doesn't middle it, and it falls short of mid-on"
"shortish outside off, and Amla isn't too balanced as he tries to slap it away through point. Extra bounce beats him"
"back of a length, slides on to cramp Amla, who plays a short-arm jab to mid-on"
"a bit of flight onto leg stump. Vijay is too early into his sweep, he misses it, and it rolls off his pad towards short fine leg"
"short, just a bit of width, and Amla steps away to make just a bit more room to slice it up and over point"
"fired in quicker, angling down leg. Amla is late getting down to sweep, and it ricochets off his pad into the off side of the pitch. They set off for the leg bye, and Chahal gets to the ball quickly, spins around even quicker, and throws down the stumps at the non-striker's end. It's gone up to the third umpire, and it looks like Amla has juuust made it"
"shortish slower ball outside off, pulled away to the left of deep square leg"
"short outside off, and Amla stabs it away crisply, but too close to Head at backward point"
"short, Amla has to fetch the pull from a long way outside off, and he doesn't get any real power into it. Binny times his jump perfectly at midwicket, takes it with both hands over his head"
"back of a length on off stump, steered down to third man"
"length ball close to off stump, just a bit of away movement to beat Vijay's attempt at a cute steer to third man"
"back of a length, just a bit of width, and Vijay lets it come on and rolls his wrists over at the top of the bounce to split the gap between backward point and short third man"
"short outside off, and Saha chops it away nicely to the backward point boundary. A little too much width, and all Saha had to do was use the pace"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed to third man"
"back of a length, close to off stump, steered to backward point"
"bouncer, and Vijay leans away from the line of it"
"back of a length on leg stump, tucked away to deep square leg"
"shortish, close to off stump. Saha plays his favourite dab to third man again"
"tossed up on middle and off. No footwork from Saha, just pushes at it with his hands, and it turns and skews off the outside half of his bat through point"
"length ball on middle stump, and Vijay clips it quietly through square leg, and uses the long boundary on that side to pick up two"
"back of a length on leg stump, whipped away to the right of long-on"

"shortish outside off, Vijay is a little late on the pull, and ends up toe-ending it to mid-off"
"short again, angling into the batsman this time, and that is a superb shot, swivelled on his back leg to hook it over the backward square leg boundary"
"length ball on off stump. Vijay is a little early on the drive, and his bottom hand takes over as he ends up playing it down through mid-on rather than extra cover as intended"
"pressure on the bowler, boundary off the first ball of the over. Down the track, gets inside the line, and positions himself just right for the chip over extra cover"
"fullish on middle stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"down the track, clips this from outside off stump towards long-on"

"tossed up on leg stump, Vijay drags the sweep to short fine leg off the bottom edge"
"short outside off, pulled to the right of long-on"
"not that short outside off, but he goes back and stabs to point, and takes on Head's arm for the quick single. Throw at the bowler's end misses"
"short, wide, slapped to the left of sweeper cover"
"down the track, and has Rahul missed another stumping? Lovely flight, a bit of dip, and Saha ends up playing all around the ball as he looks to work it against the turn. Saha is a long way down the pitch, but Rahul doesn't catch cleanly. It hits his pad and he has to pick it up off the ground to complete the stumping. Saha turns around and stretches back into the crease, but it looks like the bails are off by the time he makes it. But the third umpire wants to see this again - the ball has bounced up off his pad and it's bounced down off the grille of his helmet. But he clarifies that since the ball hasn't bounced directly onto the stumps off the helmet, and that he picked it up with his glove in between, it's fine"
"gone! That is a beautiful delivery! This time Rahul makes no mistake. Angles it across Miller, outside off stump, and he comes forward and reaches out to drive. The ball doesn't turn as much as he expects, and it beats his outside edge and Rahul whips off the bails with Miller having dragged his back foot out of the crease"
"back of a length on middle stump, whipped away to deep midwicket"

"slower bouncer outside off, Vijay can't connect with the attempted lean-back-and-ramp-over-the-keeper"

"back of a length on middle stump, shows the full face to push down to long-on"
"fullish outside off, Vijay gets forward and whips to long-on to bring up his half-century"

"full on middle and leg, and Vijay has whipped that away brilliantly. Square leg had just come into the circle, and he puts it away to the right of the fielder"
"fullish wide of off, driven to sweeper cover"
"fullish, angling down leg. Plays for the turn, looking to whip into the leg side, but there is none, and it slides through and ricochets off the front pad into the off side"

"back of a length on off stump, makes a bit of room and eases it away towards deep point"
"full on off stump and he looks to shuffle across and whip it wide of square leg. Ends up hitting it straight to the fielder. Stoinis had run out of his crease, looking for the single, and a direct hit at his end would have found him well short"
"shortish slower ball on off stump, and Vijay makes room to scoop it into the gap to the left of long-off"
"low full-toss close to off stump, and Vijay makes room to slice it away to the right of a diving backward point fielder. Jordan, the sweeper, covers a lot of ground to his left, quickly, but ends up fumbling on the dive and pushing the ball onto the rope"
"slower ball, back of a length and fairly wide outside off. Vijay looks to steer it away through point, can't put bat to ball. He lets out an angry yell after he misses the ball"
quickish length ball on leg stump. Stoinis goes deep in his crease to whip towards deep square leg
"down the leg side again, and Vijay steps across and puts it away with a whip-pull to the left of short fine leg"
"back of a length googly, flicked away to deep midwicket"
down the track and he shortens his length. Just shows the full face to push to long-on

"slower short ball outside off, Stoinis can't connect with his cut"
"short outside off, pulled away to deep midwicket"
"full outside off, and Vijay lofts it over extra cover. Bounces down in the gap between sweeper cover and long-off. The former, true to his name, does the sweeping up"
"short outside off, Vijay looks to make room and slap it away. Can't put bat to ball. His weight was moving away from the ball as he played the shot"
"ooh, that was close. Sees Vijay making a bit of room and spears it wide of off - that seemed right over the tramline. Dharmasena doesn't signal wide"
"short ball gets the big wicket. Given the size of the square boundary, it's pretty difficult to drag the pull from wide of off stump, and he can only hit it as far as Chahal on the square leg boundary"
"short and wide, and Head has made a mess of this on the boundary. Slapped away fiercely to the right of backward point, and Head, running to his left on the boundary, can't make a routine diving stop, lets it slip under him. Pretty good first ball in the IPL for Behardien"
"full-toss on the stumps, shows the full face to push to long-on"
"low full-toss on middle stump, whipped to long-on"
"full-toss outside off, and Behardien punches it away to the right of the diving extra cover fielder. AB moves quickly to his left from long-off and cuts it off"

"shot! Full, angling into leg stump, and Stoinis steps across smartly, sinks down low, and uses the pace to scoop it over short fine leg"
"fullish, close to off stump, beats the bat as Behardien tries to loft that inside-out over the covers"
"bouncer, angling into the batsman and cramping him for room. Hooks weakly in the air, falls well short of deep square leg"

"slower bouncer, and Stoinis, leaning back, can't connect with the attempted ramp over the keeper"
"length ball on off stump, swiped down to long-on. Didn't middle it at all"
"yorker on middle stump, clears his front leg and drives to long-off. End of an excellent, possibly match-winning spell from Watson"
"full-toss on the pads, and he whips it away but too close to deep square leg. Chahal moved quickly to his right, too quickly, and almost overran the ball, had to stop and reach out against his momentum to stop the ball"
"full on leg stump, and that is smashed. Makes himself room and uses his hands and wrists brilliantly to drive that to the left of extra cover with a lot of power"
"down the track and this is a length ball, stays inside the line and lofts it over the long-off boundary, he's just cleared the rope. Phew!"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off. Stoinis was shaping to shuffle across and scoop. Changes his mind to stab through the off side, but by then it's too late. Beaten!"
"full-toss on off stump and he makes room to slap to the left of sweeper cover and pick up two. He didn't time it at all, and his top hand came off the handle, but he keeps strike"
"full-toss on off stump and all he can do is pull to deep midwicket and pick up two. That was quick, and he didn't have enough swinging room to get any power on the shot. Royal Challengers win by one run."
