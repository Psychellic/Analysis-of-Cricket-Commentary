"what a catch by Cooper! Short ball and he goes for the forehand (pull). He gets a top-edge and Cooper at mid-off is running sideways, not backwards, for a long time and just at the moment his teammates and the crowd believe the ball went a little too far from him he dives from running sideways and dives to his left. Though it seems like a fluid machine at work, describing it in words, the effort involved was exemplary and beats the catches by McCullum and Harris easily"
