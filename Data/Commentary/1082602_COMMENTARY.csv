"full and sliding into the pads, flicked to deep backward square leg"
"short and sliding down leg, Kohli swivels to help it on its way but couldn't get any bat on it. Exercise for the umpire"

"back of length outside off, gets this to nip away off the seam, Kohli shoulders arms"
works the length ball from outside off to midwicket
"gets the direction wrong. There's some movement in the air but he lands this outside leg, comes back in further to beat the flick. On the bounce to Parthiv"
"beauty! This one pitches at length on off and holds its line, Gayle is beaten on a feeble forward push"
"starts off with a short ball on middle, punched to short midwicket"

"slider that comes back in with the arm from wide of the crease, defended back down the pitch"
gets half-forward and dabs the ball away with an angled bat to slip
"fired full outside off, he gets forward and taps it gently to short cover. Superb over"

whips an incoming short of length delivery towards the man coming in from deep square. Even Gayle had no problems completing the second. Kohli called for it immediately
"picks the length early, swivels back and fetches the pull from outside off to the midwicket boundary. Imperious"
"he's been batting elsewhere for an hour or what? Walks across, gets underneath the half-volley and lets his wrists take over as he whips it wide of mid-on"
"slower and fuller on off stump, worked to the vacant midwicket region"
"floats this full and across Gayle, who lets it go. Rolls to Parthiv"
"back of length delivery on middle, whipped to deep square leg"
"plays down the wrong line as he looks to defend, rolls off a thick inside edge to square leg"

opens the bat face to dab the away-going length delivery to the point
looks to flay this over cover but couldn't get to the pitch of the delivery. The good length delivery also nipped away a wee bit to shave past the outside edge
"looks to duck first, then tries to use the pace and ramp it over the slips but missed. McClenaghan went up in an appeal but it was a very optimistic one"
short and he cuts that away between short third man and point. Enough time for him to rock back and hit that flat delivery. Too much width as well

"hits the deck hard at length, Gayle bunts to the off side."
"full and into the pads, worked to long-on"
"steps out to loft but Harbhajan gets this to dip on him nicely, jabs that away in the end. Beautiful from Harbhajan"
"drifting into middle and leg, looks to play a full-blooded sweep, ends up trying to paddle and get a pad on it, the deflection off the forearm beats short fine"
"this is nothing more than a mishit, but it has still carried all the way. Made his intention very clear even before the ball was delivered, Harbhajan still tossed it up and he went through with the shot. Southee was in business at long-on but it was all too brief"
"fired full on middle, blocked"
"sees him coming and bowls it full and flat, dabbed to the off side"

"too full outside off, squeezed to Rohit at the edge of the ring at cover, they pinch a run. Rohit didn't collect it cleanly"

bottom-edges a pull to Bumrah at fine leg. Looked to pull to deep square but this kept a touch low
"slower off-cutter outside off, runs it down to third man"
steps out and blasts this length ball to long-off on the bounce. Didn't get the elevation
nearly chopped on. Backed away to slap this through cover but the ball kept coming back in to take a thick inside edge onto the pad
"<b> dropped! </b> Tough chance. Could have been the third time Krunal dismissed AB. Looks to play a slog sweep, but doesn't get underneath the flight, goes though and skies it to long-on where Buttler first comes in, then goes back, then tries to move sideways alongside the trajectory and then puts it down."
opens the face of the bat to ease this towards deep point
works the incoming length delivery wide of midwicket
"once again the ball stops on him, all three stumps in view for Krunal as he looks to cut, but he nearly chops it between the keeper. Bumrah tries to back flick this to Pollard but slips and sees the ball trickle over"
makes room and eases it with the turn to sweeper cover
"angles a length ball on middle from wide of the crease, worked past the bowler"
"cramps him for room with a length ball on the stumps from wide of the crease, Kohli looks to whip this over long-on but can't generate enough power off the bottom hand, straight to the fielder"
"clean connection. Walks down the track and muscles the slow off-cutter over long-on. Picked the delivery off the hand immediately and then waited, held his shape and boom"
steps out and slaps the length ball to deep cover
thumped over long-off. Swatted that nonchalantly to bring up a half-century. Juicy full toss and he took full toll of that
delicate little dab. Plays this really late. Uses the pace to run this down fine. Parthiv had no chance despite the dive. Is this the momentum changer RCB needed desperately?

beaten by a slower one. Looks to back away and go inside-out but played too early
"taken on the second attempt. Flat hit off a back of length delivery to Buttler, who takes it at deep extra cover. Put down ABD, takes Kohli. Relief writ large on his face. Kohli timed it well but may have forgotten there was a fielder there, because he didn't try to clear the ropes."
"chips a full delivery on middle over the infield, down to long-on"
"floats this full and way outside off, AB leaves and Parthiv takes this on the bounce"
"angles a length ball across AB, who punches it to deep midwicket"
"drilled to mid-off but he completes the run easily. Anil Chaudhary wants the benefit of a replay. Didn't need to, though."
"backs away to cut, Krunal shortens his length and tucks him up for room, bunted to deep cover"
this is sensational from Rohit at the edge of the ring at cover.  <B> Third time in three innings that Krunal has dismissed AB. </B> AB backs away to go over cover but doesn't quite get to the pitch and looks to just chip it this time. Rohit anticipated the stroke and took a couple of steps to his left. Initially looked to go with both hands but realised the ball was swerving away and so he threw himself full stretch to pull off a one-handed stunner
"worked with the spin into the gap at midwicket, they hare back for the second"
"drifts away from the left-hander, punched to deep point"

"backs away to swing leg side but is cramped for room, flat-bats one back down the pitch"
"way over the head, Jadhav pulls to deep midwicket. Bumrah receives a warning. <B> Free-hit coming up </b>"
"this is stunning from Bumrah. Bowls a yorker on leg which Negi just manages to get bat on, Bumrah is extremely aware on his followthrough as he collects the ball, turns around and fires the stumps down at the bowler's end with Jadhav well short of the crease. He did it so casually that Jadhav was caught completely unaware for a second. By the time he moved, it was too late."
no feet movement. Looks to back away and smack that inside out over cover but played outside the line to get a thick inside edge back onto the middle stump. Golden duck for Mandeep. RCB on a freefall
uses the width to ease this over cover point to get off the mark
"fires this full and across Negi from around the stumps, Negi looks to carve this over cover but can't reach out"
"full toss outside off, steered to deep point, excellent throw from Buttler but the trajectory should have been flatter to make an impact"
"swung over the bowler's head, no timing whatsoever"
"angles a full ball across, Negi swings and misses"
"right into the blockhole, squeezed to the leg side, Bumrah hares across to where short mid-on would be to fire a throw to Parthiv, who looks to cheekily flick an underarm throw to run the batsman out at the striker's end. unfortunately no one to back up and they get an extra run. Three when there should have been just one"
"flicks a low full toss into the gap at deep midwicket, Buttler comes around to cut that off"
drilled into the wide long-on region where Southee comes up with a tag-team effort with Buttler
"full and straight on middle, squeezed to long-on"
"floats this full and wide outside off as he sees Binny making room but he walked away a little too much, couldn't reach the delivery"

"good length, flat at middle stump, defended back to the bowler off the back foot"

"short and wide, angled across Parthiv who reaches far away from the body to tap it to sweeper cover"
"good length, slight shape early, but it's straight by the time it lands. Flicked off middle stump to find deep square"
"short and wide outside off, keeps low and takes the under edge on his attempted cut, rolls through to the keeper"
"short outside off, this time he looks to pull on the up, toe-ends it to AB at mid-on"
"<b>chipped it straight to midwicket.</b> Gayle's at his best in the field when he has to make absolutely no movement. Buttler is generous to that. This one is floated harmlessly, full at his toes and he clips it straight to the big man"
"good length, angled in at off stump, a nervous poke from Rohit. Inside edge into the pitch. No feet there"
"full outside off stump, expansive drive, straight to mid-off"

<b>experiment fails.</b> They've looked to cash in on his bowling confidence and catch RCB on the surprise. But he has hit this low full toss at middle stump straight to long-on and Badree is on a hat-trick on his debut
"<b>he's got it!</b> Sneaks a googly through Rohit's defence and shatters the stumps. Third time this season that Rohit has fallen to the googly. Good length at off stump, big enough gap between bat and pad on his shaky forward defence, and the ball sneaks through"
"nearly walks past this ball. Pollard steps out, this is fired down the leg side and he just about gets pad on this"

"good length at middle stump, turns it into the leg side from shin height"
"tossed up at leg stump, gets to the pitch and hammers this to long-on's left"
"<b>finishes his spell with a wicket!</b> This is short at off stump, it's a wrong'un that climbs on him slightly and makes it awkward to play the cut. He goes for it anyway and slices it uppishly in front of Arvind who watches it closely into his hands as he dives forward to take it at backward point"
"back of a length at off stump, puts a stride across and taps it on the up to deep midwicket"
"good length at off stump, driven on the up to mid-off with some grace"

"this time Chahal follows him down the leg side. It's flatter and dipping rapidly and Pollard is not to the pitch. He looks to slot this over long-off, inside-out, but skies it. De Villiers runs in from long-off, adjusts after watching the ball swerve and takes the few steps backwards he needs to pouch this cleanly. Good catch"

"tossed up outside off, gets to the pitch and flicks to deep midwicket"
