"begins with a length delivery, fended off and Pakistan are off the mark"
"beauty to Abid, moving away from the right-hander, only just beats his outside edge"
"wider outside the off stump this time, batsman lets it go"
"tried to leave that, but gets his bat on it just before he drew it away"
"flicked off the pads, Shan was perhaps a little too offside to that delivery. Anyhow, it evades a diving Buttler and there's the first boundary. Leg byes, mind you"
leaves that well alone
"middle stump line to start off, Abid solidly defends"
"lovely, that, nips away off the seam, much too good for Abid to be able to do anything but hope he misses it"
"wider outside off, and swinging away. Abid shoulders arms"
"operating around a sixth stump line, Abid not interested"
"this one zips back in, hits him high up on the pads. Decent first over from Broad so far"
"wide again, and left alone. Maiden"
"hits him on the pads. <strong>Big appeal</strong> from England. Root may fancy a review here, looked quite high, though. They wisely decide not to burn one"
"this is closer, <strong>gone</strong>! Pitched in line, and was coming back in. Shan needed to get his bat in the way of that, and the moment he didn't, that was it. Doesn't even consider reviewing. Brilliant start for England"
leaves it outside off. Azhar needs runs here. Badly
nice line from Anderson. Starts it around middle and leg and moves it away. Azhar defends back to the bowler
driven to mid-on
"short delivery, Azhar tried to leave that, but it goes off on the bat on the bounce to slips"
"back of a length, blocked"
"good ball, that. Closer to the off stump, compelling the batsman to try and play. Beats both edge and stump"
"<strong>dropped!</strong> That was a nice, catchable height around second and third slip. Sibley's the one who put it down at third, but it appears the slips are too tight together"
solidly blocked
"thick outside edge, goes along the ground to gully"
shoulders arms to that
"off-stump line, Abid defends"
"good shot, looser delivery from Anderson. Pitches it up a bit too much. Becomes a half-volley, and Abid is able to pounce on it. Gets right to the pitch, negates the swing"
hits him up him on the pad. Muffled appeal. <strong>England on top here</strong>
"shorter length, pushed Abid on the back foot"
smacks him on the pad again. A little too short to bring lbw into play
"squared him up, but he manages to get bat to it"
"wide outside off, left alone"
"nipping back into the batsman. Azhar tries to flick it to the onside, hit on the pad again"
"brilliant. Held its line outside off stump, the batsman half-heartedly tried to push at it, gets beaten"
"seaming away from the outside edge again, Azhar was lulled into playing at that when he didn't really need to"
"gets off the mark finally. Fuller and straight, and Azhar works it through midwicket and comes back for a couple. Not without its risks, that shot, for that gap it leaves between bat and pad"
"too full, and driven down the ground. Timing not the best, but enough for the pair to come back for another couple"
"driven nicely down the ground. Mid-on has work to do, and they're back for two more"
thick inside edge sees the ball squeezed down to square leg
"shaping away from the bat this time, edged to gully"
"stump-to-stump from the bowler, Azhar gets in line and blocks it back."
"squares him up again, but Azhar manages to defend"
good leave outside off
"shorter length from broad on that occasion, Abid pushed back"
"angled into the stump, batsman gets in line and fends to midwicket"
that looked like it was shaping back in. Abid was alert to the threat
"wobbling down the legside, appeared to hit pad but continued to swing after leaving the batsman at any rate. Byes given"
"lovely comeback, starts it around off stump and it moves away from the bat. All you can do is hope you miss these kinds of deliveries"
"defended to short leg. Another trying over, but these two are hanging on so far"
clipped away smartly to square leg. Anderson a bit top straight with his line
gets in line behind it and blocks
"shaping away dangerously, but wide enough outside off for Abid to keep himself rom poking at it"
left alone
"excellent from Anderson. Goes wider of the crease, angles it into the stumps and gets it to shape away. Such glorious control"
"no movement on that one, and he can block it back"
"plants his front foot and sets off for a quick single after a tap into the offside. Broad continuing, despite looking like he needed an inhaler last over"
"only just missed the bat there, Abid was late to get his bat out of the way. That's happened a couple of times, wouldn't be surprised if that kind of shot gets a wicket"
"straighter into the stumps, defended"
"shorter this time, catches him high on the pad"
"oooh, lucky to get an inside edge there, that was clattering into either pads or stumps. Found himself stuck at the crease a bit there"
defended to short leg
"Curran into the attack, moves it in from over the wicket, worked away to square leg"
driven to mid-on and they scamper through for another one
"pushes him back, defended"
"holding a good line around middle and leg this first over. A bit of movement, but nothing too extravagant so far"
defended to mid-on
shaping the other way this time. Good first over
"Woakes begins by moving it away from Azhar, who angles it down to backward point"
"whew, what happened there? Hit him on the pads, and appeared to trickle back and hit the stumps. It doesn't disturb the bails, though and he survives. England were celebrating there for a moment. Fortune cuts Pakistan's way"
"extravagant swing, bit always going well wide of off stump"
"thick edge down to square leg, and Azhar is off strike"
"too full on that occasion, and Abid drives it through the covers. Again, however, there's no momentum behind that shot, and it only rolls away for a couple"
"flicked away for four. Strayed too wide down leg side, and all Abid had to do was get a little tickle on to that one"
back of a length and worked away through midwicket
back foot push to mid-on
"<strong>nearly knocked Azhar off his feet</strong>. Full and swinging back into him, and it was touch and go there for a while. Azhar just about got his bat down in time"
driven nicely to mid-off. Are they finally getting a bit more comfortable?
"good bowling, targeting the stumps, and Azhar has to get himself back in line and defend"
shoulders arms. Another testing over
"strays down legside again. Woakes is looking for that magic delivery that swings sharply and brings off stump into the game. For now, however, it brings fine leg into the game, and Abid has another four."
"<strong>another drop</strong> in the slips! There really was no excuse this time. Nice height to Burns at second slip, no confusion between the slip fielders, but he shells it"
"down legside again, Woakes isn't getting this right at the moment. Not much swing on offer when he starts deliveries around that line"
"better. Just outside off stump, and it wobbles slight as it gets to Azhar, who lets it go"
"lazy poke at that, didn't need to play that. gets away with it, though"
"back of a length, defended. It's 41-1 at the drinks interval. Pakistan will be quietly pleased they have't lost more wickets. Alan comes back in, and you can express all your grievances and Fawad Alam stats for his benefit.See you soon!"
"over the wicket, 81mph/130kph and slightly short of a length, defended from the crease"
"angled across, 82mph/132kph and met with a solid front-foot push into the off side"
"shaping in, catches Abid on the crease and strikes high up on the back leg... Too high to think about lbw"
"fuller, 84mph/135kph on the pads and flicked fine"
"full length and shaping in, Azhar squeezes it into the leg side for a quick single"
"full outside off, wobbling in and away, tickled towards mid-off coming forward"
"length outside off, 80mph/129kph, climbing through in the channel, no stroke"
"pitched up on the stumps, 84mph and punched towards mid-on half forwards"
"length delivery holding its line outside off, Azhar comes across and lets it go"
fired in and tapped to the leg side coming across
"good length, 79mph/127kph in the corridor, Azhar continues to watch closely and let plenty go"
"touch fuller, curving away but the line was wide to start with, Azhar shuffles into line and leaves it be"
touch short and flicked of the hip fine
"good length on the stumps, dabbed down into the on side... loud call of 'No! No! No!'"
"fullish and angled across on off stump, steered towards cover point"
"pitched up, 83mph/134kph and driven towards mid-off, half-forward and without timing"
"<b>edged but short!</b> Curran gets the line right, snatches a snick as Azhar prods on off... but it bounces well in front of Root at first slip! More frustration for England's seamers"
"on the stumps, tucked to the leg side"
"this skips off a length, climbing past the shoulder of the bat with Abid playing back"
"shorter, 82mph/132kph and Abid tucks down to the leg side"
"uff, <b>hits him right in the plums!</b> Abid is down on his front, praying that his box has done its job... That has nibbled from a length (ooh err) and smacked him in the baby-maker. Going to need a moment here"
"short ball to follow up, Abid is up on his toes and defends to leg"
"length ball, 82mph/132kph and angling in, aiming for either to top of off or Abid's, ahem, middle stump... defended solidly"
"gets a touch straight, 85mph/137kph and clipped through backward square for one"
"trundles in from over the wicket, drops short and Abid is back on his stumps to defend"
"length ball, defended shuffling across"
tight lines from Curran and Abid taps it back
"pitched up, 82mph/132kph and whipped leg side, picks a big gap between mid-on and midwicket for a few more to the Pakistan total"
"good length, 83mph and pulling Azhar forward around off stump, pushed into the covers"
fired in on the pads and nudged behind square on the leg side
"short of a length and tucked off the hip playing back, <b>brings up the Pakistan 50</b>"
"length ball, 83mph/134kph and holding its line outside off, Abid lets it go"
"slightly wide on the crease, pushed in and looking for outswing, met with a neat dab in front of point for a stolen single"
"wide and fired in on the stumps, 85mph/137kph and jabbed to leg"
"length on off, comes across and covers the line"
"woof, <b>beauty from Woakes</b>, shaping away late as Azhar feels for it! Had that one on a string"
slides on to the pads first ball and Abid tucks it away square
"length ball, 82mph/132kph and straightening a fraction, pushed back down the track"
"full outside off, driven without timing towards backward point"
"<b>crunched through point!</b> Just a fraction short from Anderson, coming back in but Azhar stands tall and sends a rasping back-foot drive through the off side, just enough to outrun Pope"
"shortish on the stumps, 82mph and tapped down into the leg side"
"length delivery in the channel, 86mph/138kph and Azhar lets this one go"
on the stumps and worked to the leg side
"strays on to the pads again and Abid flicks him fine, picks up a couple as Curran has to run around"
"full on the stumps, 84mph/135kph and nudged to the right of mid-on, Anderson executes a decent pick-up and throw... but Aid was home"
"full length, 86mph/138kph and squirted through the covers half-forward, gets another brace of runs"
"angled in back of a length, clipped off the hip"
"short and rising quickly in the channel, nipping off the seam as the batsman momentarily felt for it"
"back of a length over off stump, Azhar closes the face and works to midwicket"
"shortish and entices a cut, 87mph/139kph and zipping through past the bat, bit loose from Azhar as he plays and misses"
"pitched up on middle and off, defended"
"full and he's across to cover the line, blocked into the covers"
"short of a length, 83mph/134kph and Azhar again dangles his bat in the wind to be beaten"
"fullish length on off, 86mph and met with a push into the covers"
"nipping back from a length, Abid was attempting to play inside the line... <b>edged firmly towards the cordon</b>, goes to second slip on the bounce! Pakistan continue to flirt with England here"
pitched up and met with a solid prod into the covers
"fullish, fourth-stump line and blocked once more"
"length, wobbling in the channel, this time he withdraws the bat completely inside the line"
"starts off with a nice one, just beating the outside edge. Carries on where he left off"
"wider outside, shaping away. Batsman allows it to go past"
"wide outside off, 137 kph. Allowed to go through to Buttler"
"straighter line, Azhar tried to clip it through midwicket, no real timing though"
"held its line just outside off, watchfully left"
"a little too straight, allows Azhar to flick it to the midwicket fielder"
defended through the onside. Less movement this over than it looked like Broad might get
"lured into an extravagant drive. Movement there for once, and it probably saves Azhar. Just whooshes past the putside edge. Some of the fielders were interested, but he survives"
dead-batted. Seems <strong>there was a spike</strong> on UltraEdge on that last delivery. Azhar may have escaped one.
"Broad back at it with that nagging line. Gets it to rear off a length, good bounce through to the keeper. Abid's outside edge is beaten"
thick outside edge this time. Played with soft hands and it goes through the vacant gully region for a boundary
"clipped through the onside. They thought about two, but thought better of it"
"angled in, but the batsman watches it past his bat and through to the keeper"
"good block to end the over. Another probing one by Broad, no luck"
"wicket-to-wicket, Anderson's pace is up. That was 142 kph. Good work from the old man into his second spell"
pushed him onto the back foot. Abid tried to punch it through the covers. <strong>You sense there's an edge coming</strong>
"wider and shorter, this time Abid wants nothing to do with it"
"thick outside edge, but Abid has learned to play with gentle hands. It's not going to carry to the slips even if there was a man stationed there. There wasn't, so he picks up another boundary. Frustrating for England"
defended straight back this time
"wide and shaping away, batsman shoulders arms"
that was a brave leave. Looked like off stump might be in play for a moment
swings after it's left the bat. Buttler has to scramble to ensure it doesn't run down for four byes. He's had another testing little morning
"goes wider off the crease, but it isn't angling in enough for Azhar to feel compelled to play that"
"fifth stump line, left alone again. This must become frustrating at some point"
better delivery. Seams back into Azhar and hits him on the thigh pad. Much too high for any real interest
"planted his front foot, looked like he might be in trouble with the front pad. Just about got an inside edge to save his (halal) bacon"
"hung his bat out a tad too long, pulls it back in again before it swished past the edge"
"seamed away extravagantly, well away from the outside edge"
"back of a length, Abid gets in line and blocks it to mid-on"
"targeting the stumps, blocked. Anderson looks like he's got a plan up his sleeve for Abid this over"
"well, it'll have to wait because he's got himself off strike. Worked away to the onside and they scamper through"
punched back down the ground. Tight over from Anderson
"short of a length, blocked off the back foot"
"good delivery, moving away from off stump. Had to play at it, does a good job of it"
"genuine edge, Abid flashed at that one. There was no third slip; it might have carried had there been one. Trickles away for four"
"angling down leg side, flicks Abid on the pad"
"short, down legside slightly. Batsman managed to get abid of glove on that, and out of nowhere, <strong>Abid is one run from a half-century</strong>"
"driven to mid-on, and that's the over"
"a bit too full, and Azhar tries to beat square leg with a smart clip. Finds the fielder though"
"gets good bounce there, 138kph again. He's bending his back, wonder what Jofra might make of that..."
"defended to the covers, shouts of 'no run!'"
"thick edge, but he's not driving hard at these, so it doesn't carry"
"<strong>finally, Pakistan's luck runs out!</strong> Can't argue England didn't deserve this. Chipping away at the edge all afternoon, and Azhar finally gets a hefty edge that loops up for the slips. For a change, Burns actually holds on to it, and the Pakistan captain's woes continue"
"drives to extra cover, and spry as ever, he's off the mark"
"gets in line and dead-bats it. Heavy thunder, groundstaff look poised."
"outside off stump, and Babar tries to drive it through the covers. Not dissimilar to the way he got out in both innings at Old Trafford. Couldn't hurt to be a bit more circumspect early on"
"what do I know? Attempts the same and this time gets it through. There was a huge chase on for Woakes, who's done well to save a run"
"blocked. Abid may want to get his half-century done before the rain comes, if indeed it does"
driven back to the bowler
"driven back, and it's begun to rain, according to George, our man at the venue"
"squared him up, but Babar managed to get bat on that"
"exquisite, that. Too good even for Babar, who's fortunate this whizzes past his outside edge"
"brings it back into him, forcing him to defend to the on side"
"the pace is still up, impressively. 138 kph, and Babar defends"
"copy and paste. Awkward little session for Pakistan, they'd hate to lose another wicket if rain is around the corner"
"clipped away to cow corner. Anderson wavered with his line, too straight there. Babar gets three and keeps the strike"
starts off with a loosener. Well outside off and Babar won't have anything to do with it
"better line, and some sideways movement. Babar sees it go past. The groundsman still very alert"
"angled in, targeting the pads. Babar drives it back to him"
"nicely punched to point, where Dom Bess manages to cut it off. Might we see him soon? Not if the ball continues to move like it has"
"solid back foot defence, and the <strong>umpire's have seen enough</strong>. The rain has begun to intensify, and we're going off"
"Curran completes his over with a fullish ball on off, Azam defends"
"<b>edged through the cordon, that's his fifty!</b> Little bit streaky, Anderson nibbling it away as he pushed forward, but played softly and the ball landed well short, between second and third slips and scuttling away. Abid raises his bat, been a dogged effort from him"
"angled in straighter, 85mph/137kph and worked to leg, 'Noooo!' the cry"
pitched up and defended coming forwards
"length outside off, 84mph and straightening a little, blocked towards cover"
fullish and punched towards mid-on coming across
"ooh, bit flirty from Abid again, short and wide enough to leave but he had a dabble, without success"
"pitched up and swinging a touch, blocked square on the off side"
"tight lines from Curran, 83mph/134kph and Babar is forward again, bat tucked up against the front pad"
touch back of a length and worked into the leg side for a couple
"full length, driven back to the bowler, Curran snaps it up in his follow through"
"length ball, Azam comes across"
"touch short on off, tapped down into the covers"
"not completely in control, bit of a slash at one outside off, bottom hand comes off but he gets a couple through cover"
"pitched up, 86mph/138kph outside off, skimming through as Abid gets forward and shoulders arms"
"back of a length, this bounces a bit more on Abid as he fends it away behind square on the leg side"
"length in the channel outside off, left alone"
"probing away outside off, again Azam is across and lets it go"
"<b>magnificent wristwork from Babar</b>, whipped away through midwicket! Not a bad ball by any means but he was quickly up on his toes, closes the face and belts four"
"strays on to the pads, <b>Abid helps himself to fine leg!</b> Poor delivery from Curran and he gets dispatched to the rope... <b>That's the Pakistan 100 up</b>"
"length ball, 83mph/134kph and pushed back down the track"
"on the stumps, swinging back but the length allows Abid to stay back and flick through square leg for a couple more"
"edged to slip, <b>taken this time!</b> Excellent line from Curran, maybe got this one to dart away after shaping in, Abid hasn't been watertight in that channel - as the control percentage dictates - and he finally pays with his wicket. Thick edge as the ball skipped up and hit the shoulder of the bat, Burns gobbles up the chance"
"beautiful line, drifting it across and past the outside edge as Shafiq feels for it"
fullish length around off stump and this time he gets bat on ball in defence
"fullish and drawing Babar out, a ball looking for some scandal... <i>whispers</i> through past the outside edge with the batsman committed"
prodded into the covers coming forwards
"86mph/138kph around the line of off, shows it a straight bat"
"<b>another seductive line from Anderson</b>, pulls Azam across and into a false poke in the channel... Missed it by an inch or two"
"back of a length, 85mph/137kph and finds the edge but Azam keeps it down, squeezed through gully for a couple as Pope gives chase"
"touch shorter, some width on offer and Azam throws the bat at an attempted cut, fails to connect. Bit leaden-footed, that shot"
"length ball from over the wicket, defended from the crease"
gets a stride in and pushes into the covers
"fullish, shaping back in on the stumps, Shafiq tucks it into the leg side"
"good length, chopped down into the off side, Shafiq sets off but is quickly sent back by his partner"
"length on the stumps, 83mph/134kph and Shafiq defends this time"
"tight around off stump, lines it up and blocks back towards the bowler"
"full outside off and Azam frees the arms to drive, meatily struck but Anderson leaps across to his left at mid-on to cut it off"
"in the channel coming back at him, rising on its way through to Buttler as the batsman leaves"
"corridor-bothering line from Broad, again Azam lets this go"
"<b>cracking ball</b>, jagging away past the outside edge! Babar played at that one, only for the ball to seam and then swing sharply, Buttler needed two attempts to cling on - but no bat involved"
"fired down the leg side, Buttler gives across to take"
"length ball, 87mph/139kph but gets a little too straight and this is whipped through backward square for a couple"
"short of a length, kicks up and Shafiq takes it on the gloves as he works to leg... off the mark with that single behind square"
"full length, shaping in but the line is quite straight and Azam flicks it fine for a couple"
"bouncer from Curran, 84mph and well over the crouching batsman"
"goes fuller again, 82mph/132kph and clipped off the pads through backward square leg"
"slightly short and leg side, skidding on to hit the thigh pad as Shafiq works to leg, deflected past Buttler for a few"
"fullish, 84mph/136kph and shaping away outside off stump, Babar leaves"
"full on the pads and whipped away, <b>lovely timing from Shafiq</b>... just a clip but right out of the middle and it races to the midwicket boundary marker"
"full outside off this time, 84mph/135kph and driven, sliced a touch and it skims low towards backward point"
"length ball, holds its line, <b>steered to third slip!</b> Sibley takes a low catch, again making up for his earlier error, and England have another! Bit soft really, from Shafiq, dragged forward by one that was probably wide enough to leave... just a limp push and a thick edge, and Broad is on the board"
"shuffles side on as Broad delivers from round the wicket, tapped away defensively"
"good length in the channel, again he's into position and lets it go"
"<b>cuts through him this time</b>, Alam is crabbily across and then jabs at the ball unsuccessfully as Broad nips it away off the pitch!"
"curling away in the channel, lavish swing for Woakes, but Babar watches it well and leaves"
"length ball, straightening around fourth/fifth stump, judged well and left again"
"shortish, 81mph/130kph and he cuts without timing in front of square"
"shortish and whipped away off the hip, Azam times it neatly in front of the man at fine leg"
"struck on the pads, Alam tangled up trying to defend.... did it pitch in line? Kettleborough doesn't think so but England <b>review</b>; it was definitely straight, so whether it landed on leg stump is the question. DRS says yes, Alam's long wait ends in a four-ball duck! Smashing the top of middle stump, according to Hawk-Eye. Quacker-jack ball to the crabby Alam, who shuffles off to the dressing room"
"fullish length and swinging, defended softly half forward"
deflected behind square on the leg side
"pitched up outside off, Rizwan feels for it, the bat a little out in front of him, inside-edged to leg"
"full and straight, pinged back down the ground, crisply struck bit it holds up towards long-on"
"good length, 84mph/135kph and threatening to come back, watches it closely and leaves"
"back of a length, good carry from Broad and there's a wafty jab off the back foot from Azam... not far away from the edge"
stabbed into the covers coming across
"fired in on the stumps, worked to leg for a quick single"
"good length in the corridor, left alone"
"flung full down the leg side, Azam stands in the crease and deflects a single towards fine leg"
"tricksy line, hits the seam and bends it away as Rizwan pokes flat-footed and is beaten"
"shaping away from Rizwan on a length, he defends to the offside"
"short ball, reared up, and Rizwan, not the tallest, gets his head out of the way"
"tailing away down the leg side, fended off by Babar. Perfect conditions for Anderson to be bowling in"
nice sideways movement. Starts around middle and leg and shaping towards off. Defended
"length ball, Babar blocks it back"
"similar delivery, this tome Babar blocks and runs. Sharp thinking, that, and Anderson is now Rizwan's problem"
"held its line outside off, and the batsman gratefully watches it go past"
"wide, Rizwan thought it there to be driven, but withdrew his bat at the last moment"
"seams away, Babar shoulders arms"
"that is silky. Slightly shorter, and Babar rocks back and smartly clips it through midwicket. Looked effortless"
"decent comeback delivery, fuller on this occasion, 132kph. Dead-batted"
"slightly short from Woakes, allowing Babar to step back and defend to the offside"
"late movement, late enough for it to be a problem for Buttler rather than Babar. He does well enough with a dive to his right"
"straighter again, and Babar flicks it through the legside again. A chase on for the fielder, and they get two on this occasion. Good batting from Babar"
"wide of off again. The pace from Anderson is good, though. That was 138, a speed he's maintained"
"back of a length, cramped Babar for room slightly"
"moved across to try and ease him through midwicket again. Didn't quite get it where he wanted, and decides against running"
"nicely timed rive, but straight to mid-on"
"well wide. Lured Babar into trying to crunch it through backward point. Would have been very frustrated to get a nick on that, ends up missing it"
good ball to finish off. Pitched around off stump and seaming away ever so slightly. Batsman happy to be beaten there
"pokes it through gully, who manages it to cut it off before it goes to the boundary"
"full on this occasion, blocked"
"better length from Woakes. Always moving away, though, and that allows Babar to let it go"
"little clip to the onside, and a bit of sharp running sees the pair swap ends"
"that one came back in. Rizwan moved across to tackle it, but ended up deciding to leave even as it moved back"
"<strong>much too good</strong>, much too good. Full and the batsman was tempted into an extravagant looking straight drive. Missing the outside edge by the slenderest of margins."
"flicked through midwicket, Babar is getting joy in that area. Whenever England go too straight and full, Babar has found a way to punish them"
"stump-to-stump, blocked"
"wider line, and the <strong>pace is up to 141kph</strong>"
"shorter from Anderson, and he tried to punch it through  extra cover. Played down the wrong line, and ends up beaten"
"tight off stump line, solidly blocked. Pace up to 142. This is fairly impressive from Anderson"
similar line. Decent over apart from that clipped four
"plants the front foot and drives straight again. Gets bat on it this time, thought timing isn't the best"
"good line and length, and the ball shaping away threatening the outside edge. Defended to the offside"
"good sideways shape on the ball, but it only appears to move that much when he starts it outside off. As such, the batsman needn't play at them"
"<strong>goes wider</strong> of the crease to change the angle, luring RIzwan into playing. Wily stuff from Woakes. nearly worked, too"
"this time Rizwan is wise to the plan, and was prepared to leave as soon as he picked up the line"
"good-looking drive, straight to Woakes though. Engaging over"
"that one came back in, but not enough to tempt Babar into playing"
"wobbled outside off stump, quicker on this occasion, 88mph. Babar lets it go"
wide again. Anderson might just be setting him up. Watch out for something special
"slightly shorter, but the same line. Unless he's got a plan, this won't worry Babar too much"
"at least this one was in the line of the stumps, but it didn't look like doing much. Babar flicks to the onside"
tame over. Maiden but was never going to get Babar out with that line.
"wider of the crease again, shaping away enough for Rizwan to confidently leave"
"strays down legside, and glanced off the pads"
"short of a length, defended from Babar. Woakes is trying to work out a way to target both off stump and outside edge"
"good line. Just wobbled outside off stump, but defended through cover"
"<strong>beauty</strong> Too good for Babar, and that's saying something. Landed around off and moved away sharply. Forced to try and play it, but relieved, I'm sure, not to get an edge"
"the shorter ball is pulled away, and he keeps the strike"
"Curran is in to the attack and begins with one that moves in to the pads, as you'd expect"
"swings it from a bit too straight, and flicked off the hips, allowing them to pick up a couple"
"swings back in nicely, driven down the ground"
"shaping back into him again, Rizwan solid in defence off the back foot"
"thick inside edge through to midwicket. They pondered exchanging ends, but it was never really on"
"disappointed to miss out. Juicy half-volley, there to be crunched through extra cover. Clatters it straight to mid-off, though"
strays down the legside.
"this one's too wide outside off. A loose start from Broad so far, but once he;s warmed up, should be a threat"
wide down leg once more
back of a length and tucked away down to fine leg for one
"that looked like it reared up slightly off a length. Hit the top of Rizwan's bat, but he kept it down"
wider outside off. A bit of a harmless over to start with
"pushes him back on his crease, solidly defended"
"swings from leg stump, which Babar easily tucks down to fine leg again. Needs to go a little wider, though it may not swing from there"
"short ball, well down legside. Rizwan tried, somewhat surprisingly, to hoick it down to fine leg. Best left well alone, those"
"that's what he should be trying to do. Shapes it in and lands the ball around off stump, always moving in. That's his stock ball"
angles one across this time. ALways a threat if he can get one going the other way. Batsman shoulders arms
"chasing the one that moves away again, Rizwan drives to cover"
"probing line from Broad. Hasn't quite found the swing yet, but the pace is up to 84mph now"
"coming back in but landed it too wide of off, allowing Babar to leave"
"wider outside off, Babar will leave those all day long"
"much better. That one nipped back, but he  needs the ball to move earlier, and from straighter on teh crease, for it to worry the batsman"
"short, just outside off, Babar prods it to gully"
"nips it in again, but Babar watchfully leaves. Better over"
defended to the offside
"nipping it back in, and a thick inside edge lets them come across for a single"
"good shape on that ball, angling away from the batsman. Babar lets it past"
"short, feisty from Curran. Pace up to 82mph, too. Babar ducks beneath"
"defended, it rose high in the air on the bounce, and Babar moved over to ensure the ball wouldn't drop onto his stumps"
slower one to finish off. Decent back foot defence
holds its line outside off. The pace rises to 85mph
far too straight. He went wide of the crease but couldn;t find the movement he was looking for. Flicked away to square leg
"driven down the ground. Broad got a finger on it and it went back to clip the bails. Rizwan was well inside his crease, though"
"bouncer. Not much quicker than Curran's though, mind you, at only 83mph. Babar gives it enough respect to go under, though"
"seamed back in sharply, but started off too far out wide"
too wide. This is fairly ordinary from Broad
"goes around the wicket, guided down to fine leg"
"kept ever so slightly low. Babar digs it out, though"
"a tad too straight, and Babar is onto it with that midwicket clip once more. Picks up a couple"
"a half-volley, Babar looks peeved at missing out. Smacks it straight to cover-point"
"chipped down to cow corner, and Babar comes back for another two"
"glanced down to fine leg, and that's <strong>lunch</strong>. Pakistan will consider this session a win. Only 29 runs, but they've lost no further wickets in conditions that looked very promising for England. We should be back in 35 minutes or so, and Alan will be around to guide you through it all."
"starts full and wide, 81mph/130kph and swinging out of the hand, Azam is forward and then watches it through"
"better line, drawn forward and the bottom hand takes over as he <b>tries to drive and is beaten</b>... though Buttler doesn't take it cleanly behind the stumps"
"fullish length, 81mph outside off, lets this one buzz through"
"booming outswinger from Broad, on a length and curling away ostentatiously as Babar sits back and lets it go"
"touch shorter, 83mph/134kph and again he's across to shoudler arms"
"pitched up, this one is angling in towards the stumps and he clips calmly through midwicket to keep the strike"
"length outside off, comes across and leaves... looks like Anderson has overstepped here, called retrospectively. Maybe that <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/21781364/james-anderson-rare-overstep-sums-england-day>reputation for never bowling them</a> wasn't quite so deserved"
"pitched up on fourth stump, big clunky connection as he comes forward to drive into the covers"
"touch short of a length, 83mph/132kph and defended from the crease"
tapped into the covers coming across
"in the channel, 84mph and he comes across to leave again"
fired in straighter at 86mph/138kph and Azam works it through square leg
"zipping through from a length outside off stump, Rizwan watches it through with those smouldering filmstar eyes"
"back of a length, left alone in the channel"
"Broad does go straighter with his line, drifting down the leg side as Azam comes across"
"length on the stumps, 83mph/135khp and he shows it a straight bat"
"teasing line, <b>Babar nicks one!</b> Broad breaks the resistance after almost 20 overs of toil between wickets... It's the regulation fourth-stump seamer that does it, beautiful line if a <i>fraction</i> short; looked for a second like it might have flicked the pocket of his back leg, but he knew there was bat involved and heads for the exit"
"length in the channel, nibbling away as Yasir aims a booming drive and fails to connect"
"fuller on off, 85mph/137kph and he's forward to defend this time"
"yoinks, <b>that's gone like a rocket</b>, extra bounce in the channel as Rizwan starts to play and then thinks better of it!"
"back of a length, nibbling in and defended playing back"
line and length and prodded back defensively on off
"full and a little too straight, Rizwan clips neatly off his front pad through midwicket for two"
shortish and pushed down the leg side as he moves across
length delivery steered towards point from in front of off stump
"pitched up, Yasir starts to close the face and gets a low leading edge"
"shorter, on the body, 81mph/130kph and he jabs off the back foot, deflected behind square for one"
"<b>dropped!</b> Although that's hard on Buttler... Top-edged on the pull, heading leg side and he flung himself bodily to his left, got glove-tips on the ball, <b>couldn't quite cling on!</b> Would have been a screamer if he'd managed to wrap the mitts around it"
"length ball, skidding into the pads with Rizwan on the crease... probably a touch high"
full on the stumps and this is clipped wristily through square leg for one
"short of a length, on the hip and tucked down leg side"
"<b>slices and dices him</b>, whistling through past the inside edge! Bit of an ambitious shot from Rizwan, trying to carve through the covers on the up, done by the nip-backer"
pitched up and squeezed away into the leg side
"top of off, 86mph/138kph and Yasir blocks steadfastly to the leg side"
"shaping away, length ball and Yasir is caught on the crease as it zips through past his groping bat"
short of a length on the stumps and nudged down square into the leg side
"length around off and Rizwan dabs it towards point, sets off for one... but Yasir wasn't moving"
"short of a length, comes across and steers towards backward point"
"floaty full ball outside off, 83mph/134kph and draws Yasir into a full-blooded mow, fails to connect"
"shot! <b>Smeared through point</b>, Yasir gets this one out of the screws, nailing a half-volley to the fence!"
"<b>beauty in response</b>, coming back and rising like steam past the shoulder of the bat as he propped forward... there was an appeal from behind the stumps, but Broad didn't seem too interested, which tells you plenty"
"length ball, tries to withdraw the bat, deflected into the ground towards the slips"
"<b>past the outside edge again!</b> Luck with Yasir on this occasion, just as it had deserted Babar, as he pushed hard at one that decked away and into the keeper's gloves"
"shortish, 84mph/135kph and pulled wide of mid-on, they'll take the single"
jumps back and defends around off stump
"pitched up, chewed up, <b>gobbled up!</b> Yasir again throws the kitchen sink at a full ball in the channel, but only manages to gurgle an outside edge through to Buttler! Classic outswinger and Yasir bites, another one on the reel for Anderson"
shortish and down the leg side as the gangling Afridi comes across
"pitched up, 84mph on off stump and defended watchfully pressing forwards"
"length ball, draws himself up in front of the stumps and blocks from the crease"
"back of a length outside off, fenced down into the point region"
"short ball, down the leg side as he swings at a pull and fails to get near it"
fended away square on the leg side
"curling away, good length but bounces through very low as Afridi tucks his bat in"
"length outside off, 85mph/137kph and poked towards point"
"pitched up in the channel and Afridi gets those long legs moving, big stride and defended into the covers"
"short ball, Rizwan clouts a pull through square leg to the sweeper, takes the single"
"pushed across from over the wicket, 86mph/138kph and shaping away, lets it go"
"full, skidding through wide of the stumps"
"fullish length outside off, shaping away as Afridi starts to push forward"
"drags his length back, Afridi hangs back and squares up in defence as the ball zips through outside off"
"short of a length on the stumps, 85mph/137kph and defended to the leg side"
fullish and swinging down the leg side
"full on leg stump, 76mph and Rizwan clips is square for a single to bring Shaheen down the danger end"
"stays over the wicket, good length in the channel and skipping through"
"pitched up, 80mph/129kph and nibbling away appreciably as Afridi has a little dabble"
"length ball, straightening on the stumps and prodded back"
"length ball, shaping away outside off as Afridi starts to play and then diligently holds his bat inside the line"
"nipping back, short of a length and cracks Rizwan a nasty blow on the hip"
length and defended coming across on off
"short ball, 80mph/129kph and he swings a pull away, wide of fine leg but they won't get back for two on Curran's throw"
"testing line outside off, Afridi is just happy to see those whistle through as he camps in the crease"
"fuller, has a proper flirt at this, leaden-footed drive and he fails to connect"
"length ball, shaping away at 83mph/135kph and Afridi again swings and misses"
"angled across on off stump from over the wicket, Rizwan defends"
shortish and tucked off his hip towards deep square... now he refuses the single
<b>beats the bat with a pearler!</b> 80mph and shaping in before nibbling away as Rizwan thrusts forward impetuously
"flung down the leg side, gives Buttler some work to go"
"back of a length outside off, Rizwan chops down and forces one through point"
"<b>finds the edge</b>, taken low at first slip... did that carry? Root didn't seem sure but the soft signal is out, so Richard Illingworth is only going to be looking for conclusive evidence that it bounced. Fingers underneath the ball? Very hard to tell if it's brushed a few blades of grass as he plucks the catch... Ah, there's the angle, viewed from behind it looks to have bounced. So Afridi will survive here"
"short of a length outside off, jabbed down towards backward point"
"speared in, raps the pads, yelps of appeal from behind the stumps... <b>think he got some inside edge on that</b>, otherwise he was plumb. No sign of England reviewing"
"length ball, lets it go in the channel"
pitched up and driven firmly towards mid-on
"oh no, Shaheen! <b>He's been run out by a direct hit at the non-striker's end!</b> Rizwan can only look on aghast as he dabbed towards the cordon, then turned to see his team-mate halfway down the pitch - 'No run!' was the only call in town, but Afridi's handbrake turn wasn't enough, as Sibley threw down the stumps after swooping from gully"
"<strong>Ho ho ho!</strong> Strides across and gives him a walking whack over square leg! I thought it had carried all the way, but four will do nicely. But Abbas on strike now"
<strong>nearly another run-out</strong>. Abbas flicked it to the onside and tried to scamper through for one. Desperately turned back and only just got back in
more conventional batting from Abbas this time. Goes back in his crease and defends solidly
"flicked to the onside, but he keeps it down"
"oooh, testing line from Curran. Started around off and swung back in late. Abbas was grateful most of that swing came after it passed the stumps"
"thick outside edge to gully; the single was on there, but Rizwan didn't want to take it off the penultimate ball"
"that's very close, huge lbw appeal, and <strong>England have decided to review</strong>. Came closer to the crease and swung it back in from middle. Appeared to be two noises, and yep, <strong>thick inside edge</strong>. Abbas survives"
"angling it back into Rizwan, cramps him for room"
"that's lovely bowling. Holds its line outside off stump and gets this one to move away. Little Rizwan could do, really"
"<strong>slower yorker</strong>, almost did for him. Manages to get his bat down in time, but no runs yet for Pakistan this over"
there's a couple. Brilliant fielding on the square leg boundary. Rizwan pulled it down there and a bit of teamwork from the two men out saves a couple
"outside off, Rizwan chips it to the onside. Result for Pakistan. They've got 3 runs and Abbas needs to fend off just the one ball"
flicks it deftly to midwicket. Rizwan back on strike
seams it back in from middle stump at 83mph. Rizwan fends it to the inner ring fielders on the legside
"a fraction wide, and Rizwan latched on to it. Scythes it through backward point for four. <strong>These are precious runs </strong>for Pakistan"
"inward movement again, thick inside edge as he tries to drive it through the covers"
"<strong>cheeky</strong>! A touch short from Curran, and he squats down and <strong>chips it over the slips</strong> all the way to the boundary"
worked away to fine leg and he takes a single off the fifth ball again
"round the way, swinging down the legside for Buttler to collect. Nine off the over, another decent one for the visitors"
"well wide. Rizwan tries to cut it away, but doesn't really get close to it"
"glorious. Full and wide on the offside, and Rizwan drives through extra cover on the up. Anderson has a chase on, but he isn't as sprightly as he once might have been"
driven back to the bowler
"angled down to third man, and they take the single. <strong>Abbas has to face two balls </strong>this time"
"got in line very nicely, and dead-batted it"
"nicely blocked once more. This is frustrating for England, but they have the new ball coming up in an over"
"seams it into Rizwan, who fends it to the onside. You'd expect Anderson to bowl the next over from the other end"
"handsome drive down the ground, but there's no way Rizwan was considering a single off the second ball"
"shaping away from off stump, he watches it go past"
"well wide down the legside, Buttler could only get a glove on it as he tips it across to fine leg. Lucky for Pakistan that wasn't called a wide, or Abbas would have had to face three balls"
"wide outside off, Broad needs to do better with the few cracks he gets at Abbas"
"this one's straying down leg, no problems for Abbas"
"prodded down to square leg, Rizwan emphatically tells Abbas to stay right where he is"
that's byes down legside. This is loose from England. Little Buttler could do once more after it seamed back in sharply after pitching
"wider outside off, Rizwan attempts a half-hearted cut, misses"
defended on the offside
"nice spirit from the diminutive Rizwan. Dances down the crease and looks to smack Woakes into the middle of next week. Complete miss, however, and he looks a little sheepish"
"that's well wide. The umpire decides it's too wide to forgive, and signals it. Rizwan's attempts to keep the strike continue"
"brilliant from Rizwan. Slower ball, just 69mph, and he drops it down on the legside and scurries across. Keeps the strike"
hits the top of Rizwan's bat and loops up. Beats the slips but Rizwan comes across for a single. Tries to get another one but there's no way it's on. An opening for England?
"tailing back in to Abbas, who drives it gamely to mid-on"
"that wasn't short enough to duck, but Abbas went down anyway. Smacked him in the ribs, they wonder about a legbye, but never on"
tailing down the onside. Abbas has done okay so far
blocked to gully. One more ball to survive
"wide outside off, Abbas wants nothing to do with it"
"drops it a little short, Rizwan pushes back and blocks"
"went searching for the magic ball. Full and targeting leg stump, seeking sideways movement. Rizwan's leading edge takes it back to Woakes"
"guided down to third man. Thought about a single, but thought better of it"
too close to cut and Rizwan found himself cramped for room
"a touch quicker from Abbas, but no accuracy. Rizwan gets a thigh pad on to it and Curran does well on the boundary to cut it off. Two runs saved there"
"gets it comfortably. Bowled on the pads, and Rizwan tucks it down to fine leg. He moves to within two of 50"
"good ball first up. Just outside off, decent carry through to the keeper after it beats the bat"
"pushed into the offside, and Rizwan screams at Abbas to come back for two. The throw is at the non-striker's end, and replays show Abbas has just about managed to get back in. <strong>Excellent work</strong> from the two batsman"
defended off the back foot
"cross batted hoick to square leg, and Rizwan decides he can let Abbas have a couple of deliveries"
"celebappeal from Broad, but Kettleborough isn't interested. <strong>England review straightaway</strong>. Looks like it must just slide down. Hit him high on the front pad, misses the bat but was seaming back in sharply. Umpire's call on the stumps, and <strong>Abbas survives</strong>"
"juicy edge to first slip, and it may just have dropped in front of Joe Root, who holds his finger a little tenderly. They manage to come back for two, and England's frustrations continue"
"short and wide, cut away to point. Rizwan growls 'two!' straightaway, and they come back easily"
"times nicely through the offside, but since there was only one on, they don't take it"
driven to cover-point
"length outside off, 81mph/131kph and he lets this zip through"
"hits the seam, this nibbles away past the outside edge as Rizwan props forward"
short and wide and left well alone - so Abbas will be on strike
"<b>pinned in front of off</b>, that's plumb! Abbas asks for the <b>review</b> but I think he's hoping for divine intervention here... Yep, nipping back, bat nowhere near ball, would have rattled middle stump! Broad <i>just</i> about remembered to appeal at the last minute, as Kettleborough raised the finger in approval"
"on the stumps, back of a length and nudged off the body, gets him off the mark"
"slapped over the covers, <b>Rizwan comes out swinging!</b> Plugs in the outfield and he gets a couple more"
"fiendishly difficult line, hits the seam and veers through past Rizwan's crease-bound prod"
"full and swinging, 84mph/135kph, <b>smoked through the off side!</b> Timing worthy of a Swiss watchmaker as he connects with the a free-flowing cover drive"
"shortish outside off, 86mph and he dabs behind square, not fielded cleanly and they will scramble through for one"
"what a start! Rizwan dances down the wicket and absolutely throws the bat at that. Misses completely, but the tone has been set"
"length ball, Anderson brings it back into Rizwan, who has to defend"
lovely bowling. angles it into Rizwan and shapes it away off the seam. The batsman prodded at it but misses
moves across but Anderson goes wider. Goes through to Buttler
"he's up to his old tricks again. Just pokes that to backward point and calls Naseem over for a quick single. Crawley had a shy and if that had hit, Naseem was nowhere near"
"held its line outside off, Naseem made sure he didn't let his bat too close to it"
wide of the crease and clear of off stump. Left alone
nips back off the seam and hits Rizwan high on the thigh pad off an inside edge
"much too wide and he has another whack at it. Lost his shape completely on that ball, much like I have during quarantine"
"better line. Targeting off stump. Rizwan is struggling to get the runs Pakistan need, and that's because England have been wily so far today"
moves across and tries to work it to the onside. Gets pad on it and Broad has a half-hearted appeal. At least he's farming the strike effectively
"wide of off stump, not terribly clever. Naseem has no interest in playing that"
"sliding down and seemed to hit him on the flesh above the thigh pad. Looks in a little bit of pain, but he's a tough boy"
lots of inward movement. He gets a thick inside edge and its fine enough for them to come back for two
length ball targeting the stumps. Rizwan dedends
"excellent bowling. Seaming away from an off stump length. They may not have got a wicket yet, but they are limiting the runs"
"dances down the pitch and finally <strong>a slog pays off</strong>! Looked to hit it straight but gets it high behind gully, who has a chase, to no avail"
"beautiful bowling, and <strong>Rizwan fails to keep the strike</strong>. Just missed off stump with a glorious outswinger. Naseem will have to face a full over"
"not to start off, though. Started it much too wide outside off, and while it came back in, Naseem left fairly comfortably"
finally targeting middle stump. He got in line behind it well and blocks
wide again. No wonder Naseem has a smile on his face. It doesn't matter that it's 87mph; he can just let it go
"that's the line. Full, landing around off stump, that would have been too good for Rizwan. Swung lately and just missed both the outside edge of the bat and the off stump"
bangs it down on a length and it smacks him on the thigh pad. One ball left to face
swinging away. Rizwan won't touch that with a bargepole. He's seen off the over!
"length delivery. Moves off the seam sharply, and Rizwan is beaten"
"short and wide, there to be slashed away, which is precisely what the batsman tried to do. Makes no contact, though"
that's a good shot. Punched past backward point and there's no one on the boundary to cut that off. Second boundary of the day
driven to mid-on. No question of a run
clever from hi again. Just drops it dead down the legside and calls Naseem Shah across to exchange ends. One ball to Naseem.
"that was nicely timed! Sliding down leg and he worked it to square leg. They thought about two, but since it was never on, Rizwan tells him to stay where he is"
"thick inside edge to fine leg. Naseem scampered down the pitch, but Rizwan (wisely) judges he can't get two, and sends him back"
"and <strong>we finally see the end of the innings</strong>. Rizwan scoops it high into the air and Zak Crawley at cover-point is primely poised to take that. It's been an excellent knock from Rizwan. He's frustrated the hosts and 236 is a more than respectable total, especially given the situation Pakistan were in at 176 for 8"
"<strong>almost a wicket first ball</strong> Gets a nick on that, going straight to second slip. Bounces juuust short of the fielder. They may need to come up, the slips"
"moving away from outside off, he lets it go. He's already had a bit of a warning"
"angles it into the stumps. Good line from Shaheen, especially if he continues to get the movement he's searching for"
"and this time <strong>there's no reprieve </strong>for Burns! This is so, so good. Shaping away from off stump, and Burns' defensive prod goes straight to Asad Shafiq at second slip at waist height. England lose one early!"
"smacks him on the pads, that looked very close. Huge appeal from Pakistan, and they <strong>will review</strong> Appeared top be swinging down leg, having done too much. Replays show at least two stumps visible, and in any case UltraEdge shows the faintest of inside edges. <strong>Crawley survives</strong>"
"short of a length, and he's experienced enough to leave on length. But what an over that is from the 20-year old!"
Abbas is up to his own tricks again. That has hurt Sibley. Pitches on a length and seams away to hit Sibley just above the hip bone. It looks like a painful one
"wobbles it away from off stump, and this time he gets a bit of bat on that to defend it. Umpire glances at the light metre, seems happy for now"
"short of a length, slightly leg sidish on that occasion. He blocks it"
"that's way too good for Crawley. Had to play at that, but found the ball shaping away just as he planted his front foot and looked to drive it"
"carbon copy, except this was even less playable. The seam movement he's getting is outrageous"
"smacked on the pads, and Pakistan go up in unison again. That looked like it was definitely drifting down, though, and Abbas' first over is done. England will be tested here"
"shaping back in from off stump, defended. Burns is on the balcony enjoying a coffee. Rather than than face these two, I'd imagine"
"full, almost yorker length. Solidly blocked"
"this one moved away from good length. He got a thick outside edge on that one, but managed to keep it down, and it only goes to third slip well after it's bounced"
targeting the stumps with the one that moves in again. Shaheen has been on the money every ball this little spell
"slightly wide of off this time, left alone. That might be the first ball he's given the batsman an easy decision to make"
"moved back in and a thick inside edge takes it all the way to the midwicket boundary. In the time it's cut off, they come back for two"
"this is so good it's almost illegal. Just unplayable again, moving away and bouncing as it evades the edge, tickles the pad and goes through to the keeper"
"that one held its line, and Crawley manages to play that with more confidence. Defended solidly off the front foot"
"clever from Crawley, walks down the wicket and works it to the onside, allowing them to take two.Might be time for Rizwan to consider standing up"
"fifth stump line on that occasion, he shoulders arms"
strides down the wicket again and blocks it back to Abbas
steps out of the crease. Seams back into him and smacks up in the abdominal area. Abbas gives him a dirty look. Another absorbing over
just wide enough for him to leave it
clipped through the onside again for another couple
"bounce and movement. Seaming back in off a length, but it's high enough for him to know he needn't play at it"
"good carry through to the keeper again. 85 kph outside off, not quite moving in as much as he'd have liked"
"lavish seam movement again. If that had landed around off stump, it would have been unplayable."
"good delivery, good batting. Alert to the straighter one, and gets in line and dead-bats it effectivey"
"touch short on the body, 80mph/129kph and Crawley tucks it calmly round the corner for one to leg"
shortish outside off and straightening as Sibley squirts a thick edge down towards third man for a few more
"length ball, 78mph in the channel and fading away, Crawley tucks his bat in"
"awkward, the line is coming back in, takes this one on the thigh pad"
uses the feet and gets forward to this on off stump
"<b>beautifully bowled</b>, angled in and then nibbling away as Crawley pushes out and is beaten"
"length ball, 78mph/127kph in the channel outside off and he leaves this one be"
"good length, shaping back on off stump at 85mph, Sibley is forward to defend"
"pitched up, the line is slightly wider, Sibley nudges it away coming across"
"angled across, 86mph/138kph in the corridor and Sibley lets it skip through"
"slightly short of a length, again he waves it through outside off"
"pitched fuller, 87mph/139kph and curling back, jams into the inside half of the bat as Sibley props out"
fired full on off and defended back down the track
"length ball, nipping off the seam, <b>beats him on the outside</b> as Crawley presses forward"
"drops short, sits up nicely, <b>Crawley slaps it disdainfully through backward square leg!</b> Pulled off the front foot as Abbas strays from his usual nagging length"
"angled in, 77mph/125kph and prodded back towards mid-on"
"in the channel, 80mph/129kph and shaping out, then seaming in... wide enough to leave alone"
"good length on off, 79mph and jabbed towards backward point"
"<b>crunched through cover-point!</b> Flowing cut shot brings Crawley four more... Not particularly precise from Abbas that time, short and wide and thumped to the fence"
"pitched up, Sibley jabs a thick inside edge behind square on  the leg side"
"full and quite wide, lets this one go"
"pitched up, 86mph/138kph outside off, Crawley steps into a punched drive down the ground, picks up three towards long-off"
"shorter, 88mph/141kph and kicking up to be taken at head height by Rizwan, no stroke from the batsman"
"length delivery on the pads, tickled fine for a couple more"
"fullish on off stump, Sibley leans into a block back towards the bowler"
"pitched up in the channel, snuffling forward and lets this one go through"
"fullish length on off, defended softly"
"pitched up, 78mph/127kph and steered through backward point coming down"
"full in the corridor, 79mph and not doing too much off the straight, Sibley can step out and leave it be"
"back of a length, this zips through as Sibley shoulders arms, good carry but the line was outside off"
"good length in the channel, comes across and leaves it be"
"flung full and wide of the stumps, left well alone"
"chipped over the leg side, wide of the man at mid-on! Naseem gave a spirited leap but Crawley had got quite a lot on his shot"
defended on the front foot
"short, 85mph/137kph and Sibley shovels off his hip, via the padding and gets it fine for a leg bye"
"88mph/141kph, touch short and Crawley frees the arms outside off, 'No run!' as he swats to backward point"
"length, 88mph and holdings its line, Crawley gets a bit squared up as he defends to the off side"
"full on the pads and glanced wide of fine leg for a couple. Not so much on the pads, actually, a foot or so down leg..."

"similar delivery, well wide of off stump. Crawley isn't interested"
"a tad straighter on this occasion, but he isn't targeting the stumps at the moment. Crawley isn't tempted to play at it"
banged that in a bit too short. Might have almost pitched that on his toe. So far above Crawley's head the umpire calls it a wide
wide of off and left alone. Bit of a loose over from Shaheen
"shorter ball this time, Crawley goes back and across and punches it through the offside. No timing, straight to a man"
"wide of off at 87mph, much like four other balls this over"
solidly blocked. An eight-ball over comes to an end
"length ball outside off, Sibley watches it go by. Pakistan not really making England play right now"
"pushes him back slightly. Targeting the stumps this time, defended"
fuller around a fifth stump line. Sibley moved towards it but decided against engaging with the ball
short ball forces Sibley back to defend. ball hasn't been doing quite as much as it was 50 minutes ago
"full and wide, and let go by the batsman"
"good delivery, in the block hole. Maybe a touch too straight, which allows him to work it away to square leg to keep the strike."

"short again. Seems in the mood for a bit of chin music, to use a cliche I generally despise"
"length ball, moving a touch off the seam away from the right-hander, who blocks it through the offside"

"bowls it fuller at 88mph, and it goes away from the batsman, who doesn't play at it"
"shout for lbw, but that pitches outside leg, I reckon, and was a touch too high anyway. Maiden over, and Yasir Shah looks like he's ready"
"loose from Crawley. Tries to drive it through cover, beaten by the bounce, lucky not to get an edge on it"
"that's flighted nicely, Crawley more assured in his defence"
good work from him. Dances down the wicket and slaps him above mid-off. Confident batting from the 22-year old

"slightly short of a length, he defends off the back foot"
angling away and he can afford to leave on both line and length
"pushed him on the back foot. Seemed a late decision from Crawley to play at it, but that meant he couldn't find the timing to pierce the offside field"
"a bouncer that's not terribly well-directed or fast, only 83mph. Crawley shows no interest"
driven off the front foot. Shaheen went around the wicket and was wise to the fuller length. Send it through extra cover
"shorter ball, he tries to thwack it through the leg side, and ends up missing it. The bowler and the batsman exchange knowing smiles"
"wide of off, and left alone"
"a shimmy down the pitch, good shot. A touch full from Shah, and he's driven through midwicket for four"
"that's a quicker one, and the late cut almost finds Shafiq at first slip. Wasn't far away, but it needed to be cut off at the boundary"
"shorter ball from Yasir, allowing Crawley an easy single through the offside"
"fuller and slower from Yasir, only 50mph. Defended off the front foot"
angled to backward point

"better ball, stump-to-stump. Defended this time"
wobbles slightly outside off stump. Crawley lets it go
nicely guided to deep point
"that seamed away! Sibley got onto the front foot and it just missed his outside edge. Rizwan was too deep, and it didn't carry"
"seams back in, this one, and he watches it go past"
"good delivery. He pushed him back and as the ball skid through, he had to be careful he got his bat down in time"
opens the face and slices it through the offside
"ahh, <strong>that's a missed stumping!</strong>. Rizwan, who has been perfect behind the stumps, fails to collect after Crawley dances down the wicket and ends up yorking himself"
"wrong'un, it's read well"
"nice shape on that ball, spinning away. Crawley defends it through the offside"
more assured-looking drive to sweeper-cover. Eventful over
"low full toss, and he isn't going to miss out on that one. Drives it down the ground and picks up an easy boundary"
"length ball outside off, and left alone"
"punched through the covers, Azhar ALI does well to save a few runs"
"slashes it over the slips. Didn't middle that by any means, but there was width on offer and he went after it. Little the slips could do but watch it sail over their heads."
"nice comeback, squared him up and hit him in the abdomen. Seamed back into Crawley"
"nicely cut away, deep point cuts it off smartly, though. 9 off the over"

defended
"skids it through, and defended off the front foot"
"nice flight, and England are smart with their running, allowing Crawley back on strike. He's 2 away from 50 now"
steps back and cuts it away to short third
"kept low, and <strong>nearly went under</strong> his bat! Crawley doubled up in surprise, and manages to dig it out before off stump is disturbed"
"thick edge through the offside, bit of excitement from the fielders, but it was never really a catching opportunity"
wide of off stump at 76 mph. Sibley lets it go
"carbon copy at 77mph. Sibley won't ever be tempted to play those, you'd imagine"
"slightly shorter, but bowls down the same line. Crawley might have cut that to the point boundary and brought up his 50. Sibley doesn't have those lofty aspirations"
"that one's fuller and straighter, and he clips that down to midwicket for an easy couple"
"seaming back in, the batsman shoulders arms"
"nice flight and loop from Yasir. He's settled into a but of a rhythm. Spinning away, and Crawley's leave has an air of respect to it"
driven back to him
"that's the long hop, and he steps back and tonks him through cow corner for four. He brings up his <strong>third Test fifty</strong>"
tried a bit of a slog sweep off a ball that was wide off off stump. Manages to squeeze it away for one
watchfully lets that one go through to Rizwan
"kept low, but it was wide enough of off stump not to imperil Sibley"
"big appeal, and <strong>he's given him!</strong> Crawley <strong>reviews straightaway</strong>. Pitched on length around middle stump and moved away off the seam, beating his bat and striking the front pad. Is height an issue? It's umpire's call on the wickets, which means it's upheld! Abbas strikes, removing the danger man, if that means anything in this Test"
"lovely ball first up to Root, beats his outside edge only just. Abbas is back in the sort of mood that he's so good to watch in"
"comes forward and moves across, clipping him through midwicket. It's a popular tactic, but Abbas' wiles always mean he's got something planned"
"kept low off the seam, beating Root and utterly flummoxing Rizwan. Hits him off the second bounce and it took a while before he got it under control"
<strong>absolutely magical</strong> Root advances but it moves late off the seam and misses the outside edge by a hair's breadth
"and again, <strong>this is mesmeric</strong>. Strikes him on the back pad, I think, and there's a huge appeal from Pakistan, probably for a nick, but the umpire remains unmoved. What an over that was!"
"flighted at about 51mph, blocked off the front foot"
driven back to Yasir
"slightly short and kept low, Sibley shoulders arms"
again. The variable bounce is becoming an issue for Sibley. Just about digs this one out
"drives it to mid-on, and smart running brings the captain on strike"
"excellent ball to finish. Skids through off a length, but Root is wise to the plan, and solid in defence"
defended resolutely
goes wider of the crease to change the angle to Sibley. Doesn't quite get the away movement. Umpire tells Abbas to stay off the pitch
"<strong>given</strong>! Sibley goes trying to tickle one down the legside! Sibley has a history of trying to flirt with the one that goes down legside, and that's the one that traps him again!"
assured front foot defence from Pope first up
clipped down to mid-on
wobbles in the air and moves back in off the seam. Wicket-maiden from Abbas. Exciting stuff
"nicely flight, and nicely defended from Root"
"pushes Root back. Pakistan have their tails up, and both batsmen are yet to get off the mark"
"that's not true anymore, as a slightly loose delivery is sliced through point to allow Root is first two"
skidded through once more. Root pokes it through the offside
again. Yasir is getting those to go through quickly on the bounce. An admiring cry of 'Shah jeee' from Rizwan
"swiped at it, somewhat agriculturally. Misses the ball and that's another absorbing over"
Pope sorts out his feet nicely to drop that ball dead
"angling into him, driven back to the bowler"
seamed away and a thick edge gets Pope off the mark
"wider off off stump this time, he watches it go by"
"operating around that fifth stump line, which Root is happy to shoulder arms to"
"walks down the wicket but Abbas seams it back into him. Hits his pads and ahalf-hearted appeal, but nothing doing. here's Alan to take you through the next little bit"
"tossed up and driven square, they think about one... lots of Pakistan shouting as the throw eventually comes in"
uses the feet and gets this back past the bowler for one towards mid-off

buzzing away in the channel; Pope is across and shoulders arms to this one
pushed in straighter with the arm and Pope clips it back down the track
"length on off stump, 80mph/129kph and looking for that fatal nibble one way or another, Pope jumps into line"
<b>whipped off the pads for four!</b> Shaping in but right under the eyes as Pope sent a frisky clip in front of fine leg
"bounds in and lobs up full on off, Root defends"
"looped up very full around off stump, blocked"
pushed through and Root is back in the crease the chop one through point
"pinned to the crease, up goes the finger... Pope <b>reviews</b> but he does so with sad, puppy dog eyes. He's been done by the slider, playing back and can't get his bat down in time, definitely pad first and that is <b>crashing into off stump</b>, according to Hawk-Eye! Smartly done by Yasir, Pakistan chip out another"
"tosses up the legbreak on off stump, defended"
slow and loopy on the stumps and jabbed to leg
"ooh wee, <b>unplayable from Abbas!</b> Gets a resigned grin from the batsman, Root trying to come forward and beaten as it jagged and bounced off the pitch"
comes across and taps this into the covers
"gets a bit straight, 77mph and Root nudges off the pads through square"
"in the channel, 80mph/129kph and Root is forward, dabs into the covers"
"slightly back of a length, Root opens the face and guides it towards backward point"

tossed up and bunted back down the track
"flatter, skidding on with Buttler back and defending on off"
"flighted, drifting in with the arm, leans out to defend"
tossed up full and Buttler opens the shoulders to crash the ball towards cover
"quicker again, the Yasir googly and Buttler attempts to muscle it off the back foot, takes the ball on the thigh pad... high for lbw, despite the appeal"
floated up outside off and he lets this go
"nipping back to hit the knee roll, but Root is batting well out of his ground"
"whipped through midwicket, Root advances and clips three off his pads"
"length ball, Buttler presses out to block"
"sneaks this through, snaking back at Buttler, struck on the back leg... High? Kettleborough not interested in the appeal"
"length delivery holding its line outside off, 78mph/126kph and left alone"
"pitched up on off, 79mph/127kph and blocked into the covers"
goes back and taps the ball away
prodded back to the bowler
"flighted, Root comes forward and bottom-hands a punch into the off side"
"full and flighted outside off, Root stretches out and steers into the covers"
tossed up and patted back
pushed through and Root drops into the crease to dab behind square
<b>hoops this past the edge!</b> Gentle run-up and then a vicious outswinger past Buttler's prod! And now England declare - meaning this over and two others are 'lost' to the change over and suddenly we're into the final 15 - <b>and this one is done</b>
