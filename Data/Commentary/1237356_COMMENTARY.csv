length ball to start which nips in sharply off the seam to strike him on the top of the thigh pad. DK didn't play that at all convincingly
"fired down the leg side at 135kph, lets it go"
"nibbles in off the seam, Karunaratne jams the bat down defending into the leg side"
"fuller on fourth stump, Karunaratne is drawn forward looking to drive and toe-ends into the leg side"
"width outside the off stump, back of a length, and he punches off the back foot for four! Sri Lanka's first runs in international cricket since March. Slapped hard through the covers"
"slightly back of a length, Karunaratne moves like a crab onto the back foot to defend"
"strays down the leg side to start with, and it flicks Perera's thigh pad and runs away towards fine leg"
"full on the pads, clipped down to long leg for a couple. 83mph/134kph. Not got his line right with these first two"
"length ball, clipped away off the hip down to fine leg for four! Long leg is very square, and Sipamla is too straight again, giving a freebie to Karunaratne"
"full on off stump, dug out by Dimuth who jams the bat down and manages to pick up a couple out to deep square leg"
good bounce from a length which takes Dimuth by surprise. Rears up and hits him on the glove
"<strong>beauty!</strong> Good way to finish a wayward first over. Awkward length, a little fuller, and Karunaratne doesn't know whether to come forward or stay back. His feet hardly move, and he pokes reluctantly at a ball which nips away off the seam, past the outside edge."
"full on off stump, Perera digs it out from the base of off stump"
"bit of inswing from a length, and Perera nudges towards Bavuma at short leg"
"length ball, 80mph/129kph, and Perera works to mid-on to get on the board. Nortje is a little too deep, throws at the striker's end, and they pinch a second run via the deflection off the stumps"
"length ball, good pace off the pitch even at 81mph/130kph, and Perera can only flick it into the thigh pad via the inside edge"
"hits Perera on the back leg, good bounce from a length again"
"thick inside edge into the pad. Slightly fuller, pitches on fifth stump, and draws the inside edge as Perera pushes bat away from body"
"fullish on the pads, too straight again, and clipped away through midwicket. Ngidi gets round to cut it off, but they saunter through for two"
"<strong>beauty!</strong> A fraction full of a length, and this is such a dangerous ball to the left-hander from round the wicket. Scrambled seam, and natural variation takes it away from the defensive prod"
"full, overpitched, but Karunaratne's pushed drive can't beat mid-on. 87mph/140kph"
"length ball outside off, Dimuth plays it late with soft hands and it <strong>squirts away via the outside edge</strong> between third slip and gully for four! Wouldn't have carried, as DK played it well from under his eyes"
"back of a length, Dimuth ducks underneath it as it flies over his right shoulder"
"overpitched again, and punished! Full on leg stump, and Karunaratne tucks in, clipped through square leg for four. Wayward start from Sipamla"
"good bounce from a length, and Perera gets this on the splice of the bat as he defends, surprised by the extra bounce. Might have tickled the gloves, too"
"back of a length on sixth stump, and Perera is cramped for room as he looks to punch through the covers off the back foot. More or less straight to the fielder, but they pinch a single."
"nips in off the seam towards off stump, and Karunaratne nudges to short leg on the bounce"
"back of a length, 85mph/136kph, and it hits Karunaratne on the right hip as he jumps back, shaping to work to leg"
"<strong>chops on! SA have a breakthrough</strong> There's been a bit of nip into the left-handers from round the wicket for Ngidi, and this one jags in sharply from back of a length off the seam. Karunaratne had shaped to cut, but changed his shot late in an attempt at damage limitation. In the event, he could only edge onto the base of the stumps, and SA are jubilant at removing Sri Lanka's captain inside five overs"
"slightly too wide outside off stump, and Mendis can let it go. More movement away off the seam"
"full on sixth stump, pressed out to mid-off with a stride forwards"
"banged into the pitch, but not much bounce this time. Keeps a fraction lower than Perera expected as he clips out to wide mid-on"
"good length outside off, and more movement in off the seam as Mendis lets it fly through to the keeper"
"short and wide outside off, and <strong>Mendis cashes in!</strong> That's a long hop, if truth be told. Short and wide, Mendis frees his arms and flays over the covers for four. Just a couple of bounces over the rope"
"short outside off again, Mendis considers the pull but thinks better of it"
"full on fifth stump, bit of a half-volley, and Mendis <strong>drives sweetly down the ground</strong> for four! Big stride forward from Mendis, who pounces on the full length and sends it past Sipamla, straight out of the middle"
"length on fifth stump, angled into the off side"
"short and wide from Ngidi, and Perera tucks in. Full-blooded cut shot, up and over the off side for a two-bounce four. <strong>Sri Lanka are rocketing along!</strong> 3000 Test runs for Mendis"
"good length from round the wicket, and Perera nudges into the leg side"
"length ball, clipped to short leg on the bounce"
"length ball, tucked into the leg side off the hip"
"back of a length, <strong>nearly another chop-on</strong>! Perera was cramped for room shaping to cut away from his body, and there was a bit of seam movement into him. It skews away via the inside edge down to fine leg"
"full and straight, clipped <i>just</i> past Bavuma at short leg and out towards the boundary. Shouts of 'catch!' from in close, but it would have taken a blinding effort just to get a hand on it"
"length ball, good pace to start at 90mph/145kph, and Perera steers down into the gully on the bounce"
"<b>big shout for lbw</b>, umpire Holdstock isn't interested and there's no review. Tough to get an lbw from round the wicket to the left-hander, and this looked to be going down the leg side as Perera was struck on the pad by a quick length ball"
"slightly overpitched at 91mph/146kph on leg stump, and that will fly away to the fine leg boundary as Perera clips off the pads"
"length ball outside off stump, jammed to point on the bounce"
"fullish on fifth stump at <strong>93mph/150kph</strong>, Perera is in no mood to hang around and clubs it, full-blooded, straight back down the ground. Nortje sticks out his size 14 right boot, and wears one in his follow-through!"
"up at <b>93mph/150kph again</b>, steepling bounce from a length and de Kock takes it leaping above his head! This wasn't particularly short, but it rose viciously from a length past Perera's outside edge"
"shortish, and Mendis is leaping around in his crease trying to work out whether to play at this or leave it alone. In the end, he does neither, and it flies through to de Kock"
"Ngidi has his tail up. Slightly full of a length, drawing Mendis forward, and it jags away off the seam to beat his outside edge"
"full and straight, Mendis jams the bat down and they pinch a single as it squirts into the covers. 50 up in the ninth over!"
"slightly full of a length on off stump. KJP tickles it into the leg side and sets off for a sharp single, and makes his ground comfortably. Great running"
"length ball, crab-like defence into the leg side"
"cross-batted away through mid-off for a couple. Strange shot - looked like he was trying to pull, but ended as a half-pull, half-drive as he pushed it down the ground"
"good bounce from a length, 91mph/147kph, and Mendis defends into the leg side"
"back of a length outside the off stump at 90mph/146kph, and Mendis misses out. He shaped to cut, but was late on the shot and ended up flashing at thin air"
"length outside off, Mendis' feet are stuck on the crease as he wafts airily outside the off stump. That's what high pace can do"
"91mph/146kph, length ball outside off stump and Mendis is squared up as it moves away off the seam. High-quality fast bowling"
"<strong>gets his man!</strong> Horrible shot, and the result of a scrambled mind due to the pace that Nortje has been bowling. That's a proper working-over from Nortje, banging this in back of a length at 90mph/145kph. Mendis shapes to pull, looking to take the fast bowler down, but is so late on the shot. It flies up, looping into the hands of Ngidi at mid-on. Nortje has the second wicket of a high-octane innings"
"length ball on sixth stump, Chandimal leaves it alone. 92mph/148kph, and this absolutely flies through to de Kock, who takes it at or even above head height despite the fact it wasn't particularly short. Top-quality stuff from Nortje in his two overs so far, but why didn't he take the new ball?!"
"full of a length and angled across the left-hander. Perera lines up a loose, booming shot over midwicket, but can't connect"
"strays down the leg side, Perera shoulders arms"
"length ball, 79mph/129kph, checked push into the covers"
"another loose swing from Perera, who throws the bat but can't get anything on it. Length ball outside off which he flashes hard at, but he is some way away from it"
"<b>another one!</b> Perera had been swinging like a rusty gate throughout this over, and his over-aggression brings about his downfall. Length ball, wide outside the off stump and enough room for Perera to free his arms once more. But his timing is awry, and he can only manage a thick edge through to de Kock behind the stumps. Mulder has a wicket in his first over, and this is looking worrying for Sri Lanka!"
"back of a length, shaping into the right hander, nudged to leg to end the over"
"full and straight, cautiously forward to block to the on-side"
"outside off, lifting off the seam and through to the keeper"
"outside off, and poked with the angle firmly into the covers, that's very sweetly timed, all along the deck to extra cover. Nothing more than a push"
"<B>good riposte!</B> Extra oomph behind that one, as it snorts off the seam and daggers past the outside edge"
"banged in short, explodes through to the keeper, way outside off, at 147kph. Nortje is keeping it brisk"
"beats the edge once more, at a sharp bat-threatening pace. Lovely wheels"
"angled bat, and a wild wipe outside off"
"nibble and bounce, climbing past the outside edge"
"whoops, that one's a bit off-line, fired past the leg stump"
"<B>plink!</B> that's a gorgeous pick-up, on the fuller length, clean off the toes, and high over the leg side!"
"head over the ball, fully forward and pressed into the covers"
"back of a length, dabbed to cover"
"back and across, blotting away the back-of-a-length delivery on a wicket-to-wicket line"
"open face, dabbing very late outside off, waiting for Nortje to come onto the bat ... which doesn't take very long"
"<B>whoops, errors abound!</B> A leg-stump full-toss, a freebie as Nortje overcooks the yorker ... and Sipamla at fine leg overcooks his slide, and lets the ball wing through to the rope!"
"tapped to the on-side, from deep in the crease, another fumble this time from Ngidi"
a better stop this time at mid-on as Nortje aims full again
"zoinks, that jagged! Full again, and a good leave on length as the ball bent back into the stumps. Lively stuff!"
"back of a length, nudged off the hip, but only as far as short midwicket"
"fended to the on-side, one hand comes off the bat as he does so"
"zip and bounce off the seam! Chandimal holds the pose as he leans outside off, but the ball is long gone"
"<B>even better!</B> This is high-class seam bowling, just finding the spot on the pitch and hitting it time and time again. Nothing Chandimal can do but hold the line and hope"
"slightly fuller, and an uncomfortable push to the on-side, with a yawning gate inviting the inside-edge"
"lift into the hips, tucked to the leg side"
"shaping away outside off stump, a more comfortable leave this time"
"hitting a good length on and around off stump, another shouldering of the arms"
"fierce pace, but slightly off-line. Zings past the pads as de Kock gathers with a slightly startled look"
"pulled this time, not timed, but the intent was good. Banged in short and de Silva was quickly into position to cuff it to midwicket"
"<B>drives at thin air!</B> Fast and furious from Nortje, 92mph, and de Kock swallows the kicking delivery in his bread-basket"
"a flat-footed stab through the covers, pushing counter-aggressively through the line. That's raced to the rope, but Nortje will fancy his chances against that sort of stroke"
nip and bounce off the wicket! No stroke from Chandimal as he's clattered on the thigh pad. Big appeal but clearly going over!
"fenced through the line once more, and unsettled by more extra nip off the seam as the ball inside-edges to the on-side"
"nip off the seam, past a tentative bat. This is a threatening display in helpful conditions"
"full again, and nip again, jagging back off the seam and into the thigh-pad once more"
"zip again, probing line and length"
"through to the keeper on a fourth-stump line, no stroke offered to complete the maiden over"
"shiggidy-diggiddy! Those are some wheels from Nortje! Explosion off a good length, and searing past the edge!"
"very full length, and dabbed back down the track"
"back of a length, and cracked into the off-side, but not timed"
"<B>nibble and bounce!</B> Nortje plants another landmine on a good length, and de Silva can only hold his bat hopefully on an off-stump line"
"banged in shorter, and de Silva claws into another ambitious pull, no timing, but plenty intent!"
"fuller length, swinging away, can't connect on the drive, if he had done so, that would most likely have fizzed for six through third man"
"on the pads, shaping into the legs, nurdled through fine leg. The runs keep flowing!"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"fuller length, attacking the leg stump, thumps the pads"
past the leg stump once more
"good pace and bounce, outside off, another hard-handed push at thin air"
"<B>a filthy wipe outside off!</B> That was a loose delivery, and an even looser stroke"
"round the wicket, dipping on a full length, poked to the off side"
"back of a length, clipped with intent on the up to the leg side"
"very late cut, and that's excellent placement down to the edge of third man. Just back of a length from Maharaj, but excellent wrists"
"head over the ball, pressed to cover"
"pushed into the covers, on the front foot"
"twirled onto a good length, solid block to the off side"
"wider line, jag off the seam, through to the keeper"
"outside off, no stroke offered"
speared past the leg stump
"beaten outside off once more, that extra bounce on a good length is a constant nuisance this morning"
fenced back to the bowler on a very full length
softer hands this time as Chandimal leans forward on the fuller length ... a very belatedly called no-ball...
"sliding into the pads, a chance to flick into space at fine leg ... <B>another late call for no-ball!</B>"
"<B>squelch!</B> Hits the seam, and jags back into the midriff. Better hope he's wearing his armour..."
"round the wicket, dropped onto a good length"
"head over the ball, firmly pressed to cover"
"solid block, full face of the bat, back down the off-stump line"
"use of the feet this time, a little shimmy, halfway to the pitch, and blocked"
"sniffing the leather, leaning over the length ball to block dead"
"blocked once again, into the off side"
"very full length, and that's not going to settle his nerves! A long half-volley and a<strong> languid punch through the covers!</strong>"
"full length again, but on a tighter line, and de Silva punches back to the bowler"
"short and wide, and de Silva groans audibly as he toe-ends his wipe out to cover"
"better line and length, and pressed firmly to the off side"
"<strong>over-pitched and drilled through long-off!</strong> Sipamla is not getting it right yet... another error in length, and he's punished"
"back of a length, a dismissive slap back through the bowler's followthrough. Not timed, but that intent that has been so plain all morning is evident again"
"biffed with placement into the covers, a half-shimmy to the pitch"
flicked to the on-side
clipped off the legs to keep the strike rotating
"head right over the ball this time, dead-batted into the pitch"
"held back in flight a touch, de Silva waits with a bent knee to defend"
"faster and flatter, that's an excellent change-up, and de Silva blocks once more"
"<B>that's a better ball!</B> Full length, shaping in, and holding its line to beat the outside edge. Nice one young'un"
"angled bat, tapped to cover to bring up a very brisk hundred"
"banged in short, a swivel-pull to deep midwicket"
"good bounce and carry, outside off, left alone"
"rolls the fingers on a full length, nurdled off the hips for another single"
"good finish to the over, lift off the seam, another well-judged leave, and that will be <B>lunch</B>"
"slightly full of a length outside off at 91mph/146kph, left alone with a swish of the wrists"
"jags away off the seam at 90mph/145kph, shaping like a legcutter but at high pace. Chandimal lets it go"
"<strong>through the cordon for four!</strong> Back of a length outside off, Chandimal dangles the bat at it with minimal foot movement, and steers it awkwardly between third slip and gully. Not sure he was fully in control"
"length ball at 90mph/145kph in the off-stump channel, left alone"
"booms away off the seam at 91mph/146kph, another nonchalant leave from Chandimal with a swish of the wrists"
"fullish and straight at 93mph/150kph, Chandimal calmly clips into the leg side"
"<b>beauty!</b> Length ball in the channel at 83mph/133kph. De Silva should have come forward but what stuck on the crease, and this flew past his outside edge which just a hint of nip away off the seam"
"beaten again! On a length, no real movement off the seam but DDS is rooted to the spot and prods reluctantly at it"
"punched out towards point off the back foot, straight to the fielder"
"short and wide, but DDS misses out. Freebie at 81mph/131kph outside off stump, which sat up nicely off the pitch. De Silva throws his head back in frustration after cutting straight to point on the bounce"
"lifts sharply from a length as DDS fends outside the off stump. Nibbles away off the seam, past the edge as de Silva pokes at it"
"<b>past the outside edge yet again</b>. This is a real working-over from Ngidi. Slightly full of a length, but de Silva refuses to get to the pitch of the ball. Instead, he is stuck on the crease, poking forward as this nips away off the seam and through to de Kock"
"slightly full of a length, checked drive from Chandimal which Nortje fields in his follow-through"
"slightly overpitched, and <strong>Chandimal tucks in</strong>. 90mph/145kph, presents the full face driving just past the stumps, and it flies to the long-on boundary out of the middle"
"hung outside the off stump, and Chandimal shoulders arms. 89mph/144kph and good carry through to de Kock"
"vicious short ball, which Chandimal ducks underneath. 90mph/146kph and aimed at the chin"
"length ball in the channel, Chandimal flirts at it and can't lay bat on ball. Bit of movement away off the seam as he wafts at it, with no foot movement"
"length ball hung outside off, left alone"
"length ball in the channel, left alone jerkily"
"back of a length, defended from the crease"
"length ball outside off stump, and de Silva leans on the cover drive. It's not out of the middle, but there's a gap in the infield and it will fetch him a couple of runs"
"half-volley on off stump, which DDS <strong>creams through mid-on!</strong> That is a brilliant shot. Overpitched from Ngidi, but this is all about de Silva, who stays compact at the crease with his relatively open stance, and times this sweetly to the fence"
"short ball outside off stump at 87mph/141kph, which de Silva shapes to pull. It makes a horrible sound off the toe, and dribbles out towards Maharaj at short midwicket"
"rears up sharply from a length outside off stump, left alone by DDS"
compact defensive shot to a 91mph/147kph back-of-a-length ball
"slightly too full, and Chandimal times a punch perfectly, right out of the middle. But Mulder gets across from wide mid-off, diving to his right to cut it off brilliantly"
"hung outside the off stump, and left alone"
"short ball at 92mph/149kph, which takes off as though it's hit a spring in the pitch and loops high over de Kock's head! Given as wides"
"short ball, more sharp bounce from a length at <strong>95mph/152kph</strong>, and it smacks Chandimal on the bottom glove and the handle of the bat, dribbling down towards square leg"
"length ball, springy bounce again, as Chandimal clips towards wide mid-on. 90mph/145kph"
"length ball which smacks into the thigh pad at 94mph/152kph. <strong>Nortje belts out a loud appeal</strong>, but the umpire isn't having it. Looked too high, not least with the bounce that this pitch is offering, and there might even have been an inside edge"
"chipped uppishly towards short extra cover, but falls short of him. Slightly full of a length as de Silva closed the face on it, getting a leading edge which dropped five yards in front of the fielder"
"length ball on the pads, worked out to square leg"
"length ball on seventh stump, and Chandimal decides it's time to attack. He shapes to play a booming drive, with his front foot some way from the ball, and it seams past the outside edge"
"slightly too full outside off stump, and Chandimal gets some connection on the cover drive this time. More control this time, piercing the gap in the infield, and it requires some excellent work in the field from Mulder to save a boundary"
"back of a length, outside off, and DDS pulls through square leg for one. 86mph/138kph from Ngidi, but it didn't quite get up off the pitch this time. Maharaj misfields in the deep, but they won't take on a second"
"half-volley in the channel, and Chandimal offers a checked push towards cover"
"strikes him on the pads, and Nortje is up for another appeal. 94mph/151kph, fast and furious, but I think that was straying down the leg side. They pinch a single, which is given as a leg bye - so presumably no bat involved"
"tip-and-run from Chandimal to get off strike. 92mph/148kph on a length, and he pushes with soft hands towards cover to steal a quick single"
"slightly fuller on off stump or thereabouts, and de Silva defends from the crease. 91mph/147kph"
"overpitched on fourth stump, and <strong>DDS drives through mid-on for four more</strong>! Wow, 93mph/149kph, and de Silva decides to take it on, punching with a straight bat. Chandimal has to take evasive action at the non-striker's end but manages to get out the way"
"vicious short ball, pulled hard out to deep square leg for a single. Confident batting from DDS"
"nips back off the seam and <strong>this one must be close!</strong> Holdstock says no, so South Africa <b>review</b>. Slightly full of a length, and definitely no bat. It struck Chandimal on the back leg, just above the pad, as he looked to defend, but <strong>he survives on umpire's call</strong> thanks to the height. It would have trimmed the top of leg stump... tight!"
"overpitched on leg stump, and clipped out to deep square. There's an early call for two as they take on Maharaj's arm, and the call is vindicated as he takes his time to get the throw in"
"keeps a little low from a length outside off, and DDS' back-foot punch can't get past cover"
"full on leg stump, DDS shapes to clip into the leg side but it trickles away towards midwicket off his pad for a leg bye"
"length ball on fifth stump, steered towards cover"
"slightly full of a length outside off stump, and Chandimal gets lucky. He inside-edges, driving loosely, but it flies between his body and the stumps and runs away for a single"

"length ball on the stumps, clipped into the leg side"
"fullish outside off, and <strong>de Silva reaches fifty by creaming a cover drive for four!</strong> This is a gem of an innings.

"hung outside off, a fraction closer to the off stump, and left alone this time"
"full and straight, defended back to Mulder who sees Chandimal out of his crease and hurls towards the stumps! I think he was just about safe... Yep, the bat was in the air for a little longer than he would have liked, but had come down with time to spare as the throw dislodged the bails"

"tossed up on off stump, defended back to the bowler"

"fuller length, tight line, angling into the bat, and blocked"
"back of a length, tapped to cover, a sharp single to end the over. Sri Lanka continue to push along very comfortably"

"clipped back to the bowler, on the front foot"
solidly into line to defend
"jags across the bows, through to the keeper as Dickwella keeps his bat inside the line"
"<strong>sharp lift from a good length!</strong> That hurtled past the splice, on a very cramped line to the leftie. This is a good over so far"
"aggressive line and length, hurriedly onto the front foot to defend"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"tapped to the leg side, another single to complete a tidy over"
"prodded back down the pitch, leaning out of the crease as Nortje comes round the wicket"
squirted into the covers on the front foot again
<strong>short and sharp!</strong> Dickwella flinches inside the line as this one follows him
"tapped to cover, and a very tight single! Or it would have been had the fielder gathered. But another fumble gifts the single"
"<B>so nearly played on!</B> How Chandimal survived that, only fate will know. A lifter, played down into the pitch, and over the top of middle stump, as Chandimal got into an identical tangle to Graham Gooch at Old Trafford in 1993... fortunately for him he didn't flick out a hand to try to protect his timbers!"
"full length to finish, and solidly blocked this time"
"<B>fenced in the air, and clean through the gully!</B> Now then, things are starting to happen! Fuller from Sipamla, and Dickwella, anchored on the back foot, drives reflexively with hard hands. Lucky!"
"hurried on the front foot, tight lines once more"
"well bowled again, dragging the length back but maintaining that superbly threatening tight line to the leftie. Dickwella draws his bat inside the line at the last second"
"bouncer, and limboed out of the way. Sipamla has got his tail up in this spell"
"half forward, and poked to point"
"fizzing finish to the over from the youngster. Another short ball, zipping through as Dickwella dropped his gloves. This is a torrid mini-spell for Sri Lanka ... but that must have been a late call for no-ball as we've got another ball to come"
"banged in again, through to the keeper"
"tight line, pushed to cover on the front foot"
"up on the toes, and punched to cover, well clawed in on the edge of the rope"
closing the face to work to the on-side
"round the wicket, fenced uneasily out to point"
"whooshing bouncer! De Kock does well to claw that down, but it's given as a wide on height"
"stabbed down into the pitch, on the back foot"
tapped back down the pitch
"<B>pop from a good length, and thumps the splice!</B> Wheels from Sipamla, hitting the bat hard as Chandimal loses his bottom hand on impact"
nudged out to cover on the front foot

"loose ball, a long-hop on the hips, and all Dickwella needed was a nudge to whistle that through fine leg"
"fuller length, punched along the ground to mid-off"
"back of a length, attempted clatter off the back foot, but can't connect properly"
"very full length, closes the face and tucked behind square for another brace. Runs are coming a touch too easily again after a period of pressure"
"solidly onto the front foot, head over the ball"
"<B>banged in short, and w-a-a-a-y over the keeper's head!</B>"

"gets down to sweep and it loops up off the glove or perhaps the forearm, but falls safely in the vacant leg slip region"
"full on off stump, presses out into the covers for one"
"speared in quicker outside the off stump, and Dickwella gets low to lap-sweep round the corner. Just a couple"

"fullish on off stump, clipped calmly out to midwicket by Dickwella"
"hung outside the off stump, very wide and left alone"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, Chandimal nudges into the leg side for one"
"length ball in the off-stump channel, nips in off the seam and Dickwella looks unconvinced by his own decision to leave. It flies through to de Kock, just wide of the off stump"

"back of a length, compact punch off the back foot which finds short extra cover"
"uses his feet, working to mid-on"

shimmies down to punch out to mid-off
defended with a full face
"gets low to sweep hard, Bavuma gets a hand on it at short fine leg to save two runs"
stabbed into the off side for one
"slightly full of a length, angling in towards the stumps from round the wicket. Dickwella defends back to Ngidi, who throws at the stumps after gathering in his follow-through. He misses, and Dickwella was back either way"
"fullish on off stump, clipped into the leg side"
"length ball, nudged towards midwicket"
"hung outside off, Chandimal <strong>has a slash at it</strong> and it flies away over the gully region for four! Enough width to free his arms, throwing plenty at it for a one-bounce four, albeit with a hint of outside edge"
"length ball, nudged to mid-on"
"sprayed down the leg side, and the diving QdK does well to get a hand to it"
nudged into the leg side for an ambled single
"steered into the covers, loud cry of 'NO!' from Dickwella as Chandimal sets off for a single"
lunges forward to defend a length ball
"shimmies down the pitch, turning this into a low full toss, and <strong>gets it away for four!</strong> It was airborne for a little while, keeping short midwicket interested, but had plenty on it and raced away"
pressed out towards cover
"uses his feet again, this time <strong>whipping through wide mid-on for four more!</strong> Lovely, elegant, wristy flick, and Sri Lanka are flying here"
"length ball outside off, leans on a cover drive for a couple out to the boundary-rider"
"low full toss outside the off stump, steered to the diving Markram in the gully on the bounce"
"yorker on fourth stump, dug out towards deep point"
"length ball in the channel, pushed out to short cover"
"<strong>edged, through the cordon for four!</strong> Two slips and a gully in place, and this thick outside edge flies through the region where fourth slip would be. Drawn forward by Ngidi, who finds the shoulder of the bat, but Chandimal picks up four more"
pressed out into the covers
"good start, length ball which nips away from Dickwella's casual press forward and flies past the outside edge"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"length ball, worked into the leg side for a jogged single to midwicket. Too straight, and that will be frustrating for Sipamla - two good balls, but now has to re-adjust after straying slightly"
"length ball outside off, steered square of the wicket for a single towards point"
"back of a length in the channel, and Dickwella shoulders arms"
"back of a length, steered towards point on the back foot"
"slightly overpitched, Chandimal steers out to cover and there's some miscommunication with Dickwella. Bavuma swoops to field and throws at the bowler's end, and has Dickwella diving at full stretch to make his ground"
"straight length ball, shapes to work into the leg side and a leading edge flies out towards extra cover. Miscommunication again from the batsmen, and they turn down the single despite the fact it was definitely on"
"fired down the leg side, flicks the pad as Chandimal shapes to work into the leg side and skews away for a leg bye"
"length ball, wide of the off stump, and Dickwella fences at it away from his body. He rides the bounce, and stabs it through wide gully for four. The runs just keep on coming..."
"length ball angled in, defended towards cover"
"fired down the leg side, half-hearted appeal from behind the stumps but Dickwella didn't get so much as a tickle on it"

"back of a length, punched out to wide mid-off on the back foot"
"overpitched outside off, and Chandimal leans on the cover drive to pick up a couple"
"length ball, punched sweetly back down the ground by Chandimal. Sipamla sticks his hand out in his follow-through and gets a slight deflection on it, but Dickwella had the presence of mind to make his ground at the non-striker's end. It misses the stumps regardless, and they pinch a single"
defended solidly into the covers
"half-volley, Chandimal leans on the drive but can't beat short cover. The fielder in close gets a fingertip to it, and it spills out into the off side to allow the single"
"too straight, and Dickwella clips it into the leg side for a couple. Calm, composed innings from Dickwella so far"
sprayed down the leg side
"fired down the leg side again, Mulder yet to find his range"
"fullish, and clipped to mid-on. Dickwella had set off for a single, but wisely then yelps 'no, no, no!'"
"length ball, and <strong>Dickwella frees his arms</strong> to belt Mulder over mid-on for four! I'd say this was in the slot if they were wearing coloured clothes, but this came out of nowhere. Clubbed brutally over the rope after a couple of bounces"
"length ball, clipped into the leg side"
slightly overpitched in the off-stump channel. Chandimal presses out towards extra cover
punched out into the covers
"back of a length, and Chandimal shapes to pull. But its a swipe at thin air, as he'll too early on the shot"
"hint of width outside off, and <strong>Chandimal crunches a cut shot through backward point for four!</strong> That made a brilliant crack off the bat, right out of the middle. Ngidi was sweeping at deep cover, but couldn't get round in time to cut it off"
"short again, wide again, but finds Ngidi on the rope this time round"
"length ball, tucked off the pads for four more down to fine leg. South Africa can't stop the bleeding at the moment, conceding what feels like at least one boundary every over"
"too much width, and Chandimal cuts hard out to deep cover"
"bcak of a length, nudged into the off side. Dickwella set off for a single but Chandimal barked 'NO!' to send him back"
"short ball, backs away to give himself room and Dickwella <strong>upper-cuts over de Kock for four!</strong> Off the toe of the bat, but he seemed like he was in control throughout, ramping up and over the keeper"
steered to backward point
"length ball, defends towards midwicket"
"bumper to start, as Chandimal ducks out the way"
"banged in halfway down, steered out to deep backward point by Chandimal. 88mph/142kph"
"banged in on a length, nudged to midwicket"
"banged in on a length, 92mph/147kph, and nudged towards midwicket. Bavuma was in the game at short leg, but it was just out of reach"
"sharp bouncer, which flies over everyone! Chandimal ducked under it very late in the piece, de Kock was leaping at full stretch and could only get a fingertip to it"
"short again, de Kock gathers cleanly this time. <strong>93mph/150kph</strong>"
"angled across him, tip-and-run into the covers and they steal a quick single"
nudged into the off side
"full-blooded drive, but can't beat short cover this time"
"rears up off a length, <strong>takes the edge and gone!</strong> Mulder finds some extra bounce in the surface out of nowhere, and Chandimal is taken by surprise. It springs up off the pitch, with a tight line leaving Chandimal no choice but to continuing playing at it, and it flicks up off the shoulder of the bat. Markram is the only man in the cordon, at a wide-ish second slip position, but it flies straight to him at head height and he snaffles the chance to give South Africa a much-needed wicket and break the partnership!"
"after all that extra bounce last ball, this one dies off the pitch and hardly reached de Kock"
"full outswinger, Shanaka can't lay a bat on it, getting himself into an awkward position"
"<strong>ooft, more variable bounce</strong>. Nortje bangs this in at 88mph/142kph, but it dies off the surface from back of a length. Dickwella was ready to defend off the back foot, but ended up jamming his bat down and missing it, and it flies just past off stump!"
stabbed down towards mid-on
"short ball in towards the left shoulder, as Dickwella sways inside the line. Up at 92mph/148kph, but Dickwella gestures towards Nortje and mutters something as if to say 'bring it on'"
"back of a length outside off, and Dickwella rears inside the line of it at the last minute. 93mph/150kph, and Nortje laughs in Dickwella's direction in his follow-through"
"short ball at the badge of the helmet, and Dickwella ducks underneath it"
"slightly overpitched, 93mph/149kph, but Dickwella is stuck on the crease after being forced deep by Nortje's short balls. He jams the bat down without moving his feet, and can't beat short cover with the punch"
"loose length ball outside off, and Shanaka cover-drives gorgeously away for four! Big stride down the pitch, and he times it sweetly past the diving Bavuma in the infield"
"fourth-stump length ball, which Shanaka defends"
"fullish outside off, Shanaka squeezes it out towards deep cover"
"booming outswinger, hung outside off stump. Left alone"
"length ball on fifth stump, defended back to the bowler"
"clipped to short midwicket, and that'll be <b>drinks</b>"
"banged in short, soars out of reach, through to the keeper as Dickwella bails out of a dickscoop"
"full length, leg-stump line, patted back to the bowler"
"back of a length, hitting the deck hard, Dickwella rides the bounce to pat it back to the bowler"
"solidly behind the line, patted back past the bowler, but mid-off swoops round to gather"

"short, and swivel-pulled very fine, swept up on the boundary's edge"

"nudged off the pads, to the leg side"

"soft hands, dabbed back down the track"
"back of a length on leg stump, tapped to the on-side"
"eased into the covers, picking the gap supremely"
"big appeal, and <strong>up goes the finger!</strong> This is a big moment, Dickwella reviews, it is adjacent to the line of leg-stump, but was it outside the line? <B>Nope, that's pitched on leg, and is hitting middle!</B>"
"width outside off, a slash and a miss"
"through to the keeper at a decent lick, hitting the seam and bouncing nicely from a full length"
"<B>a lucky edge, flashing down through third man, and that's the 300!</B> Hasaranga is also off the mark in Test cricket, which is nice!"
"angled bat, solid block. Pushed to the off side"
"worked to mid-on, half forward on off stump"
"flighted delivery, dipping on middle and leg and tucked round the corner"
"good areas from round the wicket, blocked back down the pitch as Shanaka gets half forward"
"A checked drive, almost on the walk as Maharaj tempts him out of the crease"
"full-faced defence, into the covers"
fired past the leg stump
"driven compactly through the covers, that's a lovely fluent strike, full face of the bat and piercing the gap"
"that's less fluent, a wild hack to a wider line. Misses everything"
"<B>beauty!</B> That is pace and length, on a beautifully tight line, with a perfect seam, achieving vertical take-off past a startled outside edge"
"nudged off the legs, to square leg"
eased out to deep backward point
"prodded into the covers, on the front foot"
tapped back to the bowler
"flipped against the spin, halfway down the track, clean through midwicket! Emphatic!"
"held back in flight, solid block on off stump"
"whipped off the front foot, to midwicket"
"dead-batted defence, into the off side"
worked to the leg side
awkward pop from a full length. Sri Lanka won't mind seeing this pitch offering live to the old ball... plenty to give their own quicks
"punched off the back foot, firmly played into the covers"
"flashed off the back foot again, keeping the cover sweeper busy with some forceful ground strokes"
"pumped with lots of bottom hand, to mid-on, hitting slightly across the line of a full-length ball"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"galloping to the pitch and drilling a drive back at the bowler, who winces as he sticks his fingers in harm's way"
"outside off, no stroke offered"
"back of a length, chopped hard to deep point"
big stride to defend
"<strong>panned with serious intent, through cow corner!</strong> That is tremendous thwackage, down on one knee and hitting up and out of the line of the ball. Quality boshing"
worked down to long-off to rotate the strike. This is already a useful stand
"driven at thin air, good pace on a good length"
"back of a length, attacking the top of off, firmly into line to block"
"back of a length, and <B>a maiden Test wicket for Sipamla!</B> He's earned that the hard way, he's come back from a torrid start and got better with every spell. This is a delivery full of intent, Hasaranga was expecting the short ball and was almost ducking by the time he realised it was fuller than expected. A loose inside-edge into the sticks, and Sri Lanka's slide continues with the new ball looming!"
"shoulders arms to a wider line, and left alone"
"<B>zing! That's got some heat!</B> Wicked jag off the seam, cutting the new man in half and forcing de Kock into a fine tumble down the leg side to gather. Fair to say Sipamla is enjoying himself now"
"back of a length again, patted down into the crease. That's a fine over, and maiden maiden in his maiden Test"
"inside-out drive, into the covers"
"turn and bounce from just back of a length. Beaten outside off, but without quite threatening the edge"
"<strong>better ball!</strong> Fuller, straighter, and turning again to sneak past the edge!"

"back of a length, a closed-face dab to midwicket"
"banged in short, but wide of off stump. Shanaka ducks"
"very full and straight, meeting Makhaya Ntini's commentary-box exhortation to 'make him drive you'. Snaffled in the followthrough"
tapped into the covers
"<B>banjaxed over long-on!</B> In the slot for a slog, and wiped mercilessly over the rope! And why not!"
head over the ball to block
looking for another big wind-up but beaten in flight this time. Sensibly bails out
"back of a length, a purposeful punch into the covers"
dead-batted down into the crease. Now then...<strong> is it new-ball time?</strong> It certainly is!
"extra bounce from the outset, and a hint of away swing too, as Shanaka drives loosely and misses"
"more carry but on a wide line, an uncomplicated leave"
"on the back foot, solid block down into the crease"
"tapped to cover, a simple single as Shanaka rides the bounce"
pace and carry on a fourth-stump line. Might want to pack that cordon with this sort of bounce on offer...
"<B>unplayable!</B> That bit like a 90mph legbreak, pitching on off and missing the outside edge by six inches. Wasted on thee, lad..."
"<B>wheels!</B> No looseners for Anrich, that's right on the money ... full, fast, off-stump line, bursting through to the keeper"
"width this time, and a fluent slap of the bat out to deep point"
"swing on a full length, at 141kph. No contact there as Rajitha has a mow"
"outswing once more, too tricksy for the tailender to latch onto"
"fenced in the air, but <B>all the way through third man!</B> That was just a dangle of the bat, the face opening on impact, and despite four slips, there's no gully to capitalise!"
"good pace to finish, fourth-stump line, through to the keeper. Not a bad over, but might be better off attacking the stumps when Rajintha is on strike"
"<B>violent intent!</B> A real stand-and-deliver slap with no footwork, and no contact either!"
"full length, outside off, zipping past the edge as Shanaka pushes with hard hands"
"lovely line, bashing the deck, just back of a length, nibbling off the seam and threatening the edge once more"
"fuller still, and so tight to off stump, but Shanaka is resolute, playing the original line and avoiding the thin edge"
hard-handed stab as Ngidi attacks the stumps this time. Mid-on gathers
"full and straight, solid defence to mid-on"
"fizzing through to the keeper, lifting over leg stump as Rajitha fails to find an inside edge"
"an impressive no-look leg-glance, as Nortje followed the retreating batsman outside leg, and somehow found the middle of his defensive blade"
"climbing off the seam, a touch too short to snag the edge, but it flies through all the same"
"wider line again, through to the keeper as Shanaka shoulders arms"
"poked out to cover, finds the gap to pinch another single. This has been impressive resolution against the new nut"
stabbed back to the bowler. Three overs of the new ball gone. Maybe only another two overs possible tonight
"very full, and solidly punched into the covers as Ngidi targets the stumps this time"
"<B>spits from a full length!</B> Shanaka whips his bottom hand off the handle after being squeezed by the lifter. It's been consistently hostile conditions today, all the more credit to Sri Lanka's batsmen for coping so well"
"wicket to wicket line, that's stump-threatening but solidly defended"
"full, tight, lifting, beaten. Can't fault that delivery, except that it wasn't hitting the stumps. It was doing most other things"
firm in defence
"speared into the legs, flinched into the off side, and that will be <B>stumps</B>."
"speared into the pads at 135kph, flicked to leg"
"<B>steered sweetly through third man!</B> Full length, movement away from the bat and a lovely open face fillets the gap to bring up Sri Lanka's highest total in South Africa"
"nibble and bounce outside off, beaten"
"a bit of helpful nip off the seam, zipping back to slam the thighpad"
"<B>fierce bouncer but too fierce for de Kock!</B> That has sailed over the batsman's head, and the keeper's too! Sharp and threatening, but more valuable runs!"
"dangled outside off, he's up to 143kph now, but that's through to the keeper with few alarms"
"a touch too straight first-up, tapped easily enough to the leg side"
"wider line, doesn't get up much as Shanaka shoulders arms"
"<strong>lovely delivery,</strong> shaping in, hitting the seam, nipping away with pace and bounce. Can't touch those!"
"banged in short, into the hip, and Shanaka does his best Shakira impression, shimmying those hips and flicking it emphatically over backward square leg! What a strike! Nortje has to go and retrieve the ball from the stands, to add an extra sheen of indignity to the moment"
"nip off the seam, thudding into the midriff"
"leaning forward, stabbed into the covers, nine runs from Ngidi's first over, and Sri Lanka are off to another flyer today"
"chiselled off the toes, hitting on the up through midwicket, a long chase as they turn for two"
"fuller length, wide line outside off, that's at 139kph, so Nortje not completely letting rip just yet, feeling his way into the morning"
"tighter line, solidly pressed back down the pitch to mid-off"
"driven, but not timed, high on the bat back to the bowler in his followthrough"
"compact in defence, head over the ball, leaning forward to smother the length ball to cover"

"tapped to the leg side, another single"
"hits the seam, but in a non-threatening manner, well back of a length and jagging safely round the edge of the bat"
"has a flash at this one, as Ngidi hits a better length outside off. Eludes the splice as it kicks through to the keeper"
jabbed into the covers once more
"outside off again, slightly too wide to demand a stroke but Rajitha has a dart anyway"
"dragged onto the front foot, and beaten outside off"
"genuine edge, and <B>eludes fourth slip for another boundary!</B> Aggressive fast bowling, hitting the bat hard and drawing the fat deflection, but that's picked the gap to perfection!"
"too straight this time, and easily flicked to midwicket. The runs keep flowing"
"angled bat, into the covers, thinks about the single but the shy persuades him otherwise"
"more snorting pace and bounce, and<strong> another one zings out of de Kock's reach</strong> behind the stumps! That was climbing past Rajitha's nose, and swung late as well to make life even more awkward!"
"attempted yorker, lots of bat on it as fourth slip tumbles to intercept"
"another sharp bouncer, Shanaka limboes out of harm's way as this one thuds safely into de Kock's gloves. it's lively, but the 50 partnership came up with those byes, and it's come at a fair lick too"
"head over the ball, dead-batted back to the bowler"
"dragged into a loose drive on a fourth-fifth stump line. Still a fraction too wide to guarantee an edge, but Rajitha is tempted outside his eyeline all the same"
"<B>edge this time, but thumps du Plessis on the shin at second slip!</B> That reached him on the half-volley, did well to save the runs to be fair"
"wider on the crease, no stroke needed there"
"bite from a good length, Rajitha rips his hand off the bat handle as the ball pops into his gloves"
"leaning forward, that's solid defence to the fuller ball, another over eaten up with minimal fuss"
"back of a length, not the genuine short ball yet, but fenced cautiously off the back foot to gully"
"<B>absolutely hammered over deep midwicket!</B> That was telegraphed like a homing pigeon trained in semaphore, and Shanaka swivelled across the line almost before the ball had arrived, flinging his front leg to square leg to open up his stance and pound his way to a maiden Test fifty!"
"making room again, and can't connect this time"
"rocking back, <B>open that stance, free those arms!</B> Lambasted over third man with a wildly what-the-hell slap up and over!"
"another retreat and slash, and another boundary is saved only by the placement of a long-stop behind the keeper's head! This is thrillingly silly batting!"
"banged in short, and Rajitha is thumped on the upper arm! It is all happening in this over, but nothing is happening quite as much as Sri Lanka's run-spree!"
"line and length, and a hint of extra bounce. Pollock-esque first delivery, blocked back down the pitch"
"another good delivery, concentrating on seam movement from a perfect length, and this one nips back into the thigh"
"wider line, hits the seam again and jags further towards the slips. No stroke offered"
pressed to mid-on with a full face of the bat
seam and bounce from a perfect fourth-stump line. That has sailed past the edge. Lovely stuff
"back of a length, keeps low and thumps the pad! Marais Erasmus is unmoved, but South Africa are <B>reviewing!</B> It was adjacent, but my instinct was it was leg-sided. It may be umpire's call at best, nope missing. On we go"
"well bowled, finding that nibbly full length, and jagging one back into the thigh-pad"
"<B>edged and gone!</B> That's the way to do it! Hitting the right length at pace, with a bit of nip off the seam and good carry. Elgar at second slip accepts the fizzing edge deep in his chest, and a valiant stand is broken by the new boy"
"<B>two in a row!</B> And that's a sight for sore fast-bowling eyes! Full, fast, straight, an upright seam with a hint of away movement, and the off stump is uprooted! A fist-pump from Sipamla, and suddenly South Africa have a spring in their step!"
"<B>nearly!</B> Fuller length again, attacking the stumps, and ... it's a no-ball, so it wouldn't have counted anyway"
"back and across, and blocked uneasily on the back foot"
dead-batted into the off side
"aggressive full length to the left-hander, shaping towards the cordon and stoutly blocked. Sipamla has a spring in his step as he ends his over"
"a step and swipe from Shanaka, giving himself toom to thwack Mulder off his length, but can't connect this time"
"another wipe through the line, finds thin air as Mulder seams another away"
beaten outside off once more by a disciplined line and length
"pace and bounce, vertical take-off from outside off, as Shanaka shoulders arms"
"fractionally tighter to the stumps this time, and an opportunity to shovel a flick to the leg side"
"round the wicket to the leftie, and fired down the leg side"
"jabbed out through point, leaning onto the front foot"
"<B>back of a length, and battered onto the grass banks!</B> Shanaka is anchored on the back foot to the quicks, and that extra split second is priceless whenever the ball drops short. Smoked over the ropes!"
"much fuller, punched into the covers, but declines the single"
"full again, flicked to the on-side, Kumara has two balls to survive"
"round the wicket, short, ducked"
"<B>edged, dropped, juggled, fumbled, snaffled!</B> Kumara flinched into a duck, but left his bat in harm's way as he did so, a fizzing deflection took van der Dussen by surprise at first slip, and he so nearly muffed it. But having played pat-a-cake two or three times, including a useful knee, he wraps his fingers round the ball to secure Sipamla's fourth, and bring a enterprising Sri Lanka innings to an end."

"fullish outside off, Elgar lunges at it and it squirts away towards backward point via the outside third of the bat"
"length ball, dabbed towards backward point again"
"<strong>edged, and short!</strong> Fell short of Kusal Mendis at second slip. Sixth-stump line, Elgar was crablike in defence and his hands were soft enough that it didn't carry to Mendis via the outside edge"

"nips away off the seam, dangerous line in the channel outside off. Markram lets it go"
"overpitched, half-volley outside off, and this <b>flies out of the middle of Markram's bat!</b> Bit of a freebie, but he pressed forward to send this rocketing to the cover boundary. And he's overstepped, to make things worse"
"slightly overpitched again, 85mph/137kph, and pressed into the covers to get off strike"

"back of a length, and Markram jumps onto the back foot to defend"

"a fraction back of a length, Elgar defends from the crease towards mid-on"
"<strong>beauty!</strong> Length ball, pushed across him in the off-stump channel, and there's just a hint of movement away off the seam to beat the outside edge of Elgar's waft"
"strays down the leg side, another freebie for Elgar. Way down the leg side on a length, and Elgar clips off the hip down to fine leg for four. A hint of inside edge, but more than enough to deflect it away to the boundary"
"fired down the leg side again, and this time Elgar wasn't too far away from getting a little tickle on its way through to Dickwella"

"length ball wide of the off stump, left alone"
"fullish in the off-stump channel, Elgar defends awkwardly, diverting it into the leg side"

"hung wide outside off stump, Markram shoulders arms"

"<strong>edged, but safely through the cordon for four!</strong> Length ball, awkward line on fourth stump, and Markram press forwards to defend with soft hands. It took the outside edge, but bounce some way short of the slips, and flew through the gap between second slip and gully"

clipped off the hip out to deep square leg
"back of a length, dabbed into the covers with soft hands. 80mph/129kph"

"wide on the crease, flat outside off without much turn. Pressed into the covers"
"tossed up on fourth stump, pressed out to extra cover on the half-volley"
"<B>Massive appeal first-up, and Sri Lanka review!</B> Elgar was thumped on the knee-roll by one that skidded on, but was it missing off? Umpire Erasmus thought so. Yep, I reckon so. Comfortably in fact."
solidly into line to defend
"onto the front foot, and <strong>clumped down the ground!</strong> Elgar's crouching stance allows him to crab onto the offensive, pounding his bat through the line"
"opens the face on the back foot, and sliced to point"
firmly forward once again

"drops the hands outside off, this one doesn't get up half as much"
"cutting back in on a good length, worked to the on-side with a closed face"

"<B>sizzler!</B> Lifting outside off stump, angling back in as it comes, and Elgar has to drop his hands in a hurry to avoid splicing that to the keeper"
tucked to square leg for another single
"rising into the hip, good lift off the deck, but all Markram has to do is hop inside the line and deflect that off his body through fine leg. The wheels are wobbly for Sri Lanka"

"lots of air outside off, pressed to short cover on the front foot"
flicked from a middle-and-leg line to mid-on

"<B>another bouncer, another set of byes!</B> It's becoming a pattern in this Test, hit that sweet spot, and watch the ball sail over everyone's head!"
"extra pop from a full length, Kumara is up for the lbw, very ambitious, but Markram is more concerned about the ball rolling back towards his stumps. Good footwork to avert disaster"
"a flogged drive, on the front foot, grabbed in the followthrough"

"nip from a full length, jabbed down to gully with hard hands"
"prodded to cover, up on the toes in defence"
"width, and <strong>room to slash the wrists through the line!</strong> Loose from Elgar, but it was calculated aggression, and his fat outside edge whizzed high over the cordon. Can't defend those!"
"fuller length, more conventional punch into the covers, and well intercepted with a scramble"
"over the wicket, dipping on middle and off, and blocked with a big stride"
"back of a length on the legbreak, clipped to square leg"

"swatted through square leg, pure bludgeon as Hasaranga drops too short"
"short again, wider line, <strong>clubbed supremely through the covers</strong>, off the back foot!"
"<strong>three fours in a row to romp to fifty!</strong> On the legs again, timed sweetly past the man at backward square. South Africa are flying as drinks approach"
"back of a length from round the wicket, chipped to the leg side"
"this is getting messy for Sri Lanka now, another leg-stump long-hop, and Elgar has only to lean his bat into the stroke, all timing and angles through square leg"
pressed to the leg side once more
"nip off the seam once again, there's still life in this deck if you can find some consistency. Markram is well beaten"
full face of the bat to blot back down the line
"zip off the seam, back into the pads as Markram shoulders arms! Half an appeal, but that's climbing over the stumps"

"fullish and straight, nudged out to midwicket"
"wrong 'un, punched into the covers on the back foot"

"good carry through to the keeper this time, as Markram lets it go"
"fuller on fourth stump, dug out towards mid-on"
"fullish outside off, and slightly loose from Markram for once. He inside-edges into the back pad"
"steered out to point on the back foot, and they jog through for one"
"length ball in the off-stump channel, Elgar shoulders arms. Plenty of noise from behind the stumps as Dickwella and the slip cordon look to keep Sri Lanka energised"
"<strong>great shot</strong>. Markram is in such good touch. This isn't particularly wide outside the off stump, but Markram sits deep in the crease and waits to cut behind square for four. No real turn for Hasaranga"
"<strong>four more</strong>. A very different shot, but just as elegant. Full on the pads from Hasaranga, and Markram whips wristily through straight midwicket, past the despairing dive of the fielder"
"googly, outside off stump, punched to cover on the back foot"
"legbreak which turns appreciably, as Markram defends from the crease with a prod"
"hint of turn, and this keeps lowish outside off as Markram fences out to deep cover"
"overpitched on the pads, and tickled round the corner for one"
flicked away to keep the strike turning over
"length ball, wide outside off, and left alone"
"wide on the crease, slightly back of a length, and Markram shoulders arms"
"<strong>loose drive, and gone!</strong> Markram throws his head back in frustration. He had looked a million dollars throughout, but this was one big shot too many. Sri Lanka have their first. Fernando persevered with his round-the-wicket ploy, bowling wide on the crease and hanging a wide ball, slightly full of a length, outside the off stump. Markram threw the bat at it, getting a thick edge, and Shanaka, the man at backward point or wide gully, took a sharp catch at head height"
"hung outside off from round the wicket, and left alone"
"length ball outside off, van der Dussen lets it sail through"
"flat legbreak, pushed firmly back to the bowler"

"crab-like defensive shot to a full, straight legbreak"
"full outside off, driven watchfully into the covers"
"googly, which van der Dussen doesn't pick. He inside-edges down towards fine leg, and gets off the mark with a streaky single"
"hangs a length ball outside off, grunting as he delivers. Rassie leaves it alone"
"hung outside off once more, and left alone. Vishwa is bowling patiently, trying to force another error of judgement"
"length ball outside off, pushed out to deep cover for one"
squirted away into the covers via the outside third of the bat
"short ball, with his pace down at 77mph/123kph. It sails harmlessly over the ducking Elgar, and Erasmus decides it's a wide"
"short and wide outside off, but Elgar toe-ends the cut shot, finding point on the bounce"
"length ball, skewed into the covers for a quick single"
"sharp, hard-spun legbreak, which Elgar clips off the pads for a single to square leg"
"good turn outside the off stump, as vdD lets it go"

"drawn forward, pressing out into the covers"
"long hop, and Elgar <strong>bludgeons it disdainfully for four</strong>. This has been Hasaranga's issue, one freebie per over. Short leg was in the firing line as Elgar lined up the pull, but managed to get out the way"
worked out to deep midwicket to retain the strike
"fullish and straight, worked for a quick single into the leg side"
"banged in halfway down, and it doesn't get up off the pitch at all. 88mph/143kph, but it loops harmlessly through to Dickwella"
"back of a length, steered into the off side on the back foot"
"low full toss in the off-stump channel, toe-ended to short cover"
"short ball outside off stump at 83mph/134kph, and van der Dussen drops the hands to let it go through. He gets a glare from Kumara in his follow through"
"length ball, angled in, and pressed towards mid-on. More noise from the slip cordon, with Sri Lanka geeing themselves up"
"full and straight, Karunaratne gets down well to field at short midwicket"
"Hasaranga gives it plenty of air, tossing it up above the eyeline, and Elgar clips straight to midwicket"
"flatter and too short this time, but Elgar can only nudge to short leg on the bounce"
"the inevitable drag-down, and Elgar rocks onto the back foot and clubs hard out to deep square. Embuldeniya, one of the sub fielders, makes hard work of it, diving on the rope, and the TV umpire takes his time checking whether his foot was in contact with the rope. This is dragging on far too long.... and he's given four, eventually"

"banged in, back of a length, and defended into the leg side"
"ooft, keeps a little low outside off and shoots below the bottom of Elgar's bat as he drives"
"drops a fraction too short, and <strong>Elgar tucks into it.</strong> He picks the length up very early, and belts a pull in front of square. Reached him around rib height"
"short again, up at 89mph/144kph this time, and it beats everyone. Elgar ducks underneath it, Dickwella jumps up at full stretch, and can only get a fingertip to it as it takes off"
"banged in halfway down at 89mph/144kph, and dabbed into the off side. Kumara has his tail up"
"back of a length outside off, 88mph/142kph, and left alone by van der Dussen"

"hung outside off, left alone"
"an edge straightaway, but it's only a thin nick into the ground as vdD drives with hard hands outside off"
"<B>that's more like it from Rassie!</B> Over-pitched outside off, and that is timed so sweetly through the covers, just leaning into the shot with a big stride"

"back of a length from round the wicket, jabbed with high wrists to cover"

"swinging into the pads, and just tickled with the angle, very fine indeed, to move into the 90s"

"very full, very straight, solid block back down the track"
"angled into the pads, Rassie walks inside the line to deflect to fine leg"
"banged in short, Elgar ducks once more"
"<strong>sharp lifter, right into the armpit! </strong>But Elgar rides it well, leaping high to jam the ball down into the leg side"
"into the armpit again! This could be a fun battle, Elgar keeps it down well, albeit off his bottom glove. Short leg is in the action here..."
"short again, but not as venomous, and Elgar is able to waft a pull around the corner, which ends up as a bonus boundary as <strong>Perera makes a hash of his gather!</strong>"
"banged in short again, confidently fenced wide of short leg, who sprawls well to prevent the single. Lively over!"
"dangled outside off at 125kph, and holding its line past the outside edge. Well bowled"
"shaping back into the pads, from just outside off, vdD kneels into a block"
"width outside off, no need to play at that one"
"<B>lovely delivery!</B> Shanaka has found that spot that Wiaan Mulder was able to exploit at a similar pace. Nibble and bounce, exploding past a confounded outside edge!"
"strong response, onto the front foot to block to cover"

"through to the keeper, and no stroke offered"
"kneeling onto the front foot, defended with a full face"
"<B>edged, and finally, Kumara snags one in the channel!</B> He's earned that one, probing away. Rassie leans forward, not totally committed to the in-between length, and snicks the thinnest of deflections to Dickwella. A glimmer for Sri Lanka"
"outside off, shaping gently across Elgar's bows. No stroke"
"keeps a touch low on a wider line, hint of outswing, Elgar stabs his bat into the covers"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"<B>spanked back to the bowler, and Elgar is gone!</B> What a way to give away a century, almost his first false stroke. A slap through the line, on a slottable length, and Shanaka was just in the right place in his followthrough, sticking out a reflexive pair of mitts to swallow the chance to his left, almost behind him in the end! That glimmer is a genuine shaft of golden sunlight now!"
"back of a length, chiselled to deep midwicket, and hauled back in after a good chase"

"tapped to cover with cocked wrists, an easy single into the gap"

"short, and <B>crashed through fine leg with a twiddle at the crease!</B> Gets big on him, but he gets on top of the bounce brilliantly. QDK is motoring!"
"width outside off, no stroke this time"
flashed through square leg off a fat inside-edge
"<B>another one gone, and it's a ripper too!</B> Hasaranga has his maiden Test wicket and it's a superb topspinner, pitching and biting with extra bounce, squaring QDK up with feet going nowhere, and a sharp take at slip too as the ball fizzed off the edge. Sri Lanka have found their second wind after a forlorn first three hours in the field. This is getting lively!"
"back of a length, twisting into the right-hander who pats back to the bowler off the back foot"

"width, and a perfectly placed cut through backward point, using the pace to place it through the gap. Lurverly"
stabbed into the covers
"angled into the right hander from round the wicket, who leaves alone outside off, that's well judged as his off stump was in peril"
"patted into the covers, and a wild shy at the non-striker's end gifts Bavuma four freebies!"
"thumps the pad, a big appeal, but no review as that was looking to be shaping down leg"
"right behind the line, worked to the leg side"
"up onto the toes, a dragged-down googly, and patted back when it came"
"fizzed past the off stump, no stroke this time"
"chipped off the front foot, back to the bowler"
"right over the ball, leaning onto the front foot to block"
leaning forward to block back to the bowler
"stabbed to cover, and that's the end of the 50 overs... probably left a few out there after a flying start, but 235 for 4 is plenty to work with ... amirite?"
"round the wicket again, through to the keeper"
"shaping into the right-hander from round the wicket, firm in defence again"
"thumps the pad, sliding past leg stump, Dickwella collects"

"back and across, nudged to midwicket and Bavuma declines the second, wisely"
"<B>jaffa!</B> Round the wicket, tight line and length, explodes off the seam and wriggles past the outside edge. That will be drinks, after Sri Lanka's best half-session with the ball by a distance"
"pitched up, and driven to short extra cover"
"wide on the crease, <strong>edged</strong>, but safely away for four. Decent turn from a length, Bavuma threw his hand at it without any foot movement, and sent it wide of the solitary slip"
"tossed up, punched back to Hasaranga"
"googly, blocked solidly back down the pitch"
"hint of turn, Bavuma drops it into the off side looking for a single but is sent back by Faf"
"drag down, Bavuma picks up the length quickly, rocks onto the back foot, and clubs over midwicket. Short leg was ducking for cover, and that is a disdainful shot"
"keeps low from wide on the crease, round the wicket, and Faf jams the bat down to defend towards mid-on"
"length ball on fifth stump, clipped behind square on the leg side for one"
"short and wide, Faf shapes to cut but miscues it to cover on the bounce"
"overpitched, and Faf simply clips off the pads down to fine leg for four, bringing up the 250 in the process"
"length ball on fifth stump, defended into the covers on the back foot"
"grunts as he lands this on a length outside the off stump, as du Plessis watches it into the keeper's hands"

As the gloves came forward, the boot was grounded, but then his foot came up at almost exactly the same moment that the bail started to go.

"flat outside off, cut through point for a single"
"<b>does him with the googly</b>, and up goes the finger! Sipamla reviews, was it sliding down leg...? Miles away from the inside edge, and I reckon it'll be clipping at least. Hasaranga's not a big turner of the ball, and Hawk-Eye has it thumping into leg stump, so it's a golden duck on his first outing as a Test batsman! Hasaranga, also on debut, is one away from a five-for"

"slips in another googly, angling in on the stumps but clipped neatly around the corner for a couple"
"No higher, evidently. A length ball, on middle stump, Maharaj swivels as he attempts to pull, skies it and <b>there's a man there to take the catch</b>. The hobbling Hasaranga makes excellent ground running round to his right towards third man and looks thrilled to have snaffled the ball"

"<b>gottim</b>, that's the perfect line! Sipamla gets his fifth wicket of what is becoming an impressive debut, drawing Shanaka forward with one that pitched on fourth stump and held its line at 138kph, de Kock doing the rest. SA closing in"
"short of a length, angling in to clip him on the body, flies away to backward square leg"
"pushed through outside off stump, Hasaranga goes back and cuts, finds backward point"
"flat delivery, angled in and he chops down behind square again"
"quicker still, on the stumps and punched in front of point on the back foot"
"Maharaj hurries the ball through, again played from back in front of the stumps"
"speared in and <b>belted over the leg side!</b> Hasaranga picks his spot, gets low and mullers four through cow corner"
"<b>oh dear, has it ended with a run-out...?</b> Mix-up between the batsmen, Fernando stranded down the pitch, and although the relay back to Maharaj is sloppy he does well to collect and break the stumps! But SL aren't done yet, from the sounds of it"
round the wicket and that's blocked in front
blocked back in the direction of the bowler
fended just to the leg side
another defensive block
""
"chipped up onto the leg side, it falls short of the man at mid on"
cut away towards point
pressed back down into the pitch
prodded away to the off side
"shaping to drive, but blocked back to the bowler"
defended in front
prodded to the off side
he blocks in front
turned to the leg side
""
turned to the legs side again
"targeting legs stump, he turns it away"
that one beat the bat as he looked to work it to the leg side
on middle and leg but he steps to give himself room and whacks it away through mid off
"similar ball and result, lovely shot, skipping down the wicket"
and again that same area down the ground to the off side
tickled fine towards third man
on off stump and blocked back to the bowler
"defensive shot to the leg side, ends an expensive over"
"good line, worked away towards midwicket"
"floating outside off, he presses down into the pitch"
just outside off and blocked
"floating full on middle, he steps back slightly and presses away"
"a push to the leg side, they set off, get a fair way before thinking, thinking again and turning back, the batsman makes his ground comfortably"
"wow, lovely shot, creamed to the leg side and it goes <b>all the way</b>"
floating onto middle and prodded away in the direction of midwicket
blocked back towards the bowler
well outside off and he can let that one go comfortably
""
"tighter line, pins him back but he blocks"
"strikes low on the front pad but looks to be drifting down the leg side, muting a half-shout. Nice maiden"
well outside off and Hasaranga <b>brings up 50</b> with a lovely stroke through long off
prodded away in defence
angling slightly onto off stump and worked away towards mid off
"just outside off, he carves that nicely between third slip and gully <b>it races away</b>"
"just outside off, driven towards mid off, where there's a man to collect"
"shorter ball, outside off, he chips that over the bowler's head, Sipamla, reaches up in vain as the ball finds the boundary"
""
"shorter ball, it leapt up, Rajitha stuck his bat out in front and it might have hit his finger before dropping into the pitch. He's hobbling round very gingerly in his crease"
prodded away behind him
"similar short ball, rearing up, looks to have hit the bottom hand and he pulled it out of the way"
"pressed to short cover, it strikes the fielder on the lower leg there, no damage done, by the looks"
another one bouncing up has him on the hop and pulling bat and hands clear as it goes over the stumps
short ball angling back into the stumps he hits hit hard into his own pad
"and that's <b>Hasaranga gone</b>. Back of a length and ouside off, he lofts that down the ground and Bavuma swallows the catch coming in from long off"
"bouncer, he swats at it and misses"
"just outside off, a swing and a miss"
""
"fourth-stump channel, 83mph, it goes through to the keeper"
"on off stump, turned away towards mid wicket"
"and Nortje <b>gets the final wicket</b>. South Africa win by an innings and 45 runs! Short of a length, gets an outside edge as he steers to gully, where Keshav Maharaj takes a sharp catch at shoulder height."
