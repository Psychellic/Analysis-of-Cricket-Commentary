"reaches out to drive, hit straight to point"
"oh, dear. Terrible stroke and he's gone. That's a chance wasted. Samson looks to hoick across the line from outside off, gets a top-edge and Santner at cover takes an excellent catch as the ball descends. A quality player like him shouldn't be rushing through to play strokes when he has the entire innings left for himself. He'll be cursing himself for the rest of the evening for missing out on this flat deck"
punched straight to point
"whizzes past the glove as Rahul looks to help it along. No-ball called, Kuggleijn can't believe it. 'What's that a wide for?' he asks. Umpire signals no-ball since this was the second bouncer in the over. <strong>Poor call, no way was that over the head</strong>"
"cross-seam delivery, full outside off but flirts with the wide line. KL deceived by the slower one and misses. Wide, so the free-hit stays"

"short ball again, fends it towards point. Tucked for room"

"makes room again, Southee follows him but a bit too much. Wide down leg"
"<strong>loud appeal from Southee</strong> as Pandey shuffles across and tries to scoop it fine on leg, but it was going high. Pandey went across and was only on his right leg when he got hit, gets a leg bye too"
"drives on the up on off, doesn't middle it as it's short of length and he gets enough to find the gap behind square. Colin Munro gives the chase towards third man and he does very well to slide and keep the ball <em>just</em> inside and save one"

"short around off now, he slaps it back with some power and gets two towards long off"

"swing and a miss outside off for the full delivery, Pandey is well in time to reach the keeper's end for a bye. Seifert misses the direct hit before the bowler has a shy at the non-striker's end. He hits but the third umpire checks that Saini has made it"
worked wide of mid-on to get off the mark immediately
"beaten on the drive. This was full, angling away and right in the slot. No feet"
"pulled but no control, down to Samson at deep midwicket"

"yorker on the base of leg stump, squeezed past midwicket"
looking to muscle it over mid-on but this length delivery nips back in to beat his swing

works it gently towards deep midwicket
"top-edge, taken by Rahul! Looking to whip this off his hip but the incoming length ball flew off the top edge. The ball was swirling for a while, Rahul called for it loud and clear, trembled just a hint as he saw the ball sway, but was right under it to pouch it."

They came back for the second but Thakur from the deep threw the ball directly to Kohli at cover, who then darted the ball to smash the stumps at the keeper's end. Munro was taken by surprise and fell short when he was running casually"
""
appeal for lbw from Dube but it was going down leg after he hit Bruce on the back pad outside leg

"some width outside off, Taylor cuts and gets one to deep point"
two fielders from the leg side converging towards deep midwicket after Seifert pulls a short ball and it lands beyond both of them. The third umpire checking now if it landed inside or hit the rope on the full. Looks like it landed directly on the ad triangles. And it's six

"<strong>lofted over mid off for four</strong>! A length delivery around of, he swings and gets enough to clear the fielder in the ring, he gets the pressure down"
"Rahul has hit the stumps at the keeper's end as they were sneaking a bye in, replays confirm <strong>Seifert has fallen short</strong>! A slower short ball outside off, Mitchell missed completely and Seifert ran hard for the bye, dragged his bat in but it wasn't enough because someone has finally got a direct hit - KL Rahul!"
"pulls the short ball past short midwicket for a single, <strong>Santner slips at the bowler's end</strong>. There's drama on every delivery"
