"lovely length, squares Khawaja up as he defends from the crease"
"full and swinging across, left alone"
rooted to the crease as he negotiates this full delivery on leg stump
whips this wide of the diving Vijay Shankar at square leg. Delightful balance and wrist work. Bhuvi punished for going too short.
"touch fuller, just around off stump, defended"
gets right on top of the bounce and turns this short of length delivery into the leg side. Decent first over to begin with.
<strong>beauty!</strong> Drew him forward with a full length delivery and got it to move away off the seam. Moved a long way away after it passed the bat. That should wake up Finch
<b> nearly chopped on! </b> Looks to force this length ball on the up but he's cramped for room. Manages to scamper a run and get off the mark. Rolled just wide of leg stump.
"slants one nice and full across the left-hander, defended"
"works this full-length delivery towards mid-on. Nice, tight line from Shami"
<strong>crunching cover drive!</strong> Errs in length by a very small margin and gets spanked. Juicy half-volley

"plants forward, uses the width and flays this on the up through extra cover. Driving without a trace of worry that time. Lovely execution"
"full outside off, defends towards Jadeja at point as they scamper a quick single"
"huge appeal, huge appeal but Joel Wilson says not out immediately. Kohli straightaway went up to his bowler to ask if he wanted to go upstairs. <b> They decide against DRS </B>. This was definitely sliding down leg, but worth an appeal? Could've come back as umpire's call"
"the whip of the wrists! Magnificent. Too short from Bhuvi, Khawaja stands tall and wrists this behind square on the leg side to pepper the short boundary."
"stopped well on the followthrough! This was hit back hard, Bhuvi put his left hand out to half-stop."
"still finds the leg side gap, but hits this straight to fine leg."
"balance and timing absolutely impeccable as he puts this juicy half-volley on the pads to the midwicket boundary. Poor from Shami, no batsman worth his salt will miss out on a gift like this."
"beauty! Good comeback. Gets one to angle in and nip away off the deck, Khawaja has a poke but misses."
we're seeing wrist work of the highest quality here! Khawaja plays a magical on-drive to this incoming length ball. The non-striker had to just get his bat out of the way to see this scream away to the boundary.
"goes for a big drive, but this swerves in a long way, gets a thick inside edge to mid-on where Bumrah misfields"
driven on the up but straight to extra cover
"excellent delivery. Angles one back in off a length, Finch plays outside the line to get an inside edge onto the pad."

driven down the ground but straight to Vijay at mid-off
"<strong>cracker-jack!</strong> Finch feels for one that leaves him ever-so-slightly off the seam as the ball whizzes past the outside edge. Magic, pure magic"
thuds into the pad as it slants back in off a length. Finch beten for pace
<strong>delightful square drive!</strong> You know it's well timed when Ravindra Jadeja gives up chase from backward point.

"<b> tumbling stop by Gabbar Dhawan at long leg! </b> This one was nicely whipped off is hip, saved a couple of runs for the side"
"<b> direct hit from Kohli </b> running in from cover point but Finch seems in. Khawaja walked into the drive but was cramped for room and got it off a thick inside edge onto the pad. Fortunately for Australia, there was no hesitation between the pair."
"slants one back in, defended."
goes right back and across to punch this back
"nearly chopped onto the stumps as he looks to run it down towards third man, Pant hares in to prevent a run"
works this length ball on off to midwicket
"mix-up, mix-up, but no damage done. Khawaja whips to Shami at mid-on, takes a few steps across, but fortunately turns back in the nick of time."
"<strong>lovely off-drive, no one moved.</strong> This is superb, not a bad ball by any means but he just leans into the drive and times it magnificently"

tucks this down to fine leg
"full and straight on the stumps, defended to mid-on"

"slants in, keeps a touch low but Finch defends"

"starts with a googly that pitches outside leg, Finch struck on the body as he plays all around it."
"steps out, doesn't quite get to the pitch but ends up hitting it off a thick inside edge towards long-on"
"drifts into middle and leg, he steps out and works this low full toss wide of mid-on"
"wrong'un on a length, Finch goes back and across as he tucks it to deep square leg."
solid hit! Excellent use of the feet to get to the pitch as he wallops it over long-on. Short straight boundaries but that would've cleared the biggest of them all. Clean hit
"rocks back and plays this very late to beat short third man, Bhuvi in pursuit but manages to pull it back in"
"length ball angling in, kept out."
tucks this incoming delivery to midwicket
right back into the crease as he defends back
solidly behind the line of this incoming length ball as he keeps it out

driven firmly but straight to mid-off
"drifting down leg, Pant can't get across and collect cleanly, but no extra runs outside the wide"
steps out and drives inside-out to wide long-off
<strong>steps out and bang! </strong> Kuldeep didn't even try to put hit hand out on the followthrough.
"belted back, somehow Kuldeep half-stops and parries it towards midwicket. He really gave this a whack"
lunges forward and smothers this wrong'un with soft hands
steps out and negotiates this shortish delivery into the leg side.
"nice flight and dip, defended back"
"paddled down to fine leg. Predetermined paddle, gets away. Got well outside the line to try and execute that"
tucks this wide of square leg. Got well forward and then brought his wrists into play
"<strong>ripper of a delivery!</strong> When he starts like this, he's a different bowler. It's the fizz off the pitch that does the trick. Fires this in towards length on middle, Finch is drawn forward by the angle but then sees this ball spin away just about enough to beat the straight bat to smash into the stumps. What a ball, what a bowler."
"drifting into the pads, worked positively to mid-on"
lunges forward and smothers this.
tucks this wide of square leg to get off the mark
"makes room and cuts to deep point, hint of confusion. Handscomb wanted the second, Khawaja didn't"
"draws him into a drive with tossed up delivery, Khawaja tempted to drive but lets go"
steps out and turns this full and flat delivery wide of midwicket
"swept from a long way outside off, the timing and placement is magnificent! Cracking stroke, best part is that is risk-free. Rolled his wrists over the delivery to keep it all along the ground. No chance for deep square."
"through with the sweep even before the ball arrived, may have got a thin edge onto it as this lobs over the keeper's head off the top-edge. Races away, lucky runs but he'll take them."
steps out and drives this full toss to extra cover.
"tosses it up outside off, he guides it to point"
"<b>there's fifty</b> and it comes off a well judged sweep shot, getting down low, picking the length ball well outside off - which puts lbw out of play - and rolling his wrists on top of the ball to prevent the top edge"
"excellent batting! He spots the short ball early, leaps back in his crease and using the full face of the bat, punches it through cover"
waits on the flatter delivery outside off and dinks it around the corner behind square leg
"good bowling. He tosses it up onto middle stump, and with Handscomb's fondness for staying back in the crease, he needs to be extra careful putting bat to the ball. And he is, with a flick behind square leg"
"the wrists save Khawaja there as he rolls them on top of a rapidly dipping delivery, and even though he is nowhere near the pitch of it outside off, he is able to keep it down to midwicket. Good end to the over from Jadeja. He looks India's most threatening bowler right now"
leans forward onto leg stump and turns the left-arm legbreak to square leg
"rocks back against a ball that is only slightly short in length, making room to take it off the stumps, but can't find the gap at cover point"
"shimmies down a little bit, but Kuldeep pulls his length back just enough that Handscomb is happy to nudge it to square leg"
"goes for the sweep, taking a tossed up delivery outside off and directing it to fine leg. Might have been risky on other pitches, but here, where there is low bounce, batsmen don't have to fear the top-edge"
"there we go again. <b>That's Handscomb's whole plan against Kuldeep</b>. Whenever he pitches it up, he gets down low and plays a very <b>measured sweep</b>. Head still, fully balanced and such lovely hands to keep it down"
defends the tossed up ball outside off with an open face
"hangs back against a length ball angling into him, making room to punch it through the covers"
"premeditates the sweep, which allows Jadeja to toss the ball up well outside off and beat the left-hander. Or beat him enough that the bottom edge pings onto his own pad"
this time the sweep works as Jadeja goes faster and flatter outside off. Single behind square leg
stays inside the line - which seems to be his plan against Jadeja - and drives the tossed pu ball on leg stump back at the bowler. Good dive from Jadeja to stop it
pushes back to defend a flatter delivery on leg stump
goes a little wide of the crease to spear the ball on leg stump but Handscomb's footwork and balance is so good that he has absolutely no trouble driving inside-out to long-off
"steps out and lifts the part-timer to the wide long-on boundary. Welcome back Kedar. I've missed you, says Handscomb"
poor shot selection - Handscomb goes to sweep Jadhav but this ball is basically a yorker on middle stump and his inside edge basically saves him from an early walk back
"shimmies down the track and drives a tossed up delivery, drifting away from the right-hander, to long-off"
loops it up from round the wicket and Khawaja taps it down to long-on
stays beside the line of the ball outside off and dabs it to short third man
"good length outside off, Khawaja knocks it down to the right of Jadhav, who tries to stop if himself, but his dive doesn't quite work"
pulls off the <b>reverse sweep</b> and Shami has a race on his hands. Does well to stop it on the edge of the boundary. Good length ball outside off was basically inviting the shot and the field was placed in expectation of a top edge
"full on off stump, he presses forward to block"
"stays back, opens up his body so he can whip a good length ball from outside off away through midwicket. Excellent batting against spin"
"defends the tossed up delivery, dipping at the last, on him with a perfectly straight bat. Good spot from Khawaja"
"loads up the reverse sweep, and even though the flatter, quicker delivery is cramping him on leg stump, he's able to find a single to deep square leg"
angles the full delivery into the pads and Handscomb deftly turns it behind square leg
"<b>oooh, is that reverse<b/>? Shami is able to get a fuller delivery to curl into the right-hander, but not so dangerously that Handscomb isn't able to pick it away through midwicket"
"tries to tie him down on leg stump again, but Handscomb whips it behind square leg"
"<b>that is glorious</b>! Gets up to his full height and swivels on the back foot, totally in control of the pull shot, and the ball just disappears like it finds a pocket dimension that leads to the midwicket boundary"
"fullish and outside off, he drives to mid-off"
"<b>beats him</b> outside off! This is sexy old-ball bowling. Hits the deck, gets it to respond and Khawaja's hopeful glide to third man comes off second best"
"another short ball, this time though he targets Khawaja's right armpit, refusing him the room that was given earlier in the over. The pull shot comes out again but only for a single through square leg"
"flicks a tossed up ball outside off towards long-on, but Jadeja puts in the dive"
"with the ball pitching outside off, he's happy to go for the reverse sweep. No chance of lbw. No chance of runs either on this occasion as it finds point"
whips the quicker delivery on leg stump to long-on
"waits nicely on middle and leg, allowing the flighted ball to come to him, and then rolls his wrists on it, directing it to midwicket"
lunges forward trying to get to the pitch of the ball outside off and drives along the ground towards long-off. Jadeja won't allow that
"wanders outside leg, picking the length as short, and slices the ball on off stump behind point. Serene batting against spin"
walks down the pitch and hacks the back of a length ball straight of midwicket for a quick single.
"the short ball isn't working on this pitch. There just isn't enough bounce for that to be a reasonably tactic. Shami bangs it into the deck as well as he could, but it just sits up for Khawaja to hammer it over midwicket. Straight of midwicket even"
goes round the wicket - because that last ball had soooooo much room - and he <B>beats him immediately</b>. The length is a lot better - trapping the batsman in his crease - and Khawaja's slice behind point makes him look less than the most in-form batsman of the series
waits on the back of a length delivery to come onto him and the deflects it to long leg
steps forward to the shortish delivery outside off and steers it to point
cramps him with a quick and short delivery on off stump and Khawaja has to jump off his crease to get on top of the ball and knock it down
"his back foot play is always top-class. Judges the ball to be short and on off stump, so he makes a little room and gently steers the bal lthrough point"
gets down low to reverse sweep the tossed up ball outside off. Finds short third man
a little more power in the shot - thanks to the width on offer - and the reverse sweep flies away to the right of short third man
tons of power on this reverse sweep too - which is surprising since Jadeja spots the batsman's premeditated movement and fires it into the leg side. Single to deep point
drills the tossed up delivery on off stump to short cover. Rohit misfields
goes back and flicks a shortish delivery outside off through square leg
sees Khawaja's intentions to dance down the track and so drags the ball well wide of off stump. The left-hander has to reach out - looking uncharacteristically ungainly - to cut the ball through point
rocks back against the short ball outside off and taps it with practically the full face of the bat to long-off.
"this is beautiful batting! He sees the flight on this so early. He charges out to meet it. And he unfurls a full swing of that straight bat. <b>High, handsome, straight, ridiculously cool six</b>! Anmd that prompts a chat between Kuldeep and Kohli"
changes his line wide outside off and pulls the length back a bit. Khawaja likes the room and goes for the sweep but he misses altogether
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"he's already shifting outside off as Kuldeep is walking in to bowl, expecting the legspinner to bowl outside off, and when that happens, he nails the sweep well in front of midwicket."
"goes round the wicket, targeting Khawaja's pads, he works it through square leg"
"loops it up on off stump, Khawaja hammers it down to long-on"
"gets inside the line of a loopy delivery outside off but in perhaps trying to hit it too hard, he mistimes it back at the bowler. Or maybe he was checking his shot considering Jadeja's dip"
"full and outside off, he smears it through the covers and Rohit isn't able to get low to his left quickly enough to stop it"
drags it way too short - which happens so very rarely with Jadeja - but Khawaja is soooooo good here. Leaps back into his crease and pulling it in front of the fielder at square leg. Splendid manipulation of the field
nudges the fuller delivery on middle through midwicket
short and wide but Khawaja finds point with his cut shot.
"there we go, he waits a little longer with this cut shot, hoping to find the gap between point and third man. Doesn't quite manage it but does get the single with short third man having to move to his left"
<b>there's the googly!</b>. Handscomb goes down to sweep it and - with the ball tossed up wide and turning away - he mistimes it through square leg
nudges it through midwicket
another sweep - this one to the legbreak wide outside off - as Handscomb finds a single behind square leg
"rolls the wrists over the legbreak outside off, largely because it dips on him and he doesn't want to pop it up in the air. Single through cover"
"<b>almost chops on</b>! Bumrah coming round the wicket for a back of a length delivery outside off. Khawaja is on the hop, his bat coming down at an angle which enables the mis-hit"
"full and outside off, he drives to cover."
"back of a length and outside off, he opens the face and runs it to third man"
"presents the full face of the bat, even though he's a little squared up on off stump. He has to do that really with Bumrah hitting the deck and getting it to straighten. That strong wrist and the hyper-extension of his elbow allows him to get more from the pitch than most other bowlers"
"<b>straightens again</b> but Khawaja is ready for this time time, staying back in his crease, waitin for it to come to him outside off and guiding it behind point"
"full and outside off, he drives to mid-off"
"shortish and outside off, he shapes to cut, but is beaten"
"presses forward as he waits for Kuldeep to delivery but the moment he reads the flight and realises this is short, he's back and across, ready with the cut shot"
"<b>googly</b> which is quicker and closer to off stump. Also keeps low, meaning Khawaja has to adjust, straightening his back leg and cutting to point"
""
another quick googly on and around off sutmp and Khawaja is very nearly bowled as he sets up for a cut shot again. Last minute change to a straight bat slice to point saves him in the end
"good length ball outside off - this one turns away from the left-hander, allowing the cut shot to deep point"
whirls his wrists over a shortish delivery outside off in an effort to smuggle it through midwicket. No such luck
"slower ball, which he picks and plays with the angle from round the wicket to deep square leg"
"firm push to extra cover as Bumrah keeps banging the ball in at back of a length, hoping the low bounce will help him get a wicket"
"<b>searing yorker</b>, and it is all the more difficult because of the late inswing. Handscomb just about deals with it, the inside edge of his bat coming in very handy!"
"follows it up with the slower ball, but Handscomb is ready for that too, holding his shape until it comes close enough that he can guide it behind point"
"slogs a good length ball on off stump down to mid-on - and the reason it only went that far is because he checks his shot, knowing Australia cannot afford to lose a wicket now. Not when they've taken out two of Bumrah's overs off the death"
cuts the shortish delivery outside off to deep point and <b>mores to 99</b>
eases down the pitch and chips the legbreak on leg stump over the infield. The timing is so good that it nearly wanders all the way to the boundary - it has no business getting that far - but Jadhav stops it with a big old dive.
"<b>googly gets the edge and it beats Pant!</b> Too thick for the wicketkeeper to do anything about it. Has no time to react. Handscomb backs away to try and open up the off side, but he's given himself too much room and is panicking as the ball turns away from him rather sharply. Gets a big edge, which is lucky for him because it takes the ball well away from the only catcher in the region"
"full on off stump, Handscomb holds his shape as it comes down slowly and then punches it to long-on"
stays back and guides the length ball on middle through cover and jogs through for <b>his second hundred in three innings</b>! Gorgeous batting from Khawaja and Delhi appreciates it. Even this shot - for a single - shows off the reason why he's succeeded on this tour. Plays late. Wiats for the turn. Soft hands.
sweeps the length ball on middle stump to deep square leg
"lovely straight drive from Handscomb. Stays legside of the ball, perhaps because there is a little bit of reverse swing out there, and presents the full face"
carves the back of a length delivery outside off into the covers and sprints through
"mistimes a swat down the ground, the fuller delivery outside off going off the bottom edge back to the bowler"
"full and outside off, he drives to mid-off"
<b>beats him</b> on the pull as Bhuvi's short ball goes under Khawaja's bat
"leaves his wicket giftwrapped at Kohli's feet. A harmless ba outside off, tempting the drive on the up. Khawaja obliges, not taking the care he has done all innings to keep the ball down, or away from a fielder. Goes straight to the Indian captain. Delhi roars in approval. Khawaja, meanwhile, is devastated, basically dragging himself off the field."
driven with the spin to cover.
"drifts in and skids through, Maxwell defends"
drives one and gets it off a thickish inside edge towards long-on
uses the depth of the crease superbly to force this towards deep point where an off-balanced Vijay hurls a superb throw. <strong>Saved three runs</strong>
"back-to-back wickets, Jadeja is pumped, Kohli even more. Maxwell has fallen looking to hit this over cover. Didn't get the elevation because he didn't get to the pitch. This also spun away a wee bit more than he expected, and Kohli is extremely alert at extra cover."
""
"length ball angling into middle and leg, tucked to midwicket where Kohli is supremely alert as he dives full-length to his left to keep Handscomb on 49"
<b> nearly chopped on! </b> The slowness of the surface starting to show up here. Looks to force this on the up through cover point.

"<b> run-out chance missed at the bowler's end. </b> Bunted to short cover, Jadhav hurls one just wide to reprieve Stoinis who was well outside the crease."
"wicket denied at one end, but Shami provides one at the other, and it's a cracker of a delivery. Lifter that completely takes Handscomb aback as he is forced to play at this because of the length, but the ball kisses the shoulder and flies to Pant who takes a superb catch. Massive break for India. They've come storming back."
"what a way to get off the mark! This one tailed in late but Turner plays it late, brings his wrists into play to flick this into the gap between midwicket and mid-on. Lovely timing."
"driven firmly on the up to sweeper cover, aggressive running to complete the second"
"full on off, defended from the crease."

"shortish delivery, punched to cover point"

"drifts one away but it's too far wide outside off, left alone"
"picks the wrong'un but hits against the turn in trying to loft this over long-on, no timing and it is well taken. Turner was looking to hit it much straighter, but ended up dragging it. Kuldeep has delivered a massive wicket. Excellent catch by Jadeja"

"flicks this full toss to deep midwicket where Kohli fires a good throw on the bounce to Pant, who breaks the bails to beat Jhye Richardson's dive."
"gets carefully behind the shortish delivery on middle and even though there's a bit of movement for Cummins away from the batsman, Rohit blunts it beautifully"
"pitches it up on off stump, Rohit eases forward and prevents its date with his sticks"
"lovely line from Cummins, but Rohit is defying him as if he's a medium pacer. Confident forward step, sweet sound off the bat and the ball scurries to cover"
"<b>glorious drive</b> as he picks the gap between cover and mid-off, but Finch, running to his left, puts in a dive and prevents it from going to the boundary"
"hint of an inside edge with Dhawan expecting the length ball to carry on with the angle across him, but Cummins gets it to straighten just enough that it ends up at mid-off's hands instead of racing away through cover"
laces the short ball outside off to cover
"hesitation from Rohit, after he nudges a length ball towards square leg, but Dhawan pulls his partner through and he's safe, despite Khawaja's throw coming to his (non-strikers') end"
"there's room to free the arms, but the slow pitch doesn't allow Dhawan to time the ball like he usually does. Cut finds cover"
"<B>whistles away to the square leg boundary</b>. Mistake from Richardson, the ball pitching on leg stump and asking to be hit. Dhawan is definitely in the mood to oblige"
"<b>carves it through cover</b>. The off side is fairly packed, but when there's that much room on offer, Dhawan can bring in all his power. Lashes it between cover and point"
"goes round the wicket and Dhawan, waiting nicely for the pitched up ball on middle, flicks it to deep square leg. <b>Delhi is ROARING</B>"
"fullish on off stump, Rohit defends."
"oooh, he goes for the cut shot and it's a very rare occurance that he misses it altogether. Especially with so much room"
opens the face and guides the shortish delivery to point. Little closer to the body prompting a straight-bat shot
"lovely batting. He's become so good on the leg side, waiting for the ball, perfectly balanced at the crease, and then the roll of the wrists to find a single at deep square leg"
closes the face to turn a fuller delivery on middle to midwicket.
"<b>inside edge</b> as Rohit underestimates the movement that Cummins gets. Hits the deck hard, with the seam upright and the ball jags back after pitching to disrupt the batsman's flick shot"
"full face of the bat as Rohit drives the fuller delivery to mid-off. Phew, just the composure he has to play proper shots even when he's not getting runs off them. The confidence that he can make it up later in the game..."
"back of a length and outside off, Dhawan guides it into the covers, only this one seems to stop on him, forcing him to check his shot"
straying onto the pads and Dhawan sends it on a one-way trip to deep square leg. (It hitchhikes the way back though)
"pristine drive from Rohit again, but mid-off is lurking to deny him runs."
"back of a length and outside off, Rohit waits on it and slice it away to deep third man"
"shortish and on off stump, Dhawan has no room to work with and as a result has to settle for knocking it down to the bowler"
"fullish and outside off, he drives through the covers"
gets squared up in dealing with a short ball on off stump. Cummins' strength to pound the new white ball into the deck is helping him get just enough sideways movement
"<b>Dhawan walks</b>! And there, in a nutshell, is the value of this outstanding bowler. The effort he puts in. The pace that he has. And the unerring accuracy. #TooGood #Cummins. This is back of a length, but it darts away from Dhawan's bat, bounces more than he expects too, and a punch through the covers instead ends up as an outside edge pounced by Alex Carey."
"good length ball outside off, Kohli guides it to point"
"<b>riiiidiculous</b>! This is a fearsome fast bowler charging in at him, steaming coming out of his nose, but Kohli is so still at the crease, so cool coming forward to the pitched up ball, and so donwright dominant as he threads the gap at extra cover"
"shuffles inside the line of the ball, hoping to deflect it to the fine leg boundary, but it thuds into his thigh and he has to settle for a single. Cummins, the bowler, gets across to it and tries to kick it at the stumps, but misses the target"
"slices it! He likely wants to find the boundary in front of point, but a thick outside edge smuggles it to boundary on the right of the third man"
"hangs back, and leg side of the good length ball outside off, so he can steer it to deep third man"
good length on off stump draws Rohit forward with a punch to cover
rides the bounce nicely - and he can do that because he is so still at the crease - to send the shortish and rising delivery outside off to cover point
"caresses it to the extra cover boundary. Rohit's driving has been sumptuous in this little innings. It's not always fetched him runs, but here, he takes care to find the gap too"
"back of a length and outside off, guides it to deep third man"
"<B>risky run</b>! But Kohli always fancies those. He brings those wrists down on a full delivery on middle stump and knowing he's mistimed it, he sprints across to the other end before Stoinis at mid-on can find the target at the non-strikers' end"
reads the length so early - short and outside off - and spirits it to deep third man.
"cuts back in off the pitch as Richardson hits the deck, Rohit hangs back, letting the ball come onto him, and then taps it towards point"
right behind the short of a length ball on off stump
"<b>OUCH!</B>. Cummins again. The sheer strength he has to keep running in and hammer the back of a length produces magic even on pitches that troll fast bowlers for even existing. This rears up at Rohit. Worse. It cuts into him, at high pace, preventing him the time he needs to get out of the way. In the end, Rohit does well to glove it and keep it down"
"back of a length and outside off, he steers towards cover"
waits on the shortish delivery on middle and turns it through midwicket
"shapes for the cut shot, but with the ball - shortish and outside off - not quite bouncing as much as he likes, he mistimes it into the covers"
<b>breathtaking</b>! All of his quality is condensed into this one moment. His balance. His timing. His ability to read length so early. Spots the shortish ball outside off and simply punches it through cover. No fuss. All boss.
opens the face as he slices the shortish ball outside off to deep third man
rises up to get on top of the bounce of this back of a length ball outside off and blunts it well
"fullish and outside off, he drives to mid-off"
"seam movement into the bat makes Kohli mistime his backfoot drive, which ends up at midwicket instead of where he was aiming (mid-off)"
"deals with Cummins' bounce welll, leaping off his feet to turn the short ball on middle to midwicket"
"searches for a quick single after dabbing the back of a length ball on off stump down by his feet, but point is switched on"
"gets out the on-the-up drive, but doesn't quite beat cover"
"misses the front-foot pull, which is bizarre because he might be the best player of that shot in the world"
"plenty of pace  -  143 kph - and bounce as well. Rohit has to be careful, using his wrists to pin the ball down at midwicket"
the front foot doesn't quite move as far as he'd like to make the most of this overpitched delivery - and that's entirely because Rohit is wary of the amount of bounce Cummins has been getting all evening - and the mis-hit drive finds mid-off
presents the full face as Richardson hits a good length on off stump
"full and outside off, drives through the covers"
he swipes at the air in anger after guiding a short ball outside off to third man and not to the third man boundary
thumps the pitched-up delivery to mid-off. Kohli asks Rohit about whether the ball is swinging...
"<b>just over mid-on</b>! And only just! Rohit is usually a fine judge of when to kick on. But here, trying to force a good length ball outside off, over the leg side, he is nearly caught out. Maxwell does his best moving to his left, but in the end it lobs over him"
pushes it to cover
swivels on the back foot as he pulls the bouncer on leg stump to long leg
"<b>low bounce</b>! Rohit is all set up for the pull shot, but the shortish delivery scuttles past his shins, and even beats Carey behind the stumps, which doesn't please the bowler one bit"
"pitched-up offcutter outside off, Rohit drops it in front of cover point and gets the quick single. Then Maxwell's direct hit at the non-strikers' (no reasons to throw, btw, the batsman was well safe) ends up at the boundary"
gets up off his toes to turn the shortish delivery on off stump through midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, Rohit eases it to deep third man"
"misfield at cover, but it doesn't really amount to much. Turner is the man in the hot seat after Kohli defends a pitched-up ball on off stump with a vengeance"
<b>stays low</b> but Kohli is so switched on that he's still able to glide it away from off stump and down to third man
"<b>beats short third man</b> just as he intends to do. Lyon starts round the wicket and Kohli trusts the angle, staying back, playing the late cut, and beating Turner on his left"
stays back and whips the good length ball on middle to deep square leg
"stays back to defend a tossed up delivery, also from round the stumps, through point"
leans over the tossed up delivery outside off and knocks it down to long-on
nudges a shortish delivery on leg stump through square leg
"both are happy to nurdle Lyon around, preferring to hang back, letting the ball turn, and deflecting it away with soft hands. Single to fine leg"
walks down the pitch and helps the back of a length delivery on off stump away to deep square leg
"shortish on off stump, Rohit turns it through square leg"
"<b>Kohli walks too</b>! Extra bounce does the Indian captain. You'd have expected that from one of the big scary quicks but this is Marcus Stoinis! And boy is he thrilled. A back of a length delivery outside off - ripe for the cut shot, which is what Kohli tries - gets a bit of a top edge through to the keeper. Cross-seamed variation from the Australian allrounder and it does the trick"
"back of a length, and slow too, but Pant reads it well and nudges it through midwicket"
covers the line of a shortish delivery outside off and nudges it to midwicket. Rohit will know he has to bat through the innings
opens the face and steers the shortish delivery outside off to deep third man
"he's back over the wicket now that Kohli's out. Good length, outside off, Rohit blocks"
"<b>lovely bowling</b>! There's just enough flight to draw Rohit forward, but it dips on him, drifts in, turns in too and beats the inside edge as he blocks"
"full on off stump, but Rohit prefers the safety of his crease, pushing the ball to long-on"
"vicious cut shot, with the ball turning away from the left-hander. Single to deep point"
there's the risk in playing back. Lyon gets the good length ball to bite in the surface. The turn is quick. There is bounce too. And it forces Rohit to hurry into his block. Australia could invest in a short leg. High chance of an inside edge onto pad
nudges the length ball to midwicket
<b>absolutely hammers it</b>. It's short. It's wide. It's so very juicy and Pant flays it behind point. Tons and tons of power in the shot.

"a little drift away from the left-hander, who stretches forward to defend the full delivery"
drags his length short which allows Pant the time he needs to slice it behind point
"ties to whip a good length ball from outside off through midwicket, but the mini-helicopter doesn't quite work from Rohit. Goes straight back to the bowler"
"ah, the answers are here! Short, half-tracker, and he rocks back to wallop that over deep midwicket."
"whips this nicely towards deep square, looks for the second but is sent back"
driven with the spin to long-off
"shortish delivery on middle and leg, worked behind square to deep square leg"

"snuffed out by a beauty! Drew him forward, got this to dip and spin, Pant has a poke and it's taken beautifully at slip. India are in trouble or what."
gets outside the line and works it with the spin to midwicket
eased with the spin too sweeper cover
"nice stride forward as he defends this sharp legbreak. Appeal from Australia because they think it was pad first, but surely the <strong>impact was outside off.</strong>"
"as a batsman, you can't ask for a better delivery than a long hop to get off the mark. Vijay gets hold of the pull but hits it all along the ground to deep midwicket"

"shortens his length, skids one through, defended back"
goes right back into the crease and turns this into the leg side.

"sees the flight, drills this to extra cover"
"lofted and lofted very well, smacks the sightscreen. Didn't get to the pitch with this one but went through with the stroke and hit it right off the middle. Was hitting against the turn, mind you, but the boundary that side is not the longest."
"he's miscued this to long-on! Vijay will be mighty disappointed, because this is an opportunity missed. Not sure why he needed to go for another big hit. Zampa goes shorter, faster and Vijay looks to pull but is cramped for room and ends up getting a top-edge. India are in trouble."
"slices this full toss towards deep point, Jadhav turns for the second but is sent back. Suspect he has been <strong>saved by a full-length dive.</strong>"
"beauty! Was there an edge? We'll soon find out. Spun away sharply as Rohit stabbed at this, not grabbed by the keeper. Hard to say without looking at a replay, but I suspect Rohit may have just gotten away."
"drifts in a quicker length ball, defended."
"dabs this gently into the off side, behind square, for a single."
"too full, eased down to long-on as they jog the single"
bunts this gently into the off side

rocks back and slaps this through extra cover. Superb. This was begging to be hit and Jadhav merely did that
"<b> Maxwell has fluffed a simple chance at cover! </b> Two drops in two overs, Rohit the recipient of slices of luck on both times. This was nice and full, he drove and failed to keep it down."
"gentle bunt into the off side, with the bat hitting the pad. This was a flipper from Zampa"

"flatter one on middle and leg, nudged towards fine leg."
"drifts in a full delivery, defended."
"he's out stumped trying to play an ugly hoick, and in the process loses his bat. Zampa has run all over him. Dropped twice in as many overs, but isn't a third time lucky. Zampa sees him coming and shortens his length, Carey does brilliantly well behind the stumps because he could've been blinded by the batsman's movements for a split second. This is an outstanding stumping."
lunges forward and defends this full and flat delivery
"nice and full on the stumps, turned back"
"Gone! Huge, huge. This is a sensational delivery, drifts away and then spins to beat Jadeja's forward prod. Completely deceived by the googly, didn't read it at all. Carey grabs cleanly and whips the bails off even as Jadeja's back foot is just on the line. I wouldn't want to be Kumara Dharmasena here, if ever there's something, there may be no more than a millimeter behind. The practical decision should be out."
squeezes the drive to cover.
tucks this down to fine leg as he jogs the single

stays back to the shortish delivery on off stump and dinks it behind square leg
<b>lbw appeal</b> as Jadhav gets forward to block an offbreak outside off. Impact not in line
"bowls it quick and flat on middle, but thereafter it spins well down leg. They check on the stumping, just in case Jadhav, who is well back in his crease, had his feet in the air. Nope."
"shortish and outside off, he slices it behind point"

"bouncer as a follow-up, and it veers into the right-hander from outside off, coming up for his nose. Bhuvi sways away beautifully though"

"full and outside off, defends"

goes back even though it's a pretty full ball and defends in front of middle stump
backs away and cuts the short ball outside off to the sweeper

"loops it up outside off, Jadhav presses forward to block"

"hammers the half-volley on middle stump back down the pitch. Zampa gets a hand to it, but then it skips past the stumps at the non-strikers to long-on"

"well flighted on off stump, Jadhav defends"

"<b>excellent composure</b>! It's the slower short ball, and he's not fooled one bit. Holds his shape, presents the bat like a ramp and finds a single to deep third man"

"<b>dropped</b> by the bowler, diving to his left. It's dying on him. It's a very very tough chance, especially in his followthrough, and after seeing the batsman play a pull shot. Wouldn't be expecting it to come his way but it does and though he responds well, diving to his left, it doesn't stick"
"back of a length on off stump, taps it into the covers"
"short and at the body, Jadhav tries to flick it away, but it bounces off the thigh pad and Bhuvi pinches the quick single"
"dabs it down by his feet and it's Jadhav's turn to push his partner for a quick single. Richardson rushes forward to make the run-out, but the underarm throw doesn't work"
"<b>outside edge</b>! Bhuvi does want to find the third man boundary, but this definitely goes finer than even he would have planned. The short ball at the body is Australia's plan. Bhuvi keeps making room and messing it up"
goes for the wide yorker - nails it - but it strays just a touch too far
"slower bouncer but Bhuvi is ready for it, tapping it through point"

"batting so very deep in the crease, defends a fullish delivery outside off over to mid-on"
"<b>Pat Cummins you absolute legend</b>! The partnership that has been scaring Australia for the last half hour is broken at it's their talisman that pulls it off. Bowls full. Angles it at the toes, Bhuvi is backing away, that is serious pace for anyone at No.8, and he just scoops the ball up to a backpedalling mid-off"
"taken at deep midwicket! There goes India's final hope, trying to pull a short ball that is a touch too close to the body for him to get any power, and just a little too much bounce for him to deal with. Tiny bit of a top edge and Maxwell on the boundary does some great work, running to his right and taking a clean catch at high pressure. Australia have been pushed to their very limit in this series, but they've found heroes every single time"

makes room and slaps this slower delivery to deep point
"steps out to pull, Stoinis attacks the body, Kuldeep bails out of it"
"flattens the middle stump to end a sensational tour! Australia won the T20Is 2-0, and now they come back from 0-2 down to win the ODI series 3-2. <b> Australia's first ODI series win in India since 2009. </b> What a win, what a performance. Massive injection of confidence ahead of the World Cup. Only four times in ODI history has a team come back from 0-2 down to win a five-match series. Australia are the fifth side. What an achievement!"
