"thick inside edge onto the pad as he shapes to drive, rolls to cover for a quick single"
pulled on the bounce to deep midwicket

steps out to pull but is beaten
"mistimes a pull to midwicket, brain fade from Bhuvi as he turned for the second, Rashid was never going to get there. Kohli coming in from deepmidwicket had to watch out for the late spin, he collected the ball on the bounce and fired an accurate throw to Parthiv who did the rest"
squeezes this full delivery down to long on
"full and straight on the stumps, kept out."
"pulled to deep midwicket, but no timing or power. They turned for the second blindly, Kaul seems confident of having made his ground, but Kohli thinks its out. Looks like he's comfortably gone. Good gather from Parthiv."
"tries to reverse this length ball, but misses. The ball angles in from wide of the crease to hit him on the back leg. Looks like he's hit in line. Ball tracker confirms this would've smashed into off stump. The on-field decision was not out, so the <strong>decision has now been overturned. </strong> SRH bowled out."

"fullish on middle and leg, now he clears mid-on with a simple, clean swing"
"that looks close and it's been given. Parthiv looks at his partner and then walks off, so review not taken. Might have been umpire's call, so perhaps a good decision to not review. Parthiv misses the sweep as this length ball spins in and pins him dead in front of middle"
"full, slid in on middle and leg, clipped away through midwicket"
"short of good length outside off, Kohli walks across and drills towards mid-on off the inside part of the bat"

"slides it into middle and leg, and Kohli whips it away through midwicket for a brace"
"a bit of spin away from him, Kohli moves across and blocks"
"oh, he's chopped it on. So the drop doesn't prove as costly. A legsidish slower ball, 113ks, just back of a length. Vohra doesn't pick the drop in pace and tries to whip forcefully. Swings early and gets an inside edge to the thigh pad, before the ball clips the glove as he completes the swing and then takes the bails out"

"back of length on off, punched to cover"
<b> dropped at slip! </b> Is that the game? Williamson lets this go through his hands. This was a thick outside edge as Kohli jabbed at this. What's worse? It races away to the third man boundary
lunges forward and defends back
dabs this gently into the off side for a quick single
"there's absolutely no spike on it, but Saha's brilliance down leg has made this look ridiculously easy. AB walks across to pull this short ball sliding in, and in doing so, missed the pull. Wide called. <b> Not out stays that way </b>. SRH lose a review"

"leading edge and the catch has been taken by Yusuf at short third man. <strong>He's taken it one-handed!</strong> For a while it looked like Yusuf lost it completely, thinks its going over, eventually sticks his right hand out to pluck that.

"shapes to pull, misses. Wasn't far from his gloves. Skiddy bouncer from Kaul"
"<strong>he's feathered an edge and RCB are on a freefall</strong>. Not the right length to pull, looked to fetch from outside off, and just got the bottom edge. The umpire didn't give it initially but raised his finger as he saw Moeen walking. Moeen's maiden IPL outing with the bat is a forgettable one!"
"this is a sensational delivery! Tails in late to hit CDG flush on his toe. Such a comprehensive appeal resonated by 40,000 fans in the ground. <strong>But SRH don't have a review</strong>! Good call from umpire Virender Sharma, though. <strong>Missing leg stump.</strong>"

"swing and a miss. Looked to go over long on, missed."
"sees the flight, looks to slog again but lost his shape. In doing so, the backfoot was up in the air Smart grab from Saha, and he whips the bails off, but was the foot plonked back? Difficult decision for the third umpire. Just grounded I reckon. Very close"
