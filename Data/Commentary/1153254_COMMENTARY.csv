"full, a tiny bit of shape in towards middle and leg, clipped away through backward square leg. Came off the inside half of the bat"
"back of a length on middle and leg, clipped watchfully to midwicket"
"ooh, good ball. Back of a length again, pitching within the stumps and slanting away, and this one nips away off the seam to beat Liton's hesitant prod"
"back of a length, finishing on an off-stumpish line, defended into the covers"
"a touch shorter, slants into a fourth-stump line. Lets it come on and guides it to third man with an open face"
"length ball close to off stump, decent stride forward to block it back to the bowler"
"fullish outside off, defended to mid-off"
"full again, slanting away from off stump, searching for swing and not really finding it. Nice stride forward to drive to mid-off"
"nice length, still quite full but not driveable, and Liton judges it well and leaves it alone. Carries through at chest height to Sarfraz"
"full on off stump, clipped to mid-on"
"very full, yorker length outside off. Liton is beaten as he tries to jam his bat down and squeeze it away through point"
"length ball on middle and off, defended to midwicket and Shaheen starts with a maiden"
"fullish, angling down leg. Looks to flick, misses, and the ball ricochets off his pad towards square leg"
"back of a length, slanting away from off stump, steered down to third man"
"length ball close to off stump, gets on the front foot to play a checked drive to mid-off"
"nice length again, brings him half-forward. Slightly wider line, lets it come on and punches to cover point"
"out for a duck on comeback, and that's very well bowled. He's been bringing him forward with his lengths so far, and he digs this one in short, and outside off stump. Gets it up to shoulder height, and Soumya is in no position to control his pull. Ends up skying it and offering a simple catch to square leg. Mohammad Amir has been struggling for wickets, and his replacement strikes in his second over"

"shot! That's gorgeous from Mominul, an effortless flick between midwicket and mid-on, but the ball was a gift, overpitched and angling into middle and leg"
"and he follows up with a beaut and beats Mominul for pace! Back of a length, pitches outside off and nips back in off the track, skids off the wicket and Mominul is late bringing his bat down in defence. Didn't really matter, because it would have beaten his inside edge anyway. Cannons off the back pad and leaves his off stump spinning. Pakistan's left-arm quicks are on fire here"
and Shaheen greets him with a sharp bouncer that he has to duck hurriedly under
"length ball angling into off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"oh my, what a delivery that is! This is what any left-arm quick going round the wicket dreams of seeing. Perfect length, pitching on off stump and straightening past the outside edge to hit top of off. Not too much Liton could have done about it - maybe take a bigger stride forward in defence?"
"full outside off, driven to cover point"
"length ball angling into middle stump, clipped towards midwicket"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended towards short extra-cover"
"ooh, Mithun was a little late spotting that change in length. Banged it in and got it to rise to just about neck height, all while angling the ball in towards off stump. Ducks quickly and just about evades it"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"ooh, edged. Just a wide slip in place, though, and it flies well wide of that fielder and rolls down to third man. Back of a length, pitches outside leg and nips away from the right-hander, accentuating the angle across. Mushfiqur defends close to his body, and the extra bounce causes the ball to kiss the edge high up, near the shoulder of the bat"
"full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"lovely length, pitching on middle and slanting away from off stump. Left alone"
"ooh, opens him up completely. Again it nips away after pitching on or around leg stump, and the length leaves him rooted to the crease. Beats his edge and the batsman's right leg slides around"
"overpitched outside off, but the covers are packed and he can't beat the fielder at short extra-cover with a firm drive"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"ooh, goes wider on the crease and angles this one in. Takes a bigger stride across than he needs to to defend, and almost finds his front pad in the way as he brings his bat down. Would have struck him outside the line anyway, but"
"fullish, angling in towards off stump. Mushfiq reaches for the ball as he looks to drive through mid-off, plays too early, and sends it rolling to mid-on off the inside half of the bat"
"back of a length, angling into off and middle. Gets nicely behind it and defends it with soft hands. Ball drops down by his feet"
"another bouncer, rising over leg stump. Mushfiq thinks of hooking and decides late not to play the shot. Called wide for height - it did bounce over head height"
"short again, rises over off stump at shoulder height. Mushfiq controls his pull well, keeps it down to the left of long leg"
"length ball angling into off stump, defended towards mid-on"
"again, the massed cover field protects Shaheen from the consequences of a wide half-volley. Mushfiq drives straight to cover point"

"back of a length, slanting away from off stump, left alone"
"back of a length on middle and off, lets it come on and defends into the point region"
"dug in short, gets it up to chest height but offers plenty of width, and Mushfiq gets on his toes to slash it high over point"

very full and quite wide too. Reaches out to drive and ends up slicing it down to third man
"fullish, close to off stump, transfers his weight nicely forward to punch to extra-cover"
overpitched on off stump and Mushfiq's placement is perfect on this occasion. Waited a tiny bit longer and opened his bat face just a touch to drive to the left of the diving extra-cover fielder
"length ball outside off stump and he beats Mushfiq's outside edge without necessarily doing a great deal with the ball. Mushfiq was a little slow getting forward, and ended up pushing uncertainly at the ball"
"fuller, wider, slashed away to the right of third man. Was in the air for a bit but was always dipping down before reaching the fielder"
"fullish outside off, punched to extra-cover"
"big appeal after he strikes the pad with an arm ball, not given out. Seemed to be heading down leg, and Pakistan make a late decision to review after a long consultation between bowler and keeper/captain... The length trapped him on the crease in defence, and the lack of turn beat the inside edge, but that's a shocking review. The ball has struck his pad outside leg stump!"
"nicely bowled, fairly quick, drifting in towards middle stump. Wanted to drive to long-off, and ended up playing it back to the bowler as a result"

"length ball landing just outside off, and he pushes this off the front foot to cover point. Four singles in a row"
"<b>edged!</b> And there's no slip fielder to gobble that up. Just wide outside off, and he tries to drive this ball through the covers. The delivery's not full enough, and therefore it takes the bat's outside edge. Past Sarfraz's right for a boundary"
"full on middle, and this is tapped off the front foot to mid on. No chance of a single on this occasion"

"length ball on the fourth-stump line, but angling into the batsman. He goes onto the back foot, and fends from near his chest"

"back of a length outside off, and Mushfiqur waits for the delivery to come to him, before opening his bat's face and running this down to third man for a single"
"full on off stump, and he defends this past the bowler to mid on. Mithun wants the single, so he's <b>halfway down the pitch</b>, but Mushfiqur says no. The non-striker has to hurry back"

"full just outside off, and straightens after pitching. He keeps his eyes on the ball, and runs this fine to short third man"
"wrong'un again. Lands outside off, and spinning into Mushi. He makes some room, and cuts this hard, but finds the fielder on the circle"
"<b>reverse sweep!</b> Innovative from Mushfiqur. Shadab goes full outside off, and he quickly changes his position, and then paddles this fine psat the short third-man fielder. <B>Fifty partnership too</b>"

"googly, too short and wide to trouble Mushfiqur, who leans back and cuts it to the left of sweeper cover. They go upstairs for a run-out appeal at the keeper's end, but Mushfiqur is back in time.

"slow, flighted googly outside off. Reads it well and clips with the turn through midwicket"
"back of a length outside off. Not sure that was intentional. Probably not. Goes for a hard-hands punch and gets a thick edge that flies to the right of the keeper. No slip, though. <b>Second time that's happened today</b>"

"goes nice and full to start his new spell, close to off stump. Clipped to midwicket"
"gone! Again, he goes full, angling in towards off stump. Isn't quite a yorker, and that works against Mehidy as he looks to flick this over midwicket.

"Oh dear, that's a terrible way to get run out.Length ball on off stump, looks to clear his front leg and flat-bat to long-off. The bowler moves to his left and cuts the ball off, and the batsmen still look to steal a quick single. Bit of a brain fade, and the bowler simply has to jog to the stumps and flick the bails off"
"and that's that. Back of a length slower ball on off stump, Mashrafe makes himself room as always, and goes for the big hit down the ground. The boundaries here are massive, and there's no way he's clearing that man at long-on"
