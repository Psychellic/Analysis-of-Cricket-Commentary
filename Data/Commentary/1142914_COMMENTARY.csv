"shorter and outside off, Hafeez rides it out to backward point with soft hands"
"<strong>Stanlake strikes with his third ball</strong> and has Hafeez nicking off for a duck. Australia's beanpole fast bowler runs in hard, hits the deck hard, and finds extra bounce.

"dug in short on leg stump, this is more a short-arm flap than a short-arm pull. Hit in the air but wide of midwicket"

Another lifter outside off, Talat rises with it and aims to fend it away. Steep bounce for Stanlake. The ball balloons off the glove. Finch runs across to his left, stretches out one hand and sends back Talat"

Sarfraz rides the bounce of a short ball outside off and secures a single to deep third man
"Has Zaman been strangled down the leg side? Umpire Jeremiah Matibiri raises his finger. Zaman doesn't seem pleased but no DRS in this series to challenge the on-field out decision. Dug in down the leg side, rushes Zaman into a hook. There's a deflection - not sure if it was off the glove or bat - but Zaman has to exit. Three wickets in three overs for Stanlake"

"short and wide outside off, Malik gets on top of the bounce and slaps it away to sweeper cover"
"<strong>Four wickets in four overs for Stanlake</strong>. Credit to Finch for giving him four overs on the bounce with the new ball. Stanlake's USP: extra bounce comes to the fore again. Bursts from a back of a length just outside off, seams away, Sarfraz is squared up; he looks to fend it away but ends up nicking it behind to Finch at slip. Finch dives to his right and takes it with both hands"

turns a fullish delivery to short midwicket
