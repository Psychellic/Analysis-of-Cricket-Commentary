"keeper up to the wicket, slightly short outside off and Smits gets off the mark with a firm back-foot punch through the covers to the man in the deep"
"shortish and the ball springs off the pitch, some away swing... and Kuhn thick-edges it past the keeper and away for the first boundary!"
"length ball, in the channel and dabbed down into the covers. Momentary thoughts of a second thanks to a misfield but it wasn't on"
"angled in straighter, Smuts works another single off his pads"
"back of a length outside off, chopped forcefully through point"
"banged, Mathews' bouncer takes off and nearly clears Chandimal, too - that's a wide on height"
"fourth-stump line, Smuts hangs back and drills another single through the covers"
"length ball, some inswing for Kula Shaker, worked off the pads towards short fine leg"
"length and bouncing over the stumps as Kuhn goes across and attempts to ramp the ball, fails to make contact"
"short outside off, maybe a slower ball and Kuhn hammers a wrathful cross-batted shot through midwicket for four. A more intentional boundary this time"
"struck on the pads - given! Kuhn had shuffled across and was trapped in front of middle and leg, no reviews in T20 so he has to go. Hawk-Eye says it would have clipped the top of leg stump, so a fair enough decision by umpire Shaun George"
"and he's off the mark with a four, short and leg side from Kula and it's flicked away past short fine leg to the fence"
"pitched up in the channel, de Bruyn steps out and thrashes a drive - straight to extra cover"
"short and on the body, Smuts swings heartily to leg and swats four more behind deep square"
"digs in the bumper, that's veered down the leg side as Smuts swings unsuccessfully at it"
"slightly back of a length, over the top of off stump, pulled to midwicket"
"short and wide, Smuts puts this beyond the rope for SA's first six! Filthy ball and a proper Smutty response, a broadsword swipe and it flies flat and true over deep point"
"swings hard again, top-edged straight up, well taken at extra cover! Smuts smudges his record with an agricultural heave, wasn't short enough as he went across the line and sent it spiralling into the night sky"
"touch too straight, no more than a flick off the pads - and that's gone for six as well! <i>Superb</i> timing from de Bruyn, who pinged it over the deep midwicket boundary with little more than a nudge to leg"
"length on the stumps, dabbed down into the on side"
"short run up for Gunaratne, who dollies a slower ball on middle and off stump, de Bruyn nudges one into the leg side"
"another floater, 85kph on the stumps, Miller leans out and pokes suspiciously, gets a thick edge towards short third man"
"this is a cutter, kicks and comes back in to the batsman, who shovels away to midwicket"
floated up on the stumps and worked away into the leg side again
"genuine medium-pace this time, 119kph and de Bruyn can only punch one through mid-on"
"another slower ball, dabbed into the leg side and Gunaratne hurls himself after it to notch a dot - tight first over from him"
"tossed up outside off and de Bruyn gets on top of a firm cover drive, beats the man in the deep"
"flat, no much turn, skipping on outside off, punched off the back foot"
"googly from Prasanna, tossedup invitingly and into Miller's arc. he gets a small stride out and <i>absolutely smokes it</i> over long-on! Miller time for SA"
"pushed through, possibly another googly, cut off the back foot outside off"
"flat outside off stump, de Bruyn slices a cut... taken by the diving fielder at point! SL have another, de Bruyn's maiden innings cut short by another decent catch from Gunaratne"
floated up towards the tramlines and spinning away - called wide
"pushed through a little straighter, worked off the body to square leg to get Behardien going"
"trundles in, dobbles the ball on a full length outside off, Behardien has to wait an age... and then can only punch one to deep extra cover"
slides this one down the leg side
"short ball, up to full speed at 120 kays, Miller us rushed a touch and can't get hold of his pull"
"full and straight, another cutter, worked neatly into a gap towards deep midwicket and they come charging back"
"slower ball on middle and leg, Behardien gets a leading edge playing back"
"drops a little short, still no pace to work with and Behardien pulls in the air, off the splice but lands short of deep midwicket"
"full, dipping slower ball, Miller gets a leading edge to mid-off - excellent two-over spell from Gunaratne, not so much as a sniff of a boundary for SA"
"round the wicket, pitched up outside off, Miller aims a meaty drive and gets a thick outside edge to third man"
"over the wicket, full and inviting the drive... and Behardien slugs it over mid-off and away! Stand and delivery, just cleared the front leg and cleared the man on the ring"
"shortish, steered off the back foot towards point"
"was that a <b>drop?!</b> I guess so... Hard to even call it a chance when they're hit that fiercely, though. Low full toss from Pradeep, at 140kph, smacked back at him and he threw up a hand, only managed to deflect it over his head (although that was certainly better than taking it on the nose)"
"backs away, swatted to deep backward point"
another full toss and this is bludgeoned down the ground by Behardien for the second boundary of the over
"full and wide, a slower ball from Mathews, Miller has to reach and can only swing one down the ground"
"length outside off, Behardien waits and chops another single to point"
"in the slot, that's outta here! May have been a cutter from Mathews but Miller picked it and timed a sweet slog over long-on. Went several rows back"
"fired outside off stump, swing and a miss from Miller - but it was wide"
"slower ball, sits up as Miller pulls, thick bottom edge into the leg side and they come charging back for two as the throw causes a stinging blow on the finger for Mathews"
"dug in short, Miller rocks back and belts a pull to the rope at deep square leg - that flew out of the middle"
"pitched up outside off and this is dispatched through the covers! They don't call him 'Killer' for nothing, that was a murderous drive"
"full outside off, taking the pace off, Behardien punches down the ground to rotate the strike. All he needs to do, with Miller at the other end"
whoops! Attempted slower ball from Kulasekara... and it ends up with Chandimal on the full. That went waaaaaaaay over head height and will therefore be a no-ball
"full outside off, Miller is set for it, clubs an inside-out drive and it pierces the field, races away"
"SMASHED! Poor from Kulasekara, pitched up and in the arc for MIller to free the arms and hammer six more into the stands at deep midwicket - brings up the SA 100, as well as the fifty stand with Fudgie"
"pitched up, better length from Kula, towards the blockhole - and slugged to long-on! Miller falls, a belligerent knock but Kulasekara snuffs him out, wasn't able to get the elevation on this one"
"length outside off, drops back and tapped into the off side"
"and he spanks his first ball in international cricket for six! Mosehle muscles a flat square swipe over the boundary at deep point, that's a pretty impressive way to get going"
"slower ball, that was well bowled, deceives Behardien who swings and misses outside off"
"straighter line, again taking the pace off, Behardien pulls and picks out deep square leg... but <b>Suranga Lakmal drops it on the run!</b> Tough chance but he made the ground, then spilled it on to the rope"
"sends down a full toss, Behardien gets hold of this, swings another six into the crowd! Crunched well beyond the ropes"
"pitched up on off, dug out down the ground and they hare back for two"
"another decent nut from Pradeep, fast and full, Behardien drives down the ground... and the direct hit runs out Mosehle trying to come back for a second!"
"backs away and swats a pull towards mid-off, they end with just a single"
"round the wicket, short of a length, tucked off the pads behind square on the leg side"
"full outside off, 140kph, and he beats the inside edge of a drive"
"and this is clubbed over mid-off, not timed that well but it skids over the damp outfield and can't be flicked back"
"short outside off, fetched into the leg side with a pull which nearly carries to mid-on...came high off the bat"
"edged! Just wide of the flying keeper. That's where slip was. A back-of-a-length ball, he throws his hands through a drive and the thick edge flies to third man"
"wide outside off, and this leaps through to Mosehle off a full length...close to a wide but gets away with it"
"back of a length, he goes for the pull and gets taken high on the leg"
"short outside off and that's a super shot, gets on his toes and back-cuts it behind point and wide of third man"
"fuller, angled in at leg stump, and he manages to flick it through midwicket as he uses his feet and there's no one in the deep"
"three in a row! This is short again, outside off, he throws his hands into a cut and though it's a top edge that won't matter. Well wide of the keeper and fine of third man"
"that's a big full toss, Dickwella moving around his crease, ends up outside leg stump, the ball cannons into his back leg and scoots to third amn"
"<B>dropped</b>, by the captain! A ball pushed across on off stump, de Silva gets too far underneath an attempt to drive over the off side. The ball goes high, Behardien turns and backtracks from mid-off but it slips through his hands"
"and he's greeted by the scoop over fine leg for six! He's round the wicket, Dickwella goes down on his back knee and flips a length delivery over his shoulder"
and now he gets enough bat on this leg-side whip to clear the in-field
"that's a fantastic shot...he did very well to wait and wait for this delivery, a slower delivery dug into the pitch, then he opened the face and guide it fine of short third man"
"goes full at the stumps, he gives himself a touch of room and drives along the ground past cover but mid-off can cut it off"
"back of a length, again he's moving to the leg side and angles it towards short third man who can't stop it cleanly"
"<B>dropped</b>, but that would have been a screamer! Better to say he saved a few runs. Was a full ball outside off, driven firmly and it flew off an open face to backward point"
"flicks a full, straight delivery along the ground through midwicket"
"brings out the reverse sweep, takes it off the stumps, straight to short third man"
"<B>dropped</b>, a full toss is hammered back at Tahir and he can't cling on. Came quickly. But it's a dot ball"
driven into the off side and they scramble a single. Out with a hit from cover
"the googly, spins across the left hander and defeats the attempt at another reverse sweep"
"and that's what they needed! Plays the conventional sweep, goes in the air and comfortably clears deep square leg"
"round the wicket, dot ball as he slices to backward point"
down the pitch and heaves a length ball over midwicket to the sweeper...fifty stand
"round the wicket, tries to scoop this and I think it's top edge this straight into his helmet then it bounce towards short fine leg...yep, came off the badge"
"that's better, biffed it straight down the ground...a strong blow as he clubs a full delivery back over the bowler's head"
"tries to fire this in full, but he just misses the length and it's a little wide...Dickwella stays leg side and drives inside-out over extra cover, wide of long-off"
a reverse sweep finds backward point on the edge of the circle
and that's find deep midwicket...tries to clear the leg side with a slog sweep but doesn't get enough bat on it and it's a comfortable catch
lovely shot! A couple of steps down the pitch and he lofts his straight down the ground
"he's down the pitch again, doesn't quite middle it as well but gets just enough bat on it to clear the man at long-off...hung in the air for a while"
"fired in fuller and flatter, at the stumps, swung along the ground through midwicket"
tucks a straight delivery into the leg side
"finds middle stump...and he's off another celebratory run. Someone catch him, please! A flatter, straighter delivery, de Silva goes to slog sweep and it's through him too quickly"
worked off the stumps down to long-on
"a first-baller for the debutant! Another catch at deep midwicket, another slog sweep that doesn't quite have the legs. Selfless shot"
"another dot ball as he swings and misses at a length ball, skids on, just misses off stump"
"cut away from outside off, a good few deliveries for South Africa"
"that will do...it the crowd and it's caught one-handed! Prasanna sweeps, takes a bit of top edge but it flies high into the night sky and comfortably clears the boundary"
"huge! That's waaayyy back into the crowd again...this is a straight blow, over long-on this time. Sri Lanka stay in it"
"short of a length outside off, Mathews gives himself room - almost too much of it - and can only get the toe end of the match towards cover"
"edged, taken, his first wicket! Back of a length, Prasanna swinging for the hills over the leg side and gets a top edge that also gives Mosehle his first catch"
"carves over cover, a full delivery, not quite out of the middle"
"full at leg stump, not quite a yorker, flicked at midwicket...a very handy four deliveries"
"and now we've had a relay catch! A short ball, angled into the hip, it's pulled away towards deep square leg where Kuhn runs around and holds the catch but knows he'll run over the rope, so flicks it back to Tahir who just about manages to keep his composure and hold the take. But he nearly dropped it!"
"that ends a terrific, and maybe matchwinning over, as Mathews just tucks a length ball into the leg side"
"and they are falling quickly now, but Parnell's got lucky here as a big full toss is heaved straight to deep midwicket. Not quite bowled for and got. They are checking on the no-ball for height, but's okay"
"short of a length, splices the pull back over the bowler"
"another short one, beats the top edge as Chandimal goes for the pull...South Africa closing this out"
"goes full, he can only drive it to cover on the edge of the ring"
"moves across his crease and middles this one, picks up a length ball from around off stump and swings it over the short deep square leg boundary"
"fuller, outside off, sweetly struck but it's drilled straight to long-on"
"full and straight, only a single as he drives to mid-off"
"well bowled, a slower short ball outside off, he's through his shot way to early"
"clubs a length ball over the off stump, it skips wide of the sweeper but it's not enough unless there is a spate of wides and no-balls"
"goes for the yorker, it's a low full toss, crunched straight to the cover sweeper"
"another full toss, scoots off the outside edge to short third man"
drives down to long-on and ambles through for the single
