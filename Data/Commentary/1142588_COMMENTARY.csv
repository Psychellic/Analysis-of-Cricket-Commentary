"low full-toss fairly wide of off stump, reaches out without too much footwork and slices it to backward point"
"starts with a fast, short one angling across Tharanga and rising over off stump. Sways to avoid the line, and the umpires reckon it bounced over head height as well - it did indeed"

"back of a length on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"appeal for caught behind, but he hasn't nicked this. Excellent length, pitching on or around off stump and continuing to slant away. Not anywhere near full enough to drive, especially with that short stride, and he pushes hard at it, away from his body, and misses"
excellent bouncer to follow up. Rises steeply over middle stump and Dickwella misses the attempted ramp over the keeper after hurriedly swaying out of the way
"another push away from the body, another miss. No real stride from Dickwella as this one pitches on about middle stump and nips away to exaggerate the angle away from the left-hander. De Kock fails to pouch this behind the stumps - a nervy start for him"

"back of a length on off stump, Tharanga is opened up by the angle but manages to defend it adequately, if not convincingly"

"back of a length close to off stump, defended towards backward point"
wide half-volley and Dickwella misses out. Drives it forcefully but can't beat cover point diving to his left

"short, a bit of width, controlled cut down to the left of third man"
"bouncer rising over middle stump. Sways away, looks to ramp it over the keeper, can't connect. The leaping de Kock can only get the tip of his gloves to the ball. Manages to slow it down and keep it down to two as third man runs around to mop up"

"shortish, close to off stump, jabbed away into the point region"
"short, angling away from off stump. Looks to pull and is a little late on it, plays it down to mid-on"

"his line is all over the place today. Down the leg side this time, too far from Tharanga's reach for the flick"
"got him! Finally he lands one on the perfect line and length for Tharanga, back of a length, fourth-stump line, and gets it to straighten. Tharanga's tendency to play with an open face undoes him, only manages an edge that carries low to de Kock, who takes it well, falling to his left"
"it's certainly messing with Dala's line. Full, slanting down leg, and KP misses the flick, forcing de Kock into a big dive"
"oh my, <b>nearly another wicket!</b> What an eventful over this is. Bangs it in short outside off, and it stops on Perera as he looks to rise to his toes and slap it over point. Ends up playing way too early, and sends it ballooning towards - but not close enough to - mid-off"

"length ball on middle and off, defended to midwicket"

"he does't need to if he gets a full-toss with width outside off. Drives firmly to beat extra-cover to his left, and the sweeper is left with too much ground to cover to his right"
"full outside off, driven to long-off"
"full on off stump. Drives a little early and checks his shot, with the result that he ends up chipping it over the bowler and umpire. Drops down well short of the fielder at long-on"
"slower ball, short and outside off, chopped to backward point, who's right on the edge of the circle, so an easy single"
"short, angling in towards off stump and he opens up to pull to the left of deep square leg. What's happened there? The fielder's left knee has dug into the soil awkwardly as he dived to try and stop it. Could have so easily led to an injury. Maharaj was the fielder, if I'm not wrong"
"another short ball, and this time he swivels a little earlier and pulls hard to the right of deep square leg. No chance for the fielder this time"
"full, bit of width, stabbed away to deep point"
"digs it in short, angles it into off stump, and Shanaka's pull continues to pile it on. Hits from down to up and ends up scooping it all the way for six, over the boundary to the rihgt of deep square leg"
"sharp bouncer over off stump, Shanaka sways hurriedly out of the way, and de Kock concedes a few more byes. Doesn't quite time his jump right, and ends up only getting his fingertips to it. Not enough to slow it down significantly either"
"full, angling down leg. Misses the flick and picks up a leg-bye as the ball rolls into the off side off the pad. I don't think he got any bat on that"
"short slower ball outside off, pulled to deep midwicket"
"another short ball, gets up to around shoulder height while angling into the batsman. A little early on the pull and it hits his back and rolls away towards third man"
"full, angling into middle and leg. Clears his front leg and mistimes his slog. Drags it to deep square leg off the inside half of his bat"
"onto the pads, and that could have cost South Africa plenty, with fine leg inside the circle, but Mathews flicks it straight to that fielder"
"short, wide, slapped off the front foot to the right of sweeper cover, where Mulder makes a good diving save. Shanaka hit this very hard"
"length ball on off stump, clears his front leg and swipes this in the air, on the bounce, to deep midwicket"
"short again, outside off, and Mathews just about finds the gap between long-on and deep midwicket with this pull, despite a desperate dive from the former fielder. Moves into the 90s too"
"slower length ball outside off, swiped along the ground to long-on"
"full, fairly wide outside off, Mathews can't quite middle this drive and it rolls slowly to the left of extra-cover"
"full on leg stump and that is... out. Makes himself room to hit down the ground, which he manages, but the full length doesn't allow him to get underneath it enough. Long-on takes the catch moving to his left"
length ball angling down leg. Mathews can't put bat on the flick
"slower short ball outside off, pulled hard but straight to deep square leg"
"greets him with a bouncer, angling in from wide of the crease, and Dananjaya responds by backing away and ramping it over the keeper. Top shot!"
"another bouncer, angling into the batsman as he backs away from the stumps. Pulled in the air, on the bounce, to deep square leg"
"Not quite. In the blockhole, angling into the batsman's feet. Gets his front leg out of the way and whips it hard, but straight to deep midwicket, and he can only pick up one. Dananjaya rushes out of his crease for a non-existent second - was worth the effort, I suppose - and ends up run out off the final ball"
"good length on off stump, Amla defends nicely"
shifts his weight back and deftly turns a shortish delivery towards midwicket
"good lines from Lakmal, and to make it even better, this one straightens off the pitch. Amla has to be careful and he is, defending on off stump"
"<b>that's OUTRAGEOUSLY good</b>. Songs should be sung about this ball; about how it pitches on middle and off stump, hoodwinking the batsman into thinking it is a straight ball and that he should be playing on the leg side. Amla is setting up to do that, then gets squared up, alarmed by the seam movement away off the pitch. The ball cackles past the leading edge and clatters into top of off. Simply glorious"
short and wide and Markram belts it to the point boundary
on the pads this time and he has another easy put-away. Leg glance for another boundary
"makes the room he needs to drive a tossed up ball, from around the wicket, to cover"
"plays for turn, the bat coming down in uncertain fashion, as the slider beats the inside edge and hits the pads. Lbw appeal, not given because it would have slid down leg"
"steps out of his crease, but Dananjaya pulls his length back well and keeps the batsman honest"
""
pushes into the covers
"backs away and slaps the quicker delivery, on leg stump, through point. The change in length (this one's rather short) helps de Kock find the middle of the bat"
"drills it to the right of point. Superb shot from the No. 3, using a vertical bat this time since he doesn't quite have the width to cut"
dribbles over onto the pads and Markram attempts a leg glance. Doesn't quite get enough bat on it. Or any for that matter as Dickwella dives to his left to collect the ball
"full and angled into middle and leg, Markram blocks"
"gets out the cover drive, the front foot moving nicely to the ball outside off. There's protection in the circle though"
finds that dangerous away movement off the pitch again and Markram has to block on off stump
"pitches it up on middle and leg, Markram turns it to midwicket"
the length is short again and de Kock smashes it to cover. Really should have done better there.
"makes up for it now as he charges down the track, gets to the pitch of the tossed up ball on leg stump and lifts it over midwicket"
"the sliders keep on coming from Dananjaya, and de Kock deals with them by keeping his front foot out of the way of his straight bat"
keeps leg side of this good length offbreak on middle and pats it down to cover
"legbreak, nicely tossed up too, de Kock shifts himself beside it on leg stump and drives to short cover"
googly to introduce himself to the right-hander. Markram doesn't pick it as he tries to drive down the ground. Inside edge to short midwicket
"chops a short and wide delivery down off the bottom edge to the slips and takes a few steps out of his crease - and alert to that, Mendis sends in a direct hit. De Kock though has made it back, which the third umpire confirms"
"good length ball on leg stump, de Kock tries to flick it away, but gets an inside edge onto pad"
"good length ball outside off, de Kock taps it to short cover"
uses soft hands to nudge the good length ball on leg stump to mid-on
hammers the back of a length delivery behind point. The bottom-hand power he's generating is unbelievable. The skill with which he's getting on top of the bounce. The balance at the crease. He definitely loves facing fast bowling
"he's into the drive a bit early and so checks his shot. Nevertheless, there's enough timing on it to zip past the bowler's right and away to the straight boundary. So much for holding a good line and length."
"shortish and outside off, he cuts to point"
"legbreak, which de Kock picks off the hand and gently works it to short fine leg"
"tosses it up just outside off, it's the legbreak again, Markram defends"
"taken! Markram looks a million bucks against pace. But he needs to do a lot of work against spin. Doesn't read the googly. Just thinks it's an overpitched delivery wide outside off, ripe to be smashed over cover. Ends up mis-hitting it to the bowler's left. Dananjaya dives to complete a fine catch, and a fine set-up"
<b>they can't spot his googly</b>. The new man in - the centurion from not so long ago - comes forward to block a legbreak. But this isn't a legbreak. It's the wrong 'un that hurtles through the gap between bat and pad
"tossed up wide of off, ends up as a full-toss that Klaasen strokes towards long-off"
"back of a length, angling into middle stump, defended to midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"lovely length, a bit of seam back in towards off stump. Good stride forward to block this towards mid-off"
"back of a length, straightens slightly away from off stump. Defended into the covers. Probing over so far"
"length ball close to off stump, defended to cover point. A needless throw at the bowler's end ends up as a direct hit and concedes an overthrow"
"back of a length down the leg side and that's a huuuuge appeal for a catch down the leg side! Not out is the decision, and Sri Lanka have reviewed it. Dickwella was really excited, but then he always is... No bat, just a tickle off the thigh pad"
"tossed up on off stump and Klaasen sweeps, in the air but safely down before square leg can come in off the rope"
"a rare bad ball from Dananjaya, short and wide, and de Kock cuts it away behind backward point"
"ooh, good ball. Goes with the angle towards off stump. Defended into the covers. Was playing a bit away from his body there"
"flighted offbreak pitching on middle and leg. Pushed gently, inside-out, into the covers"
"big appeal, and it's given! Another googly, another clueless South African batsman! Looks like Klaasen isn't reviewing this. Came forward to defend and completely played down the wrong line. Easy to see why there's no review. That spun in and hit him just below the knee-roll, in front of middle stump, and he hadn't taken a big stride forward at all. Hawkeye says it would have taken out a big chunk of leg stump"
"length ball outside off, presses forward and blocks into the covers"
"full, angling into middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"back of a length, slides on towards leg stump as he attempts to create room. Jabbed to cover point"
"shortish outside off, cut away but backward point moves quickly to his left and dives to keep it down to one"
"back of a length, goes with the angle towards off stump. Rocks back and punches it handsomely between cover point and extra-cover"
"more flight now, and again it goes with the arm towards off stump. Drives away from his body and inside-edges into front pad"
"spins now, from middle to off, and Duminy presses forward to block into the covers"
slow length ball straightening towards middle stump. Goes back and makes room to punch to cover point
down the track and he bowls a flat offbreak on leg stump. Stretches out to defend
"wrong length to pull! Nowhere near short enough, and he's lucky that's sliding down leg, or he'd have been plumb lbw"
"short outside off, slapped away through cover point"
"tossed up outside off, nice and slow, and de Kock has to reach out a long way in front of his body to sweep. Misses, and is hit on the back thigh"
"down the track now, gets to the pitch of this middle-stump ball and clips it down to long-on"
"fullish outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and chops it away into the gully region"
"short, wide, cracked away nicely but there's always a sweeper hovering in the middle overs of ODIs"
"wide-ish length ball, slapped hard to backward point"
"down the track now and de Kock gives it the big heave. Gets the length he wants, in his hitting arc, and the line, around off stump, that allows him to free his arms and hit it over mid-on"
"on the pads now, tucked away to long leg"
"tossed up slow outside off, looks to sweep and misses. Too full for the shot, and it sneaks under his bat, spins, and hits his back thigh"
"tossed up full on middle stump, driven inside-out and short extra-cover dives right to stop it"
"full on middle again, and this time short extra moves left to stop de Kock's jab"
"ooh, this one goes with the arm towards leg stump. De Kock drives away from his body and inside-edges into his pad. Barely a front-foot stride there"
"overpitches one, finally, and gives plenty of width too, and de Kock drives with a full follow-through to the left of short extra-cover"
"length ball on off stump, presses forward and opens his bat face to push towards sweeper cover"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and steers to third man"
"short, rising chest-high over off stump. Pulled to deep square leg"
"short again, angling further away from off stump and bouncing a touch higher. Can't control the pull as easily, and he plays it down to the right of midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, pulled off the front foot to mid-on"
"short on off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
"shortish on leg stump, pulled round to long leg"
this slider of his is a really effective delivery. Goes on towards leg stump and Duminy drives to long-on off the inside half of his bat
"ooh, another good-length slider. De Kock is half-forward in defence, and gets a fortunate inside edge into his pads"
"another slider. Defends, looking to play towards cover, ends up playing towards midwicket"
drifts onto leg stump and he sweeps in the air to the left of the diving midwicket fielder
"tossed up on off stump, defended into the covers"
"some turn now, from outside off, and de Kock harnesses it well to reverse-lap it past the keeper"
"down the track, makes some room to drive this full, middle-stump ball into the wide mid-off region"
"short, rising over off stump, and he swivels nicely to help this pull to the right of long leg"
"fullish on off stump, pushed into the covers off the front foot"
"length ball outside off, punched to sweeper cover"
"shortish on off stump, Nice hands from Duminy to work that to long leg"
"full, just outside off, and de Kock puts it away. He's really dangerous in this kind of mood, and he tees off to hit it flat and hard, in the air between the bowler and mid-off"
"gone! Dhananjaya joins Dananjaya in the wickets column. Steps out but doesn't reach the pitch of this length ball outside off. Closes his bat face - not sure where he's trying to drive this, but he's definitely playing well in front of his body, and gets a leading edge that pops straight back to the bowler"
"<b>huuuge appeal for a stumping</b> as de Silva slides a good length ball through with the angle from around the wicket. Mulder goes for a loose drive, he's beaten, but he has not moved his back foot up, out of his crease. Quick as Dickwella is, that's not out"
goes back to flick a good length ball off his pads towards midwicket
"opens the face as he leans forward to the flighted delivery outside off and drives through to the sweeper cover. Brings up <b>a half-century</b>, his first as South Africa captain"
"steps out, but the bowler spots those movements and shortens his length. Mulder tucks it through midwicket for a single"
"loops it up out there outside off, de Kock lashes it away to the sweeper"
"a smidge slow on the pull shot, which results in an inside edge that wanders away to fine leg"
on middle and leg and de Kock works it through to deep square leg
"bouncer to the right-hander, and Mulder does well to get under it"
"misses a straight one! Mulder is caught in the crease (the after-effects of that bouncer earlier), the bat coming around his front pad to defend. That gives enough time for this quick, pitched-up delivery to thud into his front pad. Umpire Palliyaguruge gives it, but Mulder wants a review. UltraEdge shows no bat. Ball-tracking says it will crash into leg stump"
"shortish and outside off, Andile pushes it to cover"
works it off his hips to long leg
"tossed up, angling into leg stump or thereabouts and spinning back towards the stumps. Defended back towards the bowler"
"looks to sweep from the stumps and misses, but that one bounced a lot and would have sailed over"
"quicker length ball on off stump, defended from the crease into the off side"
this one continues with the round-the-wicket angle towards middle stump. Goes deep in his crease and clips into the on side
"on the pads now, goes on the back foot again to work it backward of square"
"bowled 'im, this is an absolute beaut! De Kock never really gets a stride forward and across to the ball while defending, and this time he ends up a long way from the pitch of the ball. Plays for the slider, and it turns, but turns ever so slightly, enough to miss the outside edge but not enough to miss off stump. Delightful delivery"
"bouncer over off stump, Phehlukwayo sways away from the line"
"shortish outside off, defended into the covers"
"another bouncer, closer to the batsman this time. Sways away again, and lets the over-the-wicket angle do its thing"
full on off stump. Looks to drive through mid-off and gets a thick outside edge to third man. No real front-foot stride
"bouncer well outside off. Maharaj leans away from the line, just in case it does something unexpected off the pitch"
"full outside off, left alone"
tossed up nicely on off stump. Presses forward to defend with the turn into the covers
"a little quicker this time, and Phehlukwayo defends from the crease"
"lovely, lovely bowling. Having pushed him back with that quicker one, he dangles one up slow and enticing outside off. Hardly gets a stride in, and pushes at it away from his body as it dips and turns away sharply. Thin edge, and a good catch from Dickwella behind the stumps. This is Dananjaya's fifth wicket - the second time he's done it in an ODI"
nice length outside off. Defends with an open face towards backward point
"fuller, closer to off stump, blocked into the covers"
"full, angling down leg, clipped away to the left of mid-on"
"back of a length on off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and jabs into the cover point region"
"back of a length, angling across towards off stump, defends from the crease, playing right under his eyes"
"bouncer, signalled wide after Rabada ducks under it - didn't really have to, because it rose way over his head"
"another bouncer - wasn't a whole lot lower than the previous one but the umpires let it go. Rabada half-ducks this, bending lightly at the waist"
"short again, more rib-cage territory on this occasion. Jumps to ride the bounce, drops his bottom hand, and does well to keep it down on the leg side"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, defended into the on side"
"shortish on off stump, jumps up and defends it back to the bowler"
"googly, big lbw appeal, but there's an inside-edge on this one. Barely any stride from Maharaj as he jabs at this, well in front of his body"
"full outside off, driven towards mid-off. A bit of a mix-up, but they sort it out and complete the single"
"good-length offbreak outside off, left alone"
"fuller, on the pads, clipped through square leg"
"legbreak, loopy and full on middle stump. Clipped to midwicket"
"another loopy legbreak, ends up as a full-toss on leg stump. Maharaj clips it to long-on"

"back of a length on off stump, punched to sweeper cover"
"full on off stump, blocked into the covers"
"short, a bit of width, and Rabada uppercuts deliberately, over slip once again"
"back of a length, angling into the pads, whipped away to deep square leg"
"back of a length, angling into middle and leg. Keeps slightly low and Maharaj defends it back towards the bowler"
"nicely bowled, angling in from round the wicket, towards middle and off, and doesn't turn as much as Rabada expects as he props forward to defend. Inside-edge into the pad"
down the track and he gets inside the line to lift this inside-out over the leaping extra-cover fielder
"full outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
"legbreak, skids on towards middle and leg. Goes back and punches into the covers"
"another legbreak, slower with more flight, and Akila has his sixth wicket. Maharaj jumps out and gives it a big heave. Not quite to the pitch of it, and he slices it high in the air, descends for a simple catch at mid-off"
"back of a length slider from round the wicket, zeroing in on middle and leg stumps. Rabada defends watchfully off the back foot"
bangs it in short outside off. Reaches out and stabs it towards third man
"back of a length on leg stump, whipped away to deep square leg"
"bouncer, quick one, angling into the batsman's left shoulder. Swivels round to pull, and though he's a little late on it, he plays it pretty well, stepping across and keeping his eye on the ball. Helps it away to the fine leg boundary"
"short and wide, and that is that. Sri Lanka have pulled it back to 3-2. Slaps it firmly, but can't keep it down, hits it straight to point at around waist height, and he catches it one-handed on the rebound after spilling it on the first attempt"
