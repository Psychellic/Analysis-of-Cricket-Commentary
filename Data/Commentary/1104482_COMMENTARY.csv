"<b>huge shout for lbw, not given by umpire Gould.</b> Zimbabwe have reviewed this. Was there an inside edge? Short of good length ball, cuts back in sharply and hits him on the pad on off and middle. He also slightly jumped, so height could also be a factor here. First impact seems to be on the front pad, it may have hit the back pad after that which could have resulted in the double noise. Seems like there is no edge. Has been ruled not out. Seems like there was no conclusive evidence"

"gets some bounce off the deck from length outside off, Mathews gets on top if it to defend to the leg side"
"hint of movement away from the deck, Mathews is almost open-chested as he defends the length ball back down the pitch"
"this is a poor ball. Full and sliding down leg, Mathews uses the angle to tickle it fine. No chance for fine leg. Mopfu was looking for a yorker, I suspect. It turned out to be a low full toss on leg stump. Easy pickings"

"shot of the morning! Tossed up, this one drifts into middle, Mathews shimmies down the pitch and plays a delightful on-drive back past the bowler and mid-on"
"shot of the morning followed by a ball that would've got most top order batsmen out. Mathews is drawn forward by the length. This was nicely tossed up, the ball drifted away a touch and then spun away. Mathews stabbed at the ball, which means he went at it with hard hands, and the thick edge flew low to the right of the slip fielder, who stayed nice and low and moved as the ball descended to pluck off a stunning catch. There was some doubt for a while regarding the catch itself, but Mathews was happy to walk off as Masakadza told him he had taken it cleanly. Good to see. Sri Lanka are in trouble"

"short of length delivery outside off, he shapes to pull in front of square but sways out of the way in the end. Umpire signals that as one bouncer for the over"
"slower and fuller on middle, defended with a straight bat"
bangs in a short ball but sprays this way down leg. Exercise time for Ian Gould. Is he trying to set him up for an lbw by floating a full ball?
"defends from the crease, gets a bottom edge and the ball bounces over the stumps. Masakadza had no clue where the ball went"

"another cutter, this one's much fuller in length, confidently defended off the frontfoot"
"back of length delivery outside off, bunted to cover. This time he played at it from the crease"
he's smashed that back past the bowler and mid-on. Length on middle and he's smacked that through the line on the up. Hit it beautifully
looks to swing this over midwicket but gets a thick inside edge that races away to the deep backward square leg boundary. Not in control but he'll take the runs however they come
smacked to mid-off. This wasn't a half-volley but he went through with the stroke
"crashed back past Kulasekara. Too full again, he was waiting for it. Looked like he was trying to bowl a yorker, ended up being a half-volley which Mire biffed hard into the ground. Away she went"
"he's muscled this into the jungles. To hit the ball into the stands that are 110 metres from the middle is no joke. Wow, what timing, what muscle. Back of length outside off, Mire cleared his front leg and clobbered this from outside off. New ball, please."
"looped up on middle from around the stumps, turned to short midwicket"
slides one across the right-hander who dabs it to point
"whipped into acres of open space at deep midwicket. Once again full and drifting into the pads, he brought out his strong bottom-hand to put that away."

"lands this at length on middle and leg, defended back down the pitch"
"lofted over the infield, one bounce to long-on. Wanted to hit it over midwicket"
"brings back Malinga but there isn't  much of a change in the approach. Slower and fuller on off, Mire held his shape to loft that back over his head. Two bounces into the boundary. Thrilling batting"
"skiddy length ball on middle, bunted to the off side"
gets a good stride forward and defends the off-cutter to short cover
"he's swept Malinga over the keeper's head. Once again full on off, Masakadza gets outside the line of the stumps and sweeps him. One bounce to the ropes. What timing. Very brave of him to attempt that. They're going for this. What a turbocharge"
punches this short of length ball to short cover

"smashed back, well stopped by the bowler on his followthrough"
"looks to fetch the sweep from way outside off, misses"

"dipping full toss outside off, swung across the line to mid-on"

"sharp turn and bounce, he shaped to cut but was cramped for room. Rolls back off the top part of the bat"

drilled straight to mid-on
drags this slog from way outside off towards deep midwicket. Was lured by the flight
hit hard and just past the diving Malinga at mid-off. A more agile fielder and he may have stopped it. Hit really hard
"too full outside off, he lunges forward and blocks"
steps out and punches this length ball to cover. Shaped to go over the top but couldn't get underneath the flight
"cuts back in, the wrong'un, bunted back down the pitch"

"length ball, tucked off the pads to backward square leg"
"very full on middle and leg, squeezed out to long-on"
"misfield at wide long-on. This is the last thing Sri Lanka need now. It's a full toss that comes at an awkward height and Mire heaves it away, does not middle it and the ball lands on the bounce in front of the fielder getting around it. Lets it burst through the hands"
"and this time there is no worry about the fielder as he has slogged it out of here. Pitched up outside off, gets all the room he needs and absolutely shovels it over deep midwicket"

"gets down for another big slog sweep, not middled and the ball is fielded at deep midwicket"
"flat and full on off and middle, pushed back down the pitch"
"legbreak, spins the other way and not picked by the batsman who keeps his bat inside the line after shuffling across"
"<b>bowled around the legs</b>. Finally, Sri Lanka end this first-wicket madness. Mire gets down for a sweep and plants the front foot across. Ends up exposing his legstump and the ball has been slid in on middle and leg. It's the attempted legbreak again, and he misses the sweep and goes off the front thigh and takes out the stumps. Can Sri Lanka claw back or has the damage already been done?"
"slides in on leg on a length, tucked off the pads to midwicket"

"spears in a yorker on middle from around the stumps, just manages to bring his bat down in time to keep that out"
squeezes he full-length delivery to cover. Malinga has overstepped. Free-hit coming up. <strong>This was a harsh call</strong>
miscues a waist-high full toss towards deep midwicket
"it's taken a superb catch by Kulasekara at mid-off to end Masakadza's party. Looks to loft this over mid-off but this was the slower ball, he had to force the pace. Went a little too hard and ended up slicing it. Kulasekara timed his jump well and was airborne as he plucked the catch. Then held his balance and composure as he landed. This has been a super knock, one that has really given Zimbabwe a big push towards a series win"
"full on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
spins back in sharply to hit the top of the pad as he plays outside the line

"digs in a short ball outside leg, was angling away from around the stumps, Musakanda ducks under it"
flicks the full toss to deep backward square leg

"full ball drifting into middle from around the stumps, he gets a long way forward and blocks"
may have been saved by an inside edge. Tried to fetch this sweep from outside oeff
"wonder why it wasn't given out immediately. Replays confirm this was as plumb as it could get. This one drifted in a long way from around the stumps, pitched on leg and spun away to hit him on the back pad. Ervine was well back inside the crease so the ball didn't have much distance to travel. <b> Hawkeye confirms this would've hit top of middle. </b> Is there another twist?"
"drawn forward with the flight, he jabs at the ball and gets a thick edge that rolls to short third man"

goes back and across to defend that shortish delivery on the stumps

whips this short delivery on middle to deep midwicket. Kept a touch low but he was behind it

"sharp turn into middle and leg, nurdled to the fielder coming in from deep midwicket"
"this is now a proper meltdown. Oh, dear. Musakanda, why would you do that? This was nicely tossed up on middle from around the stumps, he looked to hit it towards midwicket but this didn't turn as much as he expected and skewed it towards long-on. Game on"
whipped to deep midwicket. Raza the key from here on
"wayward delivery down leg, looks to tickle it fine, off the pad to the keeper on the bounce"
bunts this short of length delivery to cover
nearly chopped it back onto the stumps. Looked to slash that behind point but was cramped for room

skews off the outer part of the bat to the off side. Played for the turn but there was none this time
"yorker-length, just outside off, squeezes it off the inside edge to mid-on"
"the roar in the stadium tells you the story. This was full, fast and dead straight on the stumps. The ball tailed back in late. He was looking to flick but got a leading edge back to Malinga who managed to hang on in his followthrough. There's life in this game still. Zimbabwean nerves will be jangling"
"dipping yorker on off, excellent change in pace, just behind the line in defence"
"flicked into the deep square leg region. Not entirely convincing, the ball squeezed through to take the inside edge."
"inswinging yorker, eased down to long-on"
"this is classic Malinga. Toe-crushing yorker that reverses back in a long way from outside off, he looks to squeeze this past midwicket but misses it completely. Hit flush on the toe as the ball deflects towards short third man. Angle may have taken it down leg. Malinga was convinced, Mathews not so convinced"
stabs it with the bat well in front of the pad
"flatter in trajectory, full in length just on off, he gets forward and blocks"
shows the full face of the bat in defence. Once again right to the pitch of the ball
"this is epic! Beautiful bowling from Dananjaya, tossed this up superbly on middle, he was itchy to drive but the ball dipped on him to ensure he didn't get to the pitch of it, he went through with the shot to get a thick inside edge as Kusal Mendis, stationed specifically for something like that at leg gully, moves swiftly to his left to take an excellent reflex-action catch"
worked with the spin to long-on
"what confidence! Steps out, decides he's had enough, gets to the pitch of the ball and launches this over long-off. It sailed a long way back into the stands. Guts."
"this is a Malinga special. Full and straight, tails back in late and is angling into his toes, not sure how he managed to get his bat down to keep that out. Phew"
"bends back in late to hit him flush on the pad but the impact was way outside. It was a full toss, he should've put that away"
"another full length delivery that tails back in to hit the pad and deflect to the off side. Cremer caught ball-watching, non-striker took off for the run and was through. Gestured furiously to his captain to get across, eventually they did. What drama"
"flicked into the deep square leg region, Gunathilaka does well to come haring in to keep it down to a single"
"<strong>this is the Malinga of 2014.</strong> Right into the blockhole again, Cremer just about manages to keep that out. Risky though as he tried to work that to the leg side"

"gets this to reverse late, works the full delivery to square leg"
that's the end of that. They've done it. Zimbabwe have won the series. The celebrations tell you a story. Raza saw this tossed up over his eyeline and couldn't hold back as he stepped out and lofted this over the bowler's head. Long-off was under that but the ball kept swirling away. Raza was hitting it with the breeze so it just about sailed over the ropes even though he didn't middle it. <b> Zimbabwe's first away series win since 2009. </b> What a moment. Such a thin line that between a wicket and a six. What a game we've had
