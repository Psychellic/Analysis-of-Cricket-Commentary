"pretty full, Natarajan brings this one back into Wade, this is something he has been working on in the recent years, has Wade falling over the flick. Hits the front pad. Not given out lbw. Has that straightened enough to attack leg stump?<strong> India call for a review</strong>. <b>Or have India been timed out?</b> Looks like, and Kohli has a word with the umpire. And guess what? The tracker returns three reds"
"low full-toss, sliding into the pads, picked off to deep midwicket"

"wide yorker, stabbed out to cover"
"full and outside off, punched down to long-off"
"knuckle ball variation from Thakur, Maxwell slices his lofted drive, Samson is lurking at long-off. He leaps to his left, chucks the ball into play, before going over the ropes"

"<strong>Rahul belts out an appeal for caught behind</strong>. Not given out. Chahal isn't convinced, but India still go for a review and they take it on time. Maxwell aims for a reverse-sweep, darted flatter and wider of off. Nothing on Hotspot. No spike on Snicko either. The original decision is upheld"

"full-toss on off stump, forced down to long-off. Chahar ends with 0 for 34 in his first over"

"full and straight, whipped to Chahar at deep midwicket"
"on a length and on off stump, offcutter, nurdled through the leg side"
"Chahar runs in from sweeper cover and drops it! Sloppy stuff from India. Full and outside off, Maxwell aims to launch it over extra-cover, instead he slices it squarer. Chahar runs in and spills it"
"Whoa! Outrageous strike from Maxwell. This is a slower length ball outside off, Maxwell jumps across off, manufactures his own pace and smites it over the midwicket boundary - like only he can"

"fullish and outside off, cross-seam, Maxwell jumps across off, aims for the shorter leg-side fence, leading-edges it down to third man instead"
"<strong>slower dipper from Thakur and Wade has been given out lbw.</strong> The batsman sweeps early, the ball plunges sharply and hits him on the boot in line with the stumps. Wade has reviewed almost immediately. Has he nicked it then? Nope, and ball-tracking returns three reads. Wade goes for a career-best 80 off 53 balls"

"Natarajan aims for the yorker, but it comes out as a full-toss. Maxwell shuffles across, looks to reverse-swat it away, but misses it altogether in the end. Natarajan messes with the stumps once again"
"Short shuffles across and gives the left-armer the charge, Natarajan shifts his lines wider, sliced to deep third man"
"full and outside off, drilled through the line, placed to the right of sweeper cover as Samson slides in vain in the outfield"
"full-toss, but it is still a hard-to-hit full-toss, punched down towards long-on. Short comes back for the second - which isn't quite there - and is caught short despite a full-length dive. Nice, flat throw from the deep"
