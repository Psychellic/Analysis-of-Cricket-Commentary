"Has Watson deflected the ball back onto the stumps at the non-striker's end? Watson thinks he has Denly. Yes, <strong>Watson has finger-tipped the ball back onto the stumps</strong> to catch the England batsman short.

works this full delivery towards deep midwicket
"Given out, only for the batsman to refer this immediately. Straight off the helmet it looked like. He shaped to pull but is beaten for pace completely. Oh, wait. There may have been a small spike. The umpire gave it out and quickly realised he had made a mistake perhaps. By then, Ingram had already referred the decision upstairs. What happens next? The tiny little spike means the <strong>decision is upheld</strong>. Ingram is clearly unhappy as he walks off. Surely not enough to give it out? Ingram was in sensational touch."

"inswinging yorker on leg stump, squirted straight to Mills at short fine leg. Watson wants a single, there is a mix-up, <strong>a direct hit could have dismissed Watson again</strong>"
"<b>Farcical running between the wickets</b>, and Watson has been dismissed this time. Short of a length and angling away outside off, Watson wants to pull it against the angle. Instead, he bottom-edges the pull onto his thigh. He isn't aware where the ball is. Shafiq runs in, then hesitates. Watson is hurt, having smashed the ball onto his thigh. He then stops running. Rizwan, the keeper, collects the ball, and takes the bails off. Talk about adding injury to insult. Watson hobbles off after being run out. Watson not third-time lucky"

"makes room and lifts this short of length delivery over cover, back for the second"
"Boom Boom has created magic here and Dubai roars. The entire Karachi side runs up to him to give him a big hug. This is definitely in the shortlist for the best catch in recent times. Afridi's anticipation is magnificent here. Coming back to the shot: this is a length ball which he lifts through the line. For most parts, it seems as if the ball will creep over Afridi at long-on, but he arches back, times his jump well and puts his right hand out to take the catch. As this happens, he realises he'll tip over the ropes, so hurls the ball in the air, goes out, comes back in and completes the catch. Then he brings out the arms aloft pose. Wow, this boy still has it in him, doesn't he? What an entertainer."

"slower delivery, this time he swings but the ball deflects off the pad away towards Irfan junior who fails to bend down in time to stop it on the first attempt at fine leg. Then, near the boundary cushion, his right leg may have been touching the hoarding as he eventually pulled it back in."
