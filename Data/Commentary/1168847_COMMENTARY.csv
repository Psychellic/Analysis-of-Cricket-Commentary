"<b>comedy of errors!</b> Yorker on leg, and the ball has been inside-edged onto his toes. Batsman tries to go for a single since he doesn't know where the ball is. Musa picks the ball up, and tries to whip the bails off (at the batsman's end), but he loses his balance and drops the ball. Seeing that, the batsman tries to run again, but this time Musa controls his running, takes an aim at the stumps, and gets a direct-hit! Wow"

"slower ball, length delivery outside off, and he misses the flat-batted shot. Through to the keeper"
"full on middle, and drilled to long on"
