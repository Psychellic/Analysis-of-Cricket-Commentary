"short of a length, 132kph and rising up towards the body, YJB tucks one down behind square on the leg side"

"dug in short, 136kph and at the top of the head, climbing through to the keeper as Bairstow bails out of his pull short"

"and Cummins sprays the ball leg side again... Ooh er, radar's definitely gone a but wonky"
"full outside off, Roy aims an aerial drive... <b>but it's snapped up at extra cover!</b> Cummins strikes, making good use of the extra deliveries. Swung a touch and the ball might have stopped on him, Roy is a batsman not too worried about keeping it down but he couldn't quite clear Finch, who took a good catch above his head"

comes across on off and defends

"short and wide and rasped on the cut, Smith was pretty close at backward point but gets a good hand on it and keeps them to one"
"length, driven on the up and that's all business from Root, timed through the covers and Warner has to pump the gas to catch up with the ball just in front of the rope"
pitched up and pushed into the off side
"dug in short, Bairstow rattles a pull through backward square, Cummins again surfs the wave along the boundary and one-hands it back in for deep square to field. [Jazz voice] <i>Nice</i>"

"tossed up and straightening outside off, defended on the back foot"
pushed through and YJB dabs a drive to cover
dragged down a little and this is played square off the back foot for one through point

"tossed up nice and slow, draws a false shot as YJB reaches out and thick-edges one through backward square leg"
"good length outside off, 131 kph, pushed to cover. Can't seem to force that through extra cover because of that lack of pace"
"nice wicket to wicket bowling, full around off, hit back to the bowler"
looking to glide that off the open face to third man but the ball came back in - not sure seam movement or an offcutter. Dabbed to point instead. Three dots
"on the pads this time, 136.5 kph, flicked away to deep square leg"
"full and a tad wide, allows Root to stride forward and punch to the sweeper cover for a run"
"there is that dab to third man, gets two actually, fantastic running. On a length outside off, allows the ball to hit the bat, rather than going after it."
"doesn't matter if you're bowling full tosses, Root swats it away to a straight midwicket"
"nicely bowled, full on middle and leg, some drift in the air, worked away to deep square leg"
"shortish and wide outside off, carved to deep point."
"excellent batting, learnt from his error off the first ball, knew midwicket was straight and square leg was wide so when he saw a short ball, he went back and swatted it over where a normal midwicket would have been"
"more drift, full and straight, hit back to the bowler"
"full outside off, carved to the sweeper cover with the full face of the bat."
"another good single. Full delivery, moving back in ever so slightly, patted away towards the keeper. Bairstow calls his partner through. Paine's soccer skill isn't the best, by the look of that attempt"
"in the air and <strong>juuust wide of midwicket</strong>. Fullish on middle, Bairstow clips the ball in the air, but just wide of the fielder, to his right"
"good length outside off, Root comes down and inside-halves the ball into his back thigh. Goes through his legs for a run. Ouch, could have been worse"
"full delivery outside off, driven into the cover region"
"short and wide outside off, Bairstow nails a cut but finds the impenetrable Steven Smith at backward point, who dives to his right to save two, maybe four"
"excellent finish, that's where you want to be on this surface. Full and straight, defended back. A tidy over"
"was there some bat? 82 kph, very full outside off, Root shuffles right across and sweeps to short fine leg. Steven Smith speaks to Zampa, who is conversing with Paine. They rightly decide against the review"
""
driven into the cover region
"lovely shot, some flight outside off, so much flight that Bairstow chooses not to move his feet and then lofts the ball neatly over cover. Didn't bother keeping it down"
"oh beautifully bowled. The previous one was the legbreak, this one was the googly. They both were really full, the length allowed Bairstow to throw his hands at the line without his feet. What that did was create a big gap between bat and pad, the legbreak found the middle of the bat, the googly found a massive gap between bat and pad, and hits off and middle stump. Sensational bowling, didn't shorten his length after he was hit."
"another googly, 82 kph, outside off, not much turn, defended back. Excellent length for a wristspinner in that over, rather be full than short for precisely that reason"
"a full delivery outside off, dabbed towards backward point. Steven Smith picks up and throws at the bowler's end. Hits Morgan's bat, to the angst of the umpire. Could be to scruff up the ball."
"full and wide outside off, driven elegantly to the sweeper cover"
"don't think Starc will mind that too much, there is some late inward movement. Full and straight, maybe a tad too straight. Morgan just tickles that fine, to the fine leg boundary"
"140 kph, wide and full, sliced to the point fielder. Is there some reverse swing? You tend to get reverse quicker on an abrasive surface"
"wow, probably what Australia were playing for, 141 kph outside off, gets the ball to jag back in. It takes the inside edge, hits the back pad and smells the paint of leg stump. An inch straighter and the <strong>leg bail would have fallen</strong>"
"full and wide outside off, neatly played this time, through cover for a couple. Played inside the line to account for that movement"
"too much flight, on middle and leg, driven to long-on"
"that's how Morgan plays, he backs a very productive shot and connects. Flat and straight, Morgan gets into a really good position and reverse-sweeps through backward point. Out if he missed, but it's a very safe shot for Morgan"
"did he get some bat? Don't think so, but runs given. Lots of flight outside off, attempts another reverse-sweep but it's too full outside off. Paine is put off by that shot, goes through his legs"
"some drift on middle and leg, driven to long-on"
"shortish and wide, 88 kph, wary of the reverse-sweep again, hit to backward point"
"good end, slow but not full, 89 kph, Morgan gets forward and defends"
"full and wide outside off, carved away to the sweeper cover off the open face. So adept at finding gaps"
"<strong>will go down as a drop</strong> but those ones either stick or they go through like this. Full and straight, Morgan drives back, can't keep it down. Starc sticks out a right hand, but the ball bursts through. Don't think he got a hand on it actually"
"full and straight again, off the inside half to midwicket"
"141 kph, full on off, Morgan watches the ball onto his bat and defends. They'll look at playing Starc out"
"wow, <strong>terrific yorker.</strong> On middle and leg, tailing back in ever so late. Morgan gets his bat down on it just in time and jams it out"
"124 kph, the slower bouncer or the ball just didn't travel after pitching? On middle and leg, the short delivery. Morgan watches it onto his bat, always wanted to play Starc out"
"136 kph, full delivery outside off, driven to short cover. A hint of inward movement"
"135 kph, the first today but may not be the last. Root chops on. Was just saying Root is so good at finding gaps, and his natural instinct of trying to do so kicks in. It's a good length delivery outside off that seams back in, with Hazlewood's natural angle. The safer shot would have been playing with a full face, but Root tries to cut this down to third man for a run. It's not wide enough for that, but he still may have got away with it on a quicker surface, but not this. Hits off stump and England now in trouble. Batsmen will have to get forward and play with the full face."
"another indicator of how slow this surface is, 141 kph outside off, hardly gets up, Buttler sways"
"full on middle and leg, 136 kph, driven to mid-on"
"full delivery outside off, defended into the point region."
Buttler spoils the wicket maiden with a jammed drive into the gap at extra cover
"full delivery outside off from around the wicket, hit to deep cover. Looking for that off stump, or the one that got Buttler at the Gabba"
"good length delivery around off, defended watchfully"
"full delivery outside off, driven into the mid-off region."
"141 kph, short delivery, clever change in length, well directed too, Morgan sways away"
"seams back in, 143 kph, on middle and leg, nudged to midwicket."
"short around off, 142 kph, gets on top of the bounce so easily to bunt it away. Have to use the bouncer sparingly and to earn yourself a dot on a surface like this, the fuller ones are the wicket-takers"
"good stop by Mitch Marsh. Full outside off, Buttler gets forward and drives to short cover's right. Marsh dives to his right"
"he hits it harder and better and Marsh can't stop this. Overpitched outside off, drilled through wide mid-off. Marsh dives to his right"
"dug in, short around middle and leg, a top edge on the pull to fine leg, lands well in front"
"overpitched outside off, Morgan is a tad early through his drive, past cover for a couple."

"shortish delivery outside off, punched to that short point fielder"
"134 kph, tapped into the point region, just have to keep it there on this surface"

"130 kph, very good over, not too pacey but accurate, around off, coming back in, defended back with the full face"
"85 kph, Morgan gets low for a fine paddle sweep to short fine leg"
"very good at these shots, flat on middle and off, reverse-swept away through backward point"
"93 kph, pushed through, Buttler plays with the full face, can often mistake the flipper for a short delivery, pushed to long-off"
"slower but short, pushed to long-on for a single"
"some flight outside off, 83 kph, the swatty drive to long-off. Reached out for it."
"<strong>dropped by Steven Smith</strong>. Not easy but Smith will be disappointed. Short on middle and leg, pushed through. Slides on. Pulled to midwicket, where Smith gets low to his left, the ball pops out possibly off the wrists. Big moment in the game"
"lots of edges on this surface. Full delivery outside off, Morgan closes his bat face too early, a thick leading edge falls well short of mid-off"
worked away off his hips to deep square leg
"131 kph, Smith makes up one run, good length outside off, sliced off the open face to point where Smith dives to his right"
"<strong>juuuust short of mid-off</strong>. A lot happening here. Full and wide outside off, Buttler wants to go over mid-off but the ball lobs towards the fielder off the inside half. Lands in front"
"he has had enough of plodding about. Full and straight, Buttler goes through with his lofted drive, not great timing but his muscle does the rest, over mid-on. Lands on the boundary cushion."
"shortish and wide outside off, carved away to the sweeper cover. Warner is very quick on the ball"
"tossed up outside off, 87 kph, drilled through cover, lets his hands through the line. Two to deep cover"
"a flatter trajectory, on middle and leg, pushed back to the bowler"
"lots of flight outside off, driven to long-off with the spin."
"drops short does Zampa, Morgan was waiting for it, goes back and pulls over midwicket. Cummins runs around from deep midwicket to cut off the boundary"
"short and wide outside off, slashed to point"
"87 kph, flight and straight, driven to long-off"
"shortish delivery around off, 128 kph, worked away down to fine leg"

"goes full, 141 kph, around off, driven to deep cover for a couple. Opened the bat face late to find the gap"
"a low full toss around off, driven to the sweeper cover. Not quite found his consistency, but that isn't entirely unexpected with Starc's pace"
"short delivery outside off, 138 kph, Buttler sways out of the line, drops his hands and lets it go."

"banged in, slightly short and wide, Morgan swats a cut off the toe of the bat, rolls to cover"
"full, he steps into the drive, eased through the covers and this is well placed, Warner has to make up a lot of ground but he does well out on the boundary to dive and slap the ball back in and save a run"
"round the wicket, dug in short and Morgan gets into an awkward position pulling, played down through midwicket safely in the end"

"round the wicket, pitched full and Moeen wafts a drive, gets an inside edge for one past his pads"
"<b>dropped!</b> A howler from Cameron White! Moeen gets a life, top-edging an ungainly heave straight up, should be a regulation catch at cover... but it goes right through him, a bar of soap in the showers, didn't get a hand on it - very similar to Hazlewood in the SCG Test, actually - and Moeen survives!"

"Buttler backs away, another slower-bouncer from Cummins, following the batsman as he swipes and misses"
"super placement, makes room and opens the face on a squirted drive through backward point, they get a couple as Stoinis puts in the dive on the rope"
"banged in and hammered on the pull, sweet as a nut, smooth like tropicana - but straight to deep midwicket on the bounce"
"short, another cutter, I think, flicks Woakes' bottom edge on the pull but bounces in front of Paine"
"excellent start, fires in the yorker from round the wicket, Buttler can only jam it to backward point"
"<b>dropped!</b> Starc follows Buttler as he makes room, scooped off a length straight down the ground towards long-on... <b>but Zampa grasses a difficult chance running in!</b>"
"short, taking the pace off cleverly again, Buttler can't connect"
"another slower bouncer but Buttler connects with this one, boomed on the pull through square leg and the sweeper can't get to it despite a full-length dive"
"oh, shot - the topspin forehand down the ground! Not quite the yorker and somehow Buttler gets under it and <i>smashes</i> four over mid-off with those graphite wrists!"
"good riposte, speared full outside leg stump as Buttler backs away and fails to connect"
"length ball, Woakes clears the front leg but hammers a pull to deep midwicket"
"short ball, Buttler wants to ramp it but only toe-ends wide of the keeper... <b>and there's a mix-up in the middle</b>, both batsmen at the same end briefly, but Paine is unlucky in that his throw hits Buttler diving for his ground and it deflects to safety as Woakes scuttles back"
slams in the bouncer but Buttler thinks it's high and ignores it - and gets the wide
"smoked into the boundary boards, a fierce, flat pull and it goes all the way!"
"clubbed straight down the ground for six more! Humpty from Buttler, he dumps a full ball into the crowd - <b>and he's into the 90s!</b>"
"short ball, sits up to pull, this time Buttler arrows a jab into the gap at cow corner... he's now just four away from a remarkable ton!"
"full toss from Cummins, flubbed into the leg side... but it's a no-ball on height!"
"and Woakes manages to skim it fine for four more! Cummins' figures take a beating, he strayed down the leg side and it skipped away from Paine for another boundary"
"full and straight, goes for the reverse sweep... Australia appeal for lbw, and up goes Chris Gaffaney's finger!</b> Buttler <b>reviews</b> straight away, however, and it looks like he hit it. Yes, quite a clear edge, then on to the front pad"
"full on the stumps, clipped to midwicket"
"Woakes gets this away, superbly placed, just a flick of the wrists and it's into the gap at cow corner!"
banged in... and clobbered over the rope at deep backward square! Top-edged on the pull but there was no one out there and <b>the six brings Woakes his fifty!</b>
"yes, he will, Woakes digs out a yorker towards backward point, <b>England raise 300</b> and Buttler gets his chance"
"goes full and straight, Buttler can't really get under the ball but he forces it past midwicket... they are coming back for two, <b>Buttler raises his century from the last ball of the innnings!</b> He leaps in jubilation as he completes the second, helmet off to salute the crowd! This has been a <i>brilliant</i> one-day innings from Buttler, his fifth hundred and one to savour"
"full delivery outside off, a thick outside edge down to third man for a single."
"beauty! 142 kph, on a length on a fourth-stump channel, the ball seams away and beats Warner, who indicates that the ball moves away after pitching"
"full delivery outside off, holds its line, left alone by Warner"
"full and wide outside off, 140 kph, chopped to cover point from the crease"
"144 kph, nicely played. Just strides forward and drives the ball to the right of short cover. Leant on the drive, not forced or over-hit. Warnered away."
"shortens the length, good length outside off, 143 kph, dabbed to point"
"the perfect length to Finch, good length around off, the ball moves back and beats Finch on the inside edge, hit on the thigh pad"
"nicely punched in the gap at cover, full outside off, crisply caressed into the gap. Misread the length of that"
"can't bowl there, drops short down leg and Warner shovels a flick behind square for four. Too easy. An especially bad ball because square leg was up"
"136 kph, full delivery outside off, driven to short cover"
"135 kph, on a length outside off, opens the bat face and guides the ball to point"
"full and straight, defended to cover. Good over for Australia"
"good length on middle and leg, 142 kph, pushed towards midwicket"
"poor delivery. Strays down leg, off the thigh pad and past the keeper. Four leg byes to fine leg. All free runs for Australia."
"lovely channel, just around off, 145.4 kph, played to midwicket, that strong bottom hand was evident"
"full, a yorker around off, jammed out to cover"
"146 kph, full delivery outside off, Finch stays back, should have been forward, toe-ended back up the pitch"
"lovely shot, back of a length outside off, Finch stays back and just punches a sliced push through cover point. Pulled inside just inside by a diving Morgan"
"good length delivery outside off, blocked back"
"beautifully played. Slightly short, and he loves them there. Just swivels on a pull and finds the gap behind square for four."
"pushes it slightly fuller outside off, seams back in and goes through Finch's cut. Through to the keeper"
"good length outside off, 136 kph, Finch opens the bat face and carves a glide to third man"
"tries to force the ball through cover, but his balance was terrible. And all he can do is chip his wicket away to extra cover. Was around full, on a length. Warner stayed back to a ball he should have been forward to. Instead of adjusting his shot, he goes through with what he wanted to play, a forceful punch from the back foot, but his balance (and therefore timing) are way off. Can only push it away. Woakes is pumped."
"good length delivery on middle, a 138 kph, thick inside edge to fine leg"
"dug in, short around off, defended back. Wood sprawls over, head first into the surface. Lovely day to go head first into a deep pool, but an unpleasant experience on a cricket field"
"shortish outside off, punched off the back foot to point"
"tidy channel, around off, blocked"
"142 kph, shortish again, think Wood is getting slightly carried away with that length. Not quite the surface to do this, short around off, pulled to square leg"

"full delivery outside off, played to cover"
"shortish down leg, clipped into the leg side"
"good length delivery outside off, played into the point region from the crease"
"drifts on the pads and White picks him off through midwicket for three. Nicely played, just let the ball come to him before working the ball away. Hales picks up near the boundary, and throws the ball back but a shoe is in contact with the boundary."
"full delivery outside off, may have kept a tad low, played away towards point"
"this one bounces extra, 132 kph, good length on middle and leg, some extra climb hits the splice of the bat. Toe-end and now splice off consecutive balls, of very similar lengths. In fact, this one was marginally fuller than the previous one"
"full outside off, driven into the cover region"
"a slower delivery outside off, 120 kph, tapped behind point with soft hands for a quality single. Well run"
"good length outside off, the ball seams back in, pushed back to the bowler"
"goes fuller, 136 kph, White was early through his flick off the leading edge towards cover"
"138 kph, full delivery outside off, the right length for this pitch, played defensively to point. White taking his time early"
"smashed! A half-volley outside off at 141 kph, but White creates even more power with an expansive drive through cover. Delectable"
"142 kph, on middle and leg, worked away towards midwicket. A hand on it from the fielder takes some pace off the ball"
"nice end, 141 kph, tidy around off, defended back"
"back of a length outside off, 132 kph, came on slower than White expected, defended back"
"beautiful batting. Slightly overpitched from Woakes, White gets underneath the length early and lofts the ball over cover. A very T20 stroke, but works very well in ODIs too"
"good length outside off, chopped away to point"
"135 kph, on a length, down leg, nudged to deep square leg"
"a slower delivery on middle and leg, pushed to mid-on for one. Good single, Billings the sub fielder there. Not sure who he is on for"
"well bowled, 136 kph, full on middle and leg, but not overpitched. Skews off the outside half to cover"
"142 kph, strays on the pads, Finch gets hit on it as he misses a flick, one to square leg"
"full on middle and leg, 141 kph, pushed to midwicket"
"edged and gone! A start for White but he perishes looking to force the ball through point. May have been done in by some extra bounce. Back of a length delivery outside off, White looks to hit the ball through point but all he can get is a thin outside edge. Was actually looking quite solid on a tricky surface"
"short and wide outside off, 145 kph, hit to point from the back foot"
driven to mid-on from the crease
"full delivery outside off, driven into the cover region"

"shortish delivery around off, Smith walks across and nudges to square leg for one"
"full and wide again, shaping away, hit to short cover from the crease. The fielder dives to his right, and parries it away"

flicked away to deep midwicket. Some riskless runs
"short down leg, Finch has backed away quite a bit, chopped to point"
"drifts on the pads, Smith just tickles him fine, aware that the fine leg fielder is very square. Three to fine leg"
"what was Finch doing there? He should have ran two. Full outside off, Finch stays in his crease and mis-times a lofted drive over mid-off. Doesn't move for quite a bit, plonks over mid-off."

"flat and straight, cut off the stumps towards short third man"
"a low full toss, 102 kph, punched to mid-off for one."

"lots of flight, on the pads, worked in the gap at square leg"
"flat and quick, nudged to square leg"
"too full from Root, whipped away to deep midwicket"
"whoopsy. On the pads, Finch works the ball over midwicket, a chip shot. Over midwicket. Woakes runs around from long-on, looking to flick the ball to the square leg fielder. But he over-runs it and allows the ball go to the boundary. Not a happy afternoon for him to come"
"swept away to fine leg. A fumble by Billings, but no damage done"
"pushed through, on middle and leg, nudged to square leg"
floated up full on the stumps and Finch sweeps him behind square for one

floats this up and bit more and Smith whips one out to deep midwicket

"full and flighted, Finch is down early to sweep flat through square leg"
"slips in the wrong'un now, spinning in as Smith goes back and punches to cover"

"pushed through flat, driven playing back and Root misfields at extra cover to give them one"
"goes up for lbw, this skidding on into the front pad as Finch went to sweep... outside the line, maybe? Or perhaps he got something on it, as England don't contemplate the review"
floated up and flicked in the air past square leg
"here he goes, steps out and clubs over long-on, a hefty swipe and that clears long-on, <b>bringing Finch his half-century!</b>"
"and again, another Dorothy, plants the front foot and mows the ball over cow, a flat smear that is caught - just - by a policeman sitting guarding the boundary from intruders!"
darted in and Finch settles for nudging this away to the leg side
"lobbed down on middle and leg, Smith works the single"
"flat, no turn and nudged through midwicket"
"tosses up the legbreak, Finch goes to sweep, hit on the pads - <b>and given!</b> Finch immediately signals for a review, seeming to suggest he got some bat on it... but there's no bottom edge on the replays, and Hawk-Eye has it clipping leg stump! It was very close to sliding by but umpire's call is all England needed. Huge wicket, no hundred for Finch today!"

"throws the hands, thick edge and <b>Buttler snaffles a terrific low grab!</b> Wood is delirious as he charges off...but Smith isn't walking. This is going to the TV umpire, and the <b>soft signal is out</b>, which could be crucial. Has he got fingertips under it? This is going to be <i>incredibly tight</i>, it's a fantastic effort from Buttler, but is there some grass involved? They are taking an age over the replays, but it's very hard to be definitive... <b>And the third umpire has given it!</b> The on-field call was key and Kumar Dharmasena has decided he can't overrule it. Smith is fuming, the crowd is silent but he has to go"
"yorker around off, jammed away into the cover region"

"nice and slow around off and middle, dabbed towards short third man"

"pushed through, full around off, driven back to the bowler"
"lots of flight outside off, driven past cover for a couple. Long-off cleans up"

"dug in but too short, goes over the shoulder, 137 kph, wide."
"full delivery outside off, 138 kph, seams back in, pushed to cover"

"a slower ball outside off, 127 kph, dabbed down to third man off the open face."

"pushed through, quick on middle and leg, defended"
"slow through the air, 83 kph, on middle and off, some turn too, guided to point"

"the googly on middle and leg, nudged to square leg"
"taken at long-on. And Australia stumble further. This is a huge moment, the set man has picked out long-on. There have been so many dismissals where a batsman mistakes a flat legspinner for a long-hop. Happened to Guptill against Zampa at this ground, think it was last year. Marsh goes back and looks to pull over midwicket, but the ball lobs off the splice towards long-on. Flat trajectory from Rashid. No doubt about this one"

"full and wide outside off, carved to the sweeper cover"
"a slower, wide delivery outside off, smashed to the sweeper cover for a run."
"a low full toss outside off, badly-timed drive to cover"
"another slower delivery around off, chopped away into the midwicket region, Wood chases, picks up, turns around and misses at the bowler's end."
"good short ball, on middle and leg, a top-edged hook to fine leg. Nowhere near control"
"comes down, sees him coming and Wood shortens the length, on off, Paine is hurried through his pull, goes past"
"a low full toss, 138 kph, driven to the sweeper cover for a run. Terrific over from Wood, executed pretty much what he wanted save a full toss earlier"
"flat around off, 85 kph, swept to deep square leg"
"well bowled, sees Stoinis coming and Rashid shortens his length but slow outside off, Stoinis improvises a checked flick to midwicket. Good cricket"
"short around off, Paine goes right back and pulls to deep midwicket"
"a googly down leg, 87 kph, pulled to deep square leg. Excellent defensive bowling"
"flat, quick and wide, driven to deep cover. Another fine over so far, can he finish well?"
"superb from Rashid, doesn't mind some flight on middle and leg, but does mind a full length, so the length is shorter, spins and beats the sweep. Awesome over"
"swatted for four. A short, slower delivery outside off, pulled past mid-off, to his right. Stoinis has been in great hitting form, Australia need another big innings to keep this series alive"
"good length around off, cut to deep point, one."
"a short delivery on middle and leg, 141 kph, a top-edged pull towards the man at deep square leg"
"terrific bowling, good length but just inside the tramline. Boos from the crowd, but definitely inside the guideline, juuust inside but inside"
"and again, a full and wide yorker. Stoinis has backed away, looking to open up the off side but Wood is bowling it really wide so he can't reach it. The defensive bluff"
"just eight off the over after four off the first ball, a slower ball on middle and leg, heaved to deep square leg"
"power! Rashid does not want to bowl full, he is short and a tad wide, Stoinis stays back and lofts the ball intentionally over cover. Terrific batting"
"bye? Flight outside off, Stoinis misses a drive, the ball deflects off Buttler's gloves for one to third man"
"more flight outside off, Paine stretches and fetches, a hard sweep to deep square leg for a brace"
"quick outside off, chipped away towards the sweeper cover. Just one"
"this is really good bowling, sees Stoinis coming and shortens the length. Stoinis can only bunt the ball towards long-on with middling timing, which allows Paine enough time to come back"
"Stoinis charges, gets close, too close, unable to get underneath the ball, can only hit the ball to long-off. Another excellent comeback from a bowler who was hit for a boundary off his first ball"
"another fine start to the over, a good length delivery on middle and leg. Stoinis shuffles across, bends his knees, stays low and whips a flick into the gap behind square. His muscular power takes it over the boundary"
"a slower ball outside off, 122 kph, hit to cover for a run with bad timing."
"full delivery around off, Paine nails a drive on the bounce to Root at mid-off. A boundary a few yards either side"
"a clever short slower ball around off, swatted away to long-on, two more. Good running"
"full and wide, was there to slice backward of point, but he can only mis-time a drive to the sweeper cover"
"a low full toss around middle, hit over the bowler for a couple more. Root at mid-off, runs to his right, but can't stop two."
"good length on middle and leg, slashed to backward point."
"a slower delivery outside off, under-edged towards the keeper. Stoinis steals the strike with a good call"
"there's four. Full and wide outside off, Stoinis reaches out for the ball and guides the ball into the gap between point and third man for four. <strong>Fifty for Stoinis</strong>"
"good length on middle and leg, heaved away to deep square leg. Just the one."
"a DOT BALL! Valuable. Silence at the SCG. Short delivery on middle and leg, beats Paine's pull."
"full and wide outside off, beautifully drilled but straight to the sweeper cover. Fantastic end from Wood."
"a slower ball on leg, heaved to long-on. They opt to stick with one. Stoinis wants the strike."
"a nice full, wide yorker outside off, jammed out to long-on. Bad enough timing to come back for two"
"and taken at deep square leg. This game's gone. A short delivery on middle and leg, the slower bouncer, forcing a tiring Stoinis to generate his own pace. He is too tired, all he can do is pull the ball to deep square leg. Billings runs in and takes a good, low catch."
"there it is, a wide yorker creeps under Cummins' bat. Buttler is pumped. What an innings he played"
"a short and wide delivery, slashed to deep point"
"a slower ball on off, swatted to deep square leg and <strong>England win the ODI series</strong>. Wide smiles on England's faces, Buttler knows the quality and the significance of the innings he played!"
