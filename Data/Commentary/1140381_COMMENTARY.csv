"slower delivery, stabbed towards backward point from the crease"
"short of a length, chops down on it, gets a thick inside edge and that squirts fine for four first ball!"

"better line, 142kph/88mph and he lets this one through outside off"
"fired in straighter, tucked down into the leg side for a single"
"shortish, and Dickwella goes deep in the crease to manufacture more room, twocked past midwicket on the pull for another boundary"

"slower ball, full and wide of the stumps, steered through the off side for one wide of third man"

"short ball, Dickwella hangs back and glides the ball behind square, superb timing and it skips away off the slick surface, Rashid can't get around from third man"
"drops into the crease, spots the slower ball, <b>and slugs it up and over midwicket</b> - that'll roll away to the rope as well! Dickwella making a racket with the bat, and the crowd are responding"
"lashed through the covers, brilliant batting! A little shimmy as he came down outside leg side and just timed a punch off the middle"
Samarawickrama jumps across and nudges into a gap
"<b>dropped!</b> Rashid doesn't even get a finger on it, diving forward at short fine leg... Mistimed scoop from Dickwella, off the toe of the bat but it still manages to squirt away for four. Curran does not look amused"
"fullish on off, goes for the Dickscoop again but is hit on the pad - missing off stump, though"
"nicely bowled, back-of-the-hand slower ball and Dickwella is duped as he jumps outside leg stump but can't lay a bat on it"

"gottim - <b>chipped to mid-off running back!</b> Out the back of the hand, Dickwella foxed as he goes up and over, doesn't manage to clear Woakes on the turn, though it's taken at the second attempt. England have their breakthrough, after an impish little knock from Dickwella"

"pushed through quick on leg stump, maybe out the front of the hand as Rashid gets warm, clipped for a single"
"slips in the googly, <b>sneaks through to clip off stump!</b> Big old barn door from Mendis, driving away from his body, and he's gone for a golden duck. He hangs around while the umpires confirm that Buttler's gloves had nothing to do with the dismissal, but the replays are clear"

"rising from a length, punched on the up but that's just one to the cover sweeper"
"tossed up on the stumps, straightens a touch as he goes back and works through midwicket"

banged in short and he thinks about swatting across the line and then decides better of it

"full, slower ball outside off, driven on one knee but that'll just be one to the cover sweeper"
"hits the pitch hard on a length outside off, Chandimal fails to connect with an ungainly swipe"
"goes outside leg stump early, Rashid drags the ball down and the square drive squirts away past point for a couple"
"oh dear... <b>he's top-edged a full toss to square leg!</b> Village all round, a dipping full toss from Rashid but Samarawickrama has only succeeded in flubbing it to the man on the edge of the ring, a good catch from Woakes with the ball dropping over his shoulder. Not a bad innings from Samarawickrama but he had got rather stuck"
"another first-baller! Thisara goes straight for the big shot but it's slogged straight up, <b>and well taken on the run at long-on!</b> Roy was the fielder, giving Rashid a third. Boom and bust for Thisara"

"slower ball, dabbed behind point and they scuttle through as Roy swoops and fires in a throw"
"cross-seam and sliding in on the pads, Chandimal clips it neatly through midwicket, Stokes is there again... but this time he can't flick it quite in the right direction, and then flops like an eager seal over the rope as it slips away from him and goes for four. Nearly, but not quite!"
"pitched up on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"length ball, Dhananjaya pokes it into the off side... and Stokes is on it in a flash, the batsman stranded having set off for one, <b>only for the throw to miss!</b> They can then trot a single, too"

dug in and swatted away through midwicket without timing
"slower delivery on the stumps, flicked for a single square on the leg side"
"Stokes lets go a wide, slow full toss, which Shanaka ill-advisedly toe-ends to extra cover when it was heading well outside the tramlines"
"oh, where'd that come from?! Shanaka latches on to a slower ball and <b>smokes this one well back over the rope at midwicket!</b> That's more like it"
"bunted through the covers, Stokes has ended up on the floor... but he's okay"
"tossed up on middle and leg, Shanaka gets well across, <b>and launches a slog sweep flat on to the rope!</b> He's giving it some much-needed tonk!"

"beaten past the outside edge, good pace and it nibbles away as the batsman props forward"

"full toss, 137kph/85mph and Chandimal splices it up into the air, bounces well short of long-on running in and they hustle back for two"
"full and straight, pace on and Chandimal can't get under it, fielded in his follow through"
"gone, <b>scooped awkwardly to short fine leg!</b> Chandimal picks himself up, dusts himself off and walks from the field, the latest to be done by Curran's slower ball. A slightly bedraggled knock, on a very bedraggled day, but Sri Lanka do at least have a chance"
"slower ball outside off, swing and a miss"
"finishes with a back-of-the-hand slowie, another unsuccessful swipe from Aponso... Buttler misses with an underarm at the stumps, as Malinga charges down, <b>but Curran grabs it and hits at the non-striker's end to effect the run-out!</b> Excellent final over from Curran, just three runs conceded"
"<B>an absolute pie first-up!</B> Maliinga barely hits the cut strip, way down the leg side, and Dickwella the keeper has jarred himself, flinging himself to intercept"
"much better from Malinga, full, straight with a hint of swing away from the right-hander. Roy plays with a straight bat"
"leg-sided once more, not by much, but Roy lets it slide harmlessly past his pads"
"<B>dismissive!</b> Nothing more than a bit of room and a lot of bottom hand, flick-boshed up and over the leg side, and all the way into the crowd!"
"<B>so close in the covers!</b> Squared up on the back foot, finding a fat leading edge, and bissecting the men on the off side, an ambitious dive but can't get close!"
"up on the toes, clipped to the leg side, and Bairstow's sharp running prompts an easy second"
"line and length, pressed into the covers for another single"
"on the pads, nudged with insouciance clean through square leg! Nothing more than a tap into the gap, and the greasy outfield does the rest!"
"Roy advances, meets the pitch, clips to the on side"
"<strong>spanked to mid-off!</strong> A bonus wicket for Sri Lanka, Aponso was in the attack to target Roy's perceived frailty, but instead it's YJB with a loose wristy dink into Perera's bread-basket!"
pressed hard into the covers
"high elbow, working the length ball to midwicket"
"full face of the bat, tapped back to the bowler"
"easing into the covers with an open face, fine fielding to cut off the extra run"

"back of a length again, nurdled off the pads to backward square"
"tucked to the on-side, well judged single"
advancing for the single after a tuck to leg. Sent back

"<strong>that is sublime!</strong> Driven with power, posture and placement, right under the eyeline and clean through the covers"
"big stride forward, worked to the leg side, just the single this time"
"<strong>bowled him!</strong> Root is suckered by the slider! Perhaps got too loose with the front-foot push, it would have been lbw had it not cannoned into the middle stump. England are two-down and making harder work of this than their run-rate implies..."

worked to the leg side
"full face of the bat once more, pressed into the covers"
punched into the covers
looking to advance but stopped in his tracks by a fuller length. Awkwardly defended
"forward, and finds the gap with a push"

"reversed again, struck outside the line as he misses out"
"down the track this time, a tuck to midwicket to bring up the 50"
gives himself room and pounds a drive through the covers. Shot!
<B>chance of a run-out as Morgan is sent back ...</b> but the shy is wide
"<strong>that's a freebie!</strong> A bouncing bomb, down the leg side, Roy flings his arms across the line, helps it on its way, and this is not a good return from the old boy ... so far"
"pressed on the back foot, to mid on, another half-chance for a run-out, misses with the shy. Would have been close!"
"width outside off, dabbed down to third man"
"slower ball, well watched, pressed back down the pitch with a full face of the bat"
"<B>pongo-ed over the covers!</b> Roy examines the toe of his bat, as well he might, as he had to reach that on a stepladder. A slower ball, wide of off stump, but raw power drills it past the sprawling deep cover!"
down the leg side
"back of a length, tucked into the leg side"
"tossed up, and <strong>walloped over long-on!</strong> His eyes lit up as the ball soared above his eyeline, and brute force did the rest!"
clipped to mid-on
"round the wicket, Morgan goes inside-out to pick the gap at extra cover! He's nailing it once again"
"mowed into the leg side, a bit ungainly, but gets the bonus run as midwicket fumbles. Sri Lanka getting sloppy"
"huge appeal, but there's no bat on that sweep as the ball slides down the leg side... but hang on, <B>there's a review for lbw</b>... seems optimistic! But hang on for a second time, it hit the back leg ... and it is <B>hitting the leg stump! </b>Fair play Dickwella, he was adamant!"
pushed into the covers
"outside off, too much width, cracked past point with power and placement"
"dabbed outside off, a sharp call for the single"
"<strong>that is some timing!</strong> Just back of a length, Stokes places his bat in the line of the ball, and it utterly <I>pings</I> to long-on!"

"shuffling at the crease, can't get this one away"

"poked to point. Tidy finish to that over from Malinga, but he's not been at the races today"
"fizzed through from round the wicket, defended on the back foot"
"<B>pounded back to the bowler, and he can't take the rebound!</B> Nathan Lyon would have swallowed that, but this one burst through his hands, into his collar-bone, and looped up tantalisingly... but he had completely lost sight of it as the ball plopped to the deck."
"tucked to the leg side, no desire to toss that one up!"
"advancing out of the crease, speared into the pads as Stokes gave his intentions away early"
"pumped up and over the leg side, one bounce to the sweeper"
"worked to long-off, England are easing home now"
"nudged off the hip, another one chalked off"
"banged in short, Stokes can't time his pull, and he's worn one on the elbow. Retribution for de Silva!"
"outside off, jabbed to point"
"advancing keenly, poked to point, good running"
"Jos Buttler, is that you? Turns his stance inside-out, and that's <B>flipped up and over the keeper's head!</B> Quality"
"advances, smears, under-edged for a single. Less quality, but they all count"
pushed into the covers
Morgan returns the compliment
an athletic interception by the bowler as Stokes makes room for a pummel through mid-off
"tucked to the leg side, the target moves ever closer"
clipped off the pads to the leg side
worked through the leg side once again

"full and targetting the pads, deflects into the leg side"

"width, and a wristy drive to the point sweeper."
"low full toss, tapped to long-off, England continue to breeze along"
"sliced past backward point, too short, using the pace. Easy peasy"
<B>crashed through backward point for his fifty!</B> He's purring now

"<strong>a dirty full toss, dumped through the covers</strong>. Oh well. Tomorrow's a new day"
"nurdled to the leg side, another single"
"<strong>down the track, over the ropes, that'll do!</strong> After nearly 12 hours at Pallekele, some eight of those spent warming up and waiting, England seal a 2-0 series lead!"
