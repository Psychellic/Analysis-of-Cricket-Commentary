"<strong>did it carry? Doesn't look like.</strong> Length ball outside off, Noor Ali moves towards the ball and pushes at it, gets an outside edge but looks like it landed just short of du Plessis at second slip.

"fuller on the stumps, Rahmat Shah looks to flick it away and misses, struck in front and given. Rahmat has a discussion with his partner goes for the review just in time. The only question is if it was heading down. Pitched in line, impact in front of middle and leg, and would have gone on to just clip the leg stump.

shoulders arms once more... intriguing tactics. Morris to be fair was very threatening in his first spell. Maybe Afghanistan have decided he's the man to be feared today
"driven with intent to mid-off, can't pierce the field"
"<B>absolutely plumb!</B> Full, straight, shaping in... a waft across the line, and I can't believe they are <strong>reviewing </strong>this one! Aha ... there was a <strong>tickle of an inside edge!</strong> That'd be why then! He had a chat with Hashmatullah before reviewing, which suggests he wasn't sure he'd hit it either!"
"fast and back of a length, zipping through to the keeper, once again no stroke"
"blotted back down the track, solid in defence once more"

"tight line to off stump, stabbed into the covers with minimum footwork"
"up on the toes, squeezed through point"
"driven, with hard hands, outside off, <strong>and a fat edge is gobbled at slip!</strong> <I>Precisely</I> the restart that South Africa needed. Hasmatullah was lured by one that seemed just that touch too close to leave alone, but the angle kept taking it away from his best intentions"
"over the wicket, tight line to the right-hander, who props forward to block"
"cracked out to point, no way through there"
"<B>bowled him first ball!</B> That's a massive arrival, a ripper of a googly, pitch-perfect, on off stump, twisting through the gate as Noor has no idea what's hit him. Catch me if you can, you can imagine the rest from Tahir!"
"tossed up, onto the toes, flicked to the leg side to get off the mark"
"lovely areas once more from Tahir, poked cautiously into the covers"
nudged forward with caution
"looped up, leading edge, <B>Tahir gobbles the catch in his followthrough </B>and flees the scene as if he's just scrumped an apple from an angry farmer! This is an utter meltdown from Afghanistan, completely unsettled by the interruption. Asghar was playing across the line outside off, again no clue which way the ball was biting. There's trouble at t'mill now..."
"chopped firmly out to point, the end of an eventful over!"
"back of a length, outside off, a flaccid waft of a cut, and <B>he's only gone and wrecked his own stumps!</B> Nabi was the glue in this lower order, the man who might be relied upon to rebuild. But that was too close to cut and the under-edge does the rest!"

"outside off, poked to point off the back foot"
"round the wicket to finish the over, another probing full length, clipped back to the bowler"

"firmly blocked once more, an excellent over in the midst of an excellent spell"
plonked to mid-on
"<B>a filthy long-hop, an outstanding pluck!</B> Absolutely nothing is going for Afghanistan! Tahir let one slip, halfway down the track, all the time in the world for Gulbadin to pick his spot. But he chose a telegraphed spank through midwicket, and<B> Aiden Markram reached high above his head to pluck down a blinder in both hands!</B>"

fenced through third man as Rabada drags his length back by half a yard
"<B>quality shot!</B> They've been a rarity in this innings, but that is a truly pleasing cover drive, high elbow, full face, into the gap"
"<B>back-to-back boundaries!</B> But he doesn't know much about this one, a flimsy drive, inside-edged over his leg stump!"
solidly forward and another good-looking drive straight to the man this time
"fuller, faster, 137kph, thumps the pad as it angles down the leg side"
fully forward to block
tapped to mid-on
"<B>attempted sweep, deflects off the knee!</B> Outside the line so no appeal, but Amla at slip can't intercept"

"blotted through third man, vertical bat with an open face"
"short and sharp, but sliding down the leg side as Rashid ducks"
"another bouncer, good aggression but leg-sided again. A yorker in the pipeline?"
"length this time, as Rashid swings into a violently ambitious pull but can't connect"
"fiercely drilled to mid-off, quality connection but hits the fielder"
"<B>formidable bludgeoning!</B> That's the Afghanistan we know and love! Clearing the front foot, cowboy-ing through the line and dispatching a murderous drive through the covers!"
"another huge wind-up, no connection, but the intent is plain! Now, just imagine if they still had eight wickets in hand with this mindset brewing..."
poked into the off side
"flicked back to the bowler, meeting the full length"

a lusty swing across the line as Rashid reverts to Plan B(iff-it)
"outside off, nipping off the seam, through to the keeper"
"round the wicket, cramping the left-hander with a tighter line into the stumps. Uneasily blocked down into the crease"
"back of a length, climbs past the edge as Ikram curtain-rails his bat inside the line"
"<B>ripper!</B> Nibbling off the deck from a full length outside off, genuinely beaten on the back foot"
"thumped down the ground, meeting the low full toss with a loose swing through the line"
"advancing to the pitch, a massive wind-up and an impressive-looking clump down the ground, but plugs inside the rope for long-on to gather"
"drilled with intent through the covers, another purposeful swing of the bat  but the sweeper gathers"
poked to point for the single
"cracked with a baseball swing out to deep midwicket, gathered on the bounce. Lucky he didn't connect better with that one..."
"nudged to the off side, a mild panic in the running between the wickets, but they get home safely enough"
"round the wicket, hitting the deck hard, defended from the back foot"
tight line on the left-hander's off stump. Blocked once more with a cordon of two slips lurking
flipped off a full length to mid-on
"<B>edged and gone!</B> Morris earns his reward for line and length, slanting into the left-hander, demanding a shot, and just nipping away enough to be taken in the bread-basket of first slip. Routine dismissal, and South Africa's post-rain rampage picks up pace again"
"over the wicket, tailing into the right-hander, solid block and a bit of a mix-up in the running. Rashid isn't interested"
"<strong>yee-har! </strong> Well, why not... very full, have a slash, what's the worst that could happen? Well, it somehow misses the stumps, so not that ..."
<strong>swept with authority through backward square!</strong> That's lovely timing and placement
"<B>swept again, beats the field again!</B> A touch more hurried, a quicker slider, but it was missing leg, and Rashid helps it on its way"
"<B>retreats to leg, spanks over point!</B> This is fun, who cares where it goes, so long as it goes! Not fully timed, but the runs are flowing..."
"<strong>in to out, and battered through the covers!</strong> This is brilliant entertainment, taking the fight back to South Africa"
"<B>crashed over the leg side, but van der Dussen is right back on the rope!</B> It was a quicker delivery, and Rashid picked it well, but he needed to get under the ball more to clear deep midwicket. That's probably curtains for Afghanistan, but it was fun while it lasted..."
"<B>massive appeal!</B> And up they go for the <B>review!</B> It looked to be smashing the stumps, little doubt there, but was there inside-edge? No there wasn't ... and there was doubt after all! <strong>Missing leg, and on we go...</strong>"
"<strong>slogged into the sky to seal the deal!</strong> That was short and to the point. Back of a length, whack it wherever ... except straight up in the air of course. Any number of fielders could have converged, but the skipper took responsibility, standing almost on the umpire's toes to gather."
"length ball in the corridor, left alone by Amla"
