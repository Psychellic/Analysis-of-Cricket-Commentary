"full and swinging away, Guptill down on one knee and chases it, then lifts it over cover point with the lower end of his bat"
"good length at off stump, big stride forward as he defends to mid-off"
"<b>has he dropped that?</b> Just about got a finger, tough to call it a drop. Harbhajan at first slip. Guptill chases another outswinger, this time he gets a thick outside edge that flies over Harbhajan who leaps up with his right hand and can only parry it to the third man boundary"
"full outswinger at middle stump, gets a huge stride in and punches this to mid-on's left. A lovely looking shot, the fielder gets down quickly"
"good length at off stump, defended off the front foot"
"crunched. Back of a length outside off stump, barely any feet but this is both, enough room, and close enough for him to use only hands. Flat-bats the square drive, gets it past point rapidly"
"back of a length at middle stump, stands tall and tucks it to deep square leg"
"back of a length, angled away from him and he uses it to nudge this past short third man. Once more, no feet, but it was safe enough"
"overpitched on the toes, leans in and flicks it to find deep square"
"good length at off stump, pushes at it with a stride and takes off immediately, extra cover can't cut it off after running across, mid-off cleans up"
"slower ball, full at middle stump. Goes for the flick, doesn't time it. The bat turns in his hand but he goes through, lifts it wide of mid-on"
<b>no-ball.</b> He hits the non-strikers stumps with his hands as he's about to bowl. It's also a full toss at off stump that Saha punches past the non-striker. A free hit next ball too.
"offcutter, back of a length outside off stump. He swings across the line but this rolls through from under his bat"
"good length, angled in at off stump, lunges forward and gets an inside edge that goes through square leg"

"good length at off stump, looks to drive this on the up through the covers, plays inside the line and gets a thick outside edge to third man"
"back of a length at off stump, mistimed punch on the up, straight to cover point"
"oh great ball. Like all other deliveries this over, this one angles in at off stump at a length. But it straightens after pitching. Saha is looking to get leg side of this and is half running into it with an angled bat. Poor shot. Beaten on the outside edge. There's a loud appeal from the keeper, it is turned down"
"full at off stump, gets half a stride in and lifts it over the bowler with a full face. But he gets it off the toe and it barely beats mid-off who gives chase and pulls it back"
"oh what a shot! <b>And another no-ball.</b> This is full and wide outside off, nicely angling away for Guptill to stand tall and slice this over the long-off boundary"
"bowls a low full toss outside off stump, he backs away and bunts this to sweeper cover"
"back of a length, angled down the leg side and past his attempted flick"
"good adjustment. This is an offcutter outside off stump, it's at a good length. His first instinct is to go for the cover drive, but he's beaten by the variation. Adjusts his wrists in the end and lifts it over covers"

"full and angled into the leg side, flicked to midwicket"
"good length at middle stump, skews it off the inside edge, gets it to midwicket"
"how did he get that there? He exposes all the stumps to make room, goes a long way and the bowler follows him. This is full and angling into him but he contorts those wrists weirdly to drive this wide of mid-off"

"back of a length at middle stump, looks to get on top of this and pull it over the leg side, but it hurries on and jams the top half of his bat. Rolls into the leg side"
"good bowling. Offcutter, back of a length outside off stump. Long-off is there precisely for this ball that Guptill tries to hit through the line. Doesn't connect, but this lands safely in front of that man"
"full and angled down the leg side, he looks to deposit this over the midwicket boundary with a slog sweep, gets it off the inside edge but it rolls away between square leg and short fine"
"tossed up at leg stump, gets the front leg out of the way and drills this over his partner at the other end"
"superb catch from Hardik. Good bowling too. Pulls his length back, gives it a bit more air, but keeps the angle intact. Guptill, therefore, goes for the slog sweep again. Doesn't connect, gets it high into the sky and Hardik backtracks from mid-on to take it. He kept his eyes on that nicely and maintained his balance as he was taking big strides backwards and then takes it behind his head"
"good length outside off stump, steps down the track and pushes it to mid-off"
"good length at leg stump, pushes it to long-on"

"yep, no problem. Gets a full ball at middle stump, he clears the front leg, slogs this wide of long-on and finishes with a baseball flourish"
"full and wide outside off stump, tempts him to throw his hands at it. No feet, so he can't reach this. Beaten on the outside edge with sharp turn and bounce"
"beaten again. Once more he sees air and goes across the line. This time he's beaten closer to the off stump and Parthiv takes the bails off. He was well inside, probably coz he did not use his feet there"
"steps out, doesn't get to the this middle stump ball, gets an inside edge into the leg side"
"shot. For a moment, he looked to be beaten by flight but he adjusted so nicely. This was tossed up wide and he really had to reach out after stepping down the track. Followed it nicely, go under it and lifted it inside-out over the extra cover boundary"
"stays in his crease, watches it pitch a length on middle stump, pushes it into the leg side"
"gets smoked first ball. Drops it short at middle stump, Maxwell gets deep in the crease quickly and lifts this pull shot wide of deep square leg"

"fired fast in the blockhole, leg stump, he pushes it on the full to long-on"
"swings a full toss down leg side. Maxwell nearly hit that over the leg side, luckily for the bowler it's a wide"

"back of a length, flat at off stump, shoveled wide of long-on off the back foot"

"low full toss at middle stump. He has fast hands so this looks brutal as he hits it straight back at the umpire, but he doesn't get connection. Long-off cleans up"
"bowls wide. Length ball, well away from the wide marker and moving further with the angle"
"the angle gets him the wicket. Good length, angled away from him. It keeps going away. His front leg is cleared so he has to reach in the end. Can't lock his wrists to slam this over midwicket like he intended. Slices it up and Parthiv takes it in the point region"
"back of a length at middle stump, backs away and finds short third man with the late cut"
"good yorker. In at middle stump, he digs it out into the leg side, pitch side...Mitch puts in a six yard slide to his left to try and affect the run out of the millenium. Didn't hit the stumps in the end"

"nice. The perfect yorker, swung in at middle stump, can only dig it out to deep square with the flick"

"yorker at middle stump, squeezed to long-on"

"floats it full on middle from wide of the crease, tucked to midwicket"
"width but couldn't quite pierce the gap, straight to point"
"doesn't get hold of the pull but it's still enough to trickle into the midwicket boundary. Not all that short for him to pull, went through with the stroke."
crashed on the up into the extra cover boundary. Henry wouldn't be mistaken for wondering what wrong he did
"pitched up outside off, Parthiv leans forward and belts this between cover and mid-off. Rocket hit. What timing, I'd love to use that bat of his. Brilliant. Has passed Maxwell before he moved"

"pitched up on off stump, firm push to mid-off"

"swings leg side, gets a thick inside edge past short fine. Good work by Sandeep"
"looked to flat-bat the pull over midwicket, skewed it off the top part of the bat, on the bounce to mid-on. Beaten for pace, although the speedgun clocks that at 124kph. Bizarre"

"full delivery tailing into middle and leg, flicked straight to Henry at the edge of the circle at midwicket"

whipped to Vohra at deep midwicket
"back-of-the-hand slower delivery outside off, Simmons walks across, picks it early, holds his shape and belts this over long-on. Wow"
backs away and squeezes the full ball into the gap between cover and point. Guptill does well to hare across and put out the swimming pool dive to pull it back in.
"backs away, gets underneath the full ball and lofts this cleanly over cover. Does it fly here or what? Sensational power on the swing"

slaps this length ball to Vohra at sweeper cover
"drifting into middle from around the stumps, pushed to cover"
"<b> Mohit puts down a regulation chance at long-off. </b> Is it the dew? He had it, but somehow couldn't hold on as he hared across. This one was hit flat and hard, Mohit picked it early, moved swiftly to his left to get to the ball but put it down."
worked across the line to long-on again
"cramped for room, worked back to the bowler"
"tremendous power off the bottom hand. Steps out, gets underneath the flight and showels this back over the bowler's head. Classy half-century, brutal half-century. Mumbai up and running"
"if the stands weren't there at long-off, it would've smashed the window of the balcony in one of the apartments adjacent to the Polly Umrigar gate. Massive. Right to the pitch of the ball, marries the swing with timing to loft this cleanly."

"drifting down leg, tickled to short fine leg"
"punched on the up to long-off, excellent work to keep it to a single"

"backs away, Mohit sees him do that and floats the slower delivery way outside off, Parthiv adjusts by opening the face of the bat and slicing this over short third man."
"poor delivery. Length ball sliding into the pads, Parthiv helps it on its way into the fine leg boundary. Parthiv looked to improvise by moving to the leg side, Mohit followed him and yet got picked away"
"this time, gets it high on the bat and Vohra takes a comfortable catch running across from cover to mid-off. Parthiv looked to go over cover but the short of length delivery got big on him and he skewed it straight in the air. There was a possibility of a collision but Vohra called early and completed a simple catch."
"slower and fuller on middle, worked to mid-on"
"whipped off his hip into the fine leg boundary. Angles a short of length delivery into the body, Rana uses his powerful wrists to play that into the gap. The ball skids off the practice pitches. Matt Henry had no chance"
flat-bats a short ball on off stump to long-off
punches one across the line to long-on
"<B> Guptill has made a telling contribution on the field. </b> Sensational catch. This was destined to cross the ropes at long-on. Simmons swings a full toss down the ground to long-on where Guptill took his time to suss up the trajectory and then timed his jump to perfection to pluck off a one-handed stunner. The umpires checked for the no-ball and Maxwell wasn't far from one. Few nervy moments for them, but relief in the end as big screen says 'out.'"

"works an incoming length ball off his hip into the gap at midwicket. They chanced a second that wasn't on, <b> Ishant has fluffed a run-out chance. </b> All he had to do was gather the ball on the bounce and break the bails. Rushed in and fumbled. What's worse? Another for the overthrow. <b> What should have been one is now three. </b> Lifeline for Rana"
lunges forward and eases it to cover
"mistimes a lofted hit to long-off, <b> so near to a fifth dismissal to a legspinner this season </b>"
"short, wide and Rana cuts straight to Matt Henry at deep point. Lucky to get away with the short ball, looks like it slipped out of his hand"
"<b> so he's out to a leggie again. </b> Except this time, he picked it and pulled the half-tracker straight down the throat of long-on. Looks to rock back and pull over deep midwicket, the ball stopped on him a touch, Rohit through with the shot a lot earlier and could only get it off the toe-end, which made it a simple catch for the boundary rider."

tucked with the angle to square leg
"punched to sweeper cover, a touch short on that occasion"
chops this to short third man. Not afraid to give it air

driven hard to the man at deep extra cover
"not to the pitch of the ball but he had enough width to free his arms and clobber this over the bowler's head. Flat-batted, what power. Using his reach to good effect"

"floats this full and wide outside off, umpire thinks it was just outside the wide line. Right call"

"angles a full toss on middle from around the stumps, sliced wide of point"
"right in his swinging arc, Pollard showels this straight down the ground, long-on had no chance. Sandeep went wide of the crease from around the stumps to create an angle but this was hit back really hard."
"sensational savage hitting this. You can set your fields as much as you want inside, but what do you do when he hits them nonchalantly outside the park? Right in the swinging arc, teeing off like a golfer as he hammers this over long-on for a 82-metre hit"
flicks a full toss on the bounce to Mohit at deep square
"goes for a yorker, turns out to be a high full toss, Karn swings this over the infield, Maxwell tries to parry the ball back in but momentum took him over the ropes"
"excellent knuckleball, Pollard steps out and bunts this down to long-on"
"<b> Maxwell palms this over the long-off boundary. </b> Slower and fuller outside off, Karn does well to hold his shape and biff this straight down the ground. Maxwell did well to run to his left from long-off but couldn't hold on."
"slaps the short ball into the cover boundary. Slower delivery again, this was sitting up nicely for him to belt this into the off side. Looks like they'll get this in a canter"
"full toss outside off, gets a thick edge that flies past short third man. Ishant didn't even move. Looked to slice this over point but he'll take the runs however they come"
"has his man. This is another slower ball that comes back in from wide of the crease, dipped on Karn who looked to swing this behind square, missed it and the ball hit timber. Not much celebration from Mohit. Has this slipped away from Kings XI?"
"slower delivery outside off, flayed to long-off"

"cracking delivery. Full straight and right into the blockhole around off stump, Harbhajan looks to carve this behind point but is late to get down to the ball."
"length on off stump, drilled to long-on from where Maxwell fires a poor throw to the keeper's end. <b> Umpire calls one short, Pollard the culprit. </b>"
"slower ball outside off, he holds his shape and deposits this swipe into the cow corner boundary."
"low full toss, swung away to long-off. Missed the yorker but found the fielder on the bounce. <b> Pollard refuses the run </b>"
"brilliant! Low, dipping yorker which Pollard can't get underneath. Dug back to Mohit on his followthrough"
"sensational. A knuckle ball that dips on Pollard as he looks to swing this over the off side, the ball dipped on him to beat him.  <B> Stunning execution under pressure </b>"
"another cracking yorker that tails in late to take thick inside edge to fine leg. Fifty for Pollard, but not good enough"
