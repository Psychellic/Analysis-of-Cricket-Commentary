"back of a length at off stump, bounce again. Shapes to punch into the off side, has to adjust and defend it to point"
"metronomical stuff. Back of a length at off stump, defended with soft hands off the back foot to steal a single at point"

"changes up, swings this into leg stump at a length, Warner gets on his toes and nudges this to mid-on's left"

"bouncer on a leg stump line. Dhawan shuffles again, so he's inside the line as he looks to hook this. Too quick for him, he's well beaten"

"high into the Bengaluru sky, and the local man pouches it...just about. This was good length, climbing up at a middle stump line. He gets the front leg out of the way and slashes across the line.

"good length at off stump, steps out, makes room, squeezes it out to long-off"

"<b>he's got him!</b> Two wickets in three balls for Kolkata! Pushes this back of a length, flat, and gets it to turn slightly. Warner wants to pull this but it isn't short enough. He's on the back foot and is forced to bring down an angled bat instead of a flat bat. Too much to do. It skids through and takes middle stump."
"dropped short outside off stump, punches against the turn off the back foot, down to long-on"
"<b>nearly lobs on to midwicket.</b> This stops at Yuvraj. It's good length at middle stump, he's expecting it to turn but it rises as he closes the face on the flick. It lands in front of midwicket"
"class. Pure class. This is overpitched outside off stump. He leans into it and places it perfectly to the right of long-off. He could've stopped that, he dived over it, but that was travelling quickly"

"back of a length outside off stump, stifled pull, straight to deep midwicket"
"<b>superb diving catch by Coulter-Nile!</b> Digs it in, back of a length at off stump. Gets it to sit in the pitch and induces the leading edge as Jordan tries to flick this into the leg side.

"yorker at off stump, squeezes it out to long-off. Slips as he's sent back by his partner but he puts in a dive and just manages to make the crease as the bails are taken off. Third umpire confirms it's not out."
"back of a length at off stump, looks to pull, gets it off the high part of the bat and it lobs and lands in front of mid-off"

"full delivery, with hints of away swing, Uthappa taps and runs to mid-off"

"huge appeal for a caught behind, but umpire Menon shakes his head for a moment before going to check with his partner. They call the third umpire in and the <b>soft signal is out</b>. Right then, this is a near yorker, which Lynn tries to squeeze out. But the ball pitches just before his bat and takes a bit of an edge through to Ojha. And it's a red light. Lynn's gone. Bhuvi gets right of the danger man like a boss!"
"Yusuf Pathan has earned a promotion and is he run-out first ball? Yes! It's Bhuvi again! What a player! He's bowling according to the batsman. Lynn liked length balls, so he does him in with a yorker. Pathan loves the full ones, so he bowls back of a length and cramps him up by getting the ball to angle into middle and leg. Pathan swings wildly, gets winded as the ball hits his gut, then scampers out of his crease blindly. Bhuvi, alert as ever, races up, gets the ball and underarms it on target"
"back of a length on off stump, the ball cutting back in a touch, Gambhir chops it behind the wicket to the keeper"
"a little room again and Gambhir slashes it over point. KKR may have lost two wickets, but they have more than the eight runs an over they need. That's the advantage they have having bowled Sunrisers out cheaply"
starts with a good length ball that swings further away outside off. It's too far outside off. It's a wide.
"he's picked out the only man out there at deep midwicket! He does love those front foot pulls, and he gets the perfect ball for it. Loads up, doesn't bother keeping the ball down, and pays a huge price for his mistake. Three wickets in seven balls for Sunrisers! KKR under pressure. So much pressure."

"lovely shot! He gets inside the line of a tossed up delivery on off stump and nails an extra cover drive. Vijay Shankar, moving to his right from long-off does well"

"this one drifts down leg, as he tries to fire them in quick and flat"
he's not happy. Doesn't seem to be able to grip the ball properly as he slips in another wide down leg
"googly again, pitching on leg stump, and ripping away across the left-hander. The quick pace of Rashid is not allowing Gambhir any sighters. He has to pick it off the hand - he doesn't - and ends up beaten"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to point"
"goes back of a length on off stump, Jaggi defuses it to deep third man"
"one bounce to the third man boundary. If you keep bowling short, you can't give room. He gives room and Gambhir, very experienced Gambhir, lifts it to the unmanned part of the ground"
makes it soar over short fine leg! The captain's making a statement. Launches a short ball on his hips and then pumps his fist. He's feeling it

"full on middle, Jaggi clips it to deep square leg and gets a single"

"lifts him over cover. Beautiful batting, as he shifts on the leg side and hits inside out"
"googly again, and Gambhir doesn't pick it. Goes for the flick, seeing the ball pitching on leg stump and is beaten"
"now he's playing for the googly as the stock ball. Shortish and outside off, he cuts to point"
"tosses it up outside off, he guides it to deep point and gives the strike over to the captain"
"this is the legspinner, and Gambhir, backing away to cut, is surprised by the ball turning into him. Manages to chop it through behind point"
"picks the googly, looks to swat it, but he mistimes the shot, and it doesn't carry to mid-on"
"it's a length ball down leg, Gambhir flicks it through to long leg for a single. Then comes up with a big smile to punch gloves with his partner"
"KKR are through! The defending champions are knocked out! And the match ends finally at 1.27 am. The final act, a miscued pull to midwicket and a harried single. Gambhir punches the air and bellows out a war cry."
