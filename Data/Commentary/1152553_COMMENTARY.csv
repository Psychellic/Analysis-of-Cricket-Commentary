"beauty first up, back of a length and shaping away, beats his bat outside off"

"back of a length on leg stump, tucks him up. Tries to get it away from waist high but doesn't connect well and midwicket collects. Probing first over"

"good length on leg stump, turned to square leg"
"oooh, swing and a miss. back of a length on the fourth stump line, Finch was targetting cow corner. This surface certainly has come bounce, it's rising as it goes past him"

"good length on leg stump, carted away, but one bounce to fine leg"
<b>good bowling again</b> Keeps it in the channel outside off and back of a length. The bounce in this surface means you can't just drive those balls on the up. Harvey tries and misses
"play and a miss again. Very close to off stump, shaping away a touch. Wants to punch it, but doesn't connect"
"<b>and again!</b> this is some strange batting. they've connected more with air than ball so far. In the channel again, another play and miss"
"back of a length on the stumps, jabbed to short cover."
"he finally connects while swinging his bat, but just about clears mid-off. Fuller ball on the stumps, he wanted to aim for six over long-off. Ends up getting it off the toe end and sends it high. Mid-off runs hard backwards and to his left, but can't get to the ball to catch it."

"<b>dropped by Shaun Marsh, but great effort</b> Finch's bat turns in his hand as he tries to send this over extra cover again. S Marsh jumps up and gets a hand to it, but the ball doesn't stick"

too early into the shot and ends up pushing at this good length ball on off to short third man off an outside edge.
"<b>lovely shot</b> angling away from him, ends up too full and too wide outside off. Harvey goes down on one knee while taking a step forward and stroking it through cover"
"another good shot, too full on the pads, and flicked with great timing. Beats short fine leg, but deep square leg runs around and puts in a diving stop on the boundary"
"<b>caught by Coulter-Nile at long-off</b> It's the full ball that gets the wicket. Angling into Finch, who wanted to give himself room. He still goes through with the lofted drive, but it catches the outside half of the bat and Coulter-Nile holds on after having to move a bit to his left and backwards to get into position"

"that's the length to bowl, keeps it back of a length and outside off, past the outside edge again, though he hadn't really committed to playing a shot"
"moves across to counter Tye's line, who stays on a length outside off. Manages to pull it over the in-field but without any timing."
"very full outside off, pushed straight to mid-off and they take off for a quick single. Direct hit would have been interesting. Would have run him out in fact"
"back of a length on the stumps. It's come off the pitch slower than he expected perhaps, ends up pushing at it too early and it takes the outside edge to roll away into the off side"

"<b>slapped past extra cover</b> down the track, giving himself room and allows him to send this crashing into the fence."
"that last shot forced this error. Coulter-Nile tries to bowl quicker, but strays down leg. Wide"

"back of a length angling across, cuts nicely but straight to point"
"angled across once again, but on a length this time, and it moves away enough to beat the batsman's attempted drive"

"shorter outside off, cut to short third man"
too far outside off and that will be wide
"flatter outside off, he comes down the track again but the length was quite full enough. Ends up padding it away to short third man"

"<b>stumping chance missed</b> batsman's in a tangle, but the keeper's in more of a tangle. Lovely flighted delivery that turns past his bat. The keeper fumbles the collection and it goes in front. Desperately fumbles to collect it and stump him but he's given the batsman enough time to get back"
"<b>dropped by Cartwright at deep midwicket</b> what's happening here? too short and pulled, but in the air. Cartwright has to run forward and hold on to a fairly easy catch, but it pops out. Qadir should have had two wickets in two balls, but has none"
moves across to paddle to short fine

"flatter, skids on and beats the batsman"

"yorker on the stumps again, and another risky single. Manages to squirt it to short third man and they run through. A direct hit would have seen him run out and not even in the frame"
