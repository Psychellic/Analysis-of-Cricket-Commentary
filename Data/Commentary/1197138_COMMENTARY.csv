"<strong>GIVES IT AWAY!</strong> Oh dear, Asghar Afghan, what have you done? Smart bowling by Taijul Islam, though. Pushed Afghan back with a couple of flat, quick deliveries and then tosses one up. Afghan goes for a wild slog across the line, and can only spoon this up in the air just behind the wicket. Mushfiqur Rahim calls early and takes the catch comfortably.

"flighted outside off, he stays deep inside the crease and punches it away towards cover point"
"flighted around off, and he punches this back towards the bowler"
"<strong>GOT 'IM!</strong> That is so well bowled by Taijul Islam. Pitches around leg, draws Zazai forward in an attempt to defend, spins enough to beat the outside edge and then <i>just</i> clips the top of off! Well deserved reward for the most consistent Bangladesh spinner on display, and ends a very good knock from Afsar Zazai. Bangladesh have well and truly made inroads into the lower order now, one feels!"
"short, quick, turns away from him, and he presses forward to defend this"
"flighted, around middle, and he defends towards midwicket"

"flighted around off, and he hits it hard, but straight back towards the bowler"
"Shakib has his man! Smart bowling from the ace all-rounder. Slightly flatter trajectory but similar line just around off. Qais looks to push forward, but is beaten by the flight of it, and gets an inside edge on to pad. Went low and sharp to Mominul Haque at silly point, who stays low enough to snare that comfortably"
"<b>through him!</b> Rashid stays deep and looks to power this into the leg side, but the ball rushes through him. And in fact it's taken an inside edge, but Mushfiqur can't hold onto it. Tough chance"
"Rashid on the forward press, pushing back to the bowler"
tucked defensively into the leg side
"<b>Bangladesh have reviewed</b>. Rashid plays yet another sweep as Taijul spears one in from around the stumps, but he's too far across and misses the shot. The appeal is turned down, but they go upstairs. And replays show <b>he's over-stepped!</b>. Leach yesterday, Taijul today!"

he's well forward to defend once again
"yet more flight from Shakib, Rashid getting well forward to smother it into the leg side"
"quicker one, but it's dug in half way down. Rashid can't make much of the long hop though, whipping out to the fielder at deep midwicket"
"<b>another review!</b> First things first, it's clearly a legitimate delivery. Ahmadzai lunges forward to defend, but the ball rushes through him, bursting off the pad and landing in slip's lap. But is there any bat on it? Yes, there's a thick edge onto the pad. And the catch is clean too"
"and he successfully negotiates his first delivery, defending a full one back down the track"
"he's down the track, heaving out to deep midwicket. And he turns down the single, farming the strike to protect the No. 11"
"flapped to cover, and he pings the field"
"attempted reverse sweep, but he finds himself in an awkward position and is struck on the pad. Outside the line"
"<b>slammed over long on!</b> Rashid skips down, right to the pitch, and takes on the long on fielder. Sweetly struck"
"again he's down the track, but he can't quite get underneath this one, sending a skimming shot out to the fielder in the deep"
"not entirely convincingly, Zahir props half forward and defends into the leg side"
"<b>and another!</b> Rashid slams his third six, a towering hit over long on. The field is spread, but he's taking them on. This almost went higher than it did far, but it's got enough on it to clear the boundary"
"defensive poke to follow up, into the leg side"
"Rashid uses his feet, getting to the pitch, but can only get it to long on. Again he turns down the single"
"but this time he takes it, driving out to long off and <b>raising a fifty</b> in his first match as captain. At a run a ball too"

"Zahir is well forward again, smothering a full one back to the bowler"
""
"ungainly swipe from Rashid, getting on the front foot and fetching a cross-batted stroke into the leg side. Precious little timing though"
"Steve Smith-esque leave from Rashid! Darted in wide of off, and he gives it the lightsaber treatment, whipping his bat up and over, and out of the way of the ball"
"and another! Rashid's definitely been taking pointers from Smith, as again he comes forward and then leans into an extravagant leave, whipping the bat across to leg and well away from the ball"
"down the track comes Rashid, heaving the ball out towards long on. It drops well short, though, and they take a single"

"some drift away from him, some spin back in. But Rashid is well forward to defend to leg"
"slugged down to long off, and he turns down the single"
"floated up much wider of off, and Rashid lunges out to angle the ball to point"
"<b>got him, all over!</b> And it's a juggling catch from Mehidy that wraps things up. Rashid was looking to drive down the ground, but was done a little in the flight, driving too early and reaching for the ball. The result is a return catch back to the bowler, who gets his hands up and juggles the first attempt, but recovers well to hold onto it. Mehidy has his first, Rashid falls, and Afghanistan are all out"
"some nip, and some shape back into Shadman, who presses forward and covers the swing with a straight bat"
"whoops, but this one is off target. There's a touch of swing for Ahmadzai, but his line is wide of leg and it goes further in that direction"
"Shadman's on the front foot, driving cautiously to cover"
"<b>edged, gone!</b> Ahmadzai finds the perfect line, angling across him, and Shadman pokes at one he might have left. There was some swing back in to him in the first few deliveries, but this one held its line, suckering him into a forward push. The ball takes a healthy edge, and it's safely snaffled by a diving Zazai behind the stumps. Good catch, too, as the ball was dipping as it got to him."
"Ahmadzai aims nice and full, attacking the stumps. Liton is forward to defend back down the track"
"<b>another edge!</b> Ahmadzai places one in the channel, drawing Liton forward. But this one drops short of a tumbling first slip. Are the catchers a bit deep?"
"whipped through outside off, and it's left alone"

"a touch too short, on off stump, and it's easily defended to leg"

"floated up on a leg stump line, and it's nurdled defensively into the leg side"
"<b>inside edge</b>, past the stumps! He poked with no great certainty at a ball in the channel outside off, with no foot movement whatsoever. But luck is with him, and the ball ricochets safely past the stumps"
"Sarkar steps across to off, leaving well alone as Ahmadzai angles one across him on a length"

"same ball, same shot, Liton staying in his crease and pushing to mid on"
"pushed through a little quicker, and there's a little grip in the surface. Defended easily enough"
"oohs and aahs in the field! Liton stays deep, but this was fuller and he's in an awkward position as it spins in to him, the ball taking the inside edge onto the pad but falling safely"

"length, outside off, and he presses forward to defend"

"fuller, and he drives this beautifully, but cannot beat cover"
"rapped on the pads, and given out leg-before. Will they go for the review? <strong>Yes, they do!</strong> Decent length ball, and he stretched forward to defend when he struck on the pads. Seemed to be outside the line at first glance. There doesn't seem to be any bat involved. Should boil down to ball-tracking...probably was heading on to the stumps, but did it hit him in line? Oh, impact is umpire's call, but it <b>turned too much</b>! Has to be overturned!"

"shorter ball, turns back into Das, who goes back and eases this through the cover region into the sweeper in the deep"
"filghted outside off, and Sarkar stretches forward to drive this back down the pitch"
"tossed up, and goes on with the angle. Takes the inside edge as Sarkar looks to drive. No damage done, though"
"rank long hop, outside off, and Sarkar is in a pretty defensive frame of mind. Flogs it to the sweeper at deep point"
"fired outside off, and he goes back and pushes this towards midwicket"
"length, goes all the way back and plays it with a dead bat down towards backward short leg"
sweeps a fuller ball towards deep square leg. Takes a little ricochet off the forward short leg's left shin
"tossed up outside off. He leaves, and it keeps very low!"
"sharp turn, on a good length, delivered from wide of the crease, and <strong>beats his outside edge</strong>"
"goes on with the arm from wide of the crease, and Sarkar is able to get it beyond forward short leg for a single"

"full ball, that Das presses forward to defend. There' s a loud appeal for leg before, but then there's no follow-up interest in a review"
"full again, and he drives it to mid off"
"shorter in length, turns into him, and he goes back to flick this towards square leg"
"length, holds its line, and Das has to go back and defend"
"tossed up, and he pulls out the sweep. That's close to Ahmadzai by the square leg fence, but it <strong>just clears him</strong>. Good enough tonk, and there you have it, Deepak. The first boundary of the innings!"
"tossed up, takes the outside edge, but <strong>lands short of first slip</strong>! Smart again from Sarkar, because he plays it with soft hands"
"fuller ball, and he plays it with the angle towards midwicket"
"down the leg side, and he plays it away towards fine leg"
"length, and he hangs back and defends this from the crease"

stretches forward to defend a fuller ball on the stumps
"flighted outside off, and he drives this towards backward point"
"tossed up, and he drives towards mid off"
"dragged short, and he goes back and smacks this away through square leg. <strong>Well timed, and beautifully placed!</strong>"
"full ball, and he flicks it away towards square leg. There's a quick throw rifled in, and Liton Das and Afsar Zazai get into a bit of a tangle as they look to avoid and collect that ball, respectively! Liton seems in a bit of discomfort, but should be okay to go through till the drinks break"
"presses forward to a length ball outside off, and defends"
"full, outside off, and he drives this to cover"
"off the inside half of the blade, the ball rolling through the gap behind square as they sprint back for two"
"rushing on with the arm, into the pads, and it's tucked to leg"
"Sarkar goes back and across, punching to cover"
"<b>huge shout, and it's given!</b> Sarkar knew it was plumb, he walked straight off as the finger went up. Again he stayed deep in his crease, getting back and across, and he's beaten by one that doesn't turn, zipping on straight to ping the front pad. Nabi has his first, Afghanistan their second, and the pressure is on"
"Mominul leans back, looking to cut, but the ball scuttles through low and he bottom edges a cut into the turf"
"and this time he's beaten on the cut! Mominul stays back, but the ball leaps past his shot and into Zazai's gloves. No edge though"
"glanced with the turn, behind square, but he can't find the gap"
"eased down the ground, off the front foot. The call for a single is immediate, and they get safely across"
"zipped through, out the back of the hand, and the ball spins in to the left hander, wrapping the pads. Headed down leg though, so no alarms"
"tapped away through point, and they hustle a single"
"nudged softly to leg, stopped by short leg"
"<b>deft touch!</b> Liton hangs back and dabs his bat down at the very last moment to place a very fine cut past the diving slip and away for four. Intentional, by the looks of things"
half a shout for lbw as Mominul presses forward with bat and pad together. The umpire's not interested
"placed through extra cover, just the one"
"Liton lunges forward, but plays his defensive stroke nice and light, under the eyes"
"flicked with the spin into the leg side, another single to the total"
"low-armed release from Nabi, and Mominul is well forward to smother the delivery"
"and again Mominul comes well forward to get right over the ball, defending to cover"
Liton gets himself into line and defends with a straight bat. Legbreak from Zahir
"this one slips out as a low full toss, but Liton can't take full toll, pinching a single as he flicks to leg but doesn't beat Rashid at mid on"
"Mominul's forward and on the drive, but pings the cover fielder"
"googly from Zahir, and it spins in to take the inside half of Mominul's forward push. Not sure he picked that"
"short and wide outside off, and Mominul slaps a cut just to point's left for a quick single"
"very full, outside off, and Liton squeezes a drive out to the cover sweeper to keep the strike"
"offbreak, looped up outside off, and Liton is only half forward as he defends"
"<b>swept hard</b> by Liton, rolling his wrists over it to keep it down and placing it wide of Qais at deep backward square to raise Bangladesh's fifty"
uppish! Liton stays deep but the ball stops on him and he flicks in the air towards midwicket. Short of the fielder though
"punched to cover, off the back foot"
"nurdled to leg, with the spin, and he hits the field"
"speared in flat on off stump, but Liton is equal to it, defending to leg"
"legbreak, just outside off, and it's angled to point"
Mominul is forward again to defend to point
"spinning across him, the googly, and Mominul slaps it out to deep point. Too short, too wide"
"legbreak, quick and flat. Liton waits on the back foot and defends to leg"
"another leggie, and there's some grip too as Liton defends back to the bowler"
"<b>bowled him!</b> Liton has completely misread the length of this one. He thought it was short, he rocked back to pull, but it wasn't as short as he thought and the ball zipped through under the shot to rattle his stumps. He might have been much better off coming forward to this"
Mominul lunges forward to place a drive to point as Nabi comes around the stumps
"testing delivery, landing on a good length and angling in with the arm. Mominul is forward to defend"
"a hint of width, and it's punched firmly off the back foot"
"Shakib's off the mark straight away, flicking across his pads to collect a single to midwicket"
"almost through him! Mominul stays back, but the ball skids through low, with no turn, and very nearly beats a somewhat desperate poke. Fortunately for him, he puts bat to ball to keep it out"
"and he's on the front foot once more now, defending to cover"
Shakib lets his bottom hand lead as he works a legbreak to midwicket
"googly! Has Shakib picked it? He was looking to work to leg again, but the ball spun across him and squared him up"
"<b>beaten by the googly!</b> Didn't read this one. But he did manage to hold his bat just inside the line, rather than chasing it outside off"
nudged defensively to leg
"Shakib bends low, sweeping fine for a brace"
"fuller, straighter, and ball wraps pad as Shakib misses a sweep! Rashid bellows an appeal, but the umpire is unmoved. Will they review this one? Nope. And rightly so, as he got some glove on it"
"looped up from around the stumps, Mominul is forward to defend"
""
defended to cover
"Mominul is forward again, pressing watchfully to cover"
"he puts a bit more vim into this drive, but he can't beat a tumbling cover fielder"
"Mominul stays deep in the crease, punching a defensive stroke to cover"
"<b>beaten on the cut!</b> Shakib set himself for the cut, but the ball rushed past him"
"<b>past a diving short third man!</b> Controlled stroke from Shakib, who came forward this time, having read the delivery, and angled the ball past a tame effort from the short third man fielder"
"again Shakib is forward with angled blade, but this time he can't beat the field"
"Rashid slows this one right down, flighting the ball temptingly. But Shakib won't be tempted, pushing it back to him"
"googly, but it's a little short and he can easily read it off the track, tapping to point"
"just a touch too short and too wide again, Mominul slapping a cut just to the left of point to collect one more"
"chopped down, just past point again, and they sprint through for one more"
"floated up, just outside off. Googly, but it's read, and kept out"
"legbreak this time, and it scuttles through very low to beat the under side of Shakib's cut"
"he's forward this time, on the drive to cover"
"googly again, and Mominul stays deep in the crease to work his wrists over a leg glance for one"
"full toss, and it's slugged hard back to the bowler. Shakib's disappointed with himself, he wanted to make more of that one"
"very full, Mominul digging it out back to the bowler"
"very full again, but sliding down the leg side. Mominul chances a sweep at it, and the ball kisses the glove / bat on its way through, rolling away very fine to the boundary"
"straighter this time, and it's met with a defensive bat"
"<b>beaten on the outside edge!</b> To his credit, Mominul kept his bat inside the line and didn't fish at it as the ball fizzed past him"
"punched firmly to mid on, off the back foot"
"a touch too short, and Mominul works off the hip for one"
"Zahir loses his line down the leg side, and Mominul is perfectly happy helping the harmless delivery on its way down to fine leg with a deft little sweep"
"<b>chipped in the air</b>, but into vacant space wide of long on. It had some airtime, but no-one could get close to it, and they're back for the second"
"<b>long hop, dispatched!</b> Zahir's lost his radar here, and Mominul punishes him with a swatting pull to deep midwicket"
"chopped down towards point, who gets in the way of the shot"
"googly, spinning in to him, and it's read and defended"
"<b>and another!</b> Zahir has completely lost it in this over, and digs in another rank short ball. Mominul slaps it to wide long on for another boundary"
"Shakib presses forward, defending a full one to cover"
"<b>almost chopped on!</b> Shakib just hung his bat out at it, with no great certainty"
"and now he's forward again, angling the blade to collect two down to third man"
"<b>ball thuds into pad, and the finger goes up!</b> It was the legbreak from Rashid, spinning in to beat Shakib's forward poke and pinning him on the pad. An appeal is roared, and the umpire agrees. But Shakib doesn't, asking for a review. Alas, it is a wasted one, as the replay shows three reds, pitching in line, hitting in line, and smacking into the stumps"
"flicked through full and wide, outside off, Mushfiqur drives to mid off"
"<b>now, what has happened here?</b> Afghanistan are celebrating. They believe they've got Mushfiqur out, caught close to the wicket. The soft signal is out as they send it upstairs. It's a legal delivery, to which Mushfiqur goes back and across, defending the ball straight down into his own boot. There's a puff of dust, but has the ball hit his shoe or the ground? It's snaffled by short leg under the helmet, so no problem there. When they zoom in to the replay, it's not clear (to me at least) whether it's hit his boot or the ground. But the third umpire is convinced, and it's given out! The soft signal was vital here. There was no conclusive evidence to turn that over."
"goes back and shortens the length of a straighter ball, and whips it away towards midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, and he drives it back down the ground"
"flighted outside off, and he drives it towards point. Picks up two easily"
"fuller ball, and he allows it to turn across him. <strong>Off the inner edge, and just past forward short leg</strong>!"
"flighted, and he drives this down the ground after skipping down the track. <strong>Uppish, and just clears the man at mid on</strong>"
goes back and defends a flatter ball straight at the off stump
"flat, towards the pads, and he plays it away towards long leg"
"flatter, straightens into him, and he goes back to defend towards short leg"
"flighted, possibly the googly, but he presses forward and flicks it towards midwicket and disallows it to turn and bother him"
goes back and punches a length ball towards point
"short, and he goes back and cuts it away towards deep point"
"wrong 'un, <strong>turns back a long way</strong> from outside off. Mahmudullah leaves it, and Rashid has his head in his hands. Wasn't a long way off from the top of off stump!"
presses forward to defend a length ball
"tossed up, and he drives it down towards mid on. Enough running around for the fieldsman to do, and that allows a single to be taken"
goes back and defends a length ball back towards the bowler
"flighted around off and middle, and he plays this with the turn towards midwicket"
"fires this down the legside, and Mahmudullah looks to play a fine lap shot. No contact with the bat, but it runs away towards fine leg and pulls up yards ahead of the boundary"
"Mahmudullah comes forward, and there's a review for a bat-pad catch that was initally given not out! Shorter in length, and he came a long way down the wicket, but it was the bat hitting the pad, and popped up to the forward short leg. They will also check for lbw. Missing quite comfortably. So stays not out, and review lost for Afghanistan"
"length, goes back and defends it as it turns across him"
presses forward to meet a length ball pitching outside leg and turning across him. Smothers it beautifully
"flatter, wider, and he can leave this alone"
"straight, flat, and he looks to sweep. Appeal for a leg-before, but as soon as Paul Wilson says no, they turn back to their positions. Pitched outside leg"
"shorter, and he can swat this away towards deep cover"
"length, he goes back and eases it towards cover"
"fuller ball, and he looks to flick it. Gets it along the ground towards short leg"
presses forward and defends
goes back and defends a length ball
drives a length ball towards mid on
"tossed up, and he plays it with soft hands, at full stretch, as the ball drops just short of forward short leg"
"tossed up, outside off, and he plays a fluent drive, but cannot beat extra cover"
"<strong>DONE HIM!</strong> Wrong 'un that starts from outside off, speeds on, and also creeps quite low. Mahmudullah, though, would believe he should have been forward to play this. It speeds through, and his flailing bat can only make contact with air, as the ball floors the off stump. This is a superb spell of bowling from Rashid Khan"
"flat, straight, and he goes back to defend this. <em>Keeps a bit low again</em>"
"outside off, beats the outside edge as Mosaddek looks to stretch and defend this. Full-throated appeal from Zazai as well"
"flatter, and he presses forward and drives it back down the wicket"
"this could be close. Turns back in from just outside off. <strong>They review</strong>, after is given not out for leg before. Nothing wrong with the front foot, and he had a forward press going. The ball evades the inside edge and thuds into pad. The question of hitting in line next...and impact is outside. So that stays not out, and Afghanistan lose both their reviews"
"plays back to a length ball, sharp and low, and plays it away towards midwicket"
presses forward and defends a length ball
"tossed up, and he plays it away towards midwicket"
"flighted outside off, and he goes inside out, and well over the inner fielders. <strong>Terrific shot!</strong>"
"short this time, and he rocks back and flogs this over midwicket. Superb shot yet again"
"tossed up, and he plays it with soft hands to the left of mid on. Easy single on offer"
"<strong>Mosaddek joins in the fun!</strong> Skips down the wicket with a couple of quick steps, and then smacks this with the turn over long on"
"fired in flat, outside off, and he goes back and defends this from the crease"
"flighted, and he skips down the wicket just a tad and then helps it over the unprotected wide long on fence. Good timing and placement again from the elegant Mominul, who is gathering some fine momentum here"
"another ball that keeps low, outside off, and he plays it cautiously off the back foot"
"wrong 'un, from around the wicket, and he presses forward and plays it late towards point"
"another flatter, quicker ball, from outside off, turning further away, and he leaves"
"<strong>FIFTY for Mominul</strong> in some style! In his arc, tossed up around middle and leg, and he clears his front leg and whacks this over mid on. Superb ball-striking over the last couple of overs from Mominul who is taking the attack to Afghanistan"
"fuller ball, on the middle and leg line, and he drives this down to long on"
"length ball, and he goes back and drives this towards wide cover"
"length, down the leg side, and he can nibble this around the corner towards square leg"
"<strong>he holes out this time!</strong> Ok, that might have been the kiss of death, but Mominul plays one shot too many off the spinners. Clever bowling from Nabi, as he just makes the ball hang back a bit. Mominul thinks this is in the slot and looks to go over mid on, but the length is shorter than what he anticipates. Miscues the shot, and Asghar Afghan at mid on takes a simple catch. Big wicket for Afghanistan. Nabi delivers again!"
presses forward to defend a length ball around off
"plays an uppish drive just past a silly mid on in place now, and also takes a sharp single to the mid on fielder just behind him. Just about makes it with a dive, though the return never hit the target"
"flighted around off stump, and he drives with the turn back towards the bowler"
"<strong>what a ripper!</strong> This pitches around leg, drifts in, and then turns enough to beat the outside edge. Almost got to the top of off. Think back Shane Warne, 1993, Mike Gatting, minus the actual dismissal..."
"shorter, wider and he can cut this away past point for two"
"flighted, and he drives with the turn towards cover"
"flighted, outside off, and there's a bit of flamboyance about Mehidy as he leans back and thrashes this inside out. Didn't time it well enough to get to the fence though"
"quick turn from outside off, and he drives towards cover"
"tossed up, and he presses forward to defend"
"length, keeps a bit low, and he flicks this away. Misfield at midwicket allows them to take an easy single"
"length, outside off, goes <em>scooting along</em> the ground again, and he leans back and drives this towards cover point"
"fuller ball, and he drives this towards mid on"
"tossed up, outside off, and he drives this back towards the bowler"
"length, and he presses forward to defend this"
"outside off, and he presses forward to defend"
"flat, fast, outside off, and he allows it to come to him and defends from the crease"
presses forward to smother a length ball around off stump
"wrong 'un, just outside off, and he reads it well. Played late, and with a dead bat, towards second slip"
"googly again, and he goes back and reads it perfectly. Defended to cover"
"regular leg-break, turns away after pitching around off, and he defends from the crease"
"sharp turn from outside leg, angles across Mosaddek. He defends with the bat, and very late at that"
"turns away from him, keeps low, and takes the outer edge and runs along the ground towards first slip"
"tosses it up, Mosaddek takes it on the full, and drives it but cannot beat cover"
"pitches around leg, and he drives it back towards the bowler"
"sharp turn, away from the outside of off, beating a tentative poke"
defends a length ball just around off stump
"googly, slow through the air, comfortably defended"
"tossed up, and he goes inside out, and goes high over the mid off fielder. Almost goes all the way, but one bounce into the long off fence. Not off the middle, though, as he intended go straighter"
"length, and he goes back to defend this"
"shorter in length, and he goes back to cut this away towards point"
"wrong 'un, comes in from outside off, and he presses forward to defend off the inner part of the bat"
"length, and he plays it back comfortably towards Rashid"
"length, turns away, and he defends"
"flighted, and he drives with the turn towards long off"
"length, turns away after landing around off, and Mehidy waits in the crease and defends it late"
"sharp turn, from outside off. Slow, though, and he can let it pass"
"<strong>oh, well bowled!</strong> Tossed up, outside off, and draws Mehidy into chasing it, and the turn takes it past the outside edge. Some bounce too"
"starts around leg, and then <strong>fizzes right across Mehidy</strong>. Opens him up, but he adjusts well to keep it down and play it dead at his feet"
"wrong 'un outside off, and he defends towards point"
"wrong 'un again, and he reads it well. Shuffles across and whips it away to the right of long leg"
"length, and he goes back to defend this"
"length, outside off, and beats the outside edge as Mosaddek looks to play it late"
punches a length ball towards midwicket
"short, outside off, and he looks to cut it away, but misses"
"Mehidy laces a cut, but finds point as Qais offers width"
"slider, but it's sliding down leg as it kisses Mehidy's pads"
"looped up on a leg stump line, and it's flicked square for one"
"<b>beaten by fizzing turn and bounce!</b> Qais gave this one some flight, and it gripped and spun sharply to beat Mosaddek's forward poke"
"pressed through cover, just the one"
"Mehidy lunges onto the front foot, getting right over the ball to smother it back down the track"
"pushed through flat, just outside off. Mosaddek is forward to defend"
"he's back and across now, to push it back down the track"
"fuller this time, and Mosaddek is no less resolute in keeping it out, leaning well forward"
"<b>is this dropped?</b> There was a noise as ball passed bat! Rashid fizzed down a legbreak, it gripped and kissed the edge of his bat, but Zazai can't hold on"
"and the googly is the follow-up, ragging in sharply to spit into Mosaddek's gloves"
"flat and fast on middle and off, and it's somewhat tentatively pushed to mid on"
"legbreak, and it's tapped down the track"
"<b>bowled around his legs!</b> Mehidy bends down low, setting himself for a lapped sweep, but the ball dips under his shot and then spins back to rattle the timber, behind his legs. Top work from Qais, picking up his maiden Test wicket, and, it must be said, Showkat. Not the classiest of shots"
"spinning in sharply, but Taijul is forward to defend"
"fuller this time, and he's forward to defend it"
"Qais lobs this one down slightly wider of off, Taijul stretching out to defend to cover"
"<b>there's an appeal</b> as Taijul goes back to this one and is hit on the pad, but it looked to be spinning down the leg side"
"googly to start, and it's whipped out to deep midwicket"
"worked into the leg side, and they turn the strike over once more"
a forward press and an angled bat bring a single through backward point
"legbreak, but it's a touch wide outside off and Taijul unfurls a cut to backward point"
"tossed up on middle and off, and he's forward to defend"
"and ends his 14th over with a googly, which is read and tapped square on the off side"
"<b>slammed down the ground!</b> Qais let slip with a high full toss, and Mosaddek made it higher by charging down the track at him, middling a towering stroke straight back over his head"

"legbreak, and Taijul is onto the front foot to defend it into the leg side"
"looped up a little wider outside off, and Taijul stretches out to defend to cover"
"<b>big drive, but it goes nowhere!</b> Taijul got rather ahead of himself as he tried to lace this through cover, getting a big inside edge onto his front pad. Fortunately for him it goes straight to ground"
"tucked into space at midwicket, and the call for a single is immediate. In fact, Mosaddek wants two, but it's not on"
"googly, and Taijul withdraws his bat as the ball zips across him"
"angled across him once again, and Taijul likewise meets it with an angled defence. Soft hands"
"legbreak now, and he stays back to defend it"
"there's some excitement at the wicket as Taijul tucks defensively to leg, but he's perfectly safe"
"Rashid switches to around the stumps, spinning the ball in to Taijul, who dabs it down to point"
"Mosaddek comes down the track, and slices his drive uppishly towards cover. The ball lands in front of the fielder though"
"slammed down the track, and long off cleans up to keep them to one"
"floated up outside off, Taijul steps into a firm drive that finds extra cover"
"another legbreak, and Taijul is forward to defend this one. The length wasn't quite there to drive"

"again Qais invites the drive, floating the ball up outside off, but this time Taijul won't be tempted, leaving well alone"
"squirted through backward point, and they pinch a single"
"<b>was there something on this one?</b> Rashid comes around the stumps and digs in a sharp legbreak, which touches something on its way down the leg side. In any case, the keeper Zazai fumbles his take. Could have been pad"
"straighter this time, and Taijul defends"
"speared down the leg side, and Taijul swivels into a pull but misses the shot"
"solid forward defensive from Taijul, stretching well forward to get to it"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> as Rashid spins a legbreak in to Taijul, but it's clearly headed down the leg side"
"inside out, over extra cover! It doesn't quite have the legs to reach the boundary, but Mosaddek once again uses his feet and looks to be proactive"
"landing on middle and leg, and he's forward to defend"
"slipping down the leg side again, and he helps it on its way for a brace to deep backward square"

"Ahmadzai hits a length, just outside off, and Taijul is half forward to defend to cover"

"another leggie, released with a grunt of effort by Rashid, but again Taijul is equal to it, getting forward to defend"
"just short of a good length, outside off, and Mosaddek bottom-edges a firm push straight into the ground"
"<b>short, and pulled hard down to fine leg!</b> Ahmadzai bent his back on this one, but couldn't find much help off the track and it's easily put away"
"Ahmadzai aims this one fuller, and he's forward to punch it back to him"

Mosaddek stays deep in his crease to defend another offie back to the bowler
"gentle spin for Nabi, and it's pushed to mid on, on the drive"

"angling in on a length to the left hander, who sees it off watchfully"
"flung down full and very wide outside off. For some reason Taijul flings a wild drive out at it, hitting only fresh air"
"straighter from Ahmadzai, and Taijul's response is much better as he offers an orthodox defensive stroke"
"<b>pulled handsomely through square leg!</b> Ahmadzai slipped in a bouncer, but it didn't get up much and he swiveled into a powerful pull"

Gets more elevation than distance, and Asghar Afghan, stationed around three-quarters of the way to the wide long off fence, gets under it, and tumbles to complete the catch. The change of angle works immediately, and Zahir has two. What an impressive spell this is turning out to be from the debutant left-arm wrist-spinner!"

"googly, spinning in past the defensive poke and striking him on the pad. Rashid bellows an appeal, and he's given! Mushfiqur thinks about it, and <b>reviews</b> the decision. It's a fair delivery, and he's not got any bat on it. Ball tracking confirms that he's out, the ball would have gone on to hit middle and leg."
"legbreak, and it spits off a full length, coming off the thigh pad and bouncing to leg. Not too far away from the edge / glove there"
"and now this one keeps shade low, on an off stump line. Nudged softly to leg"

"down the track comes Shakib, smothering it back at him"
"again he uses his feet, driving back at Rashid, who collects and fires a throw back at the stumps. Zazai stops it with his feet. It's all happening"

Shadman plays for the turn, pressing forward, and that thuds into his front pad, even as his stride doesn't take him too far ahead. Just above the shin, and possibly going on to take leg stump. <b>Nabi has his first in his last outing in Tests for Afghanistan!</b>"

"faster googly, and he defends this from the crease. Watches it late on to his bat"
"length, turns into him, and he flicks it away towards square leg"

"<strong>GOT 'IM!</strong> Wrong 'un, and Mahmudullah didn't read this. Pressed forward, hoping to defend this just like the previous couple of balls. The ball turns back in sharply, runs off the edge and flies low towards forward short leg, who completes the catch. Rashid Khan takes off in celebration in his trademark fashion. Afghanistan can surely sniff victory now"
"tossed up, and he presses forward to drive it back towards silly mid-off"

"tossed up, and again he thrashes this past Rashid. Similar area, and a bit more agricultural. Same result"

Gets a thin edge and it is held on with ease. Afghanistan are hopping. If they needed one thing to lift them up after this long break, it would have been the wicket of Bangladesh's captain. And I'm afraid they've got that with little effort"

"full outside off, allows that to come on and gives it a tap, very late. A nicely timed drive through the covers"
