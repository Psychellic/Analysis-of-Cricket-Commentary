the desire to bowl full on this pitch and make the best use of it results in Gabriel bowling a low full toss. Latham defends calmly
<strong>lovely bowling</strong>. Discipline is extremely key early on in New Zealand and Gabriel has got it pretty much perfect. Puts it up there in line with off stump and Latham leaves the ball on the angle
"only slightly straight and Latham is onto it in a flash, a smooth little flick shot, with head over the ball and the wrists rolling on top of it. Couple behind square leg"
"another one straying on the pads, Latham works it to long leg"
they're making the batsmen drive. They're making them play shots. That's good stuff. Gabriel going full and outside off and drawing Blundell into a shot away from his body - the cover drive
<strong>way too wide outside off</strong> and Blundell is able to steer it away to the point boundary. The desire to pitch the ball up - which is a marked change from the natural length he bowls - has resulted in a long half volley that's been punished
"back of a length and directed across the left-hander, Latham is only too happy to let those go"
makes sure to get right on top of the bounce of this shortish ball on middle and then uses soft hands to tap it down towards square leg for a single. Good work from Latham. That ball was climbing.
"pitches it up well enough, but slides it down leg"
covers the line of a good length ball on middle and off
another stray down the leg side
"back of a length and flying away to the keeper, once more, down the leg side. West Indies are slipping back into old bad habits"
"too full, too straight, and Latham puts it away with a little tickle to the fine leg boundary"
"change in angle doesn't bring any change in line, but this time Latham doesn't place it as fine, and long leg mops up"
"oh no, Gabriel's not found his rhythm at all. A floaty wide half-volley, and Blundell stretches out for a checked drive through cover"
"and another poor ball from Gabriel. Overpitched, angling into middle and leg, and Latham clips it elegantly wide of mid-on"
"length ball, fairly wide of off stump, left alone"
"good length again, angling into the corridor outside off. A better delivery, and Latham has to watch it more closely before electing to leave"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, Blundell gets right behind it to defend"
"oh, beauty. Draws him forward with a slightly fuller length in the fourth-stump channel, and beats his outside edge with away seam movement and extra bounce. Didn't go pushing at it with his hands"
"back of a length, close to off stump, gets back and across and blocks into the on side"
"fuller now, a hint of outswing, and Blundell leaves it alone"
"length ball, top of off. Gets back and across to block to midwicket"
"fullish, angling into off and middle. Stays right back and defends under his eyes"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, straightens just a touch, and another batsman might have felt for it and been troubled by it, but he needs to be closer to off stump to make Latham play"
"yup, especially when he's prepared to leave on length. Only slightly back of a length, angling in towards off stump, and Latham ignores it and lets it pass over off stump"
"fuller now, angling into off stump. Gets forward and defends into the on side"
"back of a length on off stump, defended back to the bowler."
"<strong>ooh, lovely</strong>. Length ball, angling into a tight line close to off stump, and straightening past the outside edge as Latham defends from the crease. Got slightly squared up too"
"leaves on length again. Not quite bouncing over the top of off stump this time, but pretty close nonetheless"
"fullish, angling into off stump. Presses forward for a gentle push into the covers"
"back of a length, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"length ball, angling into off stump, clipped watchfully to midwicket"
"because Latham leaves on length so much, fast bowlers can veer too full while trying to get him forward and playing. Holder pitches this up on off stump, and he flows into a smooth drive to the cover boundary"
"length ball, not far outside off, left alone"
"ooh, that's a rare moment of looseness from Latham. Length ball, fifth-stump line, not the sort of line he usually goes flirting at. Has a little nibble - wasn't an attacking shot, so he's best off just leaving - and the ball straightens past his edge"
"ooh, Gabriel slips in the surprise off-stump yorker. Probably to see if he can squeeze past Blundell who's camped extremely deep in his crease. Jams his bat down and keeps it out"
"length ball, angling into the fifth-stump channel from wide of the crease. Gets right across to cover his stumps and leave"
"back of a length, angling into the corridor. Straightens just a touch but Blundell gets across, watches it well, and defends into the off side"
"half-volley just outside off, and Blundell barely has to move forward to drive it to the cover point boundary"
"bowled him! Gabriel gets a lot of batsmen bowled, and he finds the perfect length this time. Just full enough to bring Blundell half-forward to defend, but not far enough forward to cover that little bit of inward seam movement. He's looking to defend, but the angle from wide of the crease and that moment combine to find the little gap between bat and pad and hit top of off. Super delivery. Camping so deep in your crease can make you vulnerable to this sort of ball"
"full to start, just outside off, and Young gets a good stride forward to defend. Almost smothered it like you would while playing spin"
"length ball on off stump, stays back and defends compactly"
"length ball, fourth-stump line, left alone"
"full, angling into off stump, defended towards mid-off"
"full, angling into middle stump, clipped to the right of long leg to pick up two. Nice idea from Holder - Latham seemed to play around his front pad there - but the length was a touch too full"
"zips past his outside edge. Back of a length, straightens from just outside off, forcing Young to play, but he plays close to his body so the ball doesn't take his edge as it snarls away from him"
"back of a length, on off stump this time. Extra bounce forces Young to take his bottom hand off the handle while defending into the on side"
"looks for the blockhole ball, and Latham clips neatly to midwicket"
"<strong>yikes, that's a nasty one</strong>. Rears off a length and straightens. The line is tight on off stump, and Latham, looking to play the initial angle and defend into the on side, is smacked on the right forearm, right below the elbow. No forearm guard on that arm either, and the physio comes out to attend to him"
"length ball, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and defends with an open face towards gully. Played nice and late, and watched it straighten ever so slightly"
"ooh, <strong>that is some leave</strong>. Gabriel is extremely wide on the crease, and he angles this in, and the length isn't short by any means. Not far from the top of off stump at all, and the extent of the inward angle can be seen in the fact that da Silva had to move a couple of steps to his right, towards the leg side, to collect the ball"
"back of a length close to off stump, left alone"
"length ball on middle stump, stays in his crease and clips watchfully to midwicket"
"fullish, angling into middle and leg, clipped away, and he doesn't middle it, but gets enough on it to run away past the keeper to the fine leg boundary"
"late outswing in the corridor, and Young is a little late getting forward to defend, and the ball curls past his outside edge"
"length ball on middle and off, defended to midwicket from the crease"
"length ball on middle stump, clipped watchfully to midwicket"
"too straight, nudged off the pad to the right of midwicket"
"nice. Gabriel's built up some rhythm after an erratic start. Length ball, brings Young forward to defend just outside off, and then zips it in past the inside edge. <strong>Similar delivery to the one that got Blundell</strong>"
"similar initial line, but the length is a touch shorter and Young leaves comfortably"
"length ball, a touch too wide to make Young play, especially given the steep bounce off this pitch"
"ooh, <strong>in the air briefly</strong>. Full, angling in towards off stump, and Young is late getting on the front foot. Just pushes at it with his hands, and the ball loops up off the bottom part of his bat, just to the left of Gabriel in his follow-through"
"full again, outside off, left alone"
"length ball close to off stump, left alone"
"back of a length in the corridor, left alone"
"length ball angling into middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"good ball, steep bounce from just back of a length. Tight line around off stump, and Latham looks to play that with an open face, and manages to squeeze it away between third slip and gully, all along the ground"
"length ball on middle and leg, clipped to midwicket"
"fullish outside off, left alone"
"length ball, top of off, and Latham clips to midwicket again. West Indies won't mind him playing with a closed face like that"
"full, angling into off stump, and that's a lovely shot from Young, who'll be relieved to get one off the middle after a nervy start. Shows the full face, and punches sweetly between the umpire and non-striker"
"better length in the corridor, good stride forward from Young before he leaves"
"full outside off, and that's another nice checked drive down the ground, this time to the right of mid-off"
length ball slanting across to off stump. Good stride forward to block it back to the bowler
"ooh, looks to leave on length as Joseph slants this across him, and then the ball straightens into him to hit him on the stomach. <strong>Ouch</strong>"
"wow, another leave on length. This one carries on along its initial path, and zips some six inches or so over off stump"
"full, angling into off stump, blocked to short extra-cover"
"fullish again, a little wider, left alone"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"once again full, a little bit of width, and Young drives it square, to the right of backward point"
"length ball, trusts the bounce and leaves it. Once again the ball zips over the top of off stump"
"length ball on middle stump or so, looks to defend into the on side, with a slightly closed face, and ends up playing to short cover with the leading edge"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"length ball, angling into off stump. Stays back and is slightly late on this as he clips it round to fine leg. Thick inside edge, in face"
"back of a length, angling across to off stump, defended back down the pitch"
"back of a length outside off, punched firmly and Chase dives to his right to stop it at cover point"
"length ball on off stump, squeezed back down the pitch. Wanted to work it leg-side, I think, but the extra bounce caused him to play it off the outside half of his bat"
"nicely bowled. Fullish, slanting away from off stump, left alone"
"full, close to off stump, nice stride forward to defend."
Waits on the straight ball quite nicely and by virtue of that he's able to find a single behind square leg
delightful carry through to the keeper but Latham won't be particularly worried by that. He likes balls that bounce far too much to hit his stumps. Especially when they're also outside off and he can leave
"tries ever so hard to get him forward and drive on the up, but Latham knows the danger involved and prefers to keep hiding his bat from anything angled across him..."
"... <strong>unless it's full and wide</strong>. Latham leans into the square drive, the face of his bat opening to find the gap behind point."
"hits a yorker outside the off stump, Latham attempts to perhaps run it to third man, makes no contact."
"that's another eye-catching drive from Young. He's given the opportunity to lean into the shot by Joseph overpitching once again. Brings down a straight bat and pushes it past the bowler, which is all he has to do"
"<strong>good ball, good leave</strong>. It hits around off stump, on a good length. It straightens as well. A delightful ball looking for the outside edge. Young's mind computes that and so leaves it well alone"
a much easier leave with Joseph going shorter and wider of off stump
"hmm, he seems to be getting a little more confident about his game now. That can be a good thing. And it also cannot. Like here, he's reaching to a very wide ball with extremely hard hands and ends up inside edging into the covers"
that's much better. He's keeping his shape. He's playing close to the body. He's able to do all that because he's in the advantage with a low full toss on leg stump. Three through midwicket
clips a length ball on leg stump to long leg
"<strong>that's a beautiful delivery to get a first Test wicket!</strong>. Even in this short spell, Holder has been very good at trying to tempt Latham. And not just into any shot, the most dangerous one on a fast-bowler friendly pitch. The drive on the up. NZ's captain had refrained for a while, but now, for some reason, against a good length ball just a shade outside off stump - the very line he usually leaves - he flays his bat and nicks off to the keeper. The around the wicket angle made that wicket."
"<strong>lbw appeal straight away</strong>. It's too high. But what a ball to a new batsman. It is straight. It is wobbling around. It is quick. And it leaves Taylor with very little time to react. He tries to flick it away, but by then, he's struck on the thigh"
sliding off his pads and behind square leg as he gets across to the other end
<strong>he's really revved up! </strong> The amount of effort Holder is putting through his action is paying off as balls even just back of a length are rearing up. This one is on Young's body and makes him pull his bottom hand off as he tries to work it to the leg side
"pitches it up but since its just a tad on the pads, it actually hits them and wanders off towards square leg"
"<strong>he has Taylor hopping now</strong>, although the NZ batsman does well to get his hands over the ball outside off, tap it into the covers and sprint through for a single"
drifts down the leg side as Taylor looks to flick it to long leg
"<strong>inside edge onto the body!</strong>. Taylor reads the length first. It's short. Once that happens, he immediately loads up on the cut shot. He loves that shot. He doesn't even care the ball doesn't have all that room. But he eventually has to because Gabriel gets it to dart into him off the pitch, and get extra bounce. West Indies venom!"
"<strong>caught on the crease</strong> as he pushes his hands at a pitched up delivery on and around off stump. He's in a very poor position to drive, and as a result offers another inside edgey kind of shot to midwicket"
"<strong>bang on the chest!</strong>. The pace in this Wellington wicket is really helping the bowlers. Hamilton offered them time to adjust to the obvious movement. Here, they don't have that. Taylor, deep in his crease, desperate to play off his back foot, is met by a short ball that straightens quite a bit. Goes past his outside edge and thuds into his body"
"good, soft hands from Young as he too plays an uncertain shot. No push forward to a full length ball and an angled bat. Goes down to gully."
bouncer to end the over and Young gets under it
<strong>everyone's whackin him!</strong>. Taylor's attempted flick behind square leg is useless as Holder hits just back of a length and gets extremely sharp inward movement. The batsman isn't ready for that. There's no way he can be
"<strong>oh he's had enough!</strong>. He's had enough of target practice. The second there's a full ball - a half-volley - coming his way, he throws his bat at it and rams a drive past mid-off. That's a get off my back shot."
he's done well again. Waits until the good length ball is right under his eyes - crouching in his stance - and flicks it through midwicket. Good work as he tries to play close to his body
"good length ball, outside off, good leave"
"a touch too full and once again Young is able to play a pretty drive, this one through point"
<strong>sharp bounce again from the debutant</strong> as Young shifts himself across his off stump to get outside the line of the ball and work it behind square leg
"lets the good length ball come to him and plays with the angle, deflecting it behind square leg"
"<strong>he should be moving forward to these!</strong>. And because he doesn't, and only his hands push at the full ball on off stump, the exact kind that dismissed him in the last Test, he gets an inside edge onto pad ."
"<strong>got him!</strong>. Gabriel has been unplayable since the first couple of his overs. He's been quick. He's got movement off this very green pitch. He's never let the batsman settle. And when it comes to Taylor, he's been pure torment. This is a back of a length ball angled into off stump. Taylor, because of that, doesn't know if he should play of leave. To further complicate matters, it straightens as well, which in the end is what makes the push his hands at the ball. Faint edge through to the keeper to reward some brilliant bowling by a man playing his 50th Test for West Indies."

"half an appeal for lbw as Gabriel keeps attacking the in-between length, the one where the batsman can't be sure whether to go forward or back, around 4 to 6m on the pitch. Young nudges it with a bit of his inside edge and keeps it down from short leg"
clips a back of a length ball on leg stump behind square leg. He's being very careful to play very close to his body.
low full toss from around the wicket. Nicholls keeps it out
<strong>Too good!</strong> Just too good! Gabriel is on fire. He's pitching the ball up. He's attacking the stumps. He makes Nicholls play. And then the ball seams away - and a good distance at that - past his outside edge. Unplayable!
"good length, outside off, leaves it and <strong>that's lunch</strong>"
"climbs up above his bat, which is why even though he's in good position to flick behind square leg, he's struck on the thigh pad"

"pitches it up, looking for the drive outside off, Nicholls leaves"
"<strong>top edge, goes straight up, the keeper can't get there</strong>. Surprise bouncer from Joseph. And it could so easily have been a successful one too. Nicholls goes for the pull. He's too late on the shot. Da Silva is quick off the blocks, running to his right, towards where square leg would've been to try and take the catch. Doesn't happen"

"fullish, slanting away from off stump, inviting the drive but Nicholls doesn't oblige"
"ooh, that's slanting across, and then it just begins to straighten towards off stump. Not sure if that was a misjudgment or a leave on length - either way it doesn't miss the top of off by much"
"driven. This one's just a touch too full, on off stump, and Nicholls puts it away down the ground, straight of mid-off. Not much foot movement, but there didn't need to be much"
"that's a snorter. Bouncer climbing over middle and off, not getting up too steeply either, and Nicholls does well to sway backwards and get under it"
"length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"length ball, too wide of off stump to make Young play"
"once again, a wide-ish length ball, and Young is happy to leave"

"fullish, angling across to off stump, blocked back down the wicket"
"full outside off, and Nicholls squats down low and extends his arms through a crisp drive to the right of extra-cover. Was playing a little away from his body, but it was full enough to be able to do so safely"
"back of a length, tucked off the hip to fine leg"
"short, sits up at stomach height, pulled away to the backward square leg boundary"
"this is a better short ball, climbing over the back shoulder, and Nicholls pulls it along the ground to deep square leg without looking in complete control"
"bouncer in the corridor, sinks down to his knees and leaves it alone, keeping his eyes on the ball right through"
"the full ball to follow, but a touch too straight, clipped off the pads to fine leg"
"length ball on leg stump, and Nicholls flicks in the air and into the hip of the short leg fielder, who grabs at it with both hands but the ball doesn't stick. <strong>Would be harsh to call it a drop</strong> from Shamarh Brooks"
"length ball on middle and leg, clipped into the on side"
"length ball in the corridor, left alone"
"length ball, slightly wider, left alone"
"a bit of inward movement. Length ball angling in towards off stump, and Nicholls gets forward and looks to work it leg side. Off the pad into the backward square leg region, but it struck him outside the line"

"<strong>loose drive, edged away for four!</strong> Not full enough to drive, fairly wide of off, and he goes hard at it, with an angled bat, and the ball flies in the air but wide of second slip. No third slip, but I think it would have bisected that fielder and gully too"
"length ball outside off, angling in from wide of the crease, left alone"
"good leave. Again he angles it in from wide of the crease, but Nicholls gets across his stumps and judges the line well"

"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"length ball, wide of off stump, easy leave for Nicholls"
"<strong>peach</strong>. Full, angling in towards off stump, and this looks like late outswing rather than seam, and the ball beats the outside edge as Young pushes hard at it, looking to drive through mid-off"
"length ball, draws him forward to defend, and the extra bounce hits the shoulder of his bat and falls into the point region"
"back of a length close to off stump, left alone"
"past the outside edge again! Young gets into trouble with that firmly planted front foot. Ends up pushing well in front of his body to defend, and the ball straightens to miss his edge"

"full, angling across to off stump. Aims to drive through cover, ends up jabbing it back to the bowler off the inside half of the bat"
"big appeal for lbw as Nicholls shoulders arms to one that straightens into him, but it isn't given. They don't review either, with Jason Holder indicating the ball would probably have bounced over the stumps. Not sure if it pitched in line either"

"Nicholls continues his uneasy tussle with the short ball. This one gets up around his front shoulder, and he hooks it towards long leg, where Jermaine Blackwood would have had a simple catch had he stayed on the edge of the boundary. He's a few yards in, however, and the ball soars over his head and just over the rope. <strong>Big missed opportunity</strong>."

"back of a length, straightens a little in the corridor, rides the bounce, lets it come on, and defends with soft hands into the pitch"
"short, rising ball in the corridor, Young pulls his bat and gloves out of the way"
"extra bounce. Length ball on an off-stumpish line, and he's half-forward to defend, and ends up getting <strong>smacked on the glove</strong>, looks like the right thumb. The ball runs away safely along the ground towards second slip"
"back of a length, slanting away from off stump, left alone"
"full on off stump, jabbed back to the bowler"
"another short ball, another not-in-control shot, but Nicholls, once again, will live to fight another day. This one's slanting away from him, and he has to drag his pull from well outside off. Ends up toe-ending it over the bowler, and mid-on has to run to his right and towards the boundary to chase it"
"short again, smacks Nicholls on the body after straightening into him. Not sure what his initial intent was, but the movement left him a sitting duck, and he pretty much just let the ball hit his body without offering a stroke"
"shortish, at the hip, hops to ride the bounce and keep it down into the on side"
"short on off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
"back of a length and, oddly, down leg side. He's been a lot more accurate than this"
"<strong>outstanding shot</strong>. He's very good on the leg side, and here the ball doesn't even ask him to move his feet. He can just lean over the half-volley and whip it to the midwicket boundary"
recovers well with a good length ball that is left alone outside the off stump
"hammers it in front of square. Holder doesn't quite have the pace to worry Nicholls, even though he hasn't quite looked at his best against that length today. Good pull shot into the gap for two"
"good ball, better shot. It's pitched up on middle. It's asking the batsman to come forward and Nicholls does. A strong stride and a firm block"
too wide outside off to interest the batsman. That's a very ordinary over from a bowler who will be talked about for years to come
rather smartly turns a full ball on middle and leg through midwicket.
"<strong>beats him</strong> on the angle, as he hits a good length, traps him in his crease, makes him thrust his hands out at the ball, which then flies past the outside edge"
"full on middle, he works it to mid-on"
good length but a little too far outside off to draw the batsman into a shot
"very full, very wide, no shot. Potential sucker ball embarrassment avoided."
"appeal for caught behind but umpire Broan says no. Holder considers his options and then says nope. It was just a good ball. It really was. Gabriel bent his back and banged it in and it absolutely took off. Nicholls is slow to react. By the time he reads the shorter length early and sets up for a cut, the extra pace and bounce on it turns him into a sitting duck"
<strong>inside edge past leg stump!</strong>. Young is late on his block and the back of a length ball that gains a little more bounce off this very helpful pitch skids onto his blade and then away to fine leg
goes very very full on off stump and has Nicholls in some discomfort as he defends
"shortish and on off stump, defends"
gets forward to defend a fuller ball outside off
"looks for the yorker again, but since it's on leg stump, Nicholls is able to flick it away to deep square leg."
"<strong>nips back and hits him!</strong>. For a second, Nicholls thinks he'll be able to get behind this back of a length ball angled into him. Then the seam movement beats his inside edge and peppers him instead"
"<strong>sharp movement into the right-hander</strong>, who keeps his gloves out of play and just takes it on the back."
"<strong>dropped by second slip!</strong> Oh Gabriel! He has bowled his heart out today. Very few of his overs have been comfortable for the batsman facing him. And here he is taking the edge with a delicious delivery. Back of a length, angling across, making him play and poof, Darren Bravo drops a regulation grab"
pushes away from his body at a shortish ball outside off for no runs into the covers.
"half an appeal, for an lbw, but that's too high. Gabriel testing the inside edge this time as he gets one to straighten at Nicholls, who is stuck in the crease, thanks to a mix of pace, bounce and uncomfortable lengths"
""
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"shortish and outside off, shoulders arms"
gets forward and defends a fuller delivery that straightens on off stump
"leans into a lovely square drive, but can't beat point"
"neither batsman is backing off the short ball. Young sees this one and pulls behind square leg. Not fully in control, but still good enough for two."
"back of a length and outside off, doesn't fancy playing it"
nudges a very full ball outside off through straight midwicket
"<strong>superb catch by second slip</strong>! And it's the captain himself, showin em all how it's done. The outside edge is flying to him. It's also dying. He needs to move to his right. He needs to do it quickly. It's almost reflex. He sticks out one hand. It sticks. <strong>And Gabriel, in his 50th Test has his 150th wicket</strong>. What a spell he's bowled today. He's demanded batsmen to play virtually every ball and he's got seam movement away from them them virtually every ball and that's why he keeps being a wicket-taking threat"
"<strong>ooh, he's looking to hit square leg and the ball wanders into the off side</strong>. That's a consequence of him getting into the shot too early and being turned around by some away movement"
rises up with the short ball outside off and dabs to gully

drives a pitched up ball on off stump to mid-on
"outside edge, but he makes sure it goes straight to ground. Holder is slowly getting into rhythm, keeping the length full and finding late movement away"
"back of a length on middle, Nicholls defends"
<strong>has him driving and beats the edge</strong>. Oh that is so close. The length is deliciously full. No one can call themselves a batsman and not want to drive at this. Holder is banking on that because he's tipped this to move away and move away it does. Special stuff
"<strong>dropped by first slip</strong>. But it is Holder after having taken a blinder who swerves into Bravo's line of sight and puts him off. A replay of the last delivery, only this time, Nicholls catches up with the full ball moving just enough away to claim a genuine outside edge. Poor Holder. He's running into the wind and these drops will hurt even more because of that"
"short and outside off, he looks for the cut, it's a scoring option, but the extra bounce beats him"
"short ball, outside off, sways away"

"blocks a good length ball on and around off stump into the covers and pinches a good, quick single"
"<strong>that's fifty</strong>, his first in 14 innings, his first since a hundred against Bangladesh in 2019. Gets there with a comfortable flick through midwicket. He's battled hard. He's been dropped as well. Now he needs to go on and go big"
"shortish and on off stump, defends"
<strong>lovely drive</strong>. Watling likes to say he doesn't have too many shots. But this is one he's very very good at. The punch down the ground. He gets the opportunity to show it off with a half-volley on off stump from Holder.

"<strong>hammers it past point</strong>. That's a poor ball. It doesn't even matter that the follow-up to beating a batsman should be better. Everything about this ball needs to be better. Too short, too wide, too easy"
"fullish on off stump, defends"
cramps him with a shortish delivery on middle and leg
"<strong>picks the gap at square leg</strong>. He waits for it. That's key. It's a poor ball on leg stump, but by making sure he waits for it, he is in perfect position to flick it away. Head over the ball, wrists rolling on top, outstanding"
bouncer a shade outside off. Lets it go
"back of a length and outside off, pushes into the covers"
"<strong>ooh, that's rare</strong. Watling goes after a ball that isn't supposed to be gone after. It's short, yes, but it's too close for the cut and Joseph gets extra bounce to beat his top edge"

"back of a length, angling into leg stump, clipped towards midwicket"
"full on off stump, and that's sweet from Watling, just a front-foot push with the straightest of bats, and there's no one at mid-off to stop this. West Indies have opted to give Joseph a short extra-cover instead"
"shot! That's not a short ball, and probably not even short of a length, and it's probably only just missing the top of off stump, but he just stays leg-side of it and chops it away backward of point"
"digs in the bouncer now, and Watling barely needs to duck to get under it"
"back of a length, and this one <strong>nips in off the seam</strong> to hit Watling on the back thigh after beating his inside edge as he looks to defend into the on side"

"back of a length on off stump, defended to midwicket. Shades of Kane Williamson in how he looked while doing so"

"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"big appeal for a caught-behind down the leg side, and Holder thinks long and hard before reviewing the not-out decision just as his time is about to run out. Shortish, at the hip, and he looks to tuck it away. Not sure from just the slomo replays alone whether it hit his glove or his thigh pad or both or neither. <strong>There's no Ultra-Edge</strong>, because a throw earlier took out the stump mic, so the third umpire has no option but to stay with the on-field decision. West Indies don't lose their review, though"

goes back to defend a flighted delivery outside off stump

"yorker on middle, but Mitchell is solidly behind it"
"<strong>smooth drive</strong> through the covers. And it's made by a good stride forward, his weight leaning into the shot, his head right over the ball. And then it's all a matter of putting bat to ball. Signs that Gabriel is clearly tiring now. He's been their spearhead all day today, but he's not had enough support, especially from his fielders"

opens the face to a ball slightly wider outside off to find a single through point
"<strong>gets into the nineties</strong> with a thumping on drive. He shimmies down a little to get right to the pitch of the ball from round the wicket, and that angle into him is what draws out his aggression. That and the fact that spin on day one of this pitch is virtually toothless"

gets down the pitch to work a good length ball outside off to mid-on
"<strong>dropped</strong> by slip. It's a tough chance, ballooning to him after Mitchell goes for a reverse sweep. Holder is, at first, moving to his right to cover the shot if it comes off the middle of the bat. It doesn't, so he has to move in the other direction, reaches out his left hand, it pops right out of it"

But it holds in the pitch, takes his leading edge and bounces away through point. It's been a chancy innings. It's been a gusty innings. And that shot perhaps sums it all up. On a pitch as difficult as this, you take your runs any way they come"

"<strong>pins him lbw but Mitchell wants to review</strong>. This looks straight though. It is a very full ball that the batsman plays all around, while stuck deep in his crease. Certain to be plumb. Ultra-Edge confirms there is no bat and Ball-tracking sends him on his way. Crashing into leg stump. Just rewards for a remarkable young bowler and perhaps that will lift the West Indies out of their slumber. They've played well. They can't let this last hour dictate the rest of this game."
"gets across his stumps to access the gap at midiwcket, knowing full well that Holder will hit back of a length and slant the ball outside off"

works it off his pads to long leg
"too straight, too short, too easy. Nicholls is able to knock it down to the fine leg boundary with barely any effort. Holder has had a shocker today. He's fronted up time and time again but he's never been able to hit the lengths that can trouble batsmen here on this pitch. He's been too short."

"length ball, some width on this occasion, carved away to deep point"

"length ball on off stump, swept along the floor to long leg"
"gone, Chase ends Nicholls' long innings. Tosses it up outside off and he goes hard at the drive, but can't keep it down, and short extra-cover takes a sharp catch. Kraigg Brathwaite the fielder, throwing himself low to his left. A packed Basin Reserve rises to applaud his innings"
"starts with a six. Of course he does. Tossed up wide of off, and Boult walks out of his crease and clobbers it over the wide long-on boundary. It wasn't perfectly middled, and deep midwicket almost got to it, but it fell just far enough to his left, and just far enough over the rope"
now he makes room to stab a good-length off-stump ball to backward point
"another super catch, this time from Brooks, to end the innings. Tossed up, and Boult flicks uppishly. Brooks does the rest at midwicket, diving to his left once again"
"back of a length, down the leg side, Brathwaite doesn't make any attempt to play a shot"
"once again, back of a length and down leg. Brathwaite pulls his bat away from the line"
"fullish outswinger, too far outside off to make Brathwaite play"
"length ball, in the corridor outside off. Not as much swing on this occasion, and Brathwaite leaves again"
"length ball curling late, away from a tight off-stump line. Brathwaite defends off the back foot, and gets an edge, but plays with soft hands and the ball rolls down towards gully"
"fuller now, outside off, left alone. Only one ball in that over made Brathwaite play, with Southee not quite finding his rhythm yet"
"back of a length, close to off stump, lets it come on and defends towards point"
"<strong>loose shot</strong>. Length ball swinging away in the fifth-stump channel. No feet, just throws his hands at a big, flourishing drive, and he's lucky not to edge it"
"big <strong>appeal for caught behind</strong> as he defends from the crease, not given. Boult isn't interested in reviewing. This was much closer to off stump in line, and shaped away late as he squared up in defence. Back thigh, I think. No bat at all"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"back of a length close to off stump, gets on his toes and taps down on top of the bounce to play it towards cover"

"length ball on off stump, stays back and defends into the on side"
"gone, it doesn't take long for Southee to hit the perfect spot. The line is so tight around off stump, and the length is impeccable. Brathwaite is never one for a big front-foot stride, just squares up as it swings away late, and he edges his defensive jab into the lap of Ross Taylor at first slip"
"nicely bowled. Fullish, angling into the corridor outside off, a hint of inward shape. Left alone"
"ooh, beauty. Again that fullish length, inviting the drive, but the initial line is closer to off stump and Bravo can't leave, because of the possibility of swing into him. It doesn't, and it slides past the outside edge of his drive. Could have played closer to his body"
"big appeal for lbw as Bravo falls over a flick as Southee goes full and straight. Not out is the decision, and New Zealand are happy not to challenge it. Thick inside edge, thanks to the swing into the left-hander"
"once again, full, swinging in towards middle and off. This time Bravo keeps his front pad out of the way and defends into the off side"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"huge shouts from behind the wicket for caught-behind, nothing from the bowler. Back of a length, angling into Campbell and curling away late as he tries to defend without moving his feet"
"once again that away swerve from close to off stump, from just back of a length. This time he doesn't play at it"
"back of a length, looks to go straighter with his line. Straightens towards leg stump, and Campbell plays it down on top of the bounce, towards midwicket"
"full, close to off stump, and Campbell pounces on the scoring opportunity, opening his bat face and squeezing a push past backward point's dive to his left. <strong>First runs for West Indies</strong>."
"on the fuller side of a good length, sixth-stump line, swinging away again. Boult checks whether Bravo wants to drive, but he wisely chooses not to"
"a touch too straight as Southee looks for the lbw ball again. Swings in, but starts around middle stump and swings towards leg. Inside-edged flick onto pad, and then down to the fine leg boundary"
"length ball curling in towards off stump, defended into the covers"
"this one just keeps going with the angle away from the left-hander. Lovely length, full but not a half-volley. Campbell isn't drawn into the drive"
"slanting across to off stump, straightening back just a touch. Gets forward and defends solidly"
"full, pitching just outside off and continuing with the angle away, left alone"
"full, slanting across to pitch on off stump. Good forward stride to get close to the pitch and defend with soft hands. The ball rolls away between gully and backward point"
"edged, but safely. Again the stock Boult delivery to left-handers. Just short of a length, tight on off stump, swinging away. Squares up a little while defending, but he plays with soft hands, and the ball drops short of second slip and squeezes away through a gap in the cordon"
"fuller, wider, left alone"
"full, straightening towards off stump. Gets his front leg out of the way and defends into the off side"
"shortish, angling into the hip. Looks to work it away through square leg, but ends up inside-edging into the pitch"

"full, swings in towards middle stump. Makes sure he doesn't get his front pad too far across, and clips to midwicket"

"length ball continuing with the angle away from the left-hander, left alone"

"full on middle and off, clipped with the swing to midwicket"
"full, swinging away from off stump, Campbell plays a checked drive to mid-off"
"not quite the length to pull. Back of a length, no swing, goes on with the angle towards the thigh pad. Misses the pull but picks up a leg bye down to backward square leg"
"length ball straightening towards off stump. Looks to play the initial angle, closes his bat face early, and squares up. Swings and bounces a little more than expected, and it's past the outside edge and into the batsman's chest"
"back of a length, curling away in the corridor, Bravo is squared up in defence, but he plays close to the body and <strong>lets himself be beaten</strong>"
"yorker close to off stump, jams down and stabs it into the off side"
"length ball outside off, swinging further away, a rare straightforward leave"
"back of a length, slanting across to off stump, gets nicely behind it and defends into the covers"
"big lbw appeal from behind the stumps, nothing from the bowler, because he knows it's bounced too high. Swings back into Campbell and spits up from a length to <strong>smack him in the groin</strong>, leaving him winded and on the floor. The delivery took him completely by surprise, and he had no time to bring his bat down. The physio is out to attend to Campbell. It's a particularly painful blow because a: this is a quick pitch, and b: there was no bat along the way to slow it down"
"full, too straight to win the lbw. Swings into Campbell to beat the flick and hit his front leg, but it's swinging quite a long way down the leg side"
"there's the swing again, and this time from a good length. Only misses off stump by a few inches after Campbell leaves, trusting the angle and the bounce"
"this one continues with the angle across Campbell, and he leaves it again"
"in the blockhole on off stump, jams his bat down and keeps it out"
"length ball straightening towards off stump, defended into the on side"
"too full, but still a testing delivery, swinging from leg to middle. Makes sure he doesn't go too hard with the flick, plays a controlled clip to midwicket"
"length ball swinging away in the fifth-stump channel, left alone"
"<strong>beauty</strong>. Length ball, fourth-stump line, forces Bravo to play a defensive shot without being able to get fully forward, and swings it past his outside edge"
"only slightly wider, Bravo watches it well and leaves it alone"
"looks to swing it from a straighter line, ends up firing it down the leg side"
"full, looking for the one that swings back towards off stump. Overpitches slightly, and Campbell gets forward to drive between the non-striker and mid-off. Quite a bit of bottom hand in the shot"
"length ball, slanting across Campbell, left alone"
"well played. Good stride forward to get to the pitch of this full one close to off stump, and he looks for placement over power, and plays a checked drive to the right of mid-off"
"length ball slanting across Bravo, and he shuffles back and across to defend into the covers"
"length ball, pitching on off stump and continuing with the angle away, left alone"
"gone, Southee strikes again, Bravo's popped one straight back. Full, curving in late towards off stump. Goes for the drive and then checks himself right at the end. Wanted to play that towards mid-off, but the swing makes him check his shot, and the ball pops back to Southee off the inside half of the bat. Great reflexes to grab it with both hands in his folllow-through, to his right. Bravo stays at the crease for a few seconds, either in disbelief or in the belief that it was a bump ball. It wasn't"
"length ball close to off stump, presses half-forward and defends with an open face, with the swing, square on the off side"
"shortish, and Campbell goes for the pull, but the ball doesn't quite come on. Through his shot too early and the ball smacks him on the body, not sure exactly where. Oh, back thigh, not far from where Southee struck him earlier"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, swinging away further. Good leave from Campbell"

"<strong>third time, he gets his man!</strong> Don't need the umpire's approval this time. Full on off, and he looks to drive, but it takes the outside edge and Latham at second slip moves to his left to complete the catch. All action in Jamieson's over so far. Campbell's painful stay ends"
"<strong>first-ball duck!</strong> This over just gets better! Literally no movement from Chase. An attempted yorker that lands around the crease. Chase does not move his feet, and the ball moves into him - in the air - and crashes into the stumps. Chase's bat is nowhere near the ball too. <B>On a hattrick</b>"
"<strong>Everyone goes for the lbw appeal but not given! Latham reviews</strong> This was another yorker coming in, hits his front leg in front of leg stump, but probably going down the leg. Too much swing, and the replays confirm it. New Zealand lose a review, and Jamieson just misses out on a hat-trick"
"<strong>they all appeal for the lbw again! Turned down, and Latham reviews one more time!</strong> This was a full toss, not what he was going for. Ball straightened in the air, and hit his back leg in front of middle. Surely this is out? No involvement of the bat, and it's <B>umpire's call on the review.</b> Ball tracking says it's clipping leg stump, not good enough to change the decision"

"full outswinger on off stump, gets behind it nicely to block to mid-on"
"got him, that's a great catch from Watling, or so New Zealand think, but the umpire says not out. <strong>Reviewed</strong>. Did it clip the edge, or was it thigh pad? Beautiful delivery from Southee, who's been bowling outswing all over but mixing up his angles so cleverly. Length ball, delivered from fairly close to the stumps, angling into off and middle and then curving away. Looks to work it with the angle, from the crease, and the ball is past his outside edge and brushes his back thigh on the way to Watling, who dives right to complete the low take. No bat. Terrific decision from Chris Brown"

"big lbw appeal as Wagner hits the back pad with one that keeps going with the angle. Not given - was that missing off stump? Brooks was playing for swing, looking to flick the length ball, and it went past the closed face and hit him in front of middle stump. Pitched just in line with leg stump, and ball-tracking suggests it's hitting the off bail. Wow. <strong>New Zealand chose not to review</strong>. Pitched juuuust in line with leg stump, so you can see why Chris Gaffaney gave Brooks the benefit of the doubt"

"length ball slanting away from off stump, left alone"
"back of a length, down leg, Campbell can't connect with the flick off the hip"

"full, a bit of swing back towards middle stump. Keeps that front pad out of the way and defends into the on side, meeting the ball under his eyes"
"full again, the line is more off-stumpish this time. Defended into the covers, nice and compact again"
"full, slanting away from off stump, and Brooks gets down low to pick up his third square-driven boundary in Wagner's last two overs. Just eases it into the gap to the right of point"
"got him, Wagner's really fired up now. Superb length, and all those drives have made Brooks play at one he needn't have, though the line may have forced him to. Length ball that slants across the right-hander, with extra bounce in the corridor. Comes forward to defend, and the ball kisses the outside shoulder of his bat through to Watling, who tumbles to his right to take a sharp, catch above chest high"

"fuller, wider, trying to tempt him into a drive away from the body. Campbell resists and shoulders arms"
"big inswinger, produces a massive lbw shout as Chase looks to drive down the ground and plays outside the line. Great decision from Gaffaney, this one was bouncing over the top of the stumps.

"last ball single, will keep strike on 49. Back of a length, outside off, and a quick drop and run with Chemar Holder responding quickly"
"has a chance for a single, but says no, perhaps to protect the debutant No. 10 from Boult"
"full, just outside off, and meets it with a defensive shot on the front foot"
"good length outside off, and he pokes poorly at it...good thing he didn't get an edge to the keeper"
"fullish, outside off and he presses forward to defend"
"full and wide, he has to reach wide to meet the ball. Defended back towards the bowler"
"can't take the single! Plays out a maiden, stays on 49. Good length on off and pushes him to defend off the back foot to cover"
"good length outside off, and he defends off the back foot, but takes the edge, and runs through the gap between second slip and gully"
"length ball on off, and he unconventionally shoulders his arms, by opening up from the side on stance. Ball goes just over off stump"
"fullish outside off, and swings away to Watling"
"full just outside off, and he shoulders his arms. Ball goes past off stump, but it wasn't too far away"
"full on off, and he pushes this with soft hands, ensuring it falls just short of the short mid on fielder operating near the non striker"
"full on off, and blocked firmly"
"full outside off, and he presses forward to defend. A bit wide... he doesn't need to play at those though"
"full on off, and he gets in front of the stumps before defending"
"full from around the stumps, lands outside off and he wants to defend. Inside-edged onto his pads"
"back of a length outside off, and he drops this with soft hands on the leg side and off they go for the single. <B>Fifty on debut for da Silva</b> and the WI camp in the pavillion applaud his effort"
"good length outside off, and he shoulders his arms"
"full on off. Movement into him. Defended towards the leg side, via his pads"
"starts with a full, floaty ball outside off, and da Silva just whacks it down the ground, straight of mid-on. Not a drive, more a big, booming hit"
"too full again, outside off, and Latham dives right at short extra-cover to stop a firm da Silva drive"
"short, wide, slapped to the right of deep point"
"floaty full-toss wide of off, driven to the right of deep point"
"full again, outside off, driven into the covers"
"full on off stump, driven to the squarer of the two cover fielders"
"back of a length down leg, can't connect with the flick off the hip. Looks like Wagner's overstepped"
"length ball on off stump, lets it come and defends to short extra-cover"
"full, beaten on the flick, and Chris Brown upholds the lbw shout without any hesitation. Da Silva has reviewed with even less hesitation. Looks like it might have pitched outside leg... No inside edge there, just straightened past the bat. And it's a cracking decision from Brown, who's had an incredible debut Test. Ends another debut Test, though. It pitched just inside the line of leg stump, and was straightening to hit a good part of leg stump as per ball tracking"
"full on leg and he steps forward to defend. Hits the back leg, but probably too high. They appeal but umpire Brown is unmoved. B>Replays show that's hitting the stumps</b>"
"full on middle, and he wants to go up and over. Mistimed to midwicket"
"yorker on leg, and it hits his leg, but the lbw appeal is turned down. <"

low full toss and he toe-ends a straight drive over the bowler's head!
"full outside off, and he flat-bats a shot past the bowler's left, and mid off can't stop it either!"
"bouncer on middle, and he swiftly ducks. The keeper has a hard time taking the grab in one take"
"short ball on middle, and he makes room to slap it leg side. Misses"
"length ball on off, and he opens the bat's face to guide a shot to deep point"
"<B>appeal for lbw turned down, and NZ review</b> This was a full ball on middle and leg, hitting Gabriel flush on the boot in front leg stump. Was it swinging in too much? Yes...missing leg stump"
<B>game over!</b> Yorker on the stumps. Gabriel has a swing. Ball crashes into middle. <B>New Zealand win by an innings</b>
