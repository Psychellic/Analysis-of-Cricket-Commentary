"length, wide outside off, swinging away, and he leaves"
"length, outside off, and he goes for the pull. That's gone in the air off a massive top edge, and Mujeeb ur Rahman goes across from short fine leg, and takes a fine catch! Had to travel a long distance to his left and got there ahead of the keeper, and held on to it despite this going over his left shoulder. Perfect start for Heat"
"length, down the leg side, and called a wide"
"a bit fuller, just around off, and he defends towards cover"
"length, around off, decent pace at <strong>137.8 kph</strong>, and he defends to cover"
"length again, defended towards cover yet again"
"backs away and slashes a length ball around off towards third man. Wide of Mujeeb, who has to run across to his right and field"
"top ball to start with! On a good length, wide outside off, and then jagging away after slanting in from wide of the crease. Went at good pace and carry through to the keeper, as Ferguson had a little nibble but missed"
"a little shimmy across the stumps, and then works this through mid-wicket. Superb timing on this, and that will beat the deep square leg fielder chasing it"
crunches one to cover point
"back of a length, around off, and he looks to work it away on the leg side, but can only drop it to the bowler's right"
"length, honing in around off, and he taps this with soft hands towards gully and picks up a quick single"
"good pace, back of a length, slanting into him, and he works it with the angle towards midwicket"
"fuller, straighter, and he looks to swipe this away on the on side. Just off the inside edge, and drops on the leg side"
"superb shot from Hales. Just seemed like he was eager to shuffle around a bit, and Bartlett threw this a touch wider. Hales just stood stable, and then clattered this through point"
"lofts a length ball towards long-on. Burns and Steketee go chasing after this, and Burns nearly gets there, but just cannot reel it back in"
"length, driven towards cover. Wide enough of the fielder to enable a quick single"
"length, and he walks across and works this off his pads towards deep square leg"
"Hales clears his front leg, and flogs this straight down the ground. Good swing of the bat, and it sails over the long-off fence"
backs away and whacks a length ball around off through the point region
"driven towards point, but goes too quickly for any runs to be picked"
"opens the face of the bat, but cannot beat point"
"slower ball, played towards point yet again"
"slower, outside off, and he swings this away towards deep square leg"
"Hales gets across to his right and whips this away towards long leg. Kuhnemann is the fielder at deep square, who gets across to his right and cuts this off"
"this is straight, and Ferguson shuffles across to sweep, and gets struck on the pads. Loud appeal, but probably saved by a big stride forward"
worked against the spin towards long-on
"length, a bit on the pads, and he can work this away towards deep mid-wicket"
"looks for the sweep again, and it goes off the top edge, and eludes slip and keeper. Runs away towards third man but is pulled up ahead of the boundary"
"beautifully played. Allows this to slant in to him, goes back in the crease, and runs it down between slip and short third man. Big chase, and it doesn't get to the boundary"
"quicker, straighter, and he drives this back to the right of Mujeeb"
"back of a length, hint of seam movement back in from outside off, and defended"
"looks for a big pull, but under-edges it. Rolls to the right of square leg and they can take a single"
"short, and he waits on this and places it between wide long-on and deep square leg"
"dug in short, and he has a good look at this, before letting it pass through"
"a bit of width, and he slashes hard, and it <strong>rockets away</strong> to the backward point fence"
whips one around off towrads deep square leg
"cutter, outside off, and he fails to get any purchase on an intended dunk down the ground"
backs away and slashes this through point. That's the third such shot that Ferguson has played already in a short innings. Made easier because he pre-empted a slower ball
"drives hard, but cannot beat cover. A half-stop and that allows them to go through for one"
"a bit short, and Hales this time clears his front leg and slashes this through point. Aerial, but past a fine fielder in that position, and good enough legs to beat the man in the deep"
"short, and he looks to hook, but is beaten by the pace on this"
"slower, back of a length, and he is able to biff this towards cover, just a touch wide of the man there"
"fullish, on the pads, and he works this away towards deep square leg"
"length, cut away towards point. The fielder is deep enough to allow a single"
"backs away and plays an inside out shot to a length ball. Off the edge, but lands short of sweeper cover"
"fuller, driven towards wide mid-on"
"down the wicket he comes, and tonks this over long-on. Not much wrong the bowler did, because this was destined to go all the way once Hales made contact"
"backs away on the on side, and Kuhnemann follows him with a flatter delivery. He is able to place it to the right of the bowler"
"length, slower through the air, and Hales is through with an attempted swipe across the line before the ball arrives. Down the leg side, and ends up going between the batsman and the stumps"
"tossed up a touch wider, and he slashes this in the air, just a few bounces ahead of a man at deep point"
"short of a length, and he rocks back to swing this towards deep mid-wicket"
"swiped in the air, and deep square leg gets across to the ball, but is far too close to the boundary. Had a chance to relay it to the man at deep mid-wicket, right alongside, but just cannot execute it properly"
"short, loopy outside off, and Hales looks to cut, but <strong>cannot keep this down</strong>! Deep point has an easy grab, and Mujeeb's face lights up with a smile. Happy to make up for the previous ball, where he thought he'd done enough to get a false shot out of Hales"
"length, and he stretches forward to defend one around off"
"length, around off, driven hard but straight to cover"
"slower, around off, and he goes back to whip this towards deep square leg"
"short ball, and he looks to go across the line but misses. Beaten by the pace"
"that's a good ball. Billings advances down the wicket, and it seams away after pitching, and beats him through to Pierson"
"plays this with soft hands towards deep mid-wicket. The bowler goes chasing after this, and they should be able to come back for the second"
"length, played to the right of cover, and they go through for a quick single"
"length, driven to the right of cover for a single"
"short, just outside off, and he cuts this into the ground, and they go through for a single before Pierson can come across to his right and stop this"
"length, worked away on the on side towards mid-wicket"
"driven hard through the covers, and the sweeper has to scramble to save this"
"wide of off, and he has to squat to cut this away towards the deep point area"
"<strong>what a shot!</strong> It's a length ball, nothing wrong with it as such, but try saying that to Billings. He sets himself up, gets low down in his stance and whips this away dismissively over mid-wicket, and it travels all the way into the top tier of seats. Massive hit from Billings, who seems to be feeling it tonight"
"quicker from Mujeeb, and driven back towards the bowler"
"length, quicker through the air, and turning back into him, and he has to defend this"
"looks to whip one away, but beaten by a quicker ball. Inside edge, but on to pad"
"swings one around the corner, but cannot get a good enough hold of this. Mid-wicket is standing about three-quarters of the way in from the fence, and that has come in quite nicely to him"
"length, off the leading edge as Billings looks to drive down the ground. Runs away towards point and they can pick up a single"
"length, but just drifts down the elg side. Will have to bowl this again"
"closer to off, and defended towards cover. Wasn't entirely sure of which way this might turn, and hence decided to play it with the full face of the bat"
"length, driven to cover"
drops this with a dead bat and sets off for a quick single
"length, and he has gone across the line on this, and is gobbled up at deep square leg. Perhaps went a bit early, without getting his eye in, especially against Steketee. Good pace and bounce on that, and a smart catch by Wildermuth as well to complete the loop"
"length, wide outside off, and goes through without any contact as he has a swipe at that"
"closer to him, length ball, and he has dropped this towards point and pinched a single"
"extra bounce from a short-ish length, and he is able to get it away towards short mid-wicket, rising with the ball as he shapes to defend"
"fuller length, and he drives this towards cover. Good diving stop to his right by the man stationed there"
"down the wicket, and works this off the pads towards deep mid-wicket. Thinks of two, but the man has run in quickly to extinguish any such hopes"
"length, driven towards long-on"
"pulls out the reverse sweep, and nails it! Mujeeb's length has been predictable, and that allows him to just stretch out and meet it well ahead of the crease. Not too bothered about the spin then"
"<strong>this could be trouble for Billings!</strong> Length ball, a touch wide of him, and he looks to drive while moving forward. Ends up driving it back to Mujeeb, who has it to Pierson in a flash. <strong>And a dive cannot save Billings!</strong> Superb stuff from Mujeeb, who has virtually been involved in everything good that the Heat have done today"
"length, a bit of movement away after pitching, and he drives to cover"
"fuller, driven to short mid-wicket"
"fullish, and Sams looks to whip this away. Beaten by the pace, but the line and height make it in the batsman's favour, as Bartlett appeals"
works this off his pads towards deep fine leg
worked off his pads again towards deep backward square. Needs some hard running to get back for the second
drives towards long-off
"fuller, straighter, and he works this down the ground to long-on"
"cutter, on the pads, and he whips this past Lynn at short fine leg. Lynn puts in a dive to his left but cannot get anything on it"
"back of a length, and he runs this towards short third man. Mujeeb misfields, and that allows them to pinch one"
"banged in short, and he goes to the back foot and plays this towards deep mid-wicket"
"slower ball, runs this towards third man, and Mujeeb dives away to his right to cut this off"
"that's <strong>gone on to his helmet</strong>. Shorter from Wildermuth, and he was looking to pull this away. He's missed it completely, and ended up getting struck on the back of the helmet, as he was backing away. Will need a quick concussion check, and possibly a change of helmet as well?"
"back of a length, punched towards cover. They go for a quick single, and the man at cover is quick to swoop to his right, and have a shy at the non-striker's end. He hasn't hit, though"
"short of a length, and he looks to play this towards third man. Gets into a bit of a tangle in the air, as the ball goes through to Pierson above shoulder height. Chat between batsman and bowler. Fiesty stuff!"
"slower ball, around off, and he looks to go down the ground. A hand comes off, and it skews towards long-on"
"slower again, and he fetches this towards mid-wicket, with one hand coming off. Just a single for his troubles"
"length ball, a bit of width, and he smacks this through extra cover. Got good height, but not enough distance to go all the way for six"
"fuller, and he has whipped this through <strong>mid-wicket for a flat six</strong>!"
"good pace, fuller length, around his body and forces him to defend this back towards the bowler"
"<strong>quite a unique shot!</strong> He knows the lines won't allow him much room, and so he backs away, and with a fuller length delivery, has to go really low to whack this inside out. Off balance, and as a result, the ball trundles towards the extra cover boundary, before being reeled back in"
backs away within the crease and slaps a short of a length ball over long-off. Massive power generated from a stable base!
"<strong>artistic!</strong> Gregory comes around the wicket, and looks to cramp him for room with the line, but Sams simply moves across the crease, and plays a lofted straight drive to long-off"
"the angle across him works, and Mujeeb takes another catch at short third man! More pace on this, and a good line, that forces Sams to go across the line as he attempts to get it down towards square leg. Off the edge, and Mujeeb takes this without much discomfort"
"length, driven on the up. Very good, in fact, as he clears long-off"
"fuller, across him, and he plays a lovely drive, but travels very fast to mid-off"
"bad ball, and punished. From around the wicket, and with fine leg inside the circle, you are better served not straying on to the pads, and that's what Gregory does. Cutting just helps it along, making sure he places it to the left of short fine leg"
"length, cut hard, half-stopped at point"
"fullish length, but not full enough, and he whirrs his arms into action, and is able to whip this through the mid-wicket region. Goes a long way, just about clearing the two outfielders converging on that"
"short, slapped away towards mid-wicket"
"backs away and tries to slap him down the ground. Top edge, and it flies just short of long-off. Joe Burns comes running in, and takes a smart diving catch ahead of him"
"length, around off, and he looks to drive this through extra cover. Goes in the air, and Bazley comes running in from deep point. <strong>Dives forward, but cannot hold on to this</strong>. Would have been a great catch had he held on"
driven down the ground to long-off
"full toss, and <strong>pulled straight down the throat of mid-wicket</strong>! Steketee's extra pace perhaps helping him, as also Cutting looking to go for the longer part of the ground. Bryant was a few yards in, and took it easily. There might have been a bit of doubt about the height of that ball, but it was below waist height"
"slower ball, full pitched, and he drives this wide of long-off, and they can come back quickly for the second"
"short of a length, change of pace as well, and McAndrew is through with his pull far too early. Smartly bowled"
"short, slow again, and he played away towards deep square leg. Just a single. Good outcome for the bowling side at this stage"
"length, driven towards cover after backing away and creating some room for himself"
"low full toss, and he looks to flog this away. Off the inside edge, and Steketee goes chasing after this towards short mid-wicket. They set off for the second, and the bowler fails to collect cleanly!"
"length, driven through covers, and Davies has to go chasing after this. Gets down low to his right to cut this off"
"length, lifts from just outside off, and then moves away sharply. Just past the outside edge. Good take by Billings"
"down the legside, and that will have to be rebowled"
"muscles this down the ground, but there's a long-on in place"
"length, around off, a bit of movement off the seam back in, and Lynn defends towards point"
"short, and he goes up high on his toes to slash this away. Just over point, and rapid enough to go to the fence"
"length, a bit of movement back in, and he defends back towards the bowler"
"short of a length, runs it with an open face to the right of point"
"length, some extravagant swing down the leg side after pitching around middle, and needs a good diving stop to his left from Billings to prevent extra runs for the wide"
"quick, angles into him from around a length, and Lynn looks to back away to go around mid-wicket. Beaten for pace, and this has probably struck his glove. Lucky that it lands well short of Billings"
"quick, down the leg side though, and this will be called a wide. Despite a loud appeal for caught behind from Billings. Wasn't far from Lynn's thigh pad, but just wide enough"
"length, driven firmly to cover"
"length, outside off, and also lost his black waist towel in the process. Too wide, according to the umpire"
"fast, but some width on offer. Lynn goes with quick hands towards deep point, where Milne has a fielder to protect the boundary"
"fast, a bit of movement away after pitching outside off, and Bryant misses out on a drive. Beaten by pace"
"<strong>flies off the edge</strong>, as he looks to go down the cricket. There's some good pace in this opening over from Milne, and that carries this over third man for six. The man was inside the circle in any case"
"length, straighter, and he looks to go across the ground, but gets just an inside edge on to pad"
"length, and this time he has gotten a good hold of this. Just the shot he was trying off the previous ball, but this time he latches on to it, and sends it over the mid-wicket fence"
"length, wide outside off, and he has sliced this through the cover region, in the air. Lands close to the fence and comes to a stop, before Davies can field and send the return in. They pick three for this"
"length, flicked towards deep midwicket"
"length, good pace, and Lynn backs away to drive. Gets an inside edge on to the ground, and then it pops up towards Billings to his right"
"<strong>drilled through covers!</strong> Length again, and he just stands and smashes that through the region between cover and mid-off. No chance for either man, as it travels like a gunshot"
"length, defended with a forward press"
"goes back to whip this away, but it travels quickly to square leg"
"length, and he backs away and cuts this. In the air, and just to the right of backward point"
"short, and he has pulled this straight to mid-wicket. McAndrews takes the catch, standing a few yards inside the boundary"
"shuffles across and tries to dunk this over short fine leg, but fails to make contact"
"looks for that same shot again. This time strikes the pad. Optimstic appeal for leg before, what with the ball having pitched outside leg and perhaps going down leg as well"
"sharp, around off, and he drops it dead on the off side and sets off for a single. Cover comes in quickly and underarms a shy at the striker's end, but doesn't hit"
"fuller, on the pads, worked down to deep fine leg"
"good pace, and he has used that speed on the ball smartly. Just backs away, and with a little flick of the wrists, gets it deep into the stands beyond deep square leg"
"length, a touch wide of off, and he drives to deep cover for a single"
"fast, but short, and he hangs back and cuts this with some ferocity. Beats deep point, diving away to his left"
"length, a bit of movement off the seam, as it beats an attempted run down towards third man"
"drops this a bit short, and he can go back and cut this sharp towards deep point"
"<strong>Sangha has his revenge!</strong> A touch fuller, and Lynn still looks for the cut. Ends up slicing this to Davies at backward point. Immediate celebrations in the Thunder camp, because Lynn was looking quite dangerous, especially against pace"
"length, cut away and he chances his arm for a quick single"
"short, and he can cut this towards deep cover"
"length, cut away again, this time to the left of backward point. Good shot in the end, because he controls it well, and the placement is immaculate"
flicked towrads deep midwicket
"starts with a good ball. Little seam movement away after pitching on a length, just around off. Beats Burns"
"and Burns replies with a fine lofted straight drive down the ground. Just clears his front leg, and then has a good swing down the line"
"length, <strong>beats him again</strong> as he goes searching for it just outside off"
"fuller, swatted down the ground, but it has travelled very quickly to mid-off"
"fuller, but straighter, and he can open his stance up a bit and work this through the on side. Superb timing, as it beats long-on, running away to his right"
"length, and he clears his front leg, and lofts this over lon-on. Great power, and generated through some uncluttered hitting"
"fullish ball, around off, and he almost plays all around it. Digs it out"
"driven back down the ground. Green wasn't too far from it, and they get a single to long-on"
"length, and he goes back to work this towards square leg"
"fuller, angles across him from around the wicket, and it beats him as he looks to push towards cover"
"fullish, straight, and he works this towards deep square leg. Hard running and they get two"
"speared in a bit, and he works it off his pads towards mid-wicket"
"length, and steered to third man off the back foot"
"slower ball, around off, perhaps a cross-seamer, and Burns just walks across the stumps, and then flogs this well over long-on"
"fuller, around off, and he digs it out towards point"
"length, drives towards cover"
"short of a length, cutter, and he fails to make contact with an attempted run towards third man"
"down the wicket, and able to mow this down towards long-off"
drives an off-pace ball towards cover
"length, goes back to work this off his pads towards square leg"
"short, and he works it against the turn towards deep mid-wicket"
"cuts this away, off the edge, and just clears backward point and short third man. Good ball, actually, with a bit of extra spin"
works this away towards square leg and pinches a quick single
"short, and he rocks back to pull this away towards mid-wicket"
worked against the turn towards mid-wicket
"short of a length, width on offer, and cut away towards deep point"
"short, off pace, and worked towards backward point"
cut away towards deep point
"short, wide, and cuts this away but cannot beat deep point"
"short, and he skips down the wicket in an attempt to flog this down the wicket. Beaten by the change of length, and possibly also the slowness of pace"
"slower ball, but well outside off, will have to rebowl this"
"fuller, just a touch wider, and perhaps a slightly harsh call of a wide. The batsman left it alone, but did move in towards the ball a bit"
"short, and he rocks back and clears cover and picks up another boundary"
"length, looks for the cut, but misses out, as it is slanted across him, at good pace"
"shuffles across the stumps, and picks this up from around leg and middle, and paddles this down to fine leg. Long stop, almost"
"fullish length, driven towards deep cover"
"length, runs this down towards point with a forward press"
goes back and steers it wide of short third man for a single
goes back to punch this towards mid-wicket. Easy single on offer
"shortish length, and cut away towards deep backward point"
"short, down the leg side, and he ducks under this"
"slower, shorter, and he looks to go towards deep mid-wicket, but misses out"
"length, around off, and he defends towards point"
"down the wicket, good pace ball angles into him, and he heaves this towards long-on"
"back of a length, good pace, and he cuts this firmly into the ground, and on the bounce to backward point"
"length, towards leg stump, and he works it off his hips towards long leg"
"defends a length ball around off, towards cover. Almost squared up by this"
"length, around middle, and he works it off his pads towards deep square leg"
"backs away on the onside, and Cutting follows him with a shortish ball. Pulled away towards deep midwicket"
"fuller, driven towards long-off"
"backs away and shovels this along the ground towards sweeper cover. The fielder has to move to his right, and they pick up two before he can field"
"length, wide outside off, turning further away. Too wide, in fact"
driven with the turn towards deep point
"swings this across the line, length ball around off, and <strong>lofts it towards deep mid-wicket</strong>. The fielder there shapes to catch, but seems to have lost it in the lights at the last moment. Pulls out"
"no such doubts about this one. Creams a slog sweep, and gets it deep into the stands, where a member of the crowd takes a smart catch, and celebrates by guzzling his drink at one gulp"
"swings this away towards the gap between mid-wicket and deep square leg. Hit really hard, and that's <strong>50 for Denly</strong>"
"Sangha gets his man, but is it too little too late? Tossed up around off, and Denly is in a hurry to finish this. Skips down the wicket, but is beaten by the length. Ends up wafting in vain, as the ball eludes bat and goes through to Billings, who has the easiest stumping to complete"
"wrong 'un, and he has just <strong>pulled this down deep mid-wicket's throat</strong>! It's short of a length, but Gregory probably didn't pick the variation. Still looking to attack, but perhaps safe to say he could have atleast used a ball or two as a sighter. Sangha will be on a hat-trick when he bowls next"
"fullish, around off, and he drives towards deep point for a single"
works this off his pads towards backward square leg
"flatter, and he looks to work this off his pads, but plays outside the line of this"
"length, around off, and he can only defend towards short mid-wicket"
"fuller, around off, and he squeezes this to the left of cover-point"
"fuller, driven to cover, and firmly so. No possiblity of any runs"
"back of a length, down the leg side, and a loud appeal for caught behind as Pierson looks to go down to fine leg. That was quick, bowled at 143 kph"
"length, cut hard towards deep point"
"length, cut away towards deep point"
"length, around off, and a firm drive, but straight to deep point"
"fuller, straighter, and he is forced to dig this out towards mid-off"
"<strong>fantastic innovation from Peirson!</strong> He walks right across the crease and exposes his entire set of stumps, and McAndrew follows him somewhat. He's ready to face a fuller length ball, and smacks it over mid-off. Well hit, because it lands just short of the long-on fence"
"fuller length, a bit of late movement back in, and Burns is able to squeeze it off the outside edge. Runs away really quickly to the left of short third man"
"yorker, bowled at 147.6 kph, and it goes between bat, legs and stumps through to Billings"
"length, driven to mid-off, and they pinch a single"
"length, around off, and he drives to mid-on and picks up a single"
"back of a length, drifting down the pads, and he looks to pull this away. Off the glove towards square leg, and <strong>Burns brings up fifty</strong>. Shorn of his woes with the red ball, he has played a proper gem of a white-ball innings today"
"length, good pace, and he cuts him after making some room. Superb placement from Peirson yet again, bisecting the gap between backward point and short third man"
"length, around middle, and worked away towards deep mid-wicket. They go for the second, and a direct hit at the non-striker's end could have made things interesting!"
"length, well wide of off. Eight wides and one no-ball delivered today by Thunder"
"sharp, short, and close to the batsman. Burns ducks under this"
"short, and he has cut this straight to point. A very good Burns innings comes to an end. Couldn't be blamed for that dismissal, would have gotten four had he just managed to place it wide of Khawaja, or perhaps just clear him. In the end, a good sharp catch by the latter, and Heat lose their fifth"
"fuller ball, and where has this one gone? Yorker length, and he looks to get some bat on to it. Perhaps just hit it off the toe-end, and almost on to his stumps, but it bounces through to Billings"
"good pace, short length, and Bazley looks to pull this away but gets nowhere near it as it fizzes past his right ear"
"length, and punished. Swatted away towards deep mid-wicket, and goes through for four. We are denied a potential grandstand finish. Or are we?"
"<strong>that should be the win for the Heat!</strong> Length, and a lot of turn from outside off, and Peirson has done well to pierce an infield of six fielders, three on the off side, but placing this to the left of cover. Before the sweeper in the deep can rifle in a low throw, they go through for the second"
