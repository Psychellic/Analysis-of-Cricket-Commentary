some shape into him but too straight and he can tuck it off his pads straightaway into square leg to get off the mark
"in the channel outside off, left alone"
"gets it to nip away off the seam, and Rohit is not fully forward in defense, it takes a thick outside edge and rolls past gully"
oooh that one reared up. Back of a length and moving away but continues rising as it passes Agarwal and goes at chest height almost
"fullish around off, nudged off the front foot towards wide mid-on"
"beauty. Snaking past the outside edge, was so close to actually getting a nick. Slightly back of a length and moving away a touch, Agarwal comes on the front foot for a solid defensive shot but the ball whizzes past the bat"
"full angling in on off stump, defended with an angled bat towards point"
shape away from the batsman but this is well outside off and he can leave it alone easily

shaping into Rohit but ends up on the pads and is comfortably tucked through midwicket for an easy three
"angles it into him from slightly wide of the crease and moves it away after pitching, but it was on the sixth stump and Agarwal leaves it well alone"

<b>lovely</b> beats the outside edge again with another one that moves off the seam and snakes past the bat even as the batsman is coming on the front foot to defend
this time it's too far outside off and Rohit is not going to go anywhere near that
strays on the pads that time and is clipped to fine leg
good length nibbling around off stump and defended from the crease with soft hands
"nips this back into Rohit now who gets a thick inside edge off his forward defensive onto pad. Didn't account for the inwards movement, but fortunately for Rohit, got some bat on it"

angling in on a fifth stump line and moving away

swinging into him again but very full and pushed back to the bowler
"on a hard length outside off, left alone"
"length outside off, left alone"
"he's getting wobble in the air is Philander and bowling it on a fourth stump channel. A slightly brave call to let it go, especially given Philander's ability to seam it in"
"and Philander has brought this one back in, perhaps influenced by Rohit's leaving of the previous ball. But this one is a bit too straight and it runs down to fine leg off a thickish inside edge"
"<b>huge appeal and they've gone for a review</b>. Corker of a ball and it almost seemed like Agarwal was going to walk off, but stopped. It's an lbw appeal. Pitches on a length and seams in past his bat, flicks his pad and goes through. <b>he's going to be saved by umpire's call</b>. Impact and hitting the stumps are both umpire's call, so South Africa won't lose their review. But close one for Agarwal"

"super from Rabada, left him just feeling for the ball with feet rooted. Nips away off the seam and Rohit tries to drive it without moving his feet at all and it whistles past the outside edge"
"and caught in two minds now whether to play or leave. Makes as if to push at it, length outside off and then tries to take his bat away. Gets a bottom edge that rolls to slips"
"takes on the short ball but doesn't connect well. The pull shot loops into the air but is going to land well short of deep square. Made contact off the end of the bat, which was fortunate because if he had connected, he could have been caught"
"length outside off, left alone"
"back of a length outside off, getting it to move in the air and off the pitch, but well outside off so can be left alone"

"full outside off, takes a big stride out to defend it back to the bowler"

digs it in short outside off and Agarwal stays back to pat it down
"and banged in back of a length again, Agarwal steers it to gully. Wasn't in control of that shot and quite out of position while playing it, with bat far from the body"
"back of a length outside off, moving away, left alone"
strays on the pads that time and it rolls to fine leg
"another one that beats bat. Back of a length and nice carry on that, moving away, but it's short enough that it doesn't threaten the batsman's wicket, though it would have made him uncertain"
and this one squirts off the outside edge off a half-forward prod and goes once again between third slip and gully! Second time that's happened in this first 35 minutes of play
"starts off with a back of a length ball that jags into the batsman, who defends from close to his body near his midriff"
"short and wide outside off, he went for it and slashed hard, but straight to point"
"<b>between keeper and first slip!</b> Short outside off again and he goes for the forceful cut off the back foot, but gets a toe end that dies on the keeper as it goes to his right. He dives and gets a glove on it, but can't hold on"

"fullish and coming into him now at 147.1 kph, he defends from the crease"
"good length outside off, well judged leave"
strays too far down leg and it's too far for Rohit to connect with the flick
"beaten outside off, but what Rohit did well there was not follow the ball. Back of a length and nipping away and he stayed close to pad, inside the line as the ball whizzed past"
"length ball on the pads, clipped to backward of square"
too far down leg again and no contact with bat
"<b>corker of a ball gets the breakthrough</b>. Banged it in on a hard length again, but this time the line was perfect, on middle and off stump. Moved away too, or rather straightened after pitching, and it was too close to the batsman for Rohit to not play at it, ends up getting an outside edge with the ball going past his midriff. De Kock does the rest."
back of a length and zips through outside off. Left alone
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"length on off, defended from the crease. Feet not moving much for Agarwal for those"
"ducks into the bouncer and gets pinged on the helmet. Excellently directed short ball and Agarwal didn't duck quickly enough, and cops a blow that flies off the helmet to the fine leg boundary. He wasn't in a good position to play the short ball, and didn't seem to have read the bounce till it was too late"

"length ball on the pads, flicks them and goes to short fine leg"

big stride out to smother the ball again on off
too full and Kohli clips it on his front foot to mid-on's right but Muthuswamy dives and stops the ball well
"good length, he was caught on the crease a bit, but read the line well and punches to cover"
"<b>over the top and into the stands</b>. Excellent use of the feet, skipped down the track on twinkling feet, had to stretch a bit for it with the Maharaj bowling it wide, but got excellent timing on it and lifted it straight back over the bowler's head"
<b>action replay!</b> Just a might straighter and with more power. This is dismissive of the bowler and Agarwal has got to 99 in some style. Down the track again and powers this straight over the sightscreen this time.
"length around off, blocked"
too straight and flicked off his pads to deep square leg
"back of a length but down leg, a one-day wide that was. Agarwal tried to glance it fine but doesn't connect and good take by Quinton"
"steered past the lone slip and into the boundary for another <b>Test match hundred</b>.  Back of a length outside off, he had a bit of a flash at it almost, going with only hands - as he has done in the innings - but controlled it well and sent it to the third man boundary."

"floated up outside off, he goes well back and cuts to point's right"
"flatter on a length, comes forward to defend"
"driven firmly back but <b>was that a chance?</b> Ooh yes, went low to his left and he had to get down in a hurry on his follow through, got only fingertips to it. This was a little wider of off and Kohli wanted to drive it down the ground powerfully, but got the toe-end"

back of a length but on a sixth stump line that time and safely left alone
"length ball nibbling around off and coming back a touch. Perhaps that was the plan - drag Kohli across and nip it back in. He did that in Cape Town in 2018. But this is Pune and the ball doesn't really come back enough, gets a thick inside edge off Kohli's forward prod and rolls towards mid-on"
comes on the front foot to defend but it spins a tad more than he budgeted for and takes a thick outside edge past slip
"good length, Kohli comes well forward to defend"
drags it slightly short and Kohli makes use of the depth of the crease to rock back and create more space and cut fiercely through point. There is little margin for error for Maharaj

"full on off, driven from the crease to cover"
<b>and that's a third for Rabada</b> Why did Faf wait so long to bring back after lunch? He's held on to another good catch in the slips though. Rabada's got the in-form batsman. Kicked off a length and Agarwal was looking push it but ends up getting an edge that du Plessis holds on to while tumbling across to his left
"length outside off, steered towards point on the front foot"
"tossed up nicely and gets a bit of dip on this too, but well outside off and spinning away, so Kohli able to shoulder arms easily"

"good length and gets some bite off the pitch with turn and bounce, Kohli goes well back and pats it down to short fine leg"
"length outside off, big stride out to defend"
<b>overthrows go for four</b> This was a good ball again but Kohli negotiated it into the point area by staying beside it and steering it. They were going for a quick single and there was a wild throw by Rabada - of all people - swooping in from point and throwing off balance. Into the square leg fence
"tossed up on off, defended"
good length outside off again and Rahane stretches out and pushes it into the offside
"back of a length outside off, defended from the crease to the bowler's left"
"length outside off, jabbed to point"
<b>just clears de Kock</b>. The bouncer was always coming and Kohli seemed to have decided to take it on. Was moving inside the line to hook but gets a glove on it. De Kock leaps to his left with glove outstretched but it just eludes him
151 kph. back of a length outside off defended while rising up on his toes
"digs it into the pitch and around off, Kohli hops and pats it down from near waist height to the bowler's right"

"quicker one this time, and he gets a bit of a leading edge trying to clip it. The ball doesn't hang in the air too long though"
"148.1 kph, but very full on off, he goes across and clips it off his pads to backward square leg"
was that a yorker gone wrong? Ends up as a half volley on the pads and Rahane flicks it effortlessly through midwicket to get off the mark after a nervy start
"length on leg stump, clipped again, but this time straight to mid on"
"short ball, he's late on the pull and it goes off the toe end. Rolls gently towards mid-on and Rahane realises there's a run there for the taking, and calls Kohli through"

digs it in short that time but well outside off so Kohli can sway away easily. De Kock has to leap up to gather the ball and that stung a bit. 144 kph - and a bouncer at that speed is seriously quick
"and he's caught Kohli in two minds there with a 148 kph ball in the channel. Kohli thinks about leaving it rather late, trying to get bat out of the way, and it clips the bat and bounces to slip"

"edged but Rahane indicates immediately it didn't carry to him at slip. He was coming forward again, but this time Jadeja got it to spin past the bat enough to take a thin edge"
"<b>huge appeal for caught behind</b> and not given. Kohli has opted to review. Back of a length, moving away a touch in the channel, gets him to follow the ball with his hands. The ball climbing as it passed him possibly drew him into following it, couldn't adjust quickly enough to drop his hands. And DRS <b>shows a spike as the ball passes bat</b> so Shami has struck first ball! And an excellent first ball it was too, rearing up from a length all the way to the keeper. Saha was appealing vociferously immediately."
In-ducker beats him comprehensively and hits his pad. Another huge appeal but this time they don't review. Possibly going down leg.

"played down the wrong line and gets a thick outside edge that rolls to point. Might have been some reverse on that ball, swinging into him on the stumps"

"down leg side again, clips his pad on the way to Saha, who dives to his left for another good take/save. He's been pulling those off regularly in this Test, and quietly been having a great comeback series himself."
"too full outside off and he forces a square drive that trickles to the boundary. No fielder there so even though the ball was losing momentum, there was nobody to pull it back in"

"and now he beats the man at cover to his left to raise a fine <b>fifty</b>. Similar shot, but more muscle and less timing, and he opened the face of the bat more, using his wrists, to get another boundary"

"<b>beauty from Ashwin</b> That's knocked over the stumps. De Kock is hanging around, thinking Saha's gloves knocked the bails off, but it was all Ashwin's doing. Tossed up, making him thinking about planting the front foot again perhaps, dips beautifully on him, and de Kock is caught on the crease, feet not moving.

"<b>diving effort at short midwicket by Kohli but the ball doesn't stick</b>. Fuller and he tried to go across and clip it, gets it in the air. Kohli gets a full hand to it diving to his right but the ball pops out. Tough one but it will go down as a <b>drop</b>"

Good length, pitches outside off and breaks back in sharply, Muthusamy offers no shot and simply pads up to it. Threatening off stump, and yes the tracker suggests it would have clattered into off stump. Impact was outside off, but Muthusamy wasn't offering a shot here. SA continue to collapse around Faf"

too short and allows him to rock back and cut this powerfully. Didn't time it perfectly though so Pujara hares after it from cover and pulls it in just before the point fence

"skids through on the stumps, he jams it to extra cover, where a surly looking Kohli fields it"

"<b>caught at leg slip</b> A superb innings by Maharaj but Ashwin ends it. Gets some drift on this and it is on leg stump, Maharaj is looking to flick it away, gets a thin edge onto pad and straight to Rohit Sharma.

"speared into him, defended on the front foot, short leg dives and plucks the ball and the fielders get excited about a catch, but it was a bump ball"
defended into the offside
"oh that one came out of nowhere! Pitched on a full length, Philander not quite to the pitch to defend, but it just hisses and spits off the pitch as it turns past the bat. Saha collects near his shoulders"
defended into the offside on the front foot
"fuller outside off, pushed on the front foot between cover and point"
"<b>through him</b>. Rabada goes for the drive outside off with feet static. <b>India have gone for the review</b>. Tossed up and spinning into him, Rabada seemed to have missed it entirely. And replays confirm that there is daylight between bat and pad. That was probably a review taken because India have two and South Africa are nine down"

ooh that's beaten him outside off. Tossed up again but outside off and whizzes past his bat
draws the edge that time but through the vacant gully region
"<b>given out lbw but Rabada is reviewing</b>. That's only because they have a review left. It looked pretty plumb. And DRS confirms that's three reds, so that will end South Africa's innings. Nice loop from around the wicket, pitches on middle and leg and goes almost straight on. He's playing down the wrong line to defend, expecting it to turn, but it hits his pad. Would have crashed into leg stump."
"oh my, that one came back in a long way. But safe enough to leave because it was going over the stumps. Not great for your mindset as a batsman when the first ball does that"
"<b>Markram has a pair</b>. What a start for India and Ishant. Markram is out almost the same way he was in the first innings, but to a different bowler. This one bent in sharply once again, but Ishant bowled it more full and straight than the first ball and Markram is struck on the pads. Was it going down? The umpire raises his finger after a loud appeal. They think about reviewing, but I suspect that would have been umpire's call on review."
"another one jagging in sharply on a length, but de Bruyn gets well behind it and defends with a full face"
"length in the channel, left alone"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"sharp movement into him again, defended into the legside. Was a bit off balance while getting on the front foot for that. South Africa have begun very tentatively"
"length ball going across him and ends up in the channel, bunted back to the bowler"
"<b>risky run</b>. Length in the channel, he pushed it to point and took off for a run. If the fielder - Agarwal - had hit the stumps, de Bruyn was a goner. Scrambled minds from South Africa"
"<b>edged through the slips</b>. South Africa really need to gather themselves. And that is a <b>drop</b> by Virat Kohli at third slip. Was dipping on him after straightening on a length and drawing the edge, but Kohli lets it go through his fingers"

"good length in the channel again, and he lets it go"
"nice carry for Umesh, and he's keeping in that corridor outside off. The batsman's leaving it alone alright but is forced to watch it carefully"
"length on off, defended to point"
"lost his radar there after four excellent balls, or perhaps he was looking to set him up with an inswinger after all those balls going away. But it's too far down leg for even Saha to collect and runs down fine"
"back to nibbling at that off stump on a length, moving away a touch and de Bruyn defends solidly from the crease"
"length outside off, moving away. Elgar almost had a flash at it, but pulls out of the shot"
"<b>between gully and third slip</b>.That has been South Africa's most productive area this morning. But he was more in control of this one, presses forward with an angled bat and runs it down. Half edge, half steered"
"length on off, steered to point"
"<b>dropped  short of third slip</b>. Another edge, with the ball straightening from outside off. Elgar going on a forward defensive and it takes the edge but clearly short of Kohli"
stretches out for this one outside off and steers it between point and gully - but wasn't fully in control of that because it hung in the air. Runs are coming for South Africa but fairly riskily
"and he bowls the one that goes with the angle after having taken them away from Elgar all over, but the batsman deals with it well enough, nudges it towards mid-on with bat in front of pad and weight on the front foot"
"significant movement away from him in the channel, left alone"
swinging away from him but a touch fuller and he's able to defend it on off stump towards cover
"shaping it away from the batsman nicely now Umesh, but de Bruyn's equal to it and defends to point"
<b>superman take from Saha flying to his left</b>. De Bruyn will be filthy with himself. Umesh had strayed down leg and he tried to glance him fine. You just don't do that when it's Wriddhiman Saha behind the stumps. He has flown - there is no other word to accurately describe it - yards to his left and plucked that ball out. Whew.
way down legside and the batsman is not going to get anywhere near that
"length ball in the channel, left alone"
"takes on the short ball, fetching the pull form over his shoulder outside off and gets only a toe-end on it. It's safe though, and clears midwicket"
"length outside off, steered to point's left"
"<b>that moved in sharply</b>. And good carry from a length too, outside off. Can safely leave it because it's well over the stumps"
"fuller on off, he stayed still in his crease and played it late, accounting for the swing. Just taps it down to fine leg using wrists and bottom hand, with minimal backlift or flourish"
"swinging into him again, he plays it late. Has he reduced his backlift to account for late swing? Perhaps he has. Ends up nudging it towards square leg"
"fuller on off, defended solidly to cover"
"<b>sweet timing</b> but pulled inside the point boundary by Agarwal. Wide of off stump and very full, he reaches for it with his hands and pings it past point. Wasn't exactly safe since it hung in the air a bit"
"length on the stumps, defended down the pitch"
"length on the stumps, pushed to mid-off. Jadeja is a bit wide but he swoops in like a hawk, and collects in one smooth motion"

"length ball angling into him, punched to cover"
"fuller but well outside off, left alone"
strays down leg again and is flicked to fine leg
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
oh that's a nasty short ball. It reared up from back of a length and he was going for the pull but then decided to not go for it a little too late. Bangs into his bat and almost pings him on the grille. Popped up and dropped near him
"good response by the batsman, given room outside off  and he carves it off the backfoot through backward point"
"lovely shot, half-volley outside off and he leans into the cover drive in elegant fashion"
"back of a length outside off, defended to cover"

"tossed up on a length, gets nicely behind it and goes deep in his crease to defend with the full face"
"fuller, lunges out and defends"
"<b>that's pinged short leg</b> Rohit Sharma the man there. Too short and he goes for the hard sweep, nails it too, but that's hit Rohit who was turning and taking evasive action. No damage done"
"loop, dip and turn, defeats his forward defensive and hits him on the pad. Loud appeal but maybe that ball was doing too much"
"full and slanting away outside off, Elgar carefully opens the face and glides it away behind point, to the right of the man square on the off side"
"Shami follows it with a bouncer on middle, Elgar ducks out of the way"
"another nasty bouncer, explodes off the pitch, top take from Saha once again. Wide called"

"huge appeal by Jadeja as Bavuma misses the sweep and Kohli reviews. Pitches on off and is turning away, I think Bavuma will be saved by the impact, and that might miss the stumps too. And in fact that's exactly what has happened. That's a poor review. Impact well outside off and turning further away so it's inevitably missing off by a long way too"
"<b>Rahane pulls off a stunner at slip</b> forget that review off the previous ball, Bavuma's gone now. Tossed up and Bavuma is drawn into the drive, but it drifts and turns, clips his outside edge and goes very fine. Excellent reflexes by Rahane who sticks out his left hand near shoulder height and then the right hand closes around the ball too to ensure it doesn't pop out anywhere - all while diving to his left."
