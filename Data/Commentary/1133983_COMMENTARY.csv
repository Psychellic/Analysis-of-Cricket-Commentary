"back of a length, nips in a touch towards off stump, good bounce too. Looks to defend and gets a thick inside edge into pad and they scamper a single as it trickles into the leg side"
"length ball, swings in a touch into Dhawan's pads, tucked away gently behind square leg"
"full, close to off stump, defended to mid-off. Some gentle outswing again"
"full again, angling into off stump. Not as much swing as the batsman expects, this time, and Vijay, looking to drive to mid-off, ends up driving to mid-on off the inside half of the bat"
"beauty. Good length in the corridor, outswing, and some extra bounce. Vijay pokes at it, uncharacteristically, and the ball zips past his outside edge"
"back of a length in the corridor, and this time Vijay leaves it well alone"
"length ball slanting across Dhawan, pitches on off stump and swings further away. Left well alone"
"shorter now, angling away from off stump again, good bounce once more. Dhawan leaves and lets Zazai collect"
"short and wide, and Dhawan puts it away as you'd expect. Crashed away through the vacant cover point region with a horizontal bat"
"back of a length, pitching on off stump zipping away with the angle from right-arm over. Dhawan leaves again"
"back of a length again, this time the line is closer to off stump and Dhawan has to think a little longer before deciding to leave"
"shortish, a bit of width, and Dhawan picks up another boundary. A cover point appeared after the first one, and Dhawan stands tall and splits the gap between him and backward point"
"fullish outside off, left alone"
"full, angling down the leg side, too far from the stumps for Vijay to flick, and forces Zazai into a tumbling save behind the wicket"
"full outside off, and the ball doesn't come on to Vijay. He wanted to drive through the covers, and ended up sending it rolling back towards the bowler off the inside half of the bat. Didn't really move his feet either"
"length ball wide of off stump, seventh-stump line. Left alone"
"length ball, straightens a touch towards off stump and Vijay is squared up while defending into the off side"
"ooh, again Vijay is slow getting onto the front foot. He had just landed on his heel when he made contact with this attempted cover drive off a full one outside off stump. That contact, however, is off the inside edge, and the ball runs away to the left of the keeper to the fine leg boundary"
"full on off stump, a bit of swing away from the left-hander, defended to cover"
"back of a length, slants across the stumps and isn't too far from the top of off stump when Dhawan leaves it, but he trusts the length and trusts the bounce"
"back of a length outside leg, Zazai drops the ball after Dhawan misses the flick off the hip. Looks like Zazai was about to launch into a premature appeal as he went for the ball"
"back of a length on off stump, punched into the point region"
"length ball angling across the stumps. It isn't far from off stump at all, but Dhawan judges the line well, presses forward and leaves"
"length ball on off stump, defended back down the pitch and Wafadar completes Afghanistan's first maiden over"
"good length, sixth-stump line. Vijay strides forward and leaves"
"full, angling into the pads, and Vijay clips it away neatly - or so I thought, but the signal is leg-byes - to the fine leg boundary. Oh yes, it's off the thigh pad"
"full, sixth-stump line, a bit of swing away, left alone"
"length ball, again too wide of off stump to make Vijay play"
"back of a length, a little closer to off stump but not close enough to make Vijay play"
"good length, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"good ball, fullish and angling away from Dhawan's off stump. Left alone, but Dhawan will be tested if he keeps pitching it there"
back of a length on off stump. Looks to chop it into the point region and hits it into the pitch off the inside edge
"full now and Dhawan drives, but there's a man at cover to stop it"
"full, a bit of swing away from Dhawan's off stump. He's slightly early on his drive, though, and ends up hitting it into the midwicket region, with his bat spinning in his hands, instead of through the covers"
length ball angling into off stump. Stays on the back foot and defends towards mid-off
"angles into the pads this time and the ball screams past the keeper, diving to his left, and to the fine leg boundary. Off thigh pad again - Vijay has been a touch late on the leg glance twice now"
"full, swings in but into Dhawan's pads, and he whips it away fluently to the square leg boundary, over the square-leg umpire's head"
"overcompensates with his line, sends down a wide, wide of off stump"
"overpitched now, outside off, and Dhawan leans into a drive that beats cover driving to his left"
"back of a length on off stump, defends with soft hands into the off side and thinks of a single, but the bowler moves quickly in his follow-through to prevent it"
"length ball on off stump, defended to cover"
full and on the pads again. Long leg is quite square and Dhawan's glance easily beats him despite a sprint and dive to the left
"back of a length outside leg stump, not close enough for Dhawan to flick off his hip"
"shortish, too wide of off stump to make Vijay play"
"short again, but this one's angled in towards off stump and rises quite steeply. Vijay leaves again, pulling his gloves and upper body away from the line"
"back of a length, a little wider outside off, left alone once more"
"back of a length, angling down leg with a bit of inswing. Vijay misses the flick and the ball thuds into his pads"
"ooh, edged but wide of second slip. No third slip in place - they should perhaps have had one there, given it's an uncertain Vijay on strike - and it's too far from Shahzad diving to his right. Reached out at a good-length ball on a sixth-stump line and got a thick edge on it"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"floated up full on off stump, jabbed to short extra"
"tossed up slow, this time angling in from wider, towards off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"length ball close to off stump, not much turn, defended into the covers"
"down the track now, spots some flight, and he drives it firmly and to the left of cover, who's stationed quite deep. Vijay is a little slow taking off from the non-striker's end, and has to hurry to reach the other end as Rashid moves quickly and fires a flat throw to the keeper"
"floated up full, angling down leg. Vijay thrusts his pad at it, and it rolls gently into the fine leg region. Can't get any runs for it, since he padded it deliberately"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the point region"
"length ball fairly wide of off stump, left alone"
"good length, angling in from wide of the crease but still a touch too wide to make Dhawan play"
"a touch shorter, still too wide of off stump to tempt Dhawan into a shot"
"slants this into the stumps from wide of the crease. Dhawan ends up having to play around his front pad - seemed to be surprised by the sudden change in line - and there's a big appeal for lbw, but it might be slipping down leg or bouncing over the stumps. Afghanistan don't review"
"excellent delivery, this. Two good balls, back to back. Back of a length, angling into a fourth-stump line and forcing Dhawan to play. Then it straightens past the edge. <b>Huge appeal</b> from Zazai, and Shahzad's also urging his captain to review, but Stanikzai chooses not too. <b>Wait a minute, there's a little murmur on Ultra Edge!</b>"
"back of a length close to off stump, drops it into the point region with soft hands and they pick up a quick single"
"and now Dhawan salts the wounds by jumping out of his crease and smashing Nabi back over his head for six. An off-stump ball, he got just about close enough to the pitch of it to get under it and follow-through fully"
"length ball on off stump, defended"
"tossed up wide of off, leans forward and eases it into the cover point region"
"flat length ball angling into off stump, and Vijay picks up a confidence-boosting boundary. Nice stretch forward and a smooth swing across to sweep it to the left of short fine leg"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to the left of mid-off"
"flat, angling into middle stump. Goes back to work it into the leg side but the fielder at short leg is alert and picks it up one-handed on the bounce"
"full on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"beauty. Lovely delivery from Wafadar. Angles it into off stump from slightly wide of the crease, and gets it to seam away sharply off the deck, from just short of a good length. Vijay doesn't push at it away from his body, and as a result he's beaten rather than edging it"
"nice length again, on off stump, defended back to the bowler from the crease"
"back of a length close to off stump, and Vijay is torn between playing and leaving. Ends up hitting it to gully off the middle of the bat while trying to lift his bat above his head and leave it"
"another good ball. A fuller length than the three previous once, quite an acute angle into off stump before straightening slightly. Vijay is half-forward to defend, goes to gully off the high part of his outside edge"
"ooh, some sharp inswing now. Vijay was shuffling across, maybe thinking of leaving it, and then has to hurriedly jam his bat down to protect his off stump. Hits him on the bottom glove"
"big appeal for lbw as Dhawan strides forward to defend, playing for more turn than there was. Ends up with bat behind pad, but it struck him outside off stump and was probably missing off stump too"
"similar ball to the previous one, maybe slightly wider. Defended into the point region"
"swept away hard, in the air, but well to the left of the man at backward square leg. Looked a little premeditated, went for the shot as soon as he saw the line drifting slightly towards leg stump"
"down the track now, perhaps expecting Nabi to shift his line wider of off stump. He does, and Dhawan flat-bats it to the cover boundary"
"down the track again and Nabi fires it in quicker, angling it into his feet. Flicks it straight to short leg, who moves with the batsman and gets down low to stop it"
out of his crease once more and Nabi slows this one down outside off. Stretches out and defends into the off side
"back of a length first ball, hurries on with the angle towards leg stump. Works it into the forward square leg region, and Vijay picks up a single"
"full-toss on middle stump, and that's excellent use of the wrists from Dhawan to whip it away to the left of mid-on"
"length ball, googly spinning from leg stump to off, defended from the crease, with the turn"
"another googly, but this is short, and Dhawan pulls it away mercilessly, from outside off stump to the midwicket boundary"
"another full-toss, on leg stump, and Dhawan simply jabs it with a straight bat to pick up four more to the midwicket boundary and get to his fifty in 47 balls"
"another googly, spinning towards off stump. Stays on the back foot and defends towards the non-striker"
"good ball. A bit of away seam after pitching short of a length in the fifth-stump channel. No footwork from Vijay, just jabs at it with his hands, and he's lucky he hasn't edged it"
"back of a length, closer to off stump, defended into the covers"
"full now, on off stump, and Vijay clips it elegantly, straight back into the stumps at the other end"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended with an open face to backward point"
"back of a length once more, on off stump, defended to cover point"
"short now, on off stump, and Vijay makes full use of that extra time given him by the length, rises onto his toes and punches it with a perfectly straight bat, to the right of backward point. Sweet, sweet timing"
"good ball, nicely flighted to draw Dhawan forward, looks like another googly spinning away from middle and off. Defended towards mid-off"
"another googly, shorter this time. Not short or wide enough to cut and Dhawan is beaten"
steps out now and Rashid's quickness through the air ensures he isn't to the pitch. Defended into the covers
"quickish one, slides on with the angle towards middle stump. The skidder. I think Dhawan thought it was another googly and shaped to cut, ended up having to defend hurriedly"
"slower now, googly, gives Dhawan some width but it doesn't come on to the bat, and he chops it into the point region, off the inside half of the bat"
"googly again, and a big lbw appeal, but that's definitely missing leg stump. Lots of turn after pitching on middle and off. Nice length and trajectory, drew Vijay forward to defend, and he played for the legbreak, which will encourage Rashid to keep mixing it up. Didn't get a big enough stride forward either, and wasn't anywhere near the pitch of the ball"
"Oversteps, but an excellent delivery otherwise. Angling in and nips in sharply from back of a length, but Dhawan reads the line well and leaves it alone."
"fuller now, closer to off stump, defended into the cover point region"
"back pf a length, close to off stump again, and the angle will worry Dhawan, but he leaves this one fairly comfortably. 138kph"
"overpitches now, and he's lucky Dhawan has driven that straight to cover"
"back of a length outside off, lets it come on and guides it with soft hands to the right of backward point"
"bouncer now, rises high off stump, well over head height. First bouncer of the day at 137kph, Vijay sways away from the line"
"full, looks to angle this into the stumps from wide of the crease but ends up sliding it down the leg side. India pick up a bye while Zazai scrambles to his left to stop the ball"
"full, wide of off. Not quite a half-volley but Dhawan doesn't care as he drives it on the up, over the covers"
"another googly, just about short enough for Vijay to go back to and defend to short leg"
"full-toss on off stump, driven to cover, who misfields to allow Vijay off strike"
"nice length, draws Dhawan forward to defend. Picks the googly, which is turning from leg stump to off stump, and defends with the spin"
"another wrong'un, I think, but it's a floater outside leg and Dhawan pounces to sweep it hard to the right of backward square leg"
follows up with a fast yorker on off stump and Dhawan jams his bat down to keep it out
"full, on the pads, and Dhawan flicks it to backward square leg. A foot or two more to his left and that would have been another boundary"
"tossed up outside off, eased to cover off the front foot"
"shortish carrom ball outside off, and Vijay goes back to pull but sees the extra bounce and jams it down instead towards mid-on"
floated up wide of off and he stretches out to ease it to the left of cover
"fastish, angling into the pads, looks to flick and it rolls off the apd towards backward square leg"
"fuller, angling into leg stump again, and he gets away with it as Dhawan sweeps hard but too close to backward square leg"
"tossed up full on off stump, punched back to the bowler"
wrong'un once more. Shortish and turning in towards middle and leg. Goes on the back foot to work it to deep square leg
"down the track, making himself a bit of room to hit down the ground, I think. Rashid pulls his length back slightly and bowls the googly a little wider. Driven cautiously to cover"
"short, wide, slapped away to the cover point boundary. The googly's been his stock ball today, and this time it only provides Dhawan width"
"jumps down the wicket now and launches Rashid over the long-off boundary. Another googly, lifts it inside-out after stepping nimbly away from the line"
"flighted googly spinning away from off stump, not a bad ball, but Dhawan will put anything away now. Steps forward, opens his bat face, and finds the gap to the right of backward point"
"big appeal, and Chris Gaffaney says not out. <b>Afghanistan have reviewed</b> for the first time - is it for lbw or a catch at slip? Presses forward to defend this rare legbreak, and it beats his inside edge. No bat, so we'll have to see if this was lbw. Did it pitch in line? Oh yes, it's pitching on middle and straightening, but Hawkeye shows the ball bouncing over the top of the stumps. Wow. It looked so out at first glance, but it's so hard to say how big a batsman's stride is from front-on."
Vijay didn't pick that. This time it's Mujeeb who bowls the googly. Presses forward to defend in front of off stump and gets a thick inside edge that rolls towards backward square leg
"bam, that's effortlessly swept over the square leg boundary. Floated up outside off, another googly, and he puts it away with a smooth swing of his arms"
"flatter and quicker, sliding into the pads. Hurried onto the back foot to defend into the leg side"
"on the pads once more, tucked away to deep square leg"
"carrom ball, hits a nice length and turns it towards off stump. Dhawan comes forward to defend"
Dhawan has used his feet beautifully today and he's out of his crease in a flash once again. Sees a bit of air and jumps out to drive this high over the long-on boundary. Seemed to pick the carrom ball too
"beaut. A fast legbreak outside off, just short of a good length. Vijay jabs his hands at it in defence, perhaps not picking it, and it rips past his outside edge"
"nicely tossed-up googly, defended into the covers. Vijay read that from the line, I think - it pitched outside off, classic googly line"
"quicker now, goes back to defend the googly to short leg"
"a bit shorter and it turns into his pads, goes back to work it to deep midwicket"
shortish skidder angling across to off stump. Tucked away gently towards backward square leg
"googly, too short and too wide to make Vijay think it was anything else. Goes back to try and late-cut, but Shahzad dives to his right at slip to stop it"
"back of a length, angling into middle and off, not much turn either way, goes back and whips to midwicket"
"back of a length, turns in to off stump, punched into the covers"
"on the pads now, worked away through square leg"

"shortish googly on off stump, punched to the left of cover"
"full on off stump, whipped to the right of mid-on"
"back of a length on the pads, tucked away to backward square leg"
"better length, brings Dhawan forward to try and flick this legbreak. Not too much turn, but some extra bounce, and the ball beats inside edge and hits thigh pad"
"goes back once again to this flat one on leg stump, worked to backward square leg"
"turn, sharp turn. Googly again, and it squares up Dhawan and beats his outside edge as he goes back to defend"
"floated up slow and wide of off, overpitched, and Vijay flows forward into an elegant drive to the cover boundary, beats the extra-cover fielder to his right"
"back of a length on the pads, tucked away to deep square leg"
"short and wide, slapped away to the point boundary. The sweeper was too far in front of square to be able to cut that off. The carrom ball but he's hardly found any turn so far"
down the track once more and Dhawan's toying with the spinners now. Floated up outside off and he uses his wrists to whip that back over the bowler's head
"he's now one hit away from a century before lunch. Short and wide again, and Dhawan cuts it away to the left of short third man"
"fuller now, on the stumps, clipped to midwicket"
"nicely bowled. Flighted legbreak outside off and it beats Vijay's hesitant forward prod. Not sure he picked it, but it was the length that beat him first"
"and he follows up with a horrifically bad ball, full down the leg side, and he opens up and swipes it away to the right of backward square leg"
"back of a length, googly, turns into leg stump and he goes back to try and punch into the midwicket region. Short leg moves quickly to cut it off"
"fuller now, close to off stump, clipped gently into the wide mid-on region"
"he sure can! Tossed up on off stump, and he picks the googly and simply eases it with the turn, prioritising placement over power, and bisects mid-off and extra-cover to bring up a century in 87 balls. This has been brutal"
"four more. Not quite the length to sweep, a touch too short for that, though the line was leg-stumpish and he picked the legbreak. Top-edges it slightly, hits it in the air, but into the gap to the right of backward square leg"
"nice, orthodox offbreak on a good length, turning into off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"slower and wider, defended into the covers"
"dangled up full outside off, uses his wrists to clip it down to long-on"

"length ball on off stump, defended into the point region"
"tossed up full outside off, defended into the covers"
"shortish wrong'un slipping down leg, clipped to the right of backward square leg"
"googly again, pitching outside leg and too short to bother Dhawan, goes back and whips to deep square leg"
"fuller now, on off stump, clipped gently to mid-on, who's deep enough to allow another single"
"out of his crease again comes Dhawan, gets right to the pitch of this flighted ball on the stumps and drives to the right of long-on"
"quickish legbreak on off stump, just about straightens rather than turning sharply away, but extra bounce as Vijay goes back and across to defend into the covers"
"sensational timing from Vijay. Shades of VVS Laxman there as he leans into this leg-stump ball and clips it to the right of mid-on. Only the gentlest of clips, but it just keeps running away from the chasing fielder while seeming to accelerate over the turf"
"good-length ball, pitching on off stump and continuing away with the angle. Left alone"
"back of a length on middle stump, tucked away to the left of mid-on"
"length ball angling into leg stump, flicked away to long leg"
"gone! Yamin Ahmadzai gets Afghanistan's first wicket in Test cricket. Fullish, slanting away from off stump, but not full enough to drive. Goes hard at it, away from his body, and the thick edge flies to the left of second slip, at just over shoulder height. Second slip, Rahmat Shah, reaches for it, can't grab onto it, but manages to parry it to Nabi at first slip. That was bowled at 138.6kph"
"length ball angling into off stump. Presses forward to defend, and it trickles towards mid-on off the inner half of the bat"
"back of a length, angling into leg stump, shows the full face and pushes into the forward square leg region"
"tossed up nicely on a good length outside off. The line telegraphs the wrong'un, and Vijay steps forward and uses his wrists to clip to backward square leg"
"low full-toss on leg stump, Vijay flicks it to the right of backward square leg to bring up his half-century. It's been a bit of a struggle at times, but he's dug in and done what he needs to do"
"full on off stump, pushed down the ground with the full face showing, and they pick up two by the time mid-on can chase back to his left and cut it off"
"short, and Vijay misses out. I don't think he failed to pick the googly - it just skidded on lower than he expected and hit his back thigh"
"back of a length, turning into middle stump, punched to mid-on"
"full on off stump, blocked to mid-on"
"good length ball, angling into off stump, defended off the front foot to cover point - the kind of solid building block that builds up to a good Test-match spell"
"fuller now, and Rahul has missed out, overpitched outside off, driven straight to cover point"
"back of a length, a little wider outside off, nips in off the seam but it's too wide to make Rahul play"
"nice length, angling into off stump, and straightening just a touch. Rahul watches it carefully and defends it back to the bowler"
"short now, not enough width to cut, Rahul leaves it alone"
"ooh, good ball! Good length again, and it might have come back in just a touch towards middle stump. Rahul defends it to mid-on, but for a moment he seemed to be playing around his front pad"

"full outside off, defended to short extra-cover"
"full on middle and leg, clipped to mid-on"
"nice length, draws Vijay forward to defend in front of off stump"
"back of a length now, and that's punished. Another wrong'un, turns into the pads as he goes deep in his crease, and he whips it away to the midwicket boundary"

"back of a length, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"on the fuller side of a good length now, in the corridor, Rahul comes forward and leaves again"

"good-looking shot straight to the fielder. Fullish, angling into mid-off, driven to mid-off"
"fullish, angling into off stump from wide of the crease, and Vijay flicks again, into the gap to the right of mid-on. Did well to get his front pad away from the line of the ball"

"back of a length on leg stump, punched to deep midwicket"

"flighted on off stump, defended back to the bowler. Another wrong'un"
"shortish on the pads, clipped to the right of deep square leg"

"length ball on middle stump, defended to mid-on"
"fullish, angling into off stump, driven past the right hand of the diving cover fielder and mid-off mops up"

"length ball close to off stump, but not close enough to make Vijay play"
"good length again, angles in and finishes a little closer to off stump than the previous ball. Defended into the covers"

"tossed up slow on off stump, pushed gently down the ground to mid-on"

"good length wide of off stump, offbreak. Gets forward and plays with an open face to backward point"
"flat now, angled into middle stump, goes back to punch to long-on"

"shortish carrom ball outside off, punched to short extra-cover"

"length ball on the pads, clipped to deep midwicket. Huge cheer from the crowd as Shahzad runs in to field it"
"back of a length on leg stump, goes on the back foot to tuck it to square leg. No idea why Vijay sprinted out of his crease there. Rahul rightly sent him back and he had to dive back in to beat the throw to the bowler's end"
length ball slanting across the stumps. Goes back to it and chops it into the cover point region
"flights this one across to off stump from round the wicket, and Vijay uses the angle expertly, quick hands and feet to reverse-lap it to the fine third man boundary"

"good length again, offbreak, closer to off stump this time, blocked back to the bowler"
"another offbreak, turns into the pads. Goes on the back foot to work it to deep square leg"

"low full-toss on off stump, whipped away to deep square leg"
"another legbreak, again too short. Goes back and guides it to backward point with an open face"

"good length outside off, defended to silly point"
"good length again, turns in towards off stump, defended into the on side"
"and immediately Rahul pounces on an error in length. A touch short on off stump, and he rocks back and makes room to cut it away into the newly opened-up gap at backward point"
tossed up on off stump. Rahul sashays down the track to clip to long-on
"length ball on off stump, defended into the square leg region off the front foot"
"short, wide, cut away fiercely to the point boundary"
"flighted googly outside off, driven to deep point"
"another wrong'un, with nice flight and dip wide of off stump. Vijay drives against the turn, past the fielder diving to his right at cover"
"short, wide legbreak, chopped away to the left of deep point, where Shahzad is forced into a tumbling save"
"full on off stump, shows the full face to pick up a single to mid-on"
"back of a length, legbreak, close to off stump. Goes back and across to try and tuck it into the midwicket area for one - the fielder is back on the boundary - and Rashid chases to prevent the single"
"length ball on off stump, presses forward and works it into the square-leg region"
"full, angling into off stump, and did he get a tiny bit of away movement on that? Vijay was looking to clip it through midwicket, and ended up getting an outside edge to the third man boundary"
"length ball, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"back of a length, closer to off stump now, punched to cover"
"short and wide, and Vijay punches it away to the man at deep point"
"back of a length, wide of off stump, Rahul ignores it"
"short again, this time it's just close enough to Rahul to play the back-cut while still providing him enough room. Slashes it away to the right of gully"
"tossed up outside off, defended to extra-cover"
"two legbreaks in a row! This one lands on a better length than the previous ball, a little wider, and Vijay defends to backward point"
"three legbreaks in a row now. Three good legbreaks. This one doesn't turn too much after pitching on off stump but bounces a touch more than Vijay expects as he comes forward to defend. Off the high part of the outside edge, into the point region"
"ah, well. Just when he strung three good balls together, he sends down a short, wide one that Rahul slaps away to the point boundary"
"googly, lands on a nice length outside off. Draws Rahul forward, and he defends skillfully, with soft hands and a bat face closed just so, to pick up a single behind square leg"
"another googly, flatter this time and spinning in sharply towards off stump. Comes forward to defend and the ball rolls square on the leg side off the inside edge"
"back of a length, angling into the pads, tucked away through square leg"
"back of a length outside off, punched to the left of cover point"
"bouncer angling in from wide of the crease, rising steeply over off stump. Rahul ducks under it"
"length ball angling into off stump, gets a nice stride forward and pushes gently to the left of extra-cover"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended to extra-cover"
"back of a length, angling into off stump from wide of the crease. Lets it come on and uses the pace and angle to tuck it into the backward square-leg region"
"quickish legbreak close to off stump, lands it on the fuller side of a good length, defended back towards the bowler"
misses a flick and Rashid lets out an appeal for lbw. It's clearly missing leg stump. Pitched his googly on off and middle and it beat the inside edge
"good length again, draws him forward to defend into the on side"
"a touch shorter, goes back to work it to the right of midwicket"
"resumes with a googly, back of a length and turning in towards middle and leg. Goes back to defend towards midwicket"
"full, close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"and there goes Vijay! Short, a bit of width, and he gets on his toes and lifts it over point, scooping it rather than punching it, and brings up his 12th Test hundred. Does the dab (or so it's described to me) with Rahul to celebrate the milestone"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended to extra-cover once more"
"short, very wide, dies on its way to the keeper after Vijay reaches out and misses the cut"
"full, angling into off stump, defended back towards the bowler"
"length ball, starts on a fifth-stump line and nips back slightly, left alone"
"ooh, good ball. Goes back to a flat length ball and defends it back to the bowler. Skiddy legbreak close to off stump"
"and again, another skidder on or around off stump. Goes back to defend. Hits the ground, bounces back up, and gets lodged between the batsman's legs momentarily"
"follows up with a long-hop, and Rahul is deep in his crease almost even before the bowler has released. Plenty of time to pull it away and beat the diving fielder at the square leg boundary. Mujeeb, it was. Got a hand to it, actually, but couldn't keep it in"
shortish googly turning down leg. Rahul steps across his stumps and simply paddles it to the right of short fine leg. A shot of casual contempt. Brings up his half-century too
"shortish, skids on towards off stump, goes back and punches it to deep midwicket"
"another googly, flighted and drops on a nice length, though a touch too straight and would have missed leg stump. Misses the front-foot flick and it hits him on the thigh pad"
"back of a length outside off, punched to the left of cover"
wide half-volley and Vijay drives with a high left elbow. Shahzad sprints to his right from deep point to keep him down to two runs
"overcompensates for the previous ball's width, slants this length ball well down the leg side"
"ooh, that's a loose shot from Vijay. Not close to being short enough to cut, and he tries to manufacture the length by stepping deep in his crease and carving away - Brian Lara used to do it, but Vijay doesn't connect on this occasion"
"given! Gaffaney raises his finger after Wafadar gets one to come back in and hit Vijay's front pad as he comes forward and shoulders arms. Vijay has reviewed... Impact was definitely outside off stump but that doesn't matter since he wasn't offering a shot. Let's see what ball-tracking has to say. Umpire's call, it's clipping the off bail. Was that reverse-swing? Can't say for sure, but a very good ball. Went wide of the crease in the first place, and then produced late movement as well"
"starts off with a boundary. Gets a welcome gift on the pads, full, and he flicks it away with a twirl of his wrists, beats square leg to his right"
"bowled him! Rahul has chopped on! Afghanistan will be delighted to learn that Test cricket can do this as well, bring you two wickets out of nowhere after a long, arduous struggle. A wide-ish length ball, Rahul goes hard at it with an angled bat, looking to slap it through cover point, and only succeeds in inside-edging it into his stumps"
"back of a length, angling into off stump. Defends it right under his eyes, and the ball bounces by his feet and rolls into the off side"
"wide length ball, seventh-stump line. Rahane has no option but to leave"
length ball close to off stump. Lets it come on and defends with soft hands into the leg side
"length ball angling into off stump, defended towards mid-on"
"good length again, and some away movement too, but it pitches too wide of off stump to make Rahane even think of playing"
"length ball angling into off stump, which Pujara defends down the pitch, off the inside half of the bat"
"back of a length, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"back of a length, fairly wide of off stump, Pujara will leave those all day"
"another wide-ish length ball, another Pujara leave"
"looks for the yorker, I think, ends up slipping it down the leg side. Pujara looks to flick but can't connect"
"overpitched outside off, Pujara drives but too close to cover point to get any runs for it"
short and very wide of off stump. Rahane leaves
"goes fuller and tries to bowl closer to the stumps, ends up bowling it well wide of leg stump"
"length ball angling into off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"excellent length again, angling into the top of off stump. Rahane defends off the back foot this time, nice straight bat and straight back to the bowler"
"fuller now, uses the inward angle to clip it from off stump to mid-on"
"short, wide, and Rahane is off the mark with a crashing square-cut. Gets on his toes, gets right on top of the bounce, and slaps it away into the big gap to the right of backward point"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"shortish, too wide for Pujara to attempt to cut. Leaves it comfortably"
"oh, beauty. A good length ball angling into that fourth-stump channel, bringing Pujara forward to defend, and then leaving him off the seam to beat his outside edge. Would have beaten anyone"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, defended back towards the bowler"
"ooh, this time it nips back in sharply after angling in from wide of the crease. Pujara is forward, looking to drive through mid-off, I think, and he gets a thick inside edge into his midriff"
"goes wide of the crease again, and this time bowls fullish outside off stump. Defended to extra-cover"
"length ball, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"fullish on off stump, defended to mid-on"
"good ball, just back of a length and not too far outside off stump. Rahane leaves again"
"back of a length outside off, punched firmly to mid-off"

"Full outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, Rahane ignores it"
"once again, wide length ball, and Rahane will have nothing to do with it"
"a touch closer to off stump, but not close enough to tempt Rahane into a loose drive"
"on the shorter side of a good length this time, similar length. Has a little more time to watch the ball after pressing forward, defends into the point region"
"short now, wide too, slapped to deep point"
"length ball angling into off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"shorter now, too wide of off stump to make Rahane play. Some late outswing too"
"a bit closer to off stump, gets that away shape again. Rahane leaves again"
"short now, angling into the body, gets up to around chest height, and Afghanistan think they have him caught behind, pulling. Did it strike anything on its way to the keeper? Paul Reiffel gives it out, and <b>Rahane has reviewed immediately</b>. Looks like it's gone off his left shoulder - was there a tickle on bat or glove before that? Nope. Just the shoulder. The umpire will have to reverse his decision"
"length ball wide of off stump, left alone"
"fullish on off stump, defended into the covers"
"short, wide, Pujara puts it away easily. More a jab than a cut, reaches out to stab it away to the left of backward point"
"short again, not as much width. Looks to play the more orthodox square-cut but it doesn't quite come onto the bat. Chops it hard into the ground and it bounces to backward point"
"back of a length on off stump, punched firmly back to the bowler"
"shortish, close to off stump, punched to the right of sweeper cover"
"shortish again, outside off, and Pujara waits and waits and plays a late jab to beat gully to his left"
"short on off stump now and Pujara pulls it away for another four. Easy pickings, to the right of midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, legbreak, jabbed to backward point"
"short, even more width, Rahane jabs again, to that man at backward point"
"googly now, shortish and turning towards leg stump. Lets it come on and tucks it to short fine leg"
"another legbreak, shortish again, goes back and across and stabs into the point region"
"fuller now, on off stump, another legbreak. Defended comfortably with the spin"
"googly, turns in towards middle and leg. Goes deep in his crease, can't get it past short leg, and that means Rashid has bowled his first maiden. His maiden maiden."
"fullish outside off, defended to extra-cover"
"ooh, so close, nearly shaved the top of off stump! A lovely length from Ahmadzai, and gets it to come back in late too. Pujara leaves, and nearly ends up regretting it"
"much wider this time, left alone again"
"length ball, so wide of off stump the umpire must have considered signalling wide. Left alone again"
"good ball. Hung a few wide of off stump and then slanted one in full, on off stump. Pujara looks to flick, doesn't middle it. Inside half of the bat and rolls to midwicket"
wide length ball again. Pujara shoulders arms
"nicely flighted outside off, another legbreak, stretches out to defend towards point"
"back of a length, googly, turning into the pads, whipped to deep square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, legbreak - only just straightens and keeps a touch low. Does well to play it with a judiciously straight back and defend it back to the bowler"
"tossed up googly wide of off stump, left alone, thrusting a pad out at it"
"quicker one, angling into the stumps, flicks firmly but short leg is in the way"
"another googly, flighted and pitching on middle and leg, gets on the front foot to flick to deep square leg"
"back of a length, offbreak turning in towards off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"tossed up now, another offbreak close to off stump. Gets forward to defend into the on side"
"good ball, nice length on off stump and I'm not sure Pujara knew which way it was going as he pressed forward to defend. Comes into him, not sharp turn, and he gets an inside edge into the leg side"
"fuller now, clipped away through square leg"
"sharp turn now, spins down the leg side, however"
short on off stump and he rocks back to punch it away to the point boundary
"ooh, quick turn. Legbreak outside off. Pujara thinks about punching away from his body off the back foot, but stops himself as it rips away off the pitch"
"back of a length again, on the stumps this time, defended to mid-on"
"back of a length on off stump, legbreak, uses his wrists to whip it to mid-on. Wanted to hit that through midwicket, I think, but Rashid found some extra bounce"
"googly now, turning into off stump, goes back and works it to the right of mid-on. I don't understand why Rashid doesn't have a midwicket. Both square leg and midwicket are back on the boundary"
"back of a length googly, turns in towards off stump, punched back to the bowler"
"fuller now, a flattish legbreak on off stump. Gets a nice stride forward to defend into the point region"
"flat, short, down the leg side, and Pujara opens up and thwacks it away to the right of the square-leg umpire"
"flat and back of a length, turns in towards middle and leg. Whipped away to deep square leg"
"back of a length offbreak turning towards middle stump. Goes back to work it leg side, short leg gets in the way"
"big appeal for lbw as Rahane comes forward to defend the flighted googly. Spins sharply past the inside edge, but I think impact was well outside off stump. Inside edge too"
"floated up full outside off, defended to extra-cover"
"length ball outside off, defended back to the bowler"
"length ball, googly, turning in from outside off. Defended into the point region"
"fuller now, on middle stump. Picks the wrong'un and clips to deep square leg"
"fast, flat legbreak and Rashid launches into a massive appeal for lbw as Rahane misses the back-foot flick. Not-out is the decision, and Afghanistan have reviewed after much deliberation. No inside-edge - it would have been a catch at slip otherwise - and it seems to have hit the flap of his back pad. This looks out to me, let's see what ball-tracking says. Pitches on middle stump, hits back pad in front of middle, and hits top of middle stump. Rashid Khan finally has a Test wicket, and he gets it with a good legbreak. Skids on to beat Rahane for pace, and he really shouldn't have been looking to work that across the line"
"tossed up on off stump, very full, driven hard to cover point, who's come in off the boundary"
"beauty! The wicket seems to have fired up Rashid. Lovely flight, but still quick, outside off, and DK isn't close to the pitch in defence. The ball rips away and beats his outside edge"
"flighted again, this time the googly outside off. Gets forward and defends it back down the pitch"
full offbreak on middle stump. Gets forward to clip to the left of backward square leg
"nice length, an offbreak pitching outside off and turning in towards off and middle. Gets forward to defend into the on isde"
"another good offbreak, fuller and closer to the stumps this time, defended into the on side"
"more flight, ends up overpitching outside off, and DK drives to sweeper cover"
"back of a length outside off, waits on it and jabs it to backward point. Was looking to hit that finer, I think"
"down the track now, first time we've seen Pujara stepping out today. Saw a rare flighted ball from Mujeeb and immediately skipped out. Clips it from off stump towards mid-on"
"looks for the firm bottom-hand whip down the ground off the flighted googly outside off, hits it straight to the bowler"
"<b>dropped!</b> Slip is a legspinner's best friend, and Rashid has been bowling a lot more legbreaks in this spell. Nabi, however, fluffs this chance coming to him at just around waist height, a little to his left, as Pujara hangs his bat out at a fast legbreak that bounces extra from back of a length"
"googly again, worked off the back foot into the backward square leg region"
"googly, pitching on leg stump and spinning further down. Gets down on one knee for a sweep-pull to backward square leg"
"tossed up slow, outside off, dragged wide of mid-on with a lot of bottom hand"
"good ball. He's beginning to settle into some good lengths now. A legbreak that straightens from middle and leg and <b>opens up Pujara</b> as he tries to work it against the turn, from the crease. A dangerous shot when it's pitching on that length, and the leading edge rolls away towards backward point"
"flat, good-length offbreak turning into middle stump. Gets forward to defend into the on side"
"short, just outside off, rocks back and punches to deep point"
"googly, Pujara didn't pick it. Thought it was the legbreak and went for the punch towards mid-off, and the thick inside edge rolls into the leg side"
"beaten! This one's the carrom ball, lands on a good length outside off and zips past the outside edge as Pujara jabs away from his body"
"got him! Now Mujeeb has a wicket. He's troubled Pujara right through this over with his variations, and, most importantly, his length. Lands a flighted googly on just the right spot to bring the batsman forward in defence and leave him a long way from the pitch of the ball. Bounces up, takes the inside shoulder of the bat, and Nabi makes amends for his drop in the previous over, diving left at leg gully to take a superb low catch"
"greets him with another googly, flighted, pitching fairly wide outside off - making it easier for Hardik to pick it - and he comes forward to defend"
"fullish legbreak on middle and off, uses his wrists and plays against the turn to work it to mid-on"
"ooh, a rapidly spinning legbreak pitching on off stump. Karthik is stuck on his crease in defence and then opened up by the turn. Beats the outside edge by a long way"
"full now, outside off, stretches out and defends to backward point"
"shortish legbreak outside off, punched cautiously to extra-cover. Half an hour ago he would have punched that firmly and confidently to the sweeper"
"beautifully flighted googly, dips on Karthik as he stretches forward, and then beats the inside edge of his defensive bat. <b>Another review</b>, after the lbw appeal is turned down, but I suspect this is missing leg stump. Is there an inside-edge too? Nope, no inside edge, just pad. Ball tracking says umpire's call on leg stump. That is tight, and Afghanistan won't lose their review. Rashid Khan is buzzing here, and whistles ring out around the Chinnaswamy"
"flighted outside off, overpitched, to be honest, and Karthik drives it hard but straight to the man at cover"
googly again. Presses forward to defend and gets a thick inside edge that rolls into the backward square leg region
"fuller now, blocked back to the bowler"
"length ball angling into leg stump, defended back down the pitch"
"back of a length, turning into the pads, punched with a straight bat to midwicket"
"tossed up on leg stump, and Pandya whips it nicely to the right of mid-on"
"back of a length, turns in towards middle and leg, punched towards mid-on"
"quick flight, fairly full on middle stump, driven firmly back to the bowler"
"ooh, lovely. A legbreak that doesn't turn too much, goes on straight like a topspinner with extra bounce. Comes forward to defend, possibly playing for the googly, and the ball beats his outside edge"
"back of a length on off stump, googly, goes back to work it through midwicket"
quick legbreak straightening on off break. The length draws Karthik forward and he defends into the off side
"lovely length again, great line too. This one was coming back in towards middle and leg, and Karthik defends towards short leg"
"another well-pitched googly, turning in towards off stump. Nice stride forward to defend into the on side"
"good length from Mujeeb on off stump, comes forward to defend it back to the bowler. Came back in, not too sharply"
offbreak turning into middle stump. Short enough for Pandya to stay back and punch to midwicket
"more flight this time, on off stump, defended into the covers"
"length ball turning into middle stump, defended solidly off the front foot"
"back of a length, flat and homing in on off stump. Goes back and defends it back down the pitch"
"the wrong'un now, a lot more flight and slower through the air, outside off. Pandya presses forward and defends again"
"wrong'un sliding down leg. Looks to help it away fine, but it's not close enough to make contact"
"full outside off, driven with an open face and backward point dives right to make a good stop"
quick legbreak close to off stump. A touch short to trouble the batsman unduly. Defended from the crease into the point region
"short, angling into the pads, punched with a straight bat to deep square leg. The way he played that tells you he's playing Rashid largely off the pitch"
"tossed up full on off stump, pushed into the cover point region and he sets off for a single. He's halfway down the pitch by the time he responds to Pandya's exhortations to turn around, and he has to dive back to make his crease. It's gone up to the third umpire. Has he made it back? He hasn't, and it's an excruciatingly close thing. He's flat on the floor, but his bat has bounced up off the turf and is in the air, over the crease, when the keeper gets the bails off. Not sure who the fielder was, but he moved swiftly to his right from backward point and released in a flash"
"tossed up full on middle and off, the wrong'un, and he defends it back to the bowler"
"length ball turning in towards off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"back of a length, googly, turning down leg, whipped off the hip to the backward square leg boundary. Deep square leg is well in front of square"
"down the track now and he really didn't know much about this one. Played for the legbreak or carrom ball, stepping inside the line and looking to drive inside-out, and he sends an inside-edge rolling down to mid-on"
"tossed up outside off, driven against the turn to cover"
"full on leg stump, clipped to midwicket"
"shortish, pitching well outside off and spinning into middle stump. Stays back, waits, and clips it to deep square leg"
"quick googly outside off, draws the batsman forward with his length. Stretches out and defends towards backward point"
"well played, maybe? I think he was playing for the wrong'un as he came forward to defend this tossed-up ball outside off, but didn't chase it with his hands when it turned out to be the legbreak. Let himself get beaten"
"fuller now, outside off, driven to cover"
"lovely delivery, the legbreak with some extra bounce. Comes forward, looking to defend with an open face, and the ball hits the shoulder of his bat and rolls away wide of slip"
"ooh, that is dangerous! Doesn't pick the googly at all and leaves it alone. Doesn't miss off stump by much"
"another googly, pitches on middle stump, Ashwin comes forward and has to play around his front pad in defence. Pops up off the pad, over short leg"
"length ball outside off stump and Ashwin drives with an open face, carves it away to the point boundary, lovely timing as always"
"oh my, Hardik really needs to work on his judgment of a run and his calling. Length ball on off stump, defends and it rolls off the inner half towards square leg. Hardik rushed out of his crease and Ashwin sent him back"
"very full, just outside off. Jams his bat down and stabs it towards midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and steers to backward point"
"Ooh, <b>edged and falls just short of slip</b>. Goes wide of the crease, angles it into the fifth-stump channel and gets it to straighten. Ashwin plays with hard hands, away from his body, and the edge falls short of Nabi falling to his right from slip"
"wide of the crease again, and this one nips back after angling in towards off stump. Ashwin defends without being able to get fully forward, and inside-edges into his pads"
"loopy slider on leg, just a loosener to begin, clipped away to deep backward square leg"
<b>almost shaves the outside edge!</b> Draws him forward with a length ball and gets just enough bounce to keep his tentative
"back of a length, spinning around off, this time Ashwin is prepared to face the bounce and stands tall and turns it away towards mid-on"
"full and flighted on middle, blocked off the front foot into the off side"
"short of good length, just straightening outside off, Ashwin drops it to the right of point who makes a half stop after diving across"
"short of a length outside off, blocked down the pitch off the backfoot"
"fullish length, angled into the pads, Ashwin flicks uppishy but to the left of midwicket for one"
"back of a length outside off, gets a good stride across and blocks with bat close to pad"
"full on the pads, that's very bad, easily flicked off the pads through backward square leg. That's offering batting practice"
"just back of a length, holding its line outside off, left alone"
"full outside of, driven firmly back to the bowler who gets a hand to it"
"shoulder-high bouncer on leg stump, Hardik gets under it"
"extremely full on middle and leg, dug out in front of midwicket for a quick single"
"a 98kph length ball that simply comes on with the arm around off, Pandya comes forward and defends"
"full, finds the outside part of the bat as he gets it to turn away late"
"back of a length, a little spin around middle, Hardin shuffles across and blocks"
"just back of a length, sliding in, turned away to the on side"
"shortish on off, punched past the left of point"
"full outside off, Ashwin meets the pitch with a good stride forward and drives crisply to extra cover where Mujeeb dives to his left and stops it. Good cricket all around"
"back of a length on off, blocked into the on side"
"full outside off, pushed into the covers with half a stride forward"
"<b>ooh, how close was that!</b> Rips in sharply from a back of a length outside off. The length may have just been what saved him there as Ashwin shoulders arms and the ball rises over the stumps"
"curves in again but from well outside off, but this time he can safely let it go because of how wide it was to start off with"
"full outside off, Ashwin pushes it back to the bowler off the inside of the bat"
"looks like a googly, on a length, turns in slightly, defended to short leg, the fielder takes it on the shin"
"quick fizzer, skids on middle stump, no turn either way, whipped through vacant midwicket region"
"lobs a middle-stump full-toss, forward and bunted straight to mid-on"
"pretty full and dips on leg stump, clipped past the right of mid-on for one"
"break-back, Ashwin hangs back, <b>tickles this wrong'un</b> onto the pad, the inside edge rolls away past the right of short leg"
"tossed-up legbreak, finishes just a shade outside off, Hardik deploys a small stride to smother it"
"back of a length wider than a set of stumps outside off, Ashwin does not go after it"
"wide of the crease, short and wide outside off, Ashwin now goes after it, lashing a cut to backward point. The ball bursts through the hands of the fielder. India steal three. An overthrow almost offered the fourth run. Discipline, Afghanistan"
"back of a length and much closer to off, Hardik leans back and jabs into the covers"
"that's the ball,  Ahmadzai. Keep putting three-four balls there in a row. Fuller than a good length and just a shade outside off, angling in from wide of the crease and <strong>straightening away past the outside edge</strong>"
"well done, Ahmadzai. One more? Nice and full on a fifth-stump line, draws Hardik forward, he plays for the angle from wide of the crease, but it <strong>nips away past the edge again</strong>"
"Ahmadzai, however, goes short and wide outside off, Hardik exercises caution and leaves it well alone in the corridor"
"floated on off, Ashwin deploys a strong stride and laces a drive to cover"
"<strong>Rashid draws the outside edge with a fizzing legbreak</strong> but it flies past the right of Shahzad at slip. Back of a length, 100.1ks, turns, bounces, Ashwin jabs at it and gets away"
"much fuller and goes straight on outside off, forward and driven through the line to cover"
"dragged short on off, cramps the batsman for room, short-armed to mid-on"
"full and straight, tapped to the right of mid-on"
"pushed through flat on middle, Hardik presses forward and pushes it back to Rashid"
"wide of the crease, angling in at fourth-stump, 132ks, defended back to the bowler off the front foot"
"hip-high short ball outside off, does not come onto Ashwin, this is more a short-arm flap than a short-arm pull. Flapped away to the leg side"
"wide of the crease again, but this full ball holds its line outside off, Hardik pushes drives to mid-off and take on Mujeeb's arm. The throw it at the striker's end, but Ashwin, who isn't as quick as Hardik, makes it"
"chest-hunting short ball at off stump, Ashwin rises with it and fends it off"
"Afghanistan think they have Ashwin caught behind. Is that a clean catch? The soft signal from umpire Gaffney is out. Ashwin walks off even as Rod Tucker examines it. Clean catch, of course. Zazai bends forward to get his gloves underneath the ball. Ahmadzai strikes with the old ball, but this was a loose shot from Ashwin. Thigh-high short ball pushed wide outside off - possibly wider than a set of stumps - Ashwin goes chasing after a cut and under-edges it behind"
"<strong>Ooooh, it could have been two in two for Ahmadzai</strong>, but Zazai the wicketkeeper now drops it. Nice and full outside off, Jadeja is pinned to the crease as he drives away from the body and snicks it behind. Zazai dives across to his left but the ball bursts out but it's also too quick for Nabi at first slip to snaffle it on the rebound. Fortunate four for Jadeja"
"quicker googly, flat and turns in at 95ks, Hardik reads the variation and whips it fluently with the turn to the midwicket fence"
"tossed-up legbreak on middle, defended"
"much slower on off, dead-batted again"
"flat and full on middle, Hardik presses forward and eases it to mid-on"
flighted on off and spins away - Rashid is getting quite a bit of turn with the old ball - sliced off the outside edge to point

Turns in on middle, no bat from Ishant and he has to go. Rashid ends with 2 for 154 on Test debut. Better than Shane Warne who went for 1 for 150 on his debut"

"Hardik Pandya swoops down on the ball from point and throws the stumps down at the non-striker's end. Rocket throw. Runs with the bat: check. Direct hit: check. He catches Shahzad well short. Ishant sends down a short inducker, swerves back in from outside off and cramps the batsman for room, stabbed away and Shahzad chances a single but Pandya tears to his right from point and nails the stumps - all in one motion. Lazy running from Shahzad. He was watching Pandya instead of running. Why was the TV umpire needed for this? Shahzad was waaaay short of the crease"

This was full and straight, from over the wicket, Rahmat plays all around it and is pinned on the back leg below the knee-roll in line with middle.

Shahidi is expecting it to turn away but the ball comes on with the arm to beat the inside edge and hit the pad. Could it be heading down leg? Hard to say with the angle. We will have to wait for ball-tracking. Hitting inside part of middle. That's gone"
