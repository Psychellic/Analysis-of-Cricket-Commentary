"pushed through straight, beats Roy's flick to leg - and <b>given!</b> Roy crinkles up his nose and reviews after a brief chat with his partner. Was he outside the line? If not, he looks a bit stuck here. Nitin Menon hasn't got much wrong on this tour, and <b>umpire's call</b> is the verdict from ball-tracking! Just in line, and going on to smash middle.
