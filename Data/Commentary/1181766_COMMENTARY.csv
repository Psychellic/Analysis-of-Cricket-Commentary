"<b>he's given him first ball!</b> And Saha goes for the review right as the DRS clock was running out. Back of a length, pitched on middle and came back into him. Looks like there was an inside edge too. Saha might not have felt that, because he waited for so long to take a review, and after a long discussion with Guptill. In any case, it looked a little high too. Rolled off the pad towards gully. <b>Not out</b> is the verdict, the right one. Bruce Oxenford was the umpire"
"back of a length on the stumps, pushed towards short cover and they take a quick single"
"he's getting some shape into the right-hander but wrong line that time, strays on the pads and Guptill picks him off to deep square leg"
"good length on the stumps, steered to point. They take a quick single but there's a direct hit at the batsman's end by Amit Mishra. But he was wel lin"
"very full outside off, almost yorker length, Guptill comes on the front foot and pushes it past the bowler. Another quick single"
"<b>shot!</b>. Great timing from Saha, just punches this length ball between cover and point and it finds the boundary"
"good length, in the corridor outside off, Guptill comes on the front foot to reach the pitch of the ball and defend to the offside"
"fuller, on middle, Guptill drives from the crease and Shaw at cover mis-fields, allowing the single"
"<b>through him</b>. Length ball and Ishant gets it to bounce a bit due to his height. Saha is coming forward and has a poke at it, but it goes past his outside edge in the corridor"
"length ball coming into him, Saha is on the move again, but flicks it off his pads to midwicket in the circle"
"<b>that's into the top tier</b>. Guptill seemed to have pre-decided that this ball wasn't going to stay in the field. Length ball on the stumps he takes a step down and hits down the ground with a full, clean swing. Great connection and the ball's disappeared"
"good response by the bowler, dug it in short and it was rising as it went past Guptill, who tried to uppercut it  staying legside of the ball. Misses it and it goes to the keeper"
"good length, angling across him, punched to point"
"good length but on the pads, and he tucks it to square leg"
"strays in line again, ends up on the pads and Guptill tucks it fine. Short fine leg has to run behind the ball to pull it in before it hits the boundary"
"goes wider outside off that time and very full. In the driving range, but Guptill could only toe-end the drive to cover"
"<b>he's spliced it for six!</b>. Boult went wide outside off again and Guptill threw his hands at it, one hand ended up coming off the bat and the bat also turned in his hand, but he still got enough on it to loft it over the cover boundary"
"<b>smashed</b>. That's just disdainfully put away. Short and wide outside off, and Guptill thrashes his cut shot well over the point boundary. That was hit very hard"
"<b>taken at mid-off</b>. Saha has been going hard in the Powerplay and he wanted to continue that, but he mis-timed this horribly. Got it off the end of the bat, and instead of lofting it over extra cover, the ball looped to mid-off, where Shreyas Iyer backpedalled and caught it comfortably"
"slower ball, it's the knuckle ball he's been practising perhaps? Held on the pitch and Guptill was too early into the tuck, gets a thick leading edge that floats past the bowler. Not near enough to attempt a catch"
"almost yorker length and Pandey pats it back to Ishant, who parries it away to mid-on and they get a single"
"that's a free gift, straying on the pads and all Guptill had to do was get a bit of bat on it. Tickles it fine and collects the boundary"
"good comeback, almost yorker length on middle and off and Guptill drives it back to the bowler"
"was backing away to give himself room to have a thrash at it, but Ishant follows him with one that is nipping back in. Guptill ends up pushing it towards silly mid-on and thinks about a single, but is sent back"
"darting in on a length, pushed towards point"
"fuller length on middle, he defends towards cover off the front foot"
"gives himself room and cuts this from in front of the stumps, but can't get past point"
"skips down the track, gets to the pitch of the ball and strokes it past extra cover"
"<b>wham</b>. Guptill is in the mood today. Axar dragged it short, perhaps expecting Guptill to step out. The batsman stayed put, rocked back and pulled it powerfully over deep square leg"
"good length, going with the angle, he misses the flick and it hits him high on the pad. Going down leg"
"<b>misfield goes for four</b>. Length ball outside off, driven on the up, and Shreyas Iyer at mid-off was going to his left. Wanted to pick it up and throw it back quickly for a possible run out, ends up missing it and the ball goes for four"
"good length on the stumps, steered to point"
"slower ball again, he waits for it and clips it to mid-on for a quick single"
"back of a length, coming into him and cramps Guptill for room, who was backing away. He jabs it towards point for a quick single"
"<b>top edge goes to fine leg</b> He's bowled a bouncer, but without protection in the deep. Pandey knows that, and he goes for the hook. Gets a top edge but since there's no fielder, he gets a boundary. Landed centimetres inside the rope, so it's just four"
"back of a length outside off, slower one. He waits for it and whips to midwicket, where Dhawan swoops down on the ball and has a shy at the stumps because they were thinking of a run, but misses."
"back of a length on off, and some gentle turn, Guptill punches to mid-off"
"given some more air and pitched fuller, Pandey was clearing his front leg, but it hurried on to him. Bunted to midwicket"
"<b>caught at deep midwicket</b>. That's huge wicket, because Guptill was looking ominous. Very full on middle, in the slot to slog-sweep, which is exactly what Guptill does. Makes decent connection too, but that is the long part of the boundary and there is a man there, who runs to his left and pouches it safely."
"nicely flighted and dipping on him, he wants to work it away but gets a leading edge that bounces to the bowler's right, in front of mid-on. Well in front"
"stays back and slashes this past point, too short and wide enough to play the shot. There's protection in the deep though"
too full and Williamson comes on the front foot to flick it to long-on's right
"back of a length on the stumps, he goes deep in his crease to flick it off his pads to deep square"
"bouncer, he ducks under it, but too high."
"and that is one down legside, so it'll be another wide"
"good length on the stumps, clipped off his pads to deep midwicket"
"pace off the ball, full one outside off, Williamson pushes it towards mid-off. That was just 106 kph"
"gets it to move off the seam, but ends up on the pads and Williamson tucks it to fine leg"
"<b>big appeal for lbw, not given</b>. They don't take the review. Fuller length, tailing into him, but he had moved a little bit and though it hit his pads with Pandey missing the punch, it would have gone down leg"
Keemo needs to get his line sorted. Another one well down leg side and another wide
"slower ball again, Williamson waits for it and punches, but short cover fields"
"tossed up on the stumps and he brings out the sweep, but plays it along the ground. Got nicely on top of it. Keemo runs to his left at the midwicket boundary, tumbles and saves."
"good length outside off, slapped to point"
"good length, patted back to the bowler"
"gets it to drift and cramps Pandey for room, who was looking to back away. He ends up punching it from close to his body into the offside"
"another dot ball, floated up around off and he taps it back to the bowler off the front foot"
"top spinner, hurries on to him and he pushes it towards point, wants a single but is sent back"
"stayed back to this fuller length one to chop it away, but gets the bottom edge. Lucky for him, it rolls past the stumps"
"slightly shorter, spinning away from middle and Pandey wants to slap it away, but can't go past cover"
gives himself room and pushes towards mid-off
"gets this to bounce a bit more off a length, but Williamson has gone deep in his crease so he's able to pat it down from waist high"
"good length outside off, he waits for it and strokes it to deep point"
goes back and across and swats it to long-on
"width, and he cuts this away towards sweeper cover"
"length, outside off, and beats the outside edge as he looks to run it down towards third man"
"length, and holds up again, just beats the outside of the bat, possibly a slight edge, as <strong>Pant drops it</strong>!"
"tossed up, googly, and he drives this down to long off"
"lofts a length ball back over the bowler, and long off runs around to stop this down the ground"
"tossed up again, turns away from him, and he plays it towards point with the turn"
"tossed up, and he drives this towards cover"
"tossed up, outside off, and he goes for the big drive. Bails whipped off, and <strong>they go upstairs to check for the stumping!</strong> Seems to be ok, as the back leg seems planted inside when Pant effected the stumping. Given not out"
"short, and he goes back and cuts this beyond point. Placed well to the right of short third man. Uses the pace of the ball from Patel effectively"
"short, and he goes back to cut this but misses the ball"
"short, and he goes back to pull this. Somehow muscles it past Dhawan at short midwicket, but again, not off the middle of the bat"
"length, and he goes back and punches this to sweeper cover"
"length, and he slogs this towards deep midwicket"
goes back to a length ball and punches this towards extra cover
"tossed up, outside off, and he pushes this to cover and takes a quick single to Shreyas Iyer"
"short, and he cuts this towards backward point"
"length, and he goes back and nurdles this towards long leg"
"tossed up, outside off, and he punches this towards long off"
"length ball, and he drives this towards cover, where Prithvi Shaw dives to his left, and quickly releases it to the non-striker's end. Doesn't hit, though"
"full ball, and he scoops it away towards backward point"
"slower ball, and he looks to flick this, but hasn't timed it all. It goes towards long on, where Rutherford doesn't need to move a muscle as it comes straight into his midriff. <b>Foxed by the change of pace, and Pandey is put out of his misery, just when he was probably beginning to find his bearings</b>"
"slower ball, outside off, and he drives this towards backward point"
"fuller ball, and he drives it down the ground to long on as it tails into him a touch"
"short, and down the leg side, and he gets the leg glance going, but cannot beat long leg"
"slower ball, outside off, and he punches this towards sweeper cover"
"length, and he flicks it off his hips"
"short, and goes down the leg side. Will have to re-bowl this. Quite a few wides bowled already in this innings"
"slower ball, wide of off stump, and Williamson waits on it and gets it in front of square with a drive"
"length, cuts back into him, and he drops it with soft hands. They go for the quick single, and Rutherford tries to kick the stumps down, but he misses. They will pick up an overthrow, as it completely wrong-footed Pant behind the stumps!"
"slower ball, comes back into him, and he drops it at his feet. Too close to him to consider going for a run"
"goes for the lap shot, and it takes the top edge and skews towards third man. Just beyond the reach of Amit Mishra at short third man. Was looking to go over fine leg, but the slow pace of the ball forced the mistake. <strong>Lucky to survive!</strong>"
"starts with a slower ball, at the pads, and he flicks it towards long leg"
"length, and he jumps up and cuts this away, but cannot get it beyond backward point"
"slower ball, comes into him, and he tries to flick this. Comes into him and hits his pads"
"slower ball, and he has got a hold of this, <strong>whipping it in the air towards deep backward square leg</strong>. Boult dives to his right, in going for the catch, but it lands just ahead of him, and goes through for four"
"<strong>yorker, and pegged to perfection!</strong> Williamson backs away to create some room and go through the off side, but is beaten by both the pace and length of it. Tails back in sharply and hits the base of off stump. Williamson goes, and could prove to be a good thing for Sunrisers, as he looked physically a bit less than 100 percent"
"length ball, some width, and Nabi cuts this past point. Superb bit of timing, as it gave Munro no chance to cut it off!"
"length, and he hits this hard back down the ground. Beats Patel, but there's protection in the shape of long off"
"length, and he plays it fine towards third man. Just waited for it to come to him, and ran it down past short third man. May have been a bit more of an edge than he intended, but the intent was there"
blocks a length ball on off stump
"length, played towards point. Shankar runs almost halfway down the wicket, but is sent back. There's no throw anyway"
"short, and he swings this away towards long leg"
"length, and he has lofted this over midwicket. <strong>Terrific timing from Vijay Shankar</strong>, as Patel's four overs come to an end"
"full ball, outside off, and Nabi looks to go big down the ground, but misses out on contact"
"full, in the slot, and he biffs this straight back over the bowler's head. Couple of bounces, and through for four, between long off and long on"
"banged in shorter, a bit quicker, and he misses out on an attempted pull"
"full ball, he looks to go towards long on, and gets an inside egde on to his pad and it trickles away towards short cover"
"short, and he has got a hold of this, putting it beyond the reach of long leg. Uses the pace of the ball effectively"
"full, and he crashes this down the ground to long off"
"Boult is greeted with an inside-out shot, over extra cover, and almost all the way for six!"
"length, wide of off stump, and he goes inside out again. Shreyas Iyer gets to it, but cannot hold on. Tried to get it back in, with Shikhar Dhawan near him, but it still lands beyond the boundary!"
"length, and he goes across the line this time, and holes out to deep midwicket! <b>Vijay Shankar is filthy with himself</b>, because that was again a ball that could have gone for four or six, but instead gives Delhi a wicket"
"yorker, and he flicks this away towards Shaw, who has a fumble at long leg, and that allows them to come back for the second"
"full, wide of off stump, and he tries to reach it but can't. Called wide, as it went just beyond the tramlines"
"yorker, and he keeps it out, playing it back to Boult"
"length, but slower, and he drags this down towards long on"
"slower ball, wide of off stump, and called wide, as it goes beyond the tramlines"
"yorker, and he biffs this away towards long leg"
"slower ball, outside off, and Nabi tries to go big over covers. Misses"
"no-ball, and he has <strong>driven this straight down the ground over long on</strong>! Too much of a length ball, but he overstepped to begin with. Free hit now!"
"full, wide of off stump, and he misses out on contact as he looks to run it towards point"
"slower ball, and he looks to go towards point, but <strong>hasn't been able to clear backward point</strong>! He has been having trouble picking up Paul's slower ball, and this was another off-cutter just wide of off stump, and he went for the right choice of shot, but sliced it as he tried to go towards the backward point fence"
"slower ball, outside off, and they have tried to go for a single. There's a throw at the non-striker's end. The batsman collided with the bowler. They are conferring about whether Shreyas Iyer wants to withdraw the appeal. The umpires. Iyer, Rishabh Pant everybody in there. And eventually Delhi want the appeal to stand. Paul was looking to go for the ball, and in the process his leg stuck out a bit as Hooda was getting to the non-striker's end. It was also called a wide, by the way"
"slower ball, and he looks to go towards midwicket, but gets an edge, through to Pant behind  the wicket"
"slower ball, and he swings this hard, and it goes off the toe-end towards short third man"
"length, angles into him, and he defends this towards mid on"
"short, outside off, and he loses a bit of shape as he looks to play this towards mid on. Gets it away to square leg"
"<b>crunched</b>. Dhawan's making the new ball count. He's in super form and it shows, not that far outside off, but he punches this through cover. Wasn't that short, wasn't that wide, but he just got his timing perfect."
bad ball and that's punished. Good length on the pads and all he needs to do is time his flick - and Dhawan's timing in the second half this IPL has been sublime. He moves across and flicks to the square leg boundary
"fuller length, pushed into the offside for a single"
"short, and he plays it away towards midwicket"
"good length, not much turn away from him. Slapped to cover"
"given some more air and that turned more from a length, chopped to point"
"flatter and darting in closer to off stump, Dhawan opens the face and steers to point's right"
"floated up, stump to stump, patted back to the bowler"
"tossed up on off, and squirted past cover off an outside edge. He was looking to go a lot straighter"
"flatter and skiddier, Dhawan punches to cover"
"bouncer first up and Shaw is late on the pull, as it flies past him. Nicely done by the bowler"
"<b>that's a much more confident shot</b>. Back of a length and doesn't rise as much, he spots it and transfers weight back, pulls it to the long-on boundary"
"<b>shot!</b> Fully in control of this pull shot. The last one had gone slightly lower on the bat, this is right off the middle. Goes deep in his crease and goes bang to the midwicket boundary"
"wanted to go for the pull again, but misses"
"<b>smashed</b>. Khaleel's short ones were getting hit, so he goes full this time outside off, and Shaw just pummels it through cover for another four"
"back of length on the stumps again and he swivels to pull, but it's a touch quicker so he doesn't time it all that well and deep square leg fields"
"length ball turning into him, chopped to point"
"<b>dropped by Thampi at mid-off!</b> that should have been taken. Shaw chipped this in the air and Thampi had to hold it low to his left, but he tumbled and lost balance, as well as the ball"
""
"beaten, straighter one and he was playing inside line"
"flatter on the stumps, he goes back and whips this to midwicket"
"<b>innovation and class</b>. Brings out the reverse sweep, times and places it to perfection, past slip, past the man in the circle and to the third man fence"
"<b>smacked towards the midwicket boundary</b> but Rashid Khan hares along and dives to save runs. Too short, and he picked it up early and nicely, pulled in front of square"
down the legside and he will have to rebowl that
"<b>magnificent</b>. Textbook cover drive to a full ball in the slot. Brings his bat down from high, shows the makers name, and sends it screaming along the ground"
"<b>oh ho ho ho, this young kid is schooling his senior India team-mate</b> Short ball outside off and he upper-cuts it for six over third man. Fielder there, but he was just left standing"
<b>disdain</b>. Length ball outside off and he cross bats it over mid-off as if it's a net session
"and the pressure tells, he's strayed down leg side. Escapes the wide because it clips the pads with Shaw trying to get another four to fine leg"
"full, angling in, and flicked away nicely, but this time straight to short midwicket"
"full ball on the stumps, flicked to short midwicket"
"<b>googly</b> and it beats him. A bit short and Dhawan set himself up to pull, but it turned the other way"
"legspinner this time, but closer to off stump, so Dhawan perhaps thought it was another googly. ends up inside edging onto pad"
"length ball on the stumps, and Dhawan paddles it fine"
"<b>oh my word, that's some shot</b>. Doesn't care that it's Rashid, doesn't care that his googly and leggie is difficult to read. Spots that this is the leggie in fact and it's a touch fuller, smacks it over extra cover with a full-blooded swing"
"googly again, stays back and turns it towards midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, cuts it nicely to deep point, but the Powerplay is over, so there's protection there"
"back of a length outside off, cuts it nicely but straight to point"
"slower ball, angling into him from around the wicket, Dhawan was looking to drive, adjusts and pats it back"
"good length outside off, steered to third man"
"good length, and close to off, but he's timing it so well, he's punched it from there to point by opening the face. There's a fielder there, who jumps up to field"
"finishes with a bouncer, and Shaw is a little late in trying to ramp it over the keeper, and doesn't connect"
"floated up full and on the stumps, nudged into the legside for a quick single"
"<b>down the track and over the boundary</b>. Shaw is in the mood tonight. Was skipping down quickly, got to the pitch and smashed it over long-on"
"Hooda shortens his length after that last ball, Shaw stays in his crease and cuts it away to deep cover"
"<b>brilliant work by Saha</b>. Dhawan gave him the charge and Hooda spotted that and smartly bowled it down leg. Saha had to move well to his right to collect and then come back to whip the bails off, which he does before Dhawan can ground his bat. It'll be a wide, but the important thing is, they've broken the opening stand"
"fetches this from outside off to paddle it fine, first ball"
"<b>Rashid to the rescue at deep point again</b>. Ran to his left from deep cover, and slid to save the boundary. Shaw had cut this powerfully"
walks across and taps this to midwicket to raise a fine <b>fifty</b>. He's come back into the runs in style
"googly goes wrong, pitches outside leg and turns further away. Wide"

"good length on the fourth stump line, he stays in his crease and glides it to third man by opening the face"

"good length outside off, stands tall and punches to cover"
"good length, keeping it stump to stump, slower ball this time. He moves behind it and punches to long on with a straight bat"
"moves across and clips this off his pads, places it well enough to beat short fine leg and get a couple"
backs away and wanted to thwack that through extra cover but misses it. Just outside off so it misses the stumps too. Bounces awkwardly in front of Saha and off his pads for a bye
"back of a length, angling across, Shaw pulls but there is a deep square leg"
"<b>got him!</b> Khaleel has got the breakthrough. Good length in the corridor, and Iyer wanted to glide it to third man, it bounced a bit more than he expected, took a thin edge through to Saha. Weird little celebration by Khaleel, gesturing making a phone call. Perhaps he's saying you've been called back?"
"good length on the fourth stump line, he stays in his crease and glides it to third man"
pulls this slower one to midwicket
"straighter, and he works it off his pads a tad awkwardly to fine leg"
"<b>caught at point!</b> Khaleel's making a second phone call. Big wicket. Back of a length, pacier one at 141 kph, and Shaw is too late into the pull. Gets a top edge that loops to point, and suddenly this chase has come alive."

"tossed up, angles away, and this time he defends"
"angles into him from around the wicket, and he runs this down to long on"

"comes down the wicket again, and misses the line of a length ball, bowled at <strong>122.5kph</strong> by Thampi"

"slower, short ball, and he rolls his wrist to get this towards deep backward square leg"
"length, turns back into him, and it's given out leg before. Munro was going across the line, and <strong>he has asked for a review</strong>! Rashid seems to have done the job, as there is no visible inside edge.

"tossed up, googly, angles across, and beats the outstretched forward defensive. <strong>Great bowling, Rashid!</strong>"
"turns back into him, takes the inside edge and trickles off his body, and Saha claims this! What a catch, and another wicket for Sunrisers Hyderabad. <strong>Rashid Khan turning it on when his team needs it!</strong> Bowling quick, and getting some purchase from the surface. This is turning into a great period for the former champions, as they are putting the squeeze on this young batting lineup. Replays reveal it has hit the pad, though. They don't have a review though"
"leg break, that beats an attempted heave down the pitch. Rutherford didn't read it"
"leg break, did it take the edge, as it trickled towards short fine leg? Never mind, it has fallen short. They have disturbed the stumps at the striker's end, but Rutherford was back!"

"length, and turns away, and Rutherford is just about able to get his body behind it"
"turns from a length, and gets the inside edge, and nearly bounces on to the stumps"

"length, and he has gone down the ground towards midwicket again. <strong>Guess how many...</strong>"
"full ball, and he drives this down to long on"
"length, and he looks to run it down to third man. Inside edge takes it to short fine leg, and slow enough for them to go through for a quick single"

"length, angles across Pant, who plays this towards point"
"length, and he has gone high, and handsome. Over long off. There you go -- <strong>the first six this IPL through the off side</strong>"
"very short ball, and he looks to ramp this over third man. Called wide, because he couldn't reach this"
"length, and he plays this back towards Bhuvneshwar. The bowler goes down, and seems to have twisted his right ankle. Hopefully, nothing serious..."
"full ball, and he has gone for a one-handed shot, and spliced this up. <strong>Pant is gone!</strong> Kumar floated this away outside off again, and Pant went for the glory shot, just like Rutherford. And he's picked up by Nabi, just like Rutherford. <i>Surely</i>, they cannot lose this from here?"

"slower ball, outside off, and he has whipped this towards midwicket. <strong>They want two, but will have to make do with one!</strong>"
"length ball, and he misses it. It goes through to Saha, and Mishra runs across for the run. They have asked for a review, because the throw didn't hit the stumps. <strong>Did he obstruct the field, though?</strong> There's no outside edge on it. The ball went through to Saha, who had a shy at the stumps. Oh, was the call for caught-behind? In which case, it's not out, obviously. So Sunrisers lose their review. They have a look at this again. Mishra does change his angle a bit towards the ball. Could it be obstructed the field then? Has the ball hit Mishra? <b>It has, and this out!</b> What an Eliminator this is turning out to be. Do Delhi want to win this or not?"
"short ball, and he has sent this through Vijay Shankar's reach at midwicket for four! Delhi have just about held their nerve. What should have been a canter at one stage, has turned into an absolute humdinger, but Delhi make the date for Qualifier 2 against Chennai Super Kings!"
