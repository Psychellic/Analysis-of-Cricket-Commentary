"slower ball, tried to paddle it, was too early into the shot, spoons up off the pad, but falls short of short fine leg."
"gave himself room to have a thrash at it, but absolutely not timing on that flat-batted slap from down on one knee. Only trickles to mid-off"
"nails the placement this time, though a valiant effort from Green at the midwicket boundary. Short ball and he rocks back to pull fiercely.

"short ball outside off, he fetches the pull from there and connects, but a dive to his right by mid-off ensures there's no boundary"
"<b>Stoinis has shovelled this down long-on's throat</b>. I'ts more of a deep mid-on almost. Full ball on the stumps, he went deep and used his powerful wrists to hit it sweetly - but straight to the man. is there a twist in the tale?"
"whoa, what a shot! He was shaping to pull this, but changed his mind at the last moment because it was a slower bouncer. Ends up hanging his bat and it takes the outside edge to fly past the keeper"
"<b>run out chance missed</b> at the non-striker's end. Pressure, pressure! There was no run there with the ball tapped down the wicket, but they went for the run anyway. Handscombe was miles out as Sams sprinted down the track, gathered the ball and had a shy, but missed the stumps."
"<b>caught behind!</b> What is happening to the Stars. Three wickets in the last nine balls when they were cruising. This was a full ball outside off, and Maxwell tried to steer it fine, but only snicked it through to the keeper."

"<b>run out chance missed</b> - second one in two overs. Fuller on the stumps, just tapped it towards mid-on and ran. Bit of scrambled thinking there. Mid-on ran in and had a shy, but missed the stumps."

"yorker length outside off, driven off the front foot by opening the bat face, but can't beat cover"
"misses the yorker, ends up as a full toss outside off, flicked to deep square leg. Could have had a boundary, but a single will also do for Stars"

"full ball tailing in, inside edges the flick onto pad. No run."
"yorker on the fifth stump, he shuffles across and taps it towards square leg. They sneak a quick single"
"<b>caught at mid-on</b>. Ho ho ho, this match is not over yet folks. Full and straight delivery, NCN, moved across and flicked it off his toes, timed it well actually. but there is a wide mid-on in place - in addition to the shorter, straighter mid-on, and he picks him out perfectly."
"<b>trapped him lbw</b> Oh my word, this is a thriller like no other. Length ball, jagged in and hit him on the knee roll of the back leg. Terrible choice of shot, trying to swipe across the line. The umpire takes an age to raise his finger, but he does it eventually. Stars fleetingly would have thought they won it by running a leg-bye. Not quite yet."
"<b>Zampa's done it for Stars</b>. Finally. Full ball tailing into him, he nudges it past square leg and they scamper the winning run comfortably."
