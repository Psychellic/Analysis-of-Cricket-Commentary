"that's a <b>ripper</b> as it nips away off the seam from back of a length, climbs nicely past the outside edge"
"<B>edged, and gone!</b> Doesn't take Hazlewood long to make his mark. It's short-of-a-length outside off, Roy pushing away from his body and sends a regulation edge to Paine. That's trademark stuff from Hazlewood (and, in a sense, Roy as well). To be fair, was a good delivery from Hazlewood but exposes that technique of Roy"

"a fuller delivery, at off stump, 87mph, Root presses forward and pushes to cover"

"full and straight, forced to mid-on. Impressive stuff from Hazlewood"
"round the wicket now, back of a length outside off, left alone"

"and again from Root! Too full from Cummins, the captain strides into the ball and sends it through the same spot at cover"
"good response, drags his length back and it nips off the seam into Root, takes an inside edge into his pads"

"gets him driving, floated up and punched past the cover fielder for a couple"
flat outside off and defended coming across
"skids into the pad, Gaffaney shakes his head... but Australia <b>review</b>, was it clipping leg stump? Struck in line but there was <i>just</i> enough turn to take it down, according to Hawk-Eye! So Australia will lose what turned out to be a speculative review"

That is one of the great short leg grabs"
and gets a short one first up! Sways out of the line...been a clear change of plan from Australia since lunch

lines this one up in defence on off stump
tossed up and spinning through to the keeper as Stokes lets it go
"plants the front foot and attempts to paddle, hit on the pad - <b>up goes the finger!</b> Stokes waits motionless for a long time, but won't be reviewing! Mulling over his choice of shot, perhaps, seemingly unsettled by seeing the ball turn so much from outside his off stump; looked pretty adjacent on first viewing, Chris Gaffaney giving it straight away, and Hawk-Eye reckons it would have toppled leg stump"
"pushed through on the stumps, poked away off the back foot"
"floated up, Woakes presses out to defend"
"spinning in, shouts of catch as he goes back, the ball drops safely"

"fuller at the stumps, defended...he's overstepped"
big appeal for caught behind! Another short ball. No one is really sure and at the last minute Root calls the <B>review</B>. Cummins was trying to get out of the line. This may actually be one of the worst reviews of all time. Nowhere near anything. Move on

"<b>oh dear!</B> He's been clattered here by the short ball. He's down. This is nasty. Took him on the unprotected part of the neck. The medics are out there straightaway, from both sides, and the England players have immediately gone to Smith. These are not scenes you want to see. Smith is lying on his back in the crease as he gets seen to by medical staff. Everyone will take the utmost care here with Smith. He's standing up again. He looks dazed. Talking to the doctor now.

"bouncer, he ducks"
"full and straight, played back to the bowler"
"over the wicket, pitches outside leg, tapped to the leg side"

"length ball outside off, Stokes charges down and aims to drive through the covers but doesn't make contact"
"now he tries to pull a back-of-a-length delivery, doesn't really get up and scoots under the bottom edge"
ouch! Misses the pull again and gets a painful blow in a delicate area...he manages a smile
"this takes the bottom edge as he's again walking down the crease, beats leg stump towards fine leg...a rapid fifty stand between this pair"
"length ball outside off, tries to steer it away but can't beat gully"

"there it is! Clipped off the toes through square leg and that's a brilliant <B>century</B> from Stokes. His seventh Test hundred, second at Lord's - 54 balls for the second fifty"

"low full toss, lofted straight down the ground...not sure that quite came out of the middle"

"length ball, checked drive, <strong>punched out to the cover boundary</strong>! What a start for Warner, a little wide maybe but a clear sign of intent"

"length again and goes on with the angle from around the wicket, Warner shapes to drive but it nips off the seam and finds the inside edge"
"just full of a length, 83.3mph, and left alone outside off stump. Bit of a loosener"
"similar ball, 85.3mph, and Bancroft is unconvincing playing this. Looks to drive, and hits the inside edge"

"length again, straighter this time and defended firmly off the back foot"
"length outside off and flies up off the surface, <strong>Warner flashes and misses</strong>! Extra bounce, looked to upper cut and was late on it. Piercing glare from Broad"

"full, inswinger at 86.6mph, and shoveled into the leg side for a single"

"<strong>got him!</strong> Length ball, doesn't do much off the pitch but Warner dangles his bat - prods at it really - and the ball flies off the outside edge into the gully where Burns takes a sharp low catch. What a start for England..."

"full and straight, driven tentatively to mid-on"
"slightly wider this time, angling into fourth stump, and well defended"

"similar ball, and left alone this time"
"fuller, straight, and <strong>finds the outside edge</strong>! But played with soft enough hands to fly to Root on the bounce"

"<strong>got him! </strong>Length ball, similar to the first of the over, and takes the outside edge this time! Khawaja hangs around for 15 seconds, thinking about the review... but decides against. Big, big strike for England!"
"fiery bumper, welcome to Ashes cricket, Marnus. 89mph, fierce short ball, and too high"
"<strong>hit him!</strong> Oh my, 91.6mph, another short one and this one flies up into the helmet. Labuschagne jumps straight back up to his feet, but the medical team run straight on. Took him completely by surprise, kept his eyes on it but it got big on him, bat nowhere near it, stayed right in the way of it, and flush into the grille. My word, what a snorter that was."
"length ball outside off, fends at it but doesn't find the edge"
"same again, no sort of shot really and Archer's tail is well and truly up as he beats Labuschagne again"
"full outside off stump, and driven away out towards cover. 84.1mph, which seems pedestrian compared to what is happening at the other end"
"length ball, gets up well and Bancroft chips it around the corner for an unconvincing single"
"length ball on fifth stump, 84.9mph, no movement off the seam, and decides to let it go at the last moment"

"length again, angled in towards off stump, and shoveled into the leg side. Broad has his hands on his head."
"<strong>wow wow wow! </strong>Just full of a length from Broad, tickled round the corner by Bancroft, and Stokes has literally just been moved from leg slip to leg gully so it is out of his reach! All happening."
"<strong>snorter </strong>again, 90.5mph from Archer who has the wood over Labuschagne. Length ball outside off, fends at it and misses"
"fuller this time, and played very well. A little bit of a half-volley, to be frank, and times the push through extra cover sweetly to race away down the slope"
"<strong>beaten again</strong>, on fourth or fifth stump, full of a length and Marnus is nowhere near this"
"short ball, 88.9mph, drops the glove and sways out the line of it. Chest height, or maybe collarbone, and played pretty well"
"beaten again, 89.1mph, full, fourth stump, you know the rest. Archer all over Australia"
"straighter this time, on off stump, and squirted away down the slope through gully off the outside edge. Played with soft hands and some semblance of control, but hardly convincing!"

"fuller, on fourth stump at 88.3mph, and blocked into the off side"
"back of a length, high front elbow, rolls out to mid-on on the defence"

"nicely bowled, drops it on a good length at middle, straightens a touch and is defended"

"that's not his best delivery, short and wide, left alone"
"back of a length at middle and off, defended to the off side"
"cuts him half again! Jags back from short of a length, cannons off the pad to the off side, Labuschagne scampering for the non-striker's end. Burns throws at the stumps, misses, and it's four overthrows"
