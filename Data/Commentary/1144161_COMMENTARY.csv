"length ball, and he defends off the front foot. The ball trickles down towards long on"
"<strong>WHAT A SHOT!</strong> He goes down to try and paddle, and Ashraf fires it outside off, and he is able to adjust enough to dink it over third man...all the way for SIX!"

The front foot is fine, the ball has definitely missed the edge from the look of things. Bowled at 131kph, but <em>nowhere near </em>the edge. Will be given not out"
"full ball, and he has smashed it straight down the pitch...where <strong>Malik has taken a stinger of a catch</strong>! Fielding at mid off, Malik takes the ball low down to his left to get rid of his counterpart, who has played a peach of an innings here at Newlands.

"short, and he plays it with an open face towards point. Wasim has a shy, but misses..."

"oh dear! Comes down the wicket, looks to swing at a length ball, outside off, and <em>misses by a province</em>!"
"short, and outside off, and he cuts it away. Gets it square enough, and fine enough too. <strong>Good shot!</strong>"
"length ball, and he whips it off the front foot towards square leg"
"<strong>great ball!</strong> Pitches on a length, and then bounces awkwardly back into him. He was looking to get the ball away on the on side, and the ball rose enough to beat the bat and hit his right forearm"

"slower full toss, and he is able to maneouvre it away towards midwicket. They look for two...and get it again!"

"length ball, angles into him, and he tucks it away towards short third man and picks up one"
"looks for a slower ball, full, but cooks it down the leg side, and wide"

"short in length, angles across him, and he flogs it down towards short midwicket"
"short, and angles across Azam. Slower through the air, and it is called wide for starting from outside off and moving further away"

"full ball, and he looks to go across the line. Strikes him on the pad as he shaped to play it towards midwicket. Are they going to go for a review? Yes, they eventually do.

Seems to pitch ok, and there's no sign of an inside edge. Where it goes on to hit is the big question now. Hit his back leg, so he could be in trouble. Impact in line, but wickets...is umpire's call. <em>Ah, close!</em>"
"short, and he whips it towards short midwicket, to his left"

"length, and he advances a step down the pitch before whipping him away towards long leg"
"short, and he looks to pull, and almost gets it straight down the throat of the man protecting the backward square leg fence"
"presses forward and flicks a length ball towards midwicket. They have gone through for two, and the ball is returned to Cloete, who whips the bails off. The ball was a bit high for the keeper, and that allows Azam to just make it. Referred, but given not out"

"gone for it again, and this has gone in the air! <strong>TAKEN BY BEURAN HENDRICKS!</strong> The pressure tells in the end on Talat. Went for successive big hits, and this time ended up top-edging an attempted biff down the ground. Taken at long off, moving further away to his right. Good catch in the end"

"short, outside off, and he nurdles it down to third man"

"fuller, and he has tried to get this towards short midwicket. David Miller is first to it, and he has hit the stumps! <strong>It's GONE!</strong> What a sensational bit of work to get the man who had his eye in. <strong>Advantage South Africa!</strong> A superb under-arm effort that catches Azam off guard as he was looking to back up at the non-striker's end"

"short, and he swings it with the turn towards long leg"
"<strong>INNOVATIVE!</strong> Switches to a reverse pose, and then hammers a length ball outside off past point"
"MILLER TAKES A SUPERB CATCH! It's shorter, and Wasim looks to biff this over midwicket, but cannot clear Miller who runs around from long on, took the catch, and then made sure he stayed clear of the ropes. <i>Shamsi celebrates with a couple of switch hits in the air of his own!</i>"
"outside off, and spins sharply away as it beats the outside edge as Ashraf looks to poke at it"
"length, outside off, sharp turn again, and beats his bat. Cloete takes the bails off, but he was inside"

"slower ball, outside off, and he looks to drive it down the ground, but ends up going square towards backward point"
"slower ball again, bowled at 102kph, and shorter, and Rizwan can only drag a pull down towards long leg"

"slower ball, and he has gone for a drive, but top-edged it. <strong>Beuran Hendricks drops it at short third man</strong>, but South Africa may have Rizwan as he looks to go for the second! <strong>It's Miller again!</strong> That man can do no wrong today in the field. Hendricks' throw from short third man failed to beat Rizwan, who would have been short, at the striker's end, but then Miller swoops in from midwicket to take the attempted overthrow attempt into a wicket for South Africa with a direct hit. <b>Phew!</b>"
"length ball, angled across him, and he runs it down towards third man"

"length, outside off, and he cuts it towards point, and gets it wide enough of the fielder!"
