"touch leg side, 135kph/84mph on a length and worked off the pads for a single to the boundary rider"
"full toss, YJB whips it away off his pads and mid-on misfields, meaning England try to come back for three... Looks like a run-out chance but <b>Hope dropped the ball!</b> Hales was on his shirt front diving for the line, but Hope didn't have the ball in his gloves when he brokes the bails!"
"sliding across outside off, swing and a miss from a flat-footed Hales"
"gets a touch straight again, worked for one"
"short of a length, outside leg stump and Bairstow tries to let it go, wears it on the thigh pad... and Cottrell races after it to prevent a run"

"short outside off, dropped down behind Allen at backward point for a single"
"slashed and gone - <b>taken by the diving Bishoo at backward point!</b> West Indies have their breakthrough, bit of a loose shot and YJB is gone early. Cottrell was so excited he nearly forgot to do his celebration there. Nearly"

Clipped the bat, then deflected off the thigh pad, Hope tumbling to his right for a low catch. Everything going right for West Indies right now"

"length around off stump, met coming forwards"
"good length, Denly prods it back down the ground for one"
"angled in with the arm, tapped back"

"back of a length, tight line, tapped down into the crease"
"nudged to the leg side, back in the crease. England forced to do a bit of rebuilding here"

"good loping approach to the crease with his left-arm line, full length outside off"

tapped to the off side
"on the pads, flipped to the leg side, they scamper back for two, and <strong>they are taking a look upstairs...</strong> Now then, the bat has bounced, but was it grounded first behind the line? This would have been out under the old rules... he's safe ..."

"retreating to leg, meeting the full toss with a bosh to cover"
"reverse dab, lots of manoeuvring at the crease, but just the single to backward square"
<B>impeccably deflected!</B> That's Root at his finest... opening the face and lacing this through third man like the Tailor of Gloucester's mice with the last of the cherry twist
"angled once again behind point, not quite so much finesse, but every bit as much placement"
"on the back foot, and whisked to the leg side"

"back of a length this time, thumped with intent in front of square as he picks the slower ball"
"looking for the sweep, but adjusting to meet a very wide line outside off, tapped through third man"
"bottom-handed biff, on the up to the leg side, they hustle back for two ... but the shy is good and <strong>umpire Brathwaite doesn't even look upstairs!</strong> Great work from Allen in the deep, and Root's fine knock is over. Now then Mr Billings, it's on you now ..."

"short once more, Billings was perhaps expecting the yorker, but flogs another pull to the leg side"
"very straight line, clipped straight to Gayle at short backward square, but that's a single every day of the week. He doesn't bend much these days..."
a valuable dot as Willey slashes outside off
"wide full toss, that could have gone miles, but instead it lands inches short of McCoy at mid-off"

<B>a mix-up!</B> Willey scampers for the crease but just survives as the shy requires a gathering
"punched into the covers, good sharp running again"
"flashed uppishly, out to no-man's land in the covers. Another couple to keep things ticking"
"<B>that's supreme from Billings!</B> A Jos-Buttler-esque paddle-sweep, met on the full way outside off, and lofted over fine leg. Brathwaite's first boundary of his spell"
"<B>four more, but not as intended!</B> Very full, outside off again, Billings is standing on off stump so reaches it with an inside-edge drive past the off stump, and the keeper!"

"<B>another full toss, and here comes Willey!</B> That's the power he can bring to the party, a crashing whoomph through the line, hard into the sightscreen below the commentary box!"
"<B>slower ball, and slotted into the stands!</B> Made room for himself, held his shape before committing to the stroke, and utterly lambasting it!"
"<b>reverse slap through fine leg!</b> That's excellent manipulation, cashing in on the slower ball again, had all the time in the world to pick his spot"
"flogged high and hard down the ground, that's got snow on it! Hetmyer is underneath it, but looks like he'd rather be on Nevis than in Basseterre ... and unsurprisingly, he <B>drops it!</B>"
"leans back, slapped high and hard over extra cover, and <B>Brathwaite punches it over the rope!</B> Tried to punch it back into play, but muffed it"
"<B>short again, slapped again!</B> No-one at midwicket, and Billings is motoring now!"

"length ball on off, Hope makes room and mistimes a hack towards mid-off for one"
"pitched up... <b>and Gayle chips straight to mid-on!</b> A dolly of a catch for Root on the edge of the ring and the crowd goes silent! <i>Massive</i> opening strike for England, Willey canceling out the fact he's wearing a hairband by snaring the Universe Boss"
"touch short, angling in over middle stump, Hetmyer nudges it down into the on side"
"skied into the leg side, Morgan takes it - <b>and then crashes into Curran</b>, both players going for the ball! How has he held on to that?? The England pair take their time in getting up, but looks like just a case of winding. Could have been very nasty, that, both charging towards the ball - only at the last moment did Curran realise it was Morgan's"

"gottim, <b>just a feather to the keeper!</b> Superb line, Bravo stuck on the crease and feeling for it outside off, scraped the edge and zipping through! Jordan gets Bravo for the second match running, though he doesn't have to do his own catching this time... West Indies in trouble now"

"on the stumps, clipped through mid-on"
"length ball, 134kph/83mph and it skids into the bat face, <b>deflected down past off stump!</b> Nearly a fourth for Jordan"
"<b>THAT IS FOUR!</b> Pace and bounce and Allen steers it to slip! England are running riot here, the ball zipping through as the lights take effect... They might not be needed for long"

"goes big again, <b>picks out deep midwicket this time!</b> Brathwaite loses his footing heaving across the line and ends up in a heap - which is pretty much where West Indies are, seven down in the seventh over!"
"pushes through a googly from over the wicket, Bishoo drops back on off and blocks"
"full on leg stump, 141kph/88mph to start with, clipped through square to the sweeper"

short and nipping away as Bishoo feels for it and is beaten
"dug in, 136kph/85mph on the hip and worked down to fine leg"
"short ball, huuuuuuuuuuuuge top edge... <b>taken at the third attempt!</b> Willey scurried in and got underneath it at square leg, the ball squirmed out and then he juggled it as he fell, before finally coming to a rest on his backside with the ball on his lap! That's Hetmyer gone, and West Indies in serious danger of being bowled out inside 10 overs here"

"<B>zipped through the gate, and back goes the middle stump!</B> Well, hello the second ten overs. This could be brief ... lovely length, utterly bamboozled"

"a slip and a leg slip, as McCoy waves his bat at a big googly, as if seeing it off from Southampton Dock"
"slapped heartily out to deep cover, plugs just out of reach of the encroaching Jordan"
tucked to midwicket
"slides off the back pad, into the hands of leg slip, but no bat on that one"
a full-faced punch into the covers
fenced to the off side once more
