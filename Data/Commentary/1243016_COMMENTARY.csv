It looked initially to be shaping leg-side, but Curran's cheeky swing just bent it back round at the last minute. If this pitched online, it's surely hitting!

The TV umpire confirms that it's off the boot although the second angle is less clear than the first. Buttler has to go. After having nothing to show for with the bat in the first innings, R Mendis snaps the near-century stand with the wicket of Buttler. Big moment for R Mendis"

The third umpire will check exactly when the bail was dislodged... but Root is short of his ground. Root looks distraught and is run out for the second time in as many innings.

"<b>top-edged high in the sky... and Anderson takes a brilliant running catch!</b> He was backpedalling immediately from mid-on but had to turn a couple of times to pick up the path of the ball, waited for it to come over his shoulder and pouched it smooth as you like!

flicked to the on-side and that's another probing over
"on the sweep again, and another big appeal for an inside-edge!<strong> England are using their last review!</strong> A flurry of limbs, and that looks like an under-edge onto the boot and up again! Yep, this is clearly a foot-fault, a looping chance to Buttler behind the stumps, and Sri Lanka are eight-down! Buttler, in fact, was appealing for the lbw before suddenly realising a catch was lobbing his way. He called for the review, as Root is currently off the field"

<B>huge bite from outside off!</B> Big appeal but that's clearly done too much. A sign of danger to come for England though...
"Lakmal gallops to the pitch, probably figuring he didn't want to let another one bounce, and that's a very fine in-to-out bludgeon through long-off!"
"flogged square, in the air for a moment, but just short of point! This match is pivoting once more..."
"round the wicket, Embuldeniya strides to the pitch and under-edges on the full into the crease"
"lower arm, flatter trajectory, poked to cover and a bit of indecision in the running"
"boshed very firmly, on the front foot out to wide long-off"
"<B>there's the breakthrough!</B> Much fuller from Root, Embuldeniya is startled by the more incisive length, and offers an open-faced poke, almost on the half volley, straight into Bairstow's hands at slip! The end of a tremendous and invaluable innings. He's given himself the rope with which to hang England's run-chase!"
"<B>bowled him first ball!</B> Root takes two in two ... all ten wickets to spin in the second innings... tossed right up to the popping crease, drifting away too, but Asitha's uncertain stab scuttles off the under-edge, and into the stumps.

comes across and defends this softly
"drifting leg side, starts to close the face on it, gets a slight leading edge"
"full and flighted, Sibley's forward and jams it through mid-off for one"
<b>down low with hands reversed and slaps four!</b> YJB goes on the attack and sweeps hard past gully
tossed up and chopped into the covers on the back foot
"skips down, in as much as Sibley <i>can</i> skip, lets it hit him on the pad"
"<b>launched over deep backward square leg for six!</b> There were two men out on the sweep, but he's clouted it beyond them! Pretty solid connection, went hard and flat... and looks like he's deposited it straight into a bucket of whitewash, too"
tossed up and blocked carefully coming forwards
dragged down and spinning sharply to leg as YJB watches it by... Dickwella gets across to take
"lobbed up full on off and Bairstow sweeps hard, just a single to fine leg"
"pushed through leg side again, Sibley prods and misses"
again he's a touch short and straight and this is worked off the hip through square
"floated full on off, Sibley is able to get out and tamp down watchfully"
punched in front of square going back on off stump
"flat delivery, Bairstow drops deep and raps a cut in front of point"
"done by the arm ball again, was it leg side...? Umpire Dharmasena thought so but Sri Lanka <b>review</b>, maybe because he was so far back in the crease. But that doesn't look to be straightening enough to me - no, just clipping leg but <b>umpire's call</b>, so no dice from DRS"
stretches out to defend this time
tossed up and he's out to greet it again with more dead-batted defiance
pushed through and nurdled off the pads past the attentions of short leg
lobbed up and blocked coming forwards on off
"spins back from outside off, Sibley trapped on the crease - umpire Palliyaguruge says no on this occasion, but Sri Lanka <b>review</b> again and this could be close. Height the main question, I think, because it struck him in line... <b>Umpire's call</b>, just flicking the bails this time! Not going SL's way right now"
tossed up and blocked on the front foot
lunges forward to defend on middle and off
"flatter, spinning in and Sibley flicks at it, wears it on the pads again... further across this time, and there's no review, so that will be <b>tea</b>"
"round the wicket, looped into the legs, and tucked with intent behind square. Mathews creaks off in pursuit and they hustle back for two"
"reverse sweep from Bairstow, and that's mighty effective! Drilled behind square on the off side. No-one at third man, the field is being stretched here"
"another reverse-sweep, and <B>Bairstow's in a tangle here!</B> Not out says Dharmasena but <B>Sri Lanka review</B>. That was close to the gloves before ballooning to slip. Now, there's a small spike as the ball hits the forearm. Is that technically glove? Nope, it's deemed to be not out! The wrist-band and velcrose strap does count as part of the glove, but the benefit stays on-field"
"head over the ball, poked back down the pitch as Bairstow takes a moment to reassess after a lively resumption"
"thumps the pad, but that's a big stride, and outside the line too. Not out"
"knocked into the off-side for another single. Lively times, but England's progress continues"
"sliding back onto the stumps, that would be tight if he misses, but Bairstow gets enough bat on it at the last minute to work to the leg side"
"<B>another drilled reverse sweep!</B> Very hard, and very square! Tugging the field hither and yon. This is excellent agenda-setting batting"
"conventional sweep this time, hit hard once more behind square, Perera isn't being allowed to settle as he plugs away outside off"
"swept again, a tangle as the ball bites, but struck outside the line as the ball deflects fine. That was calculated again, the sharp turn eludes the keeper"
forward and worked back down the pitch. Sibley just chugs along
"big turn down the leg side, and they are taking a look at the stumping as Dickwella whips off the bails. Sibley is safely grounded, albeit with his weight falling forward"
dabbed back down the track
another reverse sweep. More solid contact but straight at backward square this time
"whoops, now <I>that's </I> a wrongheaded shot! A wild swiping sweep, not remotely in line, and is lucky the ball skids past the off stump"
propping onto the front foot
"right back on the stumps as Bairstow is done in the flight! Up goes the finger but here comes the <strong>review</strong>! It's clipping the leg stump! So well bowled, fizzed through so much quicker with scarcely a change of action, no spin, all skid, and a very handy cameo comes to an end. Bairstow would have wanted something more, obviously, but he's laid a platform here"
"right back on the stumps, Root is back and across, playing from deep in the crease once more"
"Sibley's right back in the crease, taking a leaf from Root's book, but misses the ball which is sub-optimal! Big appeal, but missing leg too"
on the front foot this time. There's a leg slip in play for the sharp offbreak
"excellent connection on the sweep shot, but there's a man back on the rope at square leg"
bottom-handed clonk across the line as Root strides to the pitch. Midwicket gathers
back onto the stumps and shuffled to the leg side as Perera turns into his pads
"back and across, firmly in line to defend again"
open-faced punch to the off side
"big stride forward, head right over the ball"
"watchful on the front foot, Sibley is toiling hard to combat his demons"
"prodded into the off side, opening the face to work the spin out to point"
"tight line, full length, solid crease-bound block"
"over-pitched this time, as Sibley works a neat clip in front of square. More useful runs chiselled off the target, and another Embuldeniya over survived"
flicked to the leg side
"right back on the stumps, blocked with high hands"
"turn, and keeps low! Sibley does well to watch that like a hawk and stab it in front of short leg"
"punched from under the eyes, outside off, to mid-on. Hitting with the turn off the back foot"
"swept, missed, but safe enough, with a big stride outside the line to negate the lbw"
"back and across, dabbed away off the back foot. A maiden from Sibley to aid the Root century fund"
nudges the single with an open face to pick the gap in the covers
head right over the ball to smother to the leg side
"back and across, and flinched off the legs to the on-side"
"head over the ball, watching the turn from middle and leg"
"a sashay to the pitch, and a very confident flick against the spin, out to deep midwicket. Good intent, seizing the opening at midwicket"
"another confident nudge, on the move as the ball arrives. Sibley, dare one say it, is starting to find his feet in this innings"
"turning into the pads, there's a catcher round the corner as the ball flicks off the flap"
right across the stumps to defend on the back foot
"another urgent thrust of the bat to the full length, jabbed into the leg side, and a gratefully accepted single to escape the strike"
"<B>swept, and was there an edge?</B> Dickwella can't gather... nope, think it missed everything. A rare missweep from the skipper!"
"onto the front foot, poked into the covers. Another single to the cause"
"on the back foot, fenced to the gap at midwicket. And a no-ball too. Freebies abound"
"ambitious sweep from way outside the line, doesn't connect once more, but safely through to the keeper"
"big turn as Sibley is beaten outside off, but never close to nicking it"
slashed out to point off the back foot. Watches the spin well as he gathers
"a walk to the pitch, covering the off-stump, and tucked to the on-side again"
"fully forward, compact defence"
"poked to the off side, on the front foot again"
"hurried on the back foot by the slider, but at least he <em>was </em>on the back foot. Nudged to midwicket once more"
"on the front foot, poked to the on-side"
"loose push, leaving a bit of a gate for the one that bites, but he gets enough of an inside-edge to spare his stumps"
"another raucous appeal for lbw, but Root is so far outside off he's almost on point's toes"
"two steps to the pitch, and <B>that's elegance!</B> A rifled drive through long-off! One of his first shots in that direction all Test"
"<B>bowled round his legs!</B> Oh my, this is a massive moment in the Test match! Root's sweeps haven't been firing in this innings, fatigue kicking in no doubt, and he gets too far over to the off side, and is through the stroke by the time his leg stump is pegged back, via an under-edge off his glove! England are roughly halfway to their target, but they've lost three-quarters of their series runs!"
"hard-handed poke towards long-off, and he's off the mark straightaway"
flashed out to the off-side
"right up to the pads, nurdled out to the leg side"
"driven off the back foot, very open face, and punched to point"
"leaning forward this time, bat in front of pad to meet the middle-stump line"
"tickled to the leg side, the pressure is on in a runs sense, but the field could be tighter to the new man"
"firmly onto the front foot, defended for his life. This is hotting up nicely!"
"full length, and clipped back to the on-side"
"solid block on the front foot, poked to the on-side again, sharp spin into the shot"
"Mendis is really getting his offbreaks to bite now, another one grips and turns to the leg side, but Sibley gets enough bat on it to pinch the single"
"sliding down the leg side, big turn but outside the stumps. Flicked square"
whipped to the on-side
another nudge off the legs. Sibley is doing the needful in his manful prodding manner
squares up in defence in front of the stumps
"lots of air, another clip to midwicket, very much Sibley's release shot, but the gap is plugged this time"
"stretching forward outside off, and blocked down into the pitch"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"pressed into the covers, an open face and hard hands, but solid contact"
"<B>massive appeal for absolutely everything!</B> Sri Lanka are reviewing the lot. Lawrence was on the move, and effectively yorked himself, was there an inside-edge through to the keeper? If so, he's caught, if not, lbw is very on ... <B>yes, there's a fat nick onto the pad</B>, and England's fourth wicket falls!"
"stabbed defence, half forward as Mendis comes round the wicket to bring leg slip and short leg into play"
nudged to the on side
"big turn from round the wicket, from outside off back towards middle"
"another big stride, closing the face on impact to elude short leg. A jogged single to bring Buttler onto strike. If he can adopt a one-day mentality here, this could be a quick stay. One way or another!"
"flashed off the legs, behind square. Lots of noise with hustle and panic in the air"
"<B>c-r-u-n-c-h-e-d through the covers!</B> Huge stride, powerful wrists, belted through wide long-off! That's a clue as to what may be to come"
fully forward to defend
"on the front foot again, solid"
"<strong>under-cut past slip!</strong> That's really not intended, but he'll take it! Beaten off the pitch, on the back foot, and nutmegs the keeper before the fielder is forced to hurdle the boundary-boards as his momentum gets the better of him"
"sweetly timed off the  back foot, square of the wicket, and Dilruwan flings himself to intercept at third man"
"huge stride forward, pushing firmly back down the line"
"outside off, appreciable turn, through to the keeper"
"round the wicket, dobbedv on the stumps and Buttler tucks it through backward square"

"flighted, pitching outside leg and he sticks out his front pad"
"<b>spins sharply through past the outside edge</b>, lovely line but nothing on it as the ball is swallowed by Dickwella's gloves"

"flighted, he's forward this time, strokes a couple more through the covers"

"flighted on middle and off, Buttler is well forward and paddles down to fine leg"
defended going back on off stump
"flighted, straying on to the pads again, nudged behind square one more"

"loopy, drifting in and then out, defended softly coming forwards"
"on the stumps and worked to leg, midwicket is quickly across and Buttler quickly calls 'No!'"
"<b>struck on the pads playing back</b>, umpire Palliguruge thinks long and hard... shakes his head! Chandimal has a think and <b>reviews</b>, how will the dice fall this time for SL? Big turn from outside off, past the inside edge as he aimed to leg... Clipping the top of leg stump! <b>Umpire's call again!</b> So Sibley survives the DRS for the <i>third</i> time.
