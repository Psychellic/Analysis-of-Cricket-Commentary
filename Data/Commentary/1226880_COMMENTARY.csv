"<b>what do I know?!</b> Hales backs away, giving himself room outside leg stump, and dumps him over cover for six!"
"thrashed through the cover ring for four more! Not such a bad match-up after all... Too much width from O'Keefe, enough room for Hales to free his arms"

nudged to mid-on
"slides on with the angle, Hales lines him up and heaves him for a one-bounce four through wide long-on!"
"pushed through quickly but too much width, and <b>Hales crashes it through the ring for four more through point!</b> O'Keefe's first over goes for 18 and Hales looks like he's in the mood!"

"slower ball, full outside off, pushed through the ring for one"

"<strong>ooft, exquisite shot</strong>. Bird goes back of a length, and Hales just extends the arms, meeting the ball with a full face, and chips him back over his head. Couple of bounces before hitting the rope, and the Thunder are flying"
"<b>slashed to third man and SO'K takes a great catch!</b> Banged in on a length, Khawaja throws everything he has at it, and it flies away. It looked for all money like it would fly away for six, but O'Keefe back-pedalled and clung onto the chance, diving back to his right"

"slower ball, on a length outside off. Pulled away for a couple"
"slower ball outside off, cut away to deep point where Vince cuts it off"

"<b>holes out to deep midwicket where Silk takes it, throws it up to himself as he regains his balance, and snaffles it second time around!</b> Looked for another slog sweep into the stands but more than a hint of top edge this time. Silk made that look very simple but it needed good awareness and a safe pair of hands"

"hung very wide outside off, and he'll have to bowl that again"
"legbreak, nudged to midwicket"

"edged onto the pad, jumping onto the back foot, and it spills away towards point for one"
"in the slot, whipped off the pads towards midwicket. <b>Mix-up between the batsmen</b>, and the fielder doesn't know which end to throw it to! He fires it towards the bowler's, eventually, but Hales had got back"

fires in a yorker at the pads and Cutting can't get it away
"<b>dumped over midwicket for six!</b> Slower ball, slightly back of a length, and Cutting's eyes lit up. He sat back, waiting for it, and heaved it 15 rows back"

"banged in short, Cutting pulls off the front foot out to Silk at midwicket"

"<b>that's gone absolutely miles up, and has plenty of distance on it too!</b> In the slot, and Hales tucks in, crashing him over long-on for six. This is Hales' highest score in his BBL career"
"full toss on leg stump, and <b>Brathwaite can't get underneath it on the rope!</b> Mistimed, giving Brathwaite a chance running to his left at deep backward square, but he couldn't get a hand on it and it gets away for a one-bounce four"

"worked into the leg side, only one this time"
"in the slot, and <b>Cutting dumps him over long-on for six more! 25 off the over!</b> Misses his yorker once again, and Cutting isn't going to miss out on that. Brings up 200 for the Thunder and they have every chance of making the highest-ever BBL total"

"full outside leg, wide given. Philippe dives to his left, tidy work"
"straight yorker, dug out to long-on"

"full toss, but Hales misses out. He shimmied outside leg, but was cramped for room and couldn't beat the infield"
"short, <b>Hales swats at it, and picks out Silk at deep square!</b> Brings an epic innings to an end. Banged in, very short at the right shoulder, and Silk ran in off the rope to take a good catch diving forward. Adelaide Oval stands to applaud Hales, and he gets high-fives galore in the dugout. Big smile on his face"
"full toss outside off, frees his arms, and <b>clears mid-off inside the ring! Races away for four</b>."
"full toss outside off, pressed down to long-on"

"another full toss, and Cutting picks his spot, <b>finding the gap between midwicket and long-on</b>! Not timed, but perfect placement"

"length ball, slapped out to long-off and Davies scampers back for a second. <b>A BBL-record total: 5 for 232</b>"
"hung wide outside off stump, given as a wide. 138kph to start"
"beaten for pace and struck on the back thigh. 141kph, trying to pull into the leg side. Smacked him just below the hip, I reckon"

"length ball, and <b>Vince swings him through midwicket for four!</b> Sits deep in the crease and times it to the rope"
"shimmies down the pitch, <b>and chips him over mid-on for four more!</b> Great early intent from Vince. Hung wide-ish outside off, but he swings through the line and beats the infield"
"short ball, beaten for pace at 142kph, and it skews into the leg side"
"banged in outside off stump, and Philippe nails the pull, <strong>clubbing it through midwicket for four!</strong> Jeez, he's timed that well. Extends the arms, and beats the boundary-rider"
"uppish on-drive, just wide of short midwicket, <b>and away for four more!</b> The Sixers are off to the start they needed. Length ball, too straight, and away to the rope"
"short ball, too straight, and <b>pulled through fine leg to the rope! 21 off the over</b>. Wayward start from McAndrew. This was aimed at the badge of the helmet but Philippe saw it coming, and swatted him round the corner"

"length outside off, carved to cover-point on the bounce, and a misfield allows them through for one"

"forced into the covers on the bounce, throw comes in at the non-striker's end and <strong>Philippe is in trouble here!</strong> He set off for the single but Ferguson fielded well, and threw to the bowler's end on the bounce. Philippe was diving at full stretch, but Sangha did well to whip the bails off, and he was just short of his ground. Massive wicket for the Thunder - that might be the game."
"pulled away off the back foot, straight to deep midwicket"
defended awkwardly into the covers
"slapped through the covers with a cross bat, and away for four!"

"<b>chipped high into the outfield, and Cutting gets round to get underneath it at long-off!</b> Tossed up above the eyes, and lofted very high down the ground. Cutting covered plenty of ground, running round to his right, and slid on his knees in taking the catch. Sixers in all sorts."
"rocks onto the back foot, pulling hard to the right of long-on"
"hung wide outside off, left alone, and the umpire says it was inside the tramline"
"cut uppishly, but just short of backward point"
"steered to cover off the back foot, and sluggish running from Henriques could leave him in some trouble! Sent upstairs. Ferguson was the fielder at short cover. Sangha whipped the bails off, but the throw was quite wide, meaning he had a fair bit still to do. Henriques is <i>just</i> about safe. Direct hit would have done the job"

"slower-ball bouncer, pulled to deep square"
"uses his feet, shimmying down and lofting a checked cover drive for four! Superb shot, great timing. Is Henriques finally up and running?"

"short ball at the badge of the helmet, which Henriques flaps at, and can't get bat on ball. 90mph/145kph"
"wide outside the off stump, and Silk crashes it over cover! Shocking ball with the two men out both on the leg side, hung outside off, and this lands just short of the rope"
"wide outside off again, slower ball this time, and dragged out to deep midwicket"
"short outside off, pulled through mid-on, and Hales gets back to flick it back in"
"Silk can't lay bat on it. Lucky to escape without a wide, I think"
"spears in a yorker at the boot from round the wicket, flicked to long leg. Silk wanted two and was stranded mid-pitch, but the throw came in to the wrong end, and Billings fumbled it when it came in!"

"jumps across to the off side again, looking to give it the old heave-ho through the leg side, but gets a little feather on it and <b>Billings takes an excellent catch behind the stumps!</b> Hmm, Henriques doesn't look too pleased, and rightly so - replays show it has clearly missed the bat and flicked the top of the pad.
