"too full on the stumps, finally some bat on the ball as he flicks it towards fine leg"
"<b>bowled 'im!</b> A strange dismissal for Dickwella who was looking to sweep Holder. I think it was another slower ball that dipped on the batsman and beat him to hit the off stump. Holder rolls on the ground, obviously laughing, in celebration. It was 128kph, so not that slow really"
"slower ball to start, length ball that kicks slightly off the pitch. Nissanka tries to flay that through the offside but misses. Six dot balls in the last seven balls now"
"another dot ball. This is a pace-on delivery, again a length delivery outside off. Drilled straight to point"
Nissanka is struggling with this line. Back of the hand slower one again outside off. Yorker length. Nissanka tries to drag that through the legside but misses yet again

slower offcutter length ball outside off. Chandi ties to cut this away but doesn't time it well and hits point.
"well-directed,bouncer, and this steeples up to hit CHandi in the back of the helmet. The ball bounces off towards backward point and they scamper a single"
"slower ball again, back of a length, into the ribs. Nissanka waits for this one and shovels this away to midwicket for one"
"slower ball to finish the spell, short-of-a-length and outside off. Bludgeoned, without timing, to the offside sweeper for one."
"flattish ball to start with,pitching on about leg stump. Chandimal comes down the track and hits it aerially down the ground. Not a lot of power in that though, so long on can run around and stop it as they sprint two"
"Nissanka runs past this one. This is slowed up a bit from Allen, pitching just outside off and turning away. Nissanka comes down the track and take Allen over cover, but walks past the ball as it spins away from his outside edge. Simple stumping for the keeper"
flattish ball outside off stump to start. Mathews hits this down the  ground
"fired in outside off again, stroked just wide enough of cover to get a single"
"flat again, and struck straight to cover so there's no run"

length ball outide off stump. Mathews gets back and drags this to deep midwicket for a single
"big shot from Chandimal. WOW. That's huuuge. Clean, clean striking, from nowhere. This is in the slot on about off stump. Chandimal just plants the front foot and swings through the line, timing it perfectly to send the ball on to the roof of the stadium. A little flash of the Chandimal of old"
"good response from Fidel. This is quick outside off stump, and skidding through underneath Chadi's bat as he tries to squirt this away to off"
length off stump and Chandi can't quite connect as he wants as he tries to bash this down the ground. Beats the bowler's outstretched hand and takes a single though
"length on off stump, bashed across the line between deep square leg and deep midwicket. They take two"
Mathews flicks off the hips and picks out short fine leg. This is a 136kph delivery into the thighs. Mathews gets inside the line and gets a nice connection with that shot. But Siimmons at short fine leg doesn't have to move to take that catch in front of his face
sprayed down the legside
"Chandimal's stay is brief. Once again a fielder has been picked out. This is short of a length on about off stump, at 140kph. Gets up to about chest-high for Chandimal who tries to lean back and ramp this over short third man. But manages only to run it off the face straight to the fielder at short third, who takes an easy catch"

"Bouncer first up to Thisara, who ducks underneath it"
"slower one again, but length on about offstump now. Thisara waits for it and drags it to deep midwicket for a single"
"slower ball, but a full toss. This is not superbly directed, as it floats up wide of off stump. But Hasaranga can't do much with it. Drills it straight to cover."
"another slower one to finish. Length outside off, angled across the righty. Hasaranga just pokes that into the offside and the run through"
"length outside off, punched away square of the wicket. Sweeper cover runs across to clean up"

"beautiful yorker, right into the toes. Hasaranga digs it out and looks for the single, but the ball has just dribbled off to just behind the wicket and Thisara says no. Hasaranga darts back into his crease"

length ball into the pads. Wanindu gets back and hits this towards deep midwicket for one
"slower ball at 93kph, length outside off stump. Thisara, leaden footed, tries to crash this away through the offside, but succeeds only in hitting it to the cover fielder"
back of a length ball on about off stump. Hasaranga opens the face but deflects it straight to Holder at short third man. They can still scamper one though
"slower ball, and Thisara is through this shot waaay early. It's full and on the stumps. Thisara tries to pummel this back over the bowler's head for six. But he can only hit it high into the night. Long on has eons to settle under it."
"oof, almost a run out next ball. Hasaranga deflects the ball to Holder at short third man again and they scamper a single. Holder takes aim, and if he'd hit would have run out debutant Bandara before he'd even had the chance to face his first ball at international level"
"short of a length, angled across. Bandara also opens the face and deflects to short third man, but that's far enough from the fielder to take a single"
"slower ball, short of a length, over the stumps. Hasaranga can't connect as he tries another deflection"
"length ball just outside off, Hasaranga plays across the line and hauls this over to the legside fo ra single"
"fullish on the stumps, drilled back past the bowler without a lot of power. They sprint two."
"another slower ball, another wicket. This is length on the stumps. Hasaranga clears the front leg and swings hard across the line, needing to generate a lot of power to hit the six over cow corner he is aiming for. he doesn't quite manage. Fabian Allen, running around the boundary from deep midwicket, takes a good diving catch about a metre from the boundary. Sri Lanka continue to flounder"
"fullish slower ball, floated up outside off. Bandara strokes this towards cover for a single"
"bouncer to start, just outside off. Akila ducks it."
"slower ball, fullish on the stumsp. Akila turns this around the corner to short fine leg for a single"
"much needed boundary. This is overpitched on the stumps. Bandara clears the front leg, and swings somewhat corss-batted to send the ball scorching past the bowler's feet somehow. That's hit hard enough to beat the deep fielders."
"back of a length ball into the batsman's ribs. Akila bunts this into the offside and takes off. They sprint back for a second when Gayle misfields running in from cover, failing to pick up the ball"
"back of a length ball again, which Dananjaya tries to ramp over the keeper. Can't connect"
"rib-high delivery again, which Akila just pokes square on the offside for a single"
"shortish, and slightly wide. Bandara throws his bat at it and gets a top edge that flies fine of third man. McCoy does a beautiful job getting across, diving, and stopping that ball from reaching the boundary."
full and on off stump. Bandara gets low and punches this to long off for a single
"that's not badly played. Short of a length ball about hip-high. Dananjaya backs off, makes some space, and carves this to third man for a single"
"slower ball, offcutter, that just dies off the pitch. This is pitched on a length on about leg stump. Dananajay backs off and tries to bash it but it passes under the bat"
"another slower one, on the stumps. Dananjaya drags this to deep midwicket for a single"
"hit away into space on the legside, but I think this is going to be run out, as Bandara tries to sprint two and keep the strike. Bandara hits a length ball to around midwicket, and makes the early call to run two. The throw comes in and the stumps are broken as Bandara dives desperately to make his ground. His bat has bounced though from outside the crease, and is not grounded when the bails are whipped off. He has to go"
"slower ball n the stumps, swung high into legside. Bounces well short of deep square leg"
fullish delivery on off stump. Dananjaya moves across and hits it between deep midwicket and long on. A misfield in the deep allows the batsmen to run three.
"full delivery, almost a yorker, on the stump. Thats dug out and drilled to long on. The batsmen try to run a two to close out the innings, but there's not two there. The throw comes in and Chameera is comfortably out at the striker's end."
"length ball around off, stays back and defends it towards square leg for a single"
"length ball on the pads, flicked towards short fine leg. Mathews is lucky to get away with that"
not this time though as Lewis smashes it over long-on for a no-look six. Was a touch fuller on the stumps and Lewis just butchered it
"<b>back-to-back sixes for Lewis.</b> A touch shorter and smashed over deep square leg, with the wind but it would have gone over every single day"
<b>make that three</b>. This is poor bowling from Mathews. Short and down the leg side and this time Lewis pulls it behind square leg. And they have lost the ball

"<b>This can finish soon.</b> Length ball, a legcutter from Chameera but Simmons backs away and smashes it over long-off"
"fuller outside off and Simmons opens the face of the bat this time, slicing it through the point region for four more"
a bouncer this time and Simmons helps it towards short fine leg. A feet wider and that would have been four more
fast but on the pads. Simmons looks for the flick but misses. The ball though hits the pads and races away fine for four leg-byes
"length outside off, stays back and punches it towards extra cover"
not the best of the connections and it was against the wind as well but Lewis picked his spot well. Pulls this short of the length ball over the square leg fielder and it dribbles to the boundary. <b>50 is up for West Indies</b>
"fuller on the stumps this time, Lewis looks to go aerial, over extra cover but ends up mistiming it straighter and Gunathilaka takes a smart catch moving to his left from long-off"
"<B>a big appeal for lbw</b>. Denied but Sri Lanka opt for the review. Was a length ball on the stumps, Gayle looked to work it on the leg side tentatively but the ball spun past the bat to hit him on the back leg. And it would have crashed into middle and off. Gayle walks back for a first-ball duck. What an anti-climax"
"<b>and he has got it.</b> Akila Dananjaya has got a hat-trick out of nowhere. Tossed up on a length ball outside off, spinning away just enough to take the outside edge as Pooran pushed away from the body, and Dickwella just managed to pouch it and it's celebrations in the Sri Lanka camp"

"tossed up around off, comes forward and blocks"
"<b>given lbw but was it going down?</b> Fuller on the stumps, Simmons goes for the sweep and misses. An appeal for lbw and given immediately. Simmons wants to review this. It pitched in line and struck Simmons in front of middle and leg and the ball-tracking confirms it would have hit the leg stump, Suddenly, West Indies are in a spot of bother at 62 for 4"
Pollard goes down on one knee and slogs this length ball over long-on. There was a shout of catch it but Pollard cleared the boundary by some distance
this time muscles it into the sightscreen. Too full from Dananjaya this time and Pollard just latched onto this
"<b>another hat-trick of sixes.</b> Fuller and a touch wider but it makes no difference to Pollard, who smashes it over wide long-off. Pollard isn't worried by those quick wickets"
"<b>make that four in a row!</b> What a bizarre day for Akila Dananjaya, who has been clubbed for four successive sixes after a hat-trick in the previous over. Was a length ball around off and Pollard slogged it over deep midwicket. He hit it with the spin and it keeps sailing"
"<b>Whoa!</b> Five sixes in five balls for Kieron Pollard. This is carnage. A length ball outside off, Pollard rocks back and uses all his power to launch it straight over the bowler's head"
"<b>no, it doesn't.</b> Kieron Pollard has smashed six sixes in an over here. Yuvraj Singh has got company. Fired in on to pads and a chip, just a mere chip and it flies over the deep midwicket boundary. A bow from Pollard to acknowledge the applause from his team-mates"
"length outside off, plays back and gets a thick outside edge past slip"
flatter and quicker. Pushes it towards mid-off
"<b>a direct hit and Holder was gone.</b> A length ball pushed to the left of the bowler, who gets a hand to it. The ball is deflected towards covers as the batsmen go for a single. The fielder aims at the bowler's end but misses"
"<b>and now Pollard has been given lbw.</b> He wants to review it but it looked plumb. Was a googly from Hasaranga, Pollard looked to push at it after a stride forward. No bat involved there and it would have gone on to hit the leg stump. Pollard departs for an 11-ball 38"
"Allen goes first ball. What sort of a game this is! Another googly from Hasaranga, Allen has got no idea how to deal with it. Comes on the front foot and sort of tries to defend with bat no way near the ball. Struck right in front. <b>Now Hasaranga is on a hat-trick</b>"
"<b>Bravo survives the hat-trick ball</b> Hasaranga tries another googly but Bravo is well-forward and defends it on the off side. Phew, this is turning out to be a match from EA Sports"
