"shortish on off, worked towards deep midwicket"

"chops this into the off side, was looking to cut but <strong>this didn't come on</strong>"
"advances, but Boult cleverly shortens the length, tucked into the leg side. Pressure building. As Ravi Shastri would often say, <em>'something's got to give'</em>"
"<strong>chance missed!</strong> A direct hit at the stiker's end from Prithvi and Watson would've been running back to the dugout. Akram-esque late inswing, he somehow manages to tuck this to short midwicket"

"looks to squeeze this full delivery behind point, <strong>late on the shot.</strong> Bowled at 140.8kph"
"beauty! This is a short of length ball that zips past the outside edge as he wafts at it, Pant collects this in front of his face. <strong>Serious pace</strong>"
"shortish and angling into middle and leg, whipped wide of midwicket"
"<b> What have you done, Watto? </b> He's hit the half-tracker straight down the throat of deep midwicket! Surely Suchith went 'oh, damn' as soon as he dropped short, but a few second later, he was looking up to the skies to thank his stars"

"gets too close to the pitch of the ball as he advances, squeezed back"
"looks to go inside-out over cover, gets a thick inside edge, rolls towards deep midwicket"

"swept past short fine! Poor ball, too full, too much leg stump and he walloped this"
works this from outside off towards midwicket
"crunching cover drive! <strong>Chinna Thala in his elements</strong>. Too full, got to the pitch and belted that away"
"<strong>ugly hoick, just eludes point!</strong> Shaw little late to get off the blocks, but he may have not got there even if he started early, I guess. Lucky break"

"length on leg stump, flicked to deep square"
slower ball at a length on leg stump. Allows it to come on and tickles it fine
"short and wide outside off, left alone. It's a wide, is the signal from square leg"
"slower ball at a length on leg stump, flicked to fine leg"
"<b>diving stop at point</b> from Dhawan. A late cut, slightly on the front foot from Faf. Can't beat Dhawan to his right"

"quicker one at a length just outside off, punched to extra cover"
"tossed up outside off, driven with the turn, inside-out and over extra cover. Dhawan cleans up at long-off. Faf is unhappy with Raina who had turned his back on him and wasn't thinking about a second run"
<b>over short fine.</b> Mishra chucks one down leg side and Raina chucks his hands at it. Off the middle and over the fielder
overpitched on the pads and he cops it on them as he misses on the flick
"slower short ball at leg stump, drags a pull to fine leg's left. Ingram with some sliding again"
short and down leg side. Can't connect on it
"<b>shot!</b> Oh that was worth the wait for the first six of the night. Handsome, inside-out and over the extra cover boundary. It's an offcutter but it skids on from a length outside off. Gets the front foot out but slightly down leg side to make room and gets his hands through the line"
"full on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
"slower short ball at middle, mistimed pull to deep square"
"slower ball short and wide, chopped to sweeper cover"
"length on off stump, pokes it into the covers on the front foot"
"<b>oh yes!</b> Faf has been saving his best for us tonight. Another supremely gorgeous hit. Full on off stump, steps out, gets to the pitch and goes with the turn to launch this over the sightscreen. What balance. Superb."
"<b>Axar invites Faf to hit him again</b> and he gets him this time! Lovely comeback. As beautiful as it is to see a batsman use his feet to hit straight, few things match up to a loopy delivery just managing to beat a batsman in flight. That's what's happened here. Faf is down the pitch and it looks like he can do a repeat of the last ball. But he is inches short of getting to the pitch of this. Ends up getting it off the thick outside edge and Dhawan hangs on at long-off"
"length on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
"<b>past the edge.</b> There's that loop again. Slow, dipping at a length, drawing him in and ripping past the edge"
"full on off stump, poked back to the bowler"
"length ball wide outside off, leans in and sweeps between deep midwicket and long-on"
"<b>shot!</b> Fifty for Raina. Length outside off, down the track, meets it, drills it over the bowler. Right off the middle"
"<b>nearly taken at long-on!</b> Trent Boult has taken some outrageous catches but today he can only slap the turf in anger. Unrealistic to expect him to take this in the first place. Raina mistimes the slog, not to the pitch. Gets it off the inside half. Boult sprints to his left at long-on and sticks out one hand. Can't hang on"
"short and just outside off, cut straight to point"
"<b>taken at point!</b> Suchith, much like Axar, keeps inviting the batsman to step out. Beats him in flight yet again and this time the catch is taken - and just about. Dhawan is pedaling sideways, then back, then front-on and then backwards again before he swivels and hangs on in front of his chest and holds on as he tumbles. Raina was looking to slug across the line and got a top edge"
"length and in at middle stump, hurriedly jammed back to the bowler's right"
"short of a length on leg stump, flicked to deep square"
"length on middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
"length on leg stump, flicked through square leg on the front foot"
"short of a length just outside off, punched to sweeper cover off the back foot"
"<b>dropped at deep backward square!</b> Length on middle stump, drags this sweep behind square because it's delivered slowly. Rutherford runs to his right, gets under it, but cops it on his shoulder as he looks to keep balance and it bounces over the rope"
"<b>edge past the keeper!</b> Oh, poor Axar. He's foxed the batsman twice in two balls and still gone for 10. This is slow, at a length, wide outside off. Jadeja down the track and nowhere near the ball. Reaches out, no shape, throws his hands at it and somehow manages to get it past the keeper"
"<b>beaten.</b> Wild heave from Dhoni, isn't close to connecting. This length ball climbs over the off stump"
length ball sticks in the pitch as Dhoni gets on the back foot and stabs it back to the bowler
"short, up at middle stump. Dhoni gets his weight onto the back foot and pulls from above the line of the ball. Might have been an offcutter too"
"length and in at middle stump, driven off the low part of the bat, down to long-on"
"<b>deft.</b> Smart. Slower ball, short of a length and just outside off. Jadeja has picked it. Allows it to skid on and dabs it fine of short third man"
"full and just outside off, driven along the floor to long-off"
"sweet connection on this, but it'll be one. Short ball at middle stump, pulled to deep midwicket's left. Dhoni happy with one, sends him back"
<b>not in full control</b> but enough bat on this hook. Around the wicket from Boult. Cramps him at grille height. Closes his eyes and swings at it. Top edge goes high and wide of short fine
"slower ball at a length on leg stump, nudged straight to short fine"
"full on middle stump, driven down to long-on"
"slower bouncer. In control this time, Dhoni, but he can't do more than gently pat this to short fine's right"
"<b>pumps it high over long-on!</b> Got right under that! All elevation. Overpitched on middle stump, gets the front leg out of the way and the back leg collapses a little to get flex in the knee. This means a big, big swinging arc from underneath the ball. It dips inwards just a touch and that adds to Jadeja's flourish because this goes off the inside part of the bat. Well over the fielder."
"starts poorly again. Overpitched on the pads. Fine leg and square leg are in the circle. Guess where this goes? Right between those two, off the thick inside edge. Dhoni just had to swing hard at this"
low full toss pushed wide outside off. Scythed out to deep extra cover
"<b>Morris dupes Jadeja and Morris completes the job!</b> And then he chucks the ball into the ground in frustration. Hasn't been a great season so far and you can see it in his reaction. A top ball though. Offcutter, dipping on Jadeja who would have been thrown out of the nets 10 years ago for attempting this filthy heave into the leg side. It was on though, and it was coming off for him today. Just not this time. Cuts away from a length on off stump, he loses his shape, gets a top edge. Morris runs to his left and holds on at midwicket with a slide to keep his balance"
"<b>speaking of ugly heaves!</b> Rayudu goes for one first ball and it is near perfect. Length at middle, gets it over square leg and beats deep midwicket's slide to the right"
<b>high</b> before plopping into the turf well in front of long-on. Slower ball hits the toe-end as he looks for another slog
"<b>beamer goes for six!</b> Morris apologizes to the batsman and then asks the dugout for a towel. Oh boy. Straight up at the shoulder. Dhoni is trying to get out of the way, swipes one handed and manages to get it over the fine leg boundary"
"low full toss wide outside off, carted straight to deep extra"
"<b>inside edge</b> won't trickle past Pant. Slower ball, skids on and Dhoni is through the slog early. It keeps a tad low"
"full on leg stump, heaves this out to deep midwicket's right and comes back for the second"
"<b>over the bowler</b> with a subdued helicopter. Or <i>chinna</i> helicopter as they'd call it there in Chepauk. Near yorker length, just missing from Boult. Leg stump line. Gets the front leg out and whips it, flat, over the bowler"
"slower short ball, inside edge onto pad as he looks to pull"
"full and very wide outside off. Can't get bat on it, but the spikes are in shape as he responds to Dhoni's call and gets to the other end"
"<b>go and pick that up!</b> Quite literally in this case because it's into the closed stands. Hangs back, picks the offcutter and wallops it over the midwicket boundary. That sounds, my goodness..."
"<b>clears deep square!</b> The Dhoni finish! Short ball at leg stump, swivels and pulls from underneath it. Out at the boundary, Dhawan is underneath it as it teases him first and then clears his head"
"length on middle and leg, wristed to midwicket"
"juicy half-volley and Shaw gleefully whips this in front of square. Poor ball, bread-and-butter shot"
"much straighter even if the length is a touch too full, Shaw plays a full-blooded on-drive to mid-on"
high backlift again as it comes down to turn this short of length delivery to midwicket
"picks out who else but Raina at cover point! This was short, this was wide, he had all the room to thrash this, which he did, but hit it straight to the fielder. Can't believe what he's just done"
"slips this length ball down leg and Iyer tucks this fine to get off the mark with a boundary. Why Deepak, why?"
cuts to short third man for a quick single
"brings out the reverse-sweep to a delivery bowled on leg stump, hit well but straight to backward point"

"half-volley on the pads, flicked straight to midwicket"
"stands tall and wallops this behind point. Too short, Iyer picked the length early"

gets on top of the bounce and blocks
punched into the cover region for a quick single
"steps out, makes room and slaps this to cover where Bhajji misfields to give away two. To be fair though this was struck really hard"
"shortish on off, worked to long-on"
"sees Dhawan advancing and fires it wide, but he's outfoxed. Dhawan is a step ahead as he reaches out and clobbers this against the turn and across the line to clear long-on"
steps out and works this quicker delivery on the pads to square leg
nudged into the gap at midwicket
gorgeous drive on the up to sweeper cover
"slider from around the stumps, Dhawan defends from the crease"
"shot of the night! This guy is a serious player and will definitely challenge for a top order slot post the World Cup cycle. Length - not bad at all - on off and he just picks the line and length so well, goes through to clear extra cover. Didn't over-hit it by any means. Pure timing, pure class. Brilliant"
dab into the off side for a quick single
"pulled from outside off, Tahir with a sprint from deep backward square leg"
"slanting into middle and leg, worked towards deep midwicket"
"arches back, uses the pace of the bowler and simply helps him over short third man"
dabs between cover and point
"shortish on middle and leg, whipped into the gap at deep midwicket"
punched down to long-on
"got him! Bhajji roars, fist pumps because this is a huge moment. Dhawan premeditates and goes for a full-blooded sweep, this drifts in and skids through to beat him comprehensively. Dhawan was through with the shot even before the ball arrived, clean bowled."
"sliding into the pads, tucked wide of midwicket to get off the mark"
"backs away and slaps this wide of the diving point fielder, top shot"
turns this between deep midwicket and wide long-on. Pant hurried Iyer to complete the second there. Good judgment
"too much flight, reaches out to loft this over extra cover. Quality stroke"
"<strong>Open the gates at Wallajah Road, Tahir's coming!</strong> Because Pant has picked out Bravo at long-off. Was tossed p again, Pant couldn't hold back. Just looked to belt it but ended up hitting it flat and hard. Good catch"
driven firmly but straight to cover
"googly outside off, left alone"
firm push to long-off for a single
driven firmly to long-off
loopy delivery that he drives inside-out to cover
driven with the spin to wide long-off for a single
"sharp turn from length outside off, defended."
"the umpire raised his finger super quickly there and Ingram has reviewed! I think he may have to go here. Ingram completely beaten by the fizz of this Jadeja delivery, plays outside the line, big gap between bat and pad as well. It hit him on the flap of the pad but he was on the backfoot, so the ball didn't have much distance to travel. Hawkeye shows this would've clipped top of leg. So the decision stays and Ingram will have to walk back."

gets well forward and dabs this full delivery into the gap at cover
"full just outside off, driven to sweeper's left"
"<b>pouched at first slip!</b> Someone pull the chain because the Tahir express is reeling away yet again. Lovely tossed up googly wide outside off. Axar's instincts act up, much the way Pant's did earlier. He doesn't get anywhere near as good connection though. Watson arches backwards and brings in the reflexes to take this high"
"quicker yorker at middle stump, flicked straight to midwicket"
"length on leg stump, flicked to deep square off the back foot"
floated yorker this time. Jammed down the pitch
"<b>another googly, another edge!</b> Oh boy. The lure of the dipping ball. How many batsmen have we seen fall to it tonight? Hard hands from Rutherford - hard hands that are far away from the body as he looks to drive. Not near the pitch and a thick edge floats up to backward point"
"full at off stump, hurriedly pushed down the pitch"
full and drifting rapidly in at leg stump. Almost plays around this. Manages to jam it out
"full outside off, soft-handed push into the off side on the front foot"
<b>past the edge.</b> Past the edge before he knew what had come. Ripping break away as he looks to defend with less than half a stride. <b>And his back leg is up!</b> Dhoni has stumped and gone back to his pose...but he might have his man...<b>he does!</b> A stumping so quick I don't think even Dhoni was aware what just happened! The Capitals are crumbling.
"full outside off, driven firmly to sweeper's left"
"<b>another stumping appeal.</b> Length ball past the outside edge again as Iyer looks to defend this time. Lightning stumping as expected...<b>and the toe is up again!</b> Oh you're kidding me! Ridiculous, ridiculous...just filthy from Dhoni. He's playing on a different plane tonight. That toe wasn't up for a second even on slow-mo. Surreal skill to get the bails off that quickly."

Watson picks up, takes his time, hits the stumps at the non-striker's end on the bounce and that is the end of Suchith"
"full toss on the thigh. Flicks to deep midwicket's right. Jadeja sprints and gets a hand on it, but can't recover quickly enough after crossing the line. The ball trickles into the boundary"
"length on leg stump, flicked to fine leg"
"yorker just outside off, takes his Steve Smith shuffle back into the crease, stays leg side of it and jams it down to long-on with purpose"
"low full toss at off stump, backs away and chops it to point's right off the toe-end"
length ball dipping in and ripping out. At a length outside off. Mishra fishes at it and is beaten
<b>is that an edge? Yes!</b> Mishra leans in and pokes feebly at a ferocious legbreak outside off. Thin edge. Dhoni hangs on. Of course. And a massive win is sealed
