"Bhuvi's on target straight away, floating the ball up quite full and getting a touch of shape away from Rohit, who presses defensively to cover with half a step forward"
"<b>misfield!</b> Well, speaking of Thampi, this is a sloppy start from him in the field. Rohit slashes a rising delivery down to third man, and what should be a simple stop instead results in four runs as Thampi is slow creaking down to it and lets the ball past him"
"punched firmly off the back foot once more, but he pings the cover field"
"shaping in from outside off, and Rohit leans forward and defends right under his eyes"
"whoops, this one goes awry, spilling too far outside off to open the extras column with a wide"
"pitched right up and cutting in at 137km/h, and again Rohit defends. Bhuvi's seam position in this over has been exemplary"
"uppish, but through the field! Rohit has every reason to trust this placid track, and so he's confident stepping forward and slashing through the line and on the up to send the ball flying through cover point"
"his first delivery slips towards Quinny's legs, and he's milked down to fine leg to get off the mark"
"over the wicket comes Khaleel, and this time his line is spot on for the right-hander, Rohit pushing watchfully to point"
"crunched imperiously through extra cover! It's full, it's just wide enough to draw him into a cover drive, and he follows through fluently to send the ball scorching through the gap at cover for a third boundary"
"Khaleel pulls his length back a shade, and this one pings the cover fielder"
"width offered, and Rohit chops it firmly away behind point. There was a touch of toe-end to the shot, but it's placed wide of third man's right and brings four more"
"pulled, but it's in the air and not out of the middle. Fortunately for Rohit, the ball flies into space and goes safely to ground, bouncing out to deep midwicket where Nabi sets after it and dives near the boundary's edge, but touches the marker with his foot as he's hauling the ball back in to concede four more"
"his first ball rushes on to de Kock, taking a thick inside edge of his poking defence"
"de Kock backs away, looking to give himself room, and though Nabi follows him he can't stop a thump back down the track in his follow through"
"tucked into the leg side, where Vijay Shankar swoops from midwicket and has a shy with one stump to aim at. It's an excellent throw, and a direct hit, but Rohit's bat is grounded behind the line before contact is made"
"using the angle, de Kock flicks a single out to deep square leg"
"Rohit spots a little width, but his forcing stroke off the back foot is intercepted at cover"
"darted in full at Rohit's legs, and he glances out to the man at deep midwicket to keep the strike"
"full, straight, and Rohit is forward to drive for a single"
"too straight, and all Quinny needs to do is beat the man at short fine leg to collect his first boundary. He does so with a neat, controlled glance"
"pulled with authority! Quinny's just spent the summer scoring runs on the fast-bowling havens in South Africa, so this bouncer from Bhuvi doesn't have the wheels to intimidate him and he swivels back into a thumping pull"
""
"Bhuvi adjusts with a slower offcutter, on off stump at just over 121km/h, and it's slapped to the short extra cover fielder, on the bounce"
"whipped into the leg side, but de Kock can't find a way through the field on that side, and Bhuvi's pulled the over back with three dots in a row"
punched down the ground for a single straight away
"rare legbreak from Rashid, and the nip back in to Quinny beats his attempted glance. He's hit on the pad, but it's pitched way outside leg"
"fuller, quicker and it's dug out back to the bowler"
"googly, but de Kock seems a little late in reading it, mistiming a forcing stroke to extra cover"
"another googly, and de Kock bends into a reverse sweep - but Guptill pulls off an excellent reflex stop at slip to keep him on strike"
"Rashid ends an excellent first over with another dot, de Kock setting himself for a thwack into the leg side but picking out the fielder at midwicket, inside the circle"
"it's pulled, but not out of the middle and the ball trickles to mid on"
"<b>spliced to mid on!</b> Khaleel's change-up to around the stumps to Rohit has borne quick dividends. Rohit stepped back and set himself to pull in the air, but the ball just rushed on to him and ballooned off the splice to present Nabi with the simplest of chances at mid on"
"a paddle-pull brings runs! Yadav wastes no time, seizing on a back of a length delivery headed towards leg stump with a controlled pull that sends the ball bouncing out to deep backward square"
"Yadav wants to pull again, but he's not quite in position this time and the shot is inside-edged into the leg side"
"full, wide, and Yadav chops a square drive hard into the turf, the point fielder raising his hands to stop the shot cleanly"
"sumptuous! Yadav is up on his tippy-toes to thrash this rising delivery - on the up - through extra cover. There was just a hint of width on offer, and he's made the most of it"
"de Kock waits and dabs the ball down behind point, nipping through for a quick single"
"Nabi comes around the stumps, spearing the ball across Yadav on that angle. The batsman waits deep in the crease, and a short-arm jab brings a run to midwicket"
"rushing on with the arm, and de Kock swipes out into the deep on the leg side"
"chipped, and <b>perfectly placed!</b> Yadav has started in full flow this evening, leaning well forward and then using his wrists to lift a full ball cleanly and wide of long on. Long on and midwicket both charge around, but neither can get to it"
"flicked into the leg side with plenty of bottom hand, but it's not as well struck this time so it's just a single"
flicked off the toes for one more
"whipped firmly out into the leg side, but there's protection in the deep"
"full, and shaping slightly in to the right hander, who glances it straight to the man at midwicket"
"Yadav is slightly squared up as this full ball holds its line on off stump, Thampi bending low in his follow through to stop the ball"
nudged down to long on to turn the strike over
"<b>placed through backward point</b>, de Kock making room and lacing this forcing stroke right at the top of the bounce"
"de Kock looks to make room again, but Thampi follows him and they pinch a single as the ball zips past an attempted glance and ricochets off his pad"
"this one is flighted up a little higher, de Kock punching firmly to cover"
"de Kock backs away even before Nabi delivers, giving himself acres and acres of room and then thrashing the ball out to the cover sweeper"
"<b>lifted into the stands beyond wide long on!</b> Yadav steps confidently into a bottom-handed fetch into the leg side, and he gets all of it to send the ball flying 85 metres back and way into the stands"
"chipped this time, and there's a cry of 'catch it!' from Nabi, but the ball falls safely in front of long on"
"de Kock backs away again, almost making too much room as he has to reach for this one and squeezes it away through cover point off the very end of the bat"
"pushed through flat and full, Yadav digging it out back to the bowler"
"around the wicket comes Thampi, cramping de Kock's attempted heave into the leg side for room. The ball takes a thick edge and bounces down to third man instead"
"slower cutter from Thampi at 125km/h, de Kock toe-ending a drive through mid off"
"Yadav walks across but misses his glance, the ball rolling to short fine off the thigh pad as they steal a quick single"
"short and rising on middle stump, de Kock rocking back and hammering a pull wide of long on, where a diving stop from Vijay Shankar at the boundary's edge saves runs"
"nicely bowled, a sharp yorker tailing in to off stump, and de Kock can only dig it out to point"
"another expansive pull from Quinny, but he picks out the fielder in the deep and Thampi completes a good over"
"fuller on the leg stump, de Kock stays outside the line and hits it towards long-on, along the ground"
"fuller outside off, driven towards long-off from the front foot"
"length ball on the stumps, de Kock goes back to pull but the ball skids on after pitching, bat-pad and into the ground"

"a full toss, just outside off, de Kock backs away and hits it towards covers"
"a googly outside off, length ball, Suryakumar was looking to dab it fine, gets beaten"
"and a release shot from de Kock. Length ball on the stumps, de Kock clears his front leg and pulls it over deep square leg for a six, brings up the fifty partnership as well"

"fuller on the stumps this time, worked towards long-on for a single"
"fuller and wider, Suryakumar slices it away and it carries all the way towards deep cover where Rashid makes no mistake. A good innings comes to an end, has helped Mumbai stay afloat"
"and <strong>an appeal for caught-behind</strong> but they decide not to review. Length ball down the leg side, Lewis goes for the flick but misses. Looks like the ball brushed Lewis' side on its way to the keeper"
"fuller on the stumps, flicked away towards deep square leg to get off the mark"
"length ball on the stumps, comes slower off the wicket, lobbed down the wicket"
"length around off, punched towards covers off the back foot"
"length ball around off, goes for the cut but not enough room, chops it into the ground"

"length outside off, goes for the cut but straight towards backward point"
"length ball in the stumps, de Kock was shuffling in the crease and tucks it towards midwicket, he is sprinting back for the second, the throw is not at the stumps but Saha collects and back-flicks to break the wicket but de Kock was well in by then"
"<b>Sunrisers have gone for the review, for a caught-behind</b>. Fuller and down the leg side, Pandya moves across and goes for the flick. Was there something on it as it passed the batsman? Yes, there was but <b>that's the pad strap</b>. Review lost"

"better from Thampi, short of length outside off, opens the face to steer it towards deep cover"
"length ball on the stumps, backs away and pulls it towards wide long-on, the fielder cannot cut it off, de Kock's on 42 off 38 now"

"fuller and wider outside off, de Kock opens the face of the bat to run it down towards third man"
"length ball around off, a lofted off drive by Hardik as mid-off was up. The long-on fielder cuts it off to two. Was a knuckle ball from Bhuvi"
"this time to the other side of Vijay Shankar at long-on, puts in the slide to keep it to two. Was fuller around off from Bhuvi this time, Hardik brought his wrists into play"

"length ball on the pads, tucked away towards deep square leg but only a single there"

"<b>and Wriddhiman's away with a boundary!</b> The ball is full and wide, and he manages to squeeze it away behind point, and wide of third man, for runs straight away"

"Sran finds some seam movement across Saha, who hops to fetch the ball softly into space on the leg side, keeping the strike"
"and there's some early shape for him! Malinga bends his first ball away from Saha's groping defensive push outside off, <b>beating the outside edge</b>"
"another outswinger from Malinga, but this one's not quite as extravagant and it's negotiated easily enough by Saha"
"fuller this time, and Saha presses forward to dead-bat the ball to the right of point, taking the chance for a quick single"
"and Guptill toe-ends one past slip to get off the mark! There was width, so the shot was on, but Guptill wasn't in control as he flailed outside off and sent the ball bouncing down to third man"
"<b>edged, but short!</b> Guptill is completely squared up by a Malinga outswinger, feeling for the ball and sending an edge towards gully, where the ball falls just short of the fielder"
"Malinga strays into Guptill's legs, and had this glance gone a yard further on either side of the short fine leg fielder, it would have been four"
Guptill is half forward to manoeuvre the ball behind square with soft hands
"Saha looks to angle a rising ball down to third man, but he picks out the gully fielder"
"past the diving fingers of the point fielder! Saha didn't bother keeping this thrashing cut down, and the width meant the shot was very much on, but the ball flew <i>just</i> past the airborne fielder at backward point"
"sprayed down the leg side, and it's a wide"
"there's a horribly woody sound off the bat as Saha steps into a front-foot pull, but he gets enough on it to beat mid on and pick up four more"
"Saha's down the track this time, but a shortish delivery from Sran hurries him and the best he can get is a single out to deep square"

"<b>drama at the boundary's edge!</b> Saha thwacked another pull into the leg side and Pollard thundered after it, trying to kick the ball back into play but succeeding only in pushing it into the boundary marker. Worse still, his momentum carries him over the boundary and into the advertising boards, which he tumbles over. There's a moment of concern, but it seems he's fine"
"<b>sliced to point!</b> Bumrah has broken through for Mumbai. It was a full ball that did it, the length drawing Saha into a drive. But it was a slower cutter, he was too early into the shot, and he couldn't keep it down, slicing the ball in the air towards point, where Evin Lewis leaped athletically to pluck the catch cleanly out of the air"

"worked off a length, into the leg side, but there's no space for a single"

"slugged into the leg side, and hard running brings two"
"Bumrah hits the seam, Guptill is struck on the pad, and the umpire upholds a confident appeal. There's a short discussion, and the batsmen opt to <b>review it</b>. The ball hits Guptill in line, just above the knee roll, and the ball tracker suggests that it would go on to hit the stumps directly. Sunrisers burn a review, and lose another opener!"
"Bumrah attacks the stumps once again with a full, seaming delivery at 144km/h, but Williamson uses the angle to work the ball through the gap at midwicket, hurrying back for the second"
"<b>beaten outside off!</b> Bumrah has been seaming the ball back in, but this length delivery holds its line outside off to beat the outside edge"
"Bumrah is tight on off stump, but Williamson's forward defensive is equally tight to keep the ball out"

"flicked down to long on, and they briefly consider a second run, but decide against it"
"Krunal's first ball is speared in towards the pads, and after Williamson misses his sweep Mumbai <b>decide to go for a review</b>. Quinton de Kock seems very confident, and it was him that pushed for the review. Was there any bat involved? It doesn't look like it, and there's nothing on UltraEdge.
