"<strong>Buttler breaks the bails off</strong> and seems very confident. This is really full and skidding across off from over the wicket, Hughes flashes and only connects with a whole lot of thin air. After being overbalanced, he looks to drag his back foot inside the crease. The toe is on the line by the time the keeper breaks the bails. This looks very close to me but there is nothing behind the line. Hughes has already started to walk off. He has been asked to return: not out. Benefit of the doubt going to the batsman? This was really tight, though. In fact, it looked out to me because there was nothing behind the line. Well, this dismissal takes the mind back to Moeen's dismissal in the Ashes #wobblyline"
