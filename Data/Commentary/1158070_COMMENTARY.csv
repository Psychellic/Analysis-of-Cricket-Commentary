"good lift off the deck, sliding past the ribs. Gets away with it"
"more dramatic bounce on the hips, and Bairstow leans inside, pops it out of the reach of the keeper, and Oshane Thomas does his best Curtly-at-fine-leg impression, aiming a big boot at the ball, missing, and hurdling the advertising hoardings in his run-off"
"back of a length, Bairstow squares up on the back foot to defend"
speared down the leg side
"full face of the bat, blocking back up the pitch"

"once again, good lift, wrong line."

"fuller length on a leg-stump line, clipped uppishly to midwicket for the single"
"<B>that's a better line!</B> Outside off, lifting wickedly from a good length, and past the edge. Perhaps too short to take the nick, but it looks pretty"
"a more compact leave this time, and an elongated over comes to an end"
"full and straight, blocked back down the pitch"
"too short, beaten for pace, but <B>gloved up and over the keeper's head!</B> Effective enough, and nearly carries all the way to the rope. Lots of carry on this deck today!"
"<B>inswing does the trick!</B> So full from Cottrell, bending in all the time, a big wafting drive, an inside-edge into the sticks, and Cottrell brings out his salute for the first time today! Finally, West Indies find the fuller length to challenge the stumps on this deck, and it pays instant dividends"
"instantly driven, skims off a thick edge, wide of the slips and down to third man"
"head over the ball, very full and straight, pressed back down the pitch"
"misdirected this time, down the leg side"
high-elbowed block to a full and straight delivery. The end of an effective over
"<B>uppercut, and straight to third man!</B> That's a sucker punch for Root, there's so much bounce on this deck, so he couldn't afford any half-measures. Cottrell, right back on the rope, didn't need to move to inhale a floppy chop at a wide one!"

"much fuller, and <strong>that's an elegant strike through long-on!</strong> A full swing of the bat, clean through the line and beats the diving mid-on"

"tight line, bending into the pads, and tucked to the leg side"
"short and outside off, more leaping bounce to take the ball over another kitchen-sink cut"

"outside off again, good line for dot balls, but not challenging the bat"
Hales shoulders arms to complete another economical over

up on the toes and chopped past point
"<B>edged and gone!</B> The extra bounce does the trick again, but it's the tighter line that makes the difference. Hales starting to lay bat on everything now, but this one was too tight to the body for the cut, and came out instead as just a thin graze to Hope!"
"outside off, jags off the seam towards the cordon"

"full and on the pads, can't make contact with his clip off the hip"
"full-faced defence, back down the wicket. Solid work"
"full length, perfect line, all Stokes can do is put bat on ball and acknowledge the excellence. A very rare <B>maiden over</B>"
"lifting outside off, through to the keeper with good wheels once more"
"<strong>thrashed through the covers!</strong> Morgan has been an excellent opportunist today, just a fraction too full for the line, so he stays leg-sided and threads through the covers again!"
"<B>short, suckered into the pull, and gobbled on the rope at midwicket!</B> It's not to be for Morgan today, Thomas's raw pace unpicks his resistance, luring him into a reflexive swat, but the ball was too quickly onto him. England are in some serious bother now!"

"banged in, Stokes pulls - <b>and gloves to the keeper!</b> He looks disgusted with himself, but that just got bigger than expected. Brathwaite suckers Stokes again! You normally expect Stokes to be strong on that shot, though the line from round the wicket cramped him for room"

"short of a length, <b>and Moeen edges a flaccid drive to the keeper!</b> Done by pace and bounce, as have several batsmen on this pitch...

"snorter, <b>snaffled behind the stumps this time!</b> Too hot for Rashid, who was on the back foot and fending away from his body, just a tickle as the ball sizzled through - and up goes the finger, Holder has his man!"
"<b>Bull's eye!</b> Thomas gets his five-for! Full and fast, up at 90mph and Curran didn't have a prayer as he stepped away and swung like a rusty gate... A proper demolition job to sum up the innings!"

"<B>short, hooked, top-edged, caught at fine leg!</B> Gayle queries the height, but that was just a well-directed bouncer... no, it wasn't, it's a <B>no ball!</B> That's a ludicrous decision, in all honesty. What's a bowler to do, especially when Gayle has taken a step down the pitch?"
"in the slot, <B>absolutely slaughtered into the stands!</B> Hard luck on Woakes, he couldn't go short because he'd bowled his one for the over, just back to the bowling machine length, and machine-gunned over long-off! Onto the roof of the pavilion!"
"through to the keeper, outside off. Good wheels"
"full and straight, and <strong>England have their opening!</strong> That just nipped back a touch, but Campbell was playing all round it. It's a different sport at this end of the pitch. Now then, nine more of those and England are in business!"

"quick again, tucked off the hips"
"short and fast from round the wicket, Gayle leans back to let it zip by"

<strong>a swish and a miss!</strong> Lovely aggressive bowling again
"full and straight, <strong>thumps the pad, and given!</strong> Hope reviews, out of hope, rather than expectation? It might conceivably be high ... but no bat involved. Impact in line but<strong> missing the top of leg!</strong> A good review, and England have another wicket overturned!"

"fenced to the leg side, on a tight line"
"<strong>a h-u-u-u-u-ge hack through the line</strong>, thumps the pads again, but no finger this time from the umpire. Wild strokeplay ... like something I'd play in the nets. Trying to match the master, I suspect!"
"<B>bludgeoned into the stands once more!</B> The faster they come, the faster they fall, smashing hard into the breeze as Wood comes round the wicket to cramp him for room, but that's right in his slot!"
"another hack, but a miss this time as the pads wear it instead"
"<B>marmalised onto the grass banks at midwicket!</B> Because, of course it is! Searing pace from Wood, back of a length, but he just trusts his eye and heaves for glory!"
"short, sways inside the line. Whoosh"
"slower ball, tapped to cover, and <B>Gayle has a 19-ball fifty!</B> The fastest in ODI history by a West Indian batsman. He's got something left in the tank for the World Cup, it would seem..."
"fires in the yorker, clipped out to leg, as Hope gets some rare runs to interrupt the Gayle storm"

"<B>pummelled over long-off!</B> A fraction back-of-a-length, so Hope this time leans back on the drive and lifts it over the rope!"
dabbed to the off side
"<B>lifted over backward point with utter disdain!</B> Another bouncing bomb from Wood, Gayle leans back in the crease, wafts up through the line and plops it over the rope! <B>The 100th six of the series!</B>"
"<B>101 sixes and counting!</B> England just want to get to the golf course while there's still daylight. Weight on the back foot, eyes out on stalks. <strong>Cuffed over extra cover!</strong>"
"<B>leans back again, making room for the ramp!</B> Two men back for the slog to leg, so Gayle gives himself room on the off-side, and guides it with an open face!"
"fine leg has just moved to cover the off side, <B>so Gayle suckers a clip off the toes instead!</B> This is nonsense!"
"<B>kapowed over midwicket once more!</B> Beausejour is writhing in ecstasy like ... something unprintable....  back of a length, slammed across the line. Wood is being massacred!"
"full, straight, <B>timber!</B> Out comes the off stump, and Gayle's cavorting series is over! He salutes all corners as he marches from the fray. Twenty-one to win ... I can't see England coming back from this..."
"back of a length, tight line, blocked"
"full length, a stiff-forearmed thump on the up, over the covers. Reeled in just inside the rope"
solidly into line. It's a different tempo now!
"blocked once more, Hope can't hope to match what's gone before, so he's just setting himself to see it through"
"<B>or not!</B> Hope slogs across the line as Woakes takes pace off the ball on a full length, and a grotty innings comes to an end. He really wasn't feeling it today, but it is scarcely going to matter!"
"outside off, a cautious start as Hetmyer leaves alone"
"full and straight, tapped to mid-off"
"a dirty swipe into the leg side to get off the mark. Yes, Hetty, he's in the mood ..."
dabbed into the off side for another single
"banged in short, defended down into the crease"
"very full, tight to off stump, zips through at good pace to the keeper"
"sharp bouncer, Bravo ducks. That is probably the end of Wood's work today. Of all the players to flog in a lost cause, he ain't the one..."
"slower ball, picked and blocked"
"back of a length, punched back to the bowler, who stoops to gather on the half-volley"
"good wheels, banged in short and zipping through to the keeper"
"rolls the fingers, nibbles past the edge. Well bowled"
"over-pitched this time, and thumped uppishly through long-on. Not remotely timed, but there's no-one to haul it back as it rolls into the rope"
"banged in short, too short"
"full and straight, defended back down the pitch"
"<B>smoked on the up over the covers!</B> Well, that might reignite the after-burners. Hetmyer retreating to leg to have a wipe, and some!"
"a mow across the line, a top-edge to third man"
"tighter line from round the wicket, defended solidly to cover"
"well bowled, if utterly futilely. Round the wicket, tight line, defended on the back foot"
"angled past the pads, another one notched off the target"
"tucked off the toes, can't get this one away"
"slower ball, attempted yorker, a languid drive into the covers, and a fine tumbling stop just inside the rope"
".... though to be fair, that is pretty poetic. One ball, one drive to long-off, and<B> one utterly crushing victory!</B> All over in 40.2 overs... the biggest defeat in terms of balls remaining in England's history, and the series is shared 2-2!"
