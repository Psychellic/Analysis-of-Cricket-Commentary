"short of good length around middle and leg, jags away a tad and Guptill gets a very mild leading edge into the off side as he closes the face of his bat"
"back of a length, leg-stumpish line, tucked behind square and they take on the fielder in the deep for a rapid second run"
raps him on the pad with a back of a length delivery. Guptill tries to close the face and gets hit pretty high. May have pitched outside leg as well
"short of a length around leg, Guptill shapes for a late glance but the ball drifts down the leg side and beats the bat"
edged and taken. Guptill's start to the new year isn't great. Cotterell sprays one across the right-hander and Guptill indiscreetly slashes outside off to send a thick edge into the hands of the wicketkeeper Chad Walton
"short of a length around off, jumps back to get on top of the bounce and bunts it down the pitch"
"full, outside off, leans into a drive to the left of mid-on to get off the mark. Good, tight start from Cotterell"
pushes away from the body and eases a fuller offering through the gap at covers
"sliding fuller delivery on leg stump, pushed down to long-on"
"spins into middle from a length, Munro gets a bat-pad as he jabs at it from the confines of the crease"
"a New Yea's gift for Colin Munro, a harmless full toss sprayed with all the room he needs to send it crashing through the covers"
moves away from leg stump to try and force a clip but the ball follows him and tucks him up to hit the pad
dares to go against the turn and lofts him over mid-off. It was slanted across and quite wide of him. Doesn't make an effort to move towards the line. Simply stands in the crease and opens up his arms. Not middled but good enough connection to comfortably carry a couple of bounces over the long-off boundary
"back of a length, tuns it through backward point with an open face"
length ball in his swinging arc. Munro swipes and launches it over long-on. Bang off the middle
and now a full toss on middle and leg that is flicked to the right of deep midwicket for a brace
"same shot, same region. This one's fuller still and Munro dispatches it with a clean swing over long-on. Dropped in the crowd for a second time. They're missing out on some good money to celebrate the New Year"
fuller ball and clipped off the pads through square leg
gets on top of the bounce of this short of a length delivery and drops it into the leg side for a single
"full and flat on middle, eases it down to long-on for one"
that's a poor delivery. Slants across a fuller delivery with too much room again and Munro slashes it over the extra cover region
"full and pushed across outside off, driven tightly to point"
"flat, back of a length, and coming on with the angle outside off, punched into the covers"
"too full, too wide. Badree is not learning from his mistakes here. Loops another one up with lots of room and Munro slaps it down the ground. Not easy conditions to bowl on, granted, but the line could certainly be tighter"
"length ball, again comes on with the arm. Munro tries to back away and force a cut but chops it into the ground"
"short of a length, punched behind point to square third man for a single"
a loose fuller delivery on the pads. This is all too easy for New Zealand. Munro heaves it over deep backward square leg. Another clean hit
"you give them so much width and they'll close their eyes and collect boundaries. Another full toss, seems to have slipped out, shovelled through the covers"
overcompensates now and sends down a short delivery. Bangs it in halfway down but it comes on at waist-height. Munro swats a pull ferociously through midwicket
"short again, much-better directed as he tucks up Munro on the hook but wrong line. Down the leg side"
"this is the only way West Indies could make it worse for themselves. A misfield in the deep. Powell gets down but cannot pick it up, lets it go through the legs. Ran to his right as Munto shovelled another pull wide of him at midwicket"
"brings up his fifty, off 18 deliveries. <b>Second-fastest fifty for New Zealand in T20Is</b>. Munro had already got a 14-ball fifty against Sri Lanka last year. A yorker on leg stump that is clipped out, turns it away behind square as he does so"
<b>through the hands of short third man</b>. Munro slashes at a wide shortish delivery and loses slight shape. Gets a thickish outside edge and Cotterell moves to his right at short third man but the ball bursts through
a long hop with an awful lot of room. Opens up and slaps it over the backward point region
"same delivery, same line, same length. It's all turning into a horrific template for West Indies now. Short, wide, thumped over backward of point"
slower full ball. The lack of pace doesn't help as he picks it really early. Waits for it before shovelling it over mid-off
"finally some respite for West Indies. Munro tries to heave a length ball over long-on. This time the room isn't as much and he gets slightly tucked up. Sends a catch into the hands of the fielder in the deep. Powerplay done, but Munro has inflicted some serious damage already"
"shortish, some width on offer and Williamson cuts to third man. Williams has overstepped"
"full toss, slips out of the hands. Tried the slower one and lost complete control. Heaved well over deep midwicket"
"fuller ball, driven down to long-off"
"short of a length, a non-turner outside off, punched down to long-off"
has he gone through him? Williamson loses complete balance as he pushes into a stroke. Walton whips the bails off. Was Williamson's foot outside the line? An extremely pacy length ball at 100kmph. Pushes it outside off and gets no turn. Williamson plays for the turn and keeps the bat inside the line. Loses shape but the backfoot has been grounded in time
"pitched up outside off, driven out to sweeper cover"
"fuller outside off, driven off the outside of the bat through backward of point"
"full toss around off, pushed down to long-off"
Badree strikes with a skidder. Phillips is completely baffled. Tries to bring the bat down for a flick and is rapped in front of middle and leg. Looked plumb. Just skidded on from a good length region
hangs back and opens the face to this length ball and knocks it to backward point
"flat length ball on off, punched to mid-off who makes a sharp save"
"appeal for lbw, going down seems like. Looks for a flick and gets hit on the pad as it comes on dead straight with the arm. Could have been an inside edge as well as there seemed to be two noises"
""
"shortish, outside off, Williamson shapes up for a pull and the backfoot slips. Still manages good control on the shot"
"sliding down the leg side, Bruce tries to pull it away with the angle but the ball follows him and hits the pad off the inside edge before going to short fine leg"
"a little short and wide, cut through backward point for a brace"
"what a catch! Carlos Brathwaite with one of the best catches I've seen. Tell you what, we're in the first day of 2018 but this will be among the contenders for catch of the year by the time 2018 winds down. Bruce tried to pull this one and it seemed as though he had picked the gap well enough. That's, of course, if you completely don't account for Brathwaite at midwicket, flinging himself full-length to his right and stretching out the right hand to pluck a stunner. Little time to react but he was so quick"
"shortish, pulled away but finds deep backward square leg"
"fuller on middle and leg, a lot tighter with the lines now, pushed back"
that's not been picked up in the deep. And Nurse can't be any less amused. Williamson pulled this short delivery past midwicket and Fletcher in the deep took off in the wrong direction. Too late by the time he realises and sprints the right way
