"fullish, sliding into the pads, 131kph and Guptill skims a leg glance wide of the man on the edge of the ring, Billy Stanlake can't get his rig moving quickly enough and that's a boundary off the first ball"
"length, around fourth stump, met on the front foot but checked into the covers"
"touch shorter, 135kph and nibbling in to his the knee roll as Guptill hangs back - high? Maybe heading down"

"short ball, 133kph, sits up to be thwacked on the pull, one to deep square leg"
"pitched up, Guptill swings hard, comes off the inside of the bat to midwicket"
slightly leg side and it's deflected off the hip

"sort ball, Guptll was backing away and had to punch a pull away square"

"taking the pace off, prodded into a gap"
"length, wobbly around off, Munro dinks it down the ground"
"here he goes again! Cross-seam ball from Tye, he makes a bit of room and splats it over long-off, another easy, breezy swing of the arms - <b>that's the NZ 50 up</b>, from just 28 balls!"
"short, stays back and attempts the ramp, fails to connect"
"slower ball but it's leg side and Guptill has scooped it over short fine leg! Audacious, gets under it, skips away to the rope again! NZ are flying"

"banged in, climbing through well over the batsman's head"
"short of a length, 135kph and jabbed into the midwicket area for one"
"back of a length outside off, toe-ended into the covers"
angled in with the arm and Guptill flicks a single to keep the strike
"round the wicket, pushed through and chopped towards backward point"
"darted flat, touch short but Guptill just prods it into the midwicket gap for one"

floated up and swiped down the ground for one to long-on
pushed through and worked back down the ground for one

looped up and swung away menacingly into the leg side
"tossed up and smeared over long-off! <b>Munro goes to fifty with a six, too!</b> Clean drive through the line, almost into the second tier - never mind the small boundaries!"
"flat and sliding on with the arm, Munro swivels and slaps it past deep backward square for four!"
"punched down the ground, respite for Aus"
into the crowd again! Munro stays still in the crease and creams it over long-on
"length ball on the pads, Munro hits a flat six over backward square leg! This one does<i> only just</i> clear the rope..."

"pitched up full on leg, Guptill flicked it away through backward square leg - <b>and that's the record, most T20I runs for Guptill!</b>"
fired in and tapped down the ground
"full and driven, towards long-off... who slips and lets it through for four more! <b>Brings up the NZ 150 in the process</b>"
"lobbed up leg side, slows the pace and Guptill seemed to glove that straight through the keeper, though hard to call it a chance"
"ooh, tries to get cute, going for a reverse-muller over backward point, doesn't get hold of it"
"tossed up and flicked firmly towards short fine leg, good fielding prevents it running away"
angled in flat and worked for one
"Agar baits the trap, and <b>Seifert picks out deep square leg!</b> Hitting towards the longer part of the ground, against the spin and the connection wasn't good, sailed down the throat of Finch, who holds it safely"
"pushed through on middle and leg, Guptill settles for a prod to long-on"
"short of a length, 130 kays and pulled flat through midwicket"
"short ball, pulled into his thigh pad and Chapman wants one, is sent back wisely but Guptill... and <b>Stoinis misses with a toe-end dink towards the stumps</b> with the batsman trying to regain his ground! Think he would just have made it"
"full outside off, 131kph and punched to long-off along the baize"
"full toss on leg, bunted through midwicket for one more"
"short ball, Chapman pulls it to deep midwicket - only singles off this Stoinis over so far"

"short ball, pulled without timing through backward square leg"
"swung high and handsome over cow corner! Puts it on a length and Guptill puts it into the stand again, moves to within a blow of his hundred!"
"short now, Guptill swings savagely, lands the ball on the rope at long-on - <b>that's his century, from 49 balls!</b> Second T20I hundred for Guppy. Think it was a slower ball but it went pretty quickly to the fence, even though he was off balance"
full and swatted into the covers
"on the stumps, Chapman swings a single through midwicket"
"full and straight, well bowled, Guptill digs out one through midwicket - <b>raises the NZ 200</b>, with more than four overs to go!"

"full, taking the pace off, chopped for one"
"angled across, misses the tramlines"

short. 140kph and mistimed on the pull down the ground
"back of a length, taking the pace off again and De Grandhomme takes it on the body trying to swing up and over fine leg"
"oof, that's a blow on the helmet - <b>and it's knocked clean off his head and into the stumps!</b> Very unfortunate for Chapman, he's unhurt but he is out... Reminiscent of Pietersen getting out against WI a decade ago, the helmet slipped straight off his head and bounced into the wicket. Stanlake strikes, closing out a decent over"
"squirted into the leg side, Maxwell misfields as he attempts to fire in the throw and they come back for two"
"bowled 'im! De Grandhomme clears the front leg but is done by the slower ball, <b>thick-edges into his back leg and on to the stumps!</b> Another wicket at the death, Richardson snaffles the dangerous Bigman"
"slower ball again, dabbed square for one"
"pitched up and heaved into the leg side, they think better of coming for two"

"length ball, heaved into the leg side, beyond the rope... <b>and it's been snagged by an orange-clad fella in the crowd!</b> A brilliant one-handed catch, and he goes bananas, because it's worth NZ$50,000, I believe! The Aussies should get him in the team"
slung wide of the stumps as Taylor steps down
"again Tye loses his line, into the tramlines and he'll have to bowl it again"
full toss to finish and <b>Taylor slugs it over the deep midwicket rope!</b> The 18th six of the innings and it takes NZ up to a mighty 243-6 from their 20 overs!

"full at leg stump, takes the pad into the leg side"
"that's a very short one outside off, climbs over the keeper"

"short outside leg stump, he goes for the pull and there's a slightly belated appeal for a catch down the leg side...given wide"
"<B>dropped!</b> That one was gloved. On leg stump again, Short goes for the pull and it takes the shoulder of the bat - maybe glove as well - but Seifert can't cling on diving to his right"
"and that rubs it in, another short one and this time it's pulled away wide of short fine leg"

"another wild short one, the wheel(ers) are a little off for New Zealand at the moment...goes for the bouncer, sails over Short and the keeper"
"back on a length, pulled to deep square leg"

"short on leg stump, pulled effortlessly off his hip and it's a fraction in front of the rope"

drags a shortish ball from outside off to deep midwicket
"back of a length, stand-and-deliver from Warner, shifts his front leg out of the way and clubs it over long-on"
"done him! Beaten all ends up. Very nicely bowled. A googly, think Warner read it, went back to pull but was through his shot a fraction early and the ball takes the top of off stump"

pulled to deep square leg
"round the wicket, flicks a length delivery one bounce to deep square leg"

"taken at deep cover this time! Full outside off, jabbed out over the side, it's a skimming shot, reaches Guptill in a hurry and this time he holds on"
a length ball gets swing into the stands at deep square leg...into a hospitality box
"very wide outside off, barely on the cut strip...New Zealand have offered up too many extras"

"moves outside leg again, short of a length, goes over cover this time, wide of the sweeper and just in front of the rope"

"pulls a short delivery straight down the ground, one bounce to long-on"
"full, straight, drilled...and he almost holds the pose"
"chopped on! Southee rolls his fingers across this, Maxwell giving himself some room to open up the off side, into off stump"
"beaten first ball, trying to angle a length delivery down to third man...there is a <i>huge</i> appeal for caught behind by Southee. Seifert less excited. No review"

"goes full, driven in the air into the leg side, lands between long-on and deep midwicket"
"steers a full delivery through point, as he made it back for the second? No, he hasn't! A few inches short. Seifert did well to gather the ball and get it back to the stumps"
"full, wide outside off, carved over point to the sweeper"
"that's the match! Finished, aptly, with another six...a full toss is drilled way back into the crowd at long-on"
