Splices off the top half and carries to Botha at deep square leg, who runs around to his right, takes the catch, but throws the ball back up as he notices his momentum is taking him over.

"another one. Gets underneath the darted delivery on off, and reverses his sweep over point. Fantastic batting"
"full and wide, steered to short third man"
"excellent slower delivery. 114 kph, the slower variation outside off - the knuckle ball. Gets some away shape. Haddin is through his shot, checks it in the end and ends up skewing one to short third man off the outside half.

taken. Billings drags a pull from well outside off. Poor shot selection. Billings fails to get on top of the bounce and all he does is top edge a cross-batted swat into the hands of deep square leg. Hitting into the off side would have been a better choice

"sees Henriques coming and fires it in full and wide, slashed to backward point. Shot."
"well bowled. Floats this up outside off, Henriques comes down, wanting to go over cover. The ball takes the outside edge and flies down to the third man boundary. Shaun Marsh chases it down but parries it into the boundary"

nudged to deep square leg
punched to cover from the back foot
"slower ball, mis-timed drive finds cover"

"chopped through cover for two. Great running, should not have been two there"
"106 ks, yet another slower delivery outside off, smashed to deep cover. One more"
"splendid timing but just one. Full and wide, 125 kph, crashed through point"
"shovelled to short midwicket for a tough run. The fielder misses the stumps. No need for that run. Out by a distance if he hit, Turner the man"
"another non-existent run. Fullish around off, pushed to short cover. The bowler hares after it and misses the stumps at the batsman's end in his follow-through. Would have been out too"

"128 kph, slower ball, heaved into the leg side, on the bounce to deep square leg"
"poor stroke, considering it was Tye's last ball. On the pads, the knuckle ball. Silk was beaten for pace and misses his swing into the leg side. Ricochets onto leg stumps via the pad"
"a slower loopy full toss outside off, 102 ks. Botha watches the ball and hammers a drive between cover and mid-off. Good idea, poor execution"
"and that should be the game. Another slower ball, this one pitches, but right in Botha's slot. He lifts his elbow and lifts the ball straight over mid-off. Lands over the boundary."
"low full toss on middle and leg, 144 ks. Pushed to mid-on. Astute batting"
"tip and run towards extra cover, good stuff"
"more runs. Short delivery down leg, helped along to fine leg. Sixers three away"
that's it. A first pump from Botha. A short delivery on middle and leg sits up for Botha to pummel through backward square leg
