"length, around off, a bit of movement away, and he presses forward to defend"
"length, around off, defended from the crease, after covering a bit of away swing"
"fuller, outside off, and he leaves"
"fuller, raps him on the pad as he is squared up. <strong>Given out leg before</strong>! Is he planning to review this? No, he runs out of time after a consultation with his captain. Good ball from Joseph. He has got some away swing going, and got this to pitch around leg and straighten. Liton played all around it with a tentative poke, and the only doubt might have been about height. The umpire is convinced, and that's all that counts"
"fullish length, around leg and middle, defended back towards the bowler"
"length, plays this towards square leg, and then scurries through for a single. Slightly late response from Shanto, but ample time to get across for the run"
"short of a length, angles across him, and he defends"
"fuller, and he defends with a forward press"
"length, angles across, and he defends towards point"
"back of a length, and he goes back looking to whack this through the on side. Hits it hard, but straight along the ground towards short mid-wicket"
"back of a length, negotiated with a little hop towards mid-off"
"fuller, wider, and he drives this through the point region. Gets enough bat to clear the in field, and from there on, we have a pretty quick outfield at Chattogram"

"fullish length, driven back towards the bowler with a little forward press"
"length, zips away from outside off, and he leaves"
"worked away towards square leg, and pinches an easy single"
"short of a length, angles across him, and Shanto plays a somewhat ungainly pull. Basically hurried on to him even before he could get into a proper position. Plays it down to the on side for no runs"
"fuller, wider, and he drives this well. Keeps it controlled, and wide of the man at cover"
"length, and he looks to play this through mid-wicket. Off the outer edge, and goes just wide of mid-off. A more victory for the bowler, but the run for the batsman"
"length, around off, and he defends with a forward press"
"length, around off, defended towards cover"
"back of a length, and he goes back to punch this back down the wicket"
"good ball, cranking it up a notch to <strong>136 kph</strong>. Pitches around off, on a good length, and leaves him as he stretches to defend"
"short, and put away towards deep backward square leg. Bowled at 127.5 kph, and perhaps not fast enough to force a mistake. He swings around and gets good purchase on the pull, lifting one leg off the ground as he strikes it"
"length, a bit of movement away from him, from outside off. Left alone"
"length, stretches forward to defend one"
"pitched up, outside off, and Tamim Iqbal stretches forward and crunches this to the right of mid-off. Superb timing on this, as it evades the man diving to his right"
"driven to mid-off. Length ball, pitching around off"
"short, angles across him, and he ducks, ensuring he keeps his wrists low as well"
"little back of a length, punched towards cover"
"is that out? Fullish ball, down the pads, and he looks to flick this away. Takes a heavy chunk of the thigh pad, and goes through to Hamilton. Loud appeal, but they don't review this"
"length, closer to the stumps, and he defends"
"just a touch short in length, but he defends compactly"
"oh, that will <strong>go down as a drop </strong>technically! Harding floats one a touch wider, and Shanto looks to go over cover. Ends up skewing it to the right of mid-off, where Jason Mohammed goes for it to his right. Just grazes his fingers, and bounces away"
works one off his pads towards square leg
"<strong>oh, he's got this all wrong!</strong> Probably looking for the short ball to angle across Tamim, but it must have got stuck in his fingers during release. Goes way down leg, and Hamilton does well to reel it in"
"played with a stride forward, whipping it towards mid-wicket. A half-stop by the man there, but cannot prevent the single"
starts with one floating down leg side
"back of a length, angles in, and he works it off his hips towards deep backward square leg"
"wide of the crease, straighter towards Shanto, who defends this towards short mid-wicket"
goes back and works this towards deep square leg. Immediately said 'hoye jaabe (it's possible)' and came through for the second
"fuller, straight, and he defends from the crease. Not a great mover of his feet anyway, so just crouches over the ball to defend"
"back of a length, and he looks to drive this straight. Beaten by the line, more than the pace, and it goes off his thigh pad towards short third man"
"fuller, driven to mid-off"
"length, angles across Tamim, who is able to guide it to third man"
"length, pushed to mid-off"

"length, pushed to the left of mid-off, and they complete a quick single"

"down leg side, and he can place this between deep square leg and fine leg, and pick up two easy runs"
"length, and he plonks his front foot down the pitch, and works it away with the incoming angle towards deep square leg"
"length, angles into him, and he plays all around this one! Given out leg before, but <strong>Shanto reviews</strong>. I think, line-wise, he cannot have any complaints. Just the height might be a saving grace. It was a straighter ball, and he has basically just played around his front pad. No bat on that. Pitches outside off, impact is in line, and it stays with umpire's call, as it has grazed the top of leg"
"<strong>oh, what a chance to get Shakib first ball!</strong> Similar line and length ot the previous ball, and Shakib looks to play this towards mid-wicket. Off the leading edge, and it pops up to the right, over his shoulder, of Mayers, and he nearly gets across to catch it. Agonisingly close!"
"<strong>beaten off successive balls!</strong> Yet again, just nips from a length around off, after angling in. Shakib plays the line, and gets a thin outside edge. There's no slip, and third man is inside the circle. It runs fine, and through for four"
"this is close! It's full, it has <strong>struck him in front of the stumps</strong>, and West Indies have reviewed after it is given not out. Perhaps just some doubt about where it has pitched. Tamin shapes to drive straight, and misses out on contact again. It has pitched outside leg, though. West Indies lose one review, and Bangladesh will heave a collective sigh"
"length, around off, and driven through covers with a flourish. Struck well, and gives no fielder in that region a chance"
"length, width outside off, and he crashes this through the point region. Waits on it, and allows it to run along the ground. Some nifty footwork from third man helps keep it to two"

It's a shot that has fetched him a lot of runs today, but this time the angled bat doesn't help. Finds the minutest of gaps between bat, legs and just tickles the top of middle. Reifer leaps in celebration. It's a good skill, well executed at a critical time in this innings. That could just shave off 20-30 runs off the final total"

"slower ball, 113.7 kph in pace, and worked away with a little shuffle towards mid-wicket"
"walks across and tries to dink this over short fine leg, but <strong>misses</strong>! Yet another change in pace, and it passes not far from leg stump. No way the umpire would have called it a wide"

worked with the incoming slant to the left of short fine leg
"quicker in pace, just around off, and forces Rahim to defend this"

"looks for the slower, fuller ball, but ends up going down leg with it"
"<strong>oh, good connection!</strong> Mahmudullah stays deep in his crease, and picks a length ball, around leg and middle, down towards deep square leg. It's just 110 kph, and that allows him to tee the bowler up. Brings up the 50 of the partnership as well"

"full, outside off, and beats an attempted drive through covers"
"<strong>good ball!</strong> Full, and just around off, with a bit of movement in the air tailing back in. Mahmudullah fails to connect with a drive"
"full, wide of off, and outside the tramlines. Beats an attempted drive towards third man, but it was out of reach for him"
"full toss, outside off, and steered along the ground towards deep backward point. Deep point has been able to just pull it back with his left hand. Good job in the end, because his left foot was very close to the rope as he pulled it back in"
"yorker, angles into him, tucking him up. Can only dig it out towards long off"
"yorker, with a bit of tail in. Mahmudullah digs it out, on to the on side, and Joseph himself goes chasing after it. No chance of a run. Outstanding!"
"yorked again, and he can only just about get some bat on it. Jams it away towards mid-wicket. No fielder inside the ring, so Joseph himself goes chasing after the ball, and keeps them down to one"
"looks for the yorker, but it's ended up in the slot. Still, good pace on it, and Rahim can go inside out, to the right of the sweeper at extra cover. They scamper through for two"
"length, a bit of angle back in. Rahim looks to make way and go inside out, but the angle forces him to drive it back to Joseph"
"yorker again, angles in, and he looks to drive it away through the onside. Inside edge, on to pad, and falls towards square leg"
"length, angles across him, and he goes back and across, and tonks this over deep square leg. Superb pick up and drop by the batsman"
"length, wide of off, and he looks to go inside out. Cannot clear cover, though. It's Alzarri Joseph, who moves quickly to his left, and puts in a little hop to get across to the ball. Good bowling, because Reifer has largely preferred coming back in from around the wicket, but the angle across the right-hander works better for him this time"
"back of a length, and he runs it towards deep point"
"full, and pumped through the point region with the angle going across him. Very well placed, and sweetly timed!"
"<strong>oh cheeky!</strong> Can only be described as a reverse lap over the keeper. It's full, just around off, and he gets into position to play the reverse lap, and then just takes it on the full, and gets it down to third man"
"full toss, straighter, and whipped away to deep mid-wicket"
"fullish, around off, and he looks to flick this. Off the pads, towards point, and they go through for a leg bye"
"length, around off, and driven towards long on"
"length ball, possibly a change of pace as well, and he flogs this hard towards long on"

"length, shuffles across and works it towards deep mid-wicket. Played with soft hands, but they will only pick one for this"

"slower, angles across him, and he drives this uppishly towards deep point"

"full, outside off, and crashed hard, but straight towards deep point"
"length, driven to long off"
"<strong>fifty for Mahmudullah, and in some style!</strong> Backed away a touch, creating room in the off side. Harding serves up a length ball, on pace, and he can just go inside out"
"shuffles across, and looks to ramp this down the leg side. Pops up, but fine leg is back by the fence now. Easy single"
"full toss, way outside off, and he carves this towards deep backward point. Good throw from Akeal Hosein from the deep, as they chance a second. Finds him short of his ground at the striker's end"
"length, and he just stands up tall and whips this off his feet. Not sure if he intends to get this as square as he eventually does, but ends up finding the deep backward square leg fence with ease"
"length, slapped away across the line towards deep midwicket"
"slaps this down the ground, and <strong>clears long on</strong>! It's nothing more than a length ball, perhaps a bit off pace, and it allows Mahmudullah to clear his leg and swing down the ground"
"length, around off, driven down the ground, and they pick up two before mid off can fetch that"
"length, well outside off, ignored"
"straighter line, and worked off his pads towards mid-wicket. Easy single on offer"
"length, down the leg side, as Ambris shapes to flick. Called a wide"
"length, and he drops this in front of him with a little forward press"
"length, driven towards cover"
"short of a length, and he goes back looking to pull this away. Keeps a touch low, and slips beneath the bat, but the line is well outside off"
"length, and he drives this over mid-off. Not quite off the middle, but good enough to fetch him four"
"length, pitched outside off, and swings further away. Too far outside off, in fact"
"fuller, swings away beautifully from outside off. Left alone"
"length, swings away from outside off, and he shoulders arms"
"fullish, outside off, keeps going away with the angle, and he leaves again"
"full, around off, seaming away. Tries to tempt Ottley into having a go at it with a drive, but he shoulders arms yet again"
"full, and this time he drives with the swing away. Goes along the ground to point"
"<strong>edged</strong>, and gleefully accepted low in front of him by Rahim! Just a replay of most of the previous balls, a good length, fullish even, outside off, and a hint of shape away. A lazy poke at it by Ottley, and gets a fine tickle through to the keeper. For a while, even as he threw the ball up in celebration, the bowling side seemed unsure of the decision. The umpire's finger does go up, and Ottley starts a forlorn walk back to the pavilion"
"length, straighter around leg and middle, and worked away towards deep mid-wicket"
"length, angles in from outside off, and he just pushes this to the left of mid-on"
"length, way down the leg side. Saifuddin's radar has just been a bit wayward today"
"length, defends with a little forward press. Ball around off"
"straighter, around off, defended towards cover-point"
"a touch fuller, and he looks to drive. Off the inner part of the edge towards square leg"
"length ball, angles across him, and he goes back to try and flick this away. Loud appeal for leg before, but they choose not to review this. Probably sliding down leg"
"length, around off, and he defends close to his body"
"length, angles away from him, and he leaves"
"good length, shapes back in from outside off. He presses forward and plays it off the inner part of the blade towards square leg"
"fuller, at 135.2 kph, and he defends as it shapes back in a touch from outside off"
"length, around off, and he defends with a forward press. This was pushed across the right-hander"
"fullish, angles across him, and he leaves"
"length, and Bonner presses forward and drives this between cover and cover-point. Good timing"
"length, angles in from outside off, and forces him to defend towards mid-on"
"length, defended to short midwicket"
"full toss, outside off, and he does well to get some bat on this. Skews through the vacant slips to third man"
"length, outside off, and he can stretch forward and ease this through the point region. Two fielders, one from point and another from cover-point, go chasing after. The latter, Shanto, puts in a dive and pulls it back"
"length, worked off his pads towards square leg. Short midwicket is quickest to get across to it, as the non-striker Ambris sends him back"
"fullish length, slants across him, and he leaves after having some thoughts about having a poke at it"
"fullish length, and Ambris goes inside out. Clears cover and picks up four for himself"
"length, but down the leg side. Ambris tries to get a tickle on to this, but fails. Good take low to his left by Mushfiqur Rahim"
"length, angles across him, and he hangs back deep in his crease and pumps this through cover-point. Won't go all the way for four, but they will pick two easily"
"<strong>could be gone, and given!</strong> Don't think he's looking to review this either. Mustafizur gets one to pitch on a good length, just around off and middle, and swings in a touch. Ambris falls over a bit in trying to defend, but in truth plays outside the line of it. He knew this would have gone on to crash on to middle. Probably also keeping just a bit low, but great bowling by Mustafizur"
"full, outside off, swinging further away, and he tries to have a drive. Misses the ball by a fair distance"
"length, outside off, swings away, and beats the outside edge with another attempted drive through cover"

"back of a length, defended towards cover"
"length, angles across him, and goes off the bottom edge towards fine leg"
"full, angles across him, and he crunches this along the ground past point. No more than a little push, but supremely good timing"
"length, and he looks to drive towards cover. Off the inner edge towards square leg. This was bowled at <strong>142.6 kph</strong>, by far one of the quickest today"
"back of a length, angles back in, and he defends. This was at <strong>141.9 kph</strong>"

"length, worked away towards short mid-wicket"
"length, around off, and driven back towards the bowler"

"cutter, angles away from him, and beats the outside edge, as Bonner shapes to defend"
"length, straightens around off, and he drives it back to the bowler"
"flatter, quicker, and goes back into him. Mayers goes back to drive to cover"

"length, goes on with the angle, and pushed to cover"
"length, zips back in from outside off, and he jams this down towards fine leg"
"length, defends off the back foot"
"a bit of a wild swipe. Length ball, angling across him, and he tries to go inside out, but is beaten by the movement across him"
"length, tries to flog it away on the on side. Struck on the pads, but good bounce on it, and also going across him, surely. They don't review, but he definitely did get hurried up by him. Probably pitching outside leg as well"
"fuller, driven hard, but cannot beat wide cover"
"cut away towards point, but no runs on offer"
"turns this one a mile from outside off down the leg side, not given a wide"

"back of length towards top of off stump again, blocked again"
"accurate outside off again, on the back foot and he blocks on the off side"
"that's <strong>as plumb as anything</strong> but Mayers has reviewed it almost immediately! Mayers went deep in the crease for this ripping offbreak with the seam position pointing towards first slip, it's pitched on leg stump and turned enough to hit the stumps. That's a review wasted early on"
"loopy offbreak around off stump, worked to the leg side"
"well outside off, he lunges forward a long way and blocks, Test-match style"

"bit too full and that's driven very well off the front foot as he gets some width, for two in the covers"
"<b>another lbw appeal and another one given, but here's another review</b>! Only en edge can save him here. Shakib pitched it from wide of the crease, and looks like it was headed for the stumps after beating the inside edge, but UltraEdge shows a spike and the decision has been overturned"
overpitched outside off and it's driven to deep extra cover
"<strong>return catch put down by Shakib</strong>! Jason drove it back and hard, over the bowler's head and Shakib jumped to get his left hand to it but couldn't hold on. It wasn't easy by any standards"

a lot more flight and driven straight to short cover this time

"better length on the stumps, worked to the leg side"
"towards middle and leg now, helped to short fine leg for a quick single"
"too short again, this one is also pulled but straight to deep midwicket. Loose delivery but not put away"
"turning in towards leg, he helps it to midwicket"
uses his feet to come down and drives it hard to long on
"<strong>thin outside edge</strong> to the keeper and Saifuddin sends a flying kiss while looking to the sky! It was just back of length outside off, Jason wanted to flay it on the off side off the back foot but only managed an edge"
"angling in towards middle and leg, helped to long leg for one"
"124kmh, a cutter towards off stump, he defends it back"
"a little too full and Powell has <strong>swung that hard</strong> down the ground with a big follow through, from off stump to long on, for the first six of the innings"

"a full offcutter outside off, driven down to mid off"
"<strong>right through him</strong> and more flying kisses for someone in the sky from Saifuddin! It's that awkward length from Saifuddin outside off which Bonner doesn't move much for and tries to block by staying still, leaves some gap between bat and pad, and the ball sneaks right through that!"
fullish outside off and driven straight to cover
"back of length and angling in for the stumps, he goes across and helps to fine leg"
"in the block hole outside off, steered straight to backward point"
"keeps a little low as Powell looks to cut off the back foot, Mushfiqur doesn't collect cleanly and concedes a bye"
"good length outside off, tapped to point and they take another quick single. Oh! Mehidy has hit Powell on the body while having a shy at the non-striker's end. But the apology comes quickly, no hard feelings. <b>No ball for overstepping so free hit coming up</b>"
"goes for the heave, misses it completely and is bowled. The zing bails go flying and he says no for the single"
drives on the up and it reaches cover after a bounce
drives outside off again and gets an inside edge to fine leg
"mid-on is up, he gets a full delivery and lofts that to the long on boundary for four. He got it from the inner half of his bat but mid on was in the circle which means there was hardly any risk"

"length, straightens into him from around off, and he defends with a dead bat"
"takes the outside edge, as he looks to run it towards third man. Good bowling from Mehidy, looping it up around off, drifting away, and then just turning lesser than what the batsman anticipates. It's a forgettable debut for Hamilton, who feathers it through to Rahim, who throws up in delight"

"length, played to point"
"length, angles in from around off, and he defends towards midwicket"

"length, and he stretches forward to defend"
"length, and he stretches forward to smother this, pitching around off and middle"
"length, presses forward to defend"

"cutter, just around off, moving away, and Powell shapes for a pull, but misses out"

"angles in towards the pads, and he can lean back and work this off his hips towards square leg"
"cutter, and he guides it towards deep third man with an open face"
"fuller, outside off, and a change in pace. Reifer looks to drive, but is beaten by both the line and the lack of pace. Ends up playing well outside the line"
"length, pace up, and he defends towards cover-point"
"length, dropped on the bounce towards long on"
"length, worked towards mid off, and they set off. An underarm attempt at the non-striker's end, and perhaps would have been close if he had struck"

"works this towards mid-wicket again. Wants two straight away, but the fielder is quick to get across to this"

"that could be plumb! Length ball, angles in from outside off, and he falls over in trying to work it away on the onside. <strong>Given out</strong>, but he has reviewed this. No bat on this. And the line is pretty adjacent too. Probably umpire's call, at worst, for Soumya Sarkar. It's actually three reds on the tracker, and that's great news for Sarkar, as he gets rid of the dangerman Powell"

"length, around off, driven firmly through extra cover region"

"full, on off stump, driven to long off"
"length, and a lazy, elegant lofted drive straight down the ground. Just clears long off"
"worked away towards deep midwicket. They go for the second, but the return is a good one, and that catches Joseph well short at the non-striker's end! It's a decent shot from Reifer, but he was always tempting fate because Shanto had done really well to get to that ball, and send in a good low throw to the bowler. Just needed to collect, and whip the bails off. Doesn't even need the TV umpire to get involved"
"length, taps this towards deep mid off"
"length, straightens from around the wicket and wide of the crease. He defends from the crease"
"<strong>good catch by Rahim?</strong> There's definitely an edge, and Rahim has got to the ball, and the soft signal from the umpire is out. Let's see if that carried or not. Good ball, decent pace, and forces Hosein to have a little nibble. Good, low catch to his left by Rahim, who has overall had a good day"
"fullish, and he is able to work this somehow off his pads towards fine leg. Searching for the yorker, but just not able to nail it to perfection"
"length, driven to the right of short cover, and Reifer retains strike with a single"
"short, and he goes back to defend this. Takes his bottom hand, as it probably hits him on his glove. Shows no emotion as he walks away after it drops by his feet"
"<strong>Taskin gets a wicket!</strong> Short, and he looks to rock back and swing this away towards the on side, but gets a top edge. Taskin plucks the return catch, as it hurries back on to him"
