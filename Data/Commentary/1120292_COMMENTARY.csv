"length ball slanting across towards off stump, blocked back to the bowler, off the back foot"
"similar ball to the previous one, similar result. Staying on the back foot, is Gunathilaka"
"again, that ball swerving across the left-hander's stumps - a little shorter this time. Makes a bit of room and punches towards long-off"
"length ball on off stump, defended into the covers"
"length ball slanting in towards off stump, blocked into the covers"
"again that swerve. Starts from a straighter line this time, and would probably have missed leg stump. Looks to flick, but the ball beats his inside edge and hits front pad"
"fullish, slanting into a fourth-stump line, driven to mid-off"
"back of a length, slanting in towards off stump. Plays with feet rooted to the crease, just looks to punch through the covers, and the ball hits his inside edge and flies over the top of the bails before running down to the fine leg boundary"
"back of a length, not too much width, forced off the back foot towards backward point"
"shortish outside off, the ball skids through to beat Gunatilaka's attempted swivel-pull. A bit of inward movement too"
"down the track, and that's put away pretty well. Gets some width to free his arms, and even though he's not to the pitch of it, he's able to flat-bat it into the gap between mid-off and extra-cover"
"back of a length, angling into the stumps. Big appeal for lbw after the ball slides past his attempted whip over midwicket, but I think he inside-edged it. Maybe a touch high too"
"back of a length, sliding in towards middle and off, blocked back to the bowler"
"fuller and slower now, pitching on middle and leg, and he quickly gets down on one knee to sweep to the left of short fine leg"
"quicker and shorter now, angling down leg. Misses his flick and the ball rolls to short fine leg off his pad"
length ball angling towards leg stump - he straightened his line after seeing him try to make room. Jabbed towards point
on the pads now - he knows Gunathilaka is looking to create room - and he tucks it away through square leg
"back of a length, sliding into the pads, worked to deep backward square leg"
"full on middle stump, and that's nicely played. Stays nice and still, ensures he doesn't get his feet in the way, and brings a nice, straight bat down to drive to the right of mid-off"
"back of a length, slanting across towards off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, makes room to slap through point, doesn't quite middle it. Off the toe-end towards third man"
"length ball, fifth-stump line. Shuffles across to clip to the right of midwicket"
"fullish on off stump, Munaweera plays a nice-looking checked drive to mid-off"
"back of a length on off stump, and Munaweera premeditates, exposing all three stumps to create room, and then simply lifts the ball over cover point"
"back of a length on leg stump, looking to deny Gunathilaka the room he's craving and trying to create. Flat-batted towards mid-off"
"back of a length, slanting in towards leg stump, pulled away through square leg"
"length ball slanting away from off stump. Looks to shuffle across and lap-sweep, hits it straight to short fine leg"
"again spots the batsman looking to make room and fires a flat, back-of-a-length ball at his legs. Punched to long-on"
"shot. He's lined up Imad here, knows he's going to get one that angles in and doesn't turn away - on a length or just short of it, and attacking the stumps. He waits, clearing his front leg, gets exactly the ball he wants, and pulls over midwicket. Slows down near the boundary though"
"again Gunathilaka moves away from leg stump. This time Imad fires it full and wide, asking the batsman to reach out for it. He does so, and slices it off the outside half of his bat. It's in the air, but to the left of short third man"
"back of a length, close to off. Doesn't get the room he wants to slash through the off side, and it nips in too, and doesn't miss off stump by much after beating the bat"
"back of a length, tight on off stump. Lets it come on and dabs to the left of backward point"
"on the pads, and that's a sensational shot. Flicked nonchalantly over backward square leg, and it keeps soaring through the night sky and carries all the way over the rope"
back of a length slower ball on off stump. Leans across to tuck it to the right of short fine leg
"length ball on middle and off, punched back to the bowler. He tends to play these from the crease, without getting a stride forward"
"good ball. An away-seamer in the channel outside off, and there's some extra lift as well. Easily beats the outside edge as Munaweera aims a no-footwork drive at it"
"length ball slanting away in the channel outside off. May have been the slower one. Aims a cover drive at it and gets only a thick outside edge that rolls to the left of the keeper, who makes a good diving save"
"back of a length close to off stump, dabbed to third man"
"shortish on off stump, defended with the bottom hand coming off the handle"
"length ball angling into middle stump, and that looks out to me. Takes on mid-off, takes off for a single despite hitting it straight to Imad Wasim. Direct hit, and he's at least three feet short of his crease. He isn't helped by the fact that he curves his run away from the pitch towards the end, for what reason I do not know"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and guides to third man"
"nice shot to start off with. A step down the pitch, and he gets a length ball angling in towards off stump, which he drives to mid-on with a nice high elbow and he holds his pose through the first few yards of his single"
"tossed up slow, close to off stump, clipped through square midwicket. May have been a googly that he picked out of the hand"
"full, close to off stump, driven hard down the ground and Shadab dives right to stop it"
"nicely bowled. May have seen him shaping for the reverse-sweep, and he fires it flat and quick outside off, beats the batsman for pace"
"shortish, turning down leg, pulled to long leg"
"back of a length, turning towards off stump, goes back to work it against the turn through midwicket"
"beauty. The slider - or maybe the flat wrong'un - slanted across the left-hander. Didn't pick it at all, went back and across to defend with the spin, and it shot past his outside edge"
"back of a length, close to off stump, dabbed to the right of third man"
"back of a length outside off, presses forward and pushes to the right of backward point"
"slower length ball on leg stump - he's very aware that Gunathilaka is trying to make himself room. In the end, all the batsman can do is punch with a straight bat towards mid-off"
"length ball close to off stump, moves forward to push into the cover point region"
"back of a length on off stump, pulled off the front foot to the right of deep square leg"
"short, rising ball on off stump. Gets on top of the bounce and taps it down to third man"
tossed up on off stump and Sadeera uses his feet to clip it smartly to the right of long-on
"shortish outside off, stabbed to sweeper cover"
"back of a length outside off, looks like the googly, jabbed into the covers"
"googly again. Was looking to make himself room for the back-foot punch through the covers. Cramped for room, he only manages to squeeze it to short fine leg off the inside half of the bat. They complete a quick single - Gunathilaka called early and ran in a straight line to the danger end"
"top-edge, but it falls safely short of deep backward square leg. A touch too short to sweep - he premeditated - and it was the googly too. Checks his shot, though, and that ensures it falls short of the fielder"
"flat, quick and on the stumps. Wants to clip it to long-on but the bowler moves quickly to his right to intercept and stop the single"
"starts the new spell by firing one down leg, and he gets down on one knee, quickly, to sweep it fine, to the left of short fine leg"
"fired in flat at the pads, clipped through midwicket"
"tossed up slow, and this drifts down leg. Batsman misses the flick, keeper misses the collection. Through Sarfraz's legs and they sneak an extra"
"oh my. Two bad balls for Sarfraz. Flat length ball outside off. Pushes at it, playing for turn, looking for a single into the covers, and it slides past the outside edge. He overbalances, steps out of the crease, but Sarfraz fumbles"
"flat and quick outside off, beats the attempted reverse-sweep"
"length ball outside off, pushed to extra-cover"
"flat length ball angling into off stump, swept to deep backward square leg"
"angles this into the left-hander's stumps from round the wicket, and he clips it neatly through midwicket. Run the first one hard, and look for a second, but Hasan comes in quickly off the rope and Gunathilaka has to turn around and dive to regain his crease at the bowler's end"
"down the track and Hafeez gets some wicked dip outside off. Looks to flick, doesn't get any turn, and the outside edge rolls towards short third man"
"down the track again, and Hafeez spots him and fires one at his pads. Clipped to midwicket"
looks for the reverse-sweep but the length is too short. Top-edges into his shoulder and it rolls to short third man
"back of a length, slides on with the arm towards leg stump. Wants to make room, can't get any, and punches back to the bowler"
"on the pads, tickled away to the right of short fine leg"
"length ball outside off, driven on the up to deep point"
"length ball angling into middle and off, clipped through backward square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, and that's superb. Takes a step back to shorten the length further, makes himself some room, and slaps it up and over extra-cover, to his left, and easily beats deep point running to his right"
"short, angling down leg, not too bad a ball when long leg is back on the rope. Pulled down to that fielder for a single"
"short outside off, swivels nicely to pull through midwicket, and it easily beats Shehzad, running to his right from deep square leg. Sarfraz isn't happy with Shehzad - maybe he thought he should have stationed himself slightly in front of square"
"fullish on off stump, doesn't quite get hold of his lofted drive, and doesn't get elevation, but it's safely to the left of the fielder at mid-off"
down the track and Hafeez shortens his length slightly on off stump. Whipped through square midwicket
"slider on the pads, clipped through square leg"
"down the track and he skips away from the line of this off-stump ball to drive inside-out to the right of sweeper cover. They could have pushed for two, but Gunathilaka wasn't interested"
"back of a length on middle and leg - again, no room to Gunathilaka - and he punches down to long-off"
sees him looking to make room and fires it flat down the leg side. Sadeera simply moves back towards the stumps to collect a wide for his team. Smart batting
"was there bat on this? Had to be, because it looked plumb otherwise. No one appeals. Again he moves this way and that, and Hafeez bowls a length ball that turns towards middle stump. Flicks across the line, gets an inside-edge into pad, and it rolls away into the fine-leg region"
"flat length ball on the stumps, whipped in the air towards deep square leg"
"length ball on off stump, shuffles across to tuck it into the square leg region. This time Shehzad sprints in quickly from deep backward square leg and keeps it down to a single. Earns some applause from his captain"
"down the track, flat-bats the wide-ish ball to extra-cover"
"full on middle stump, whipped to deep midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, googly, dabbed to the left of backward point"
"down the track, doesn't quite reach the pitch of this off-stump legbreak. Wanted to hit inside-out over the covers, only manages an outside edge that rolls to short third man"
"quicker one, shortish, outside off. Beats Sadeera for pace as he leans back for the late dab"
"back of a length, no real room to cut, chopped down into the covers and he sprints through to the other end to bring up his first T20I fifty"
"down the track, looking to make room, and he bowls a middle-and-leg line to deny him. Slapped to extra-cover"
"bang. Floated up slow on middle stump, and he gets his front leg out of the way to heave it away, over midwicket"
"looks to clear his front leg again but Hafeez bowls this quicker, angles it into his leg stump to cramp him. Swiped to the right of long-on"
"back of a length on off stump, no turn, punched into the cover region"
"down the track, looking to make room. Gets a middle-and-off length ball that he flat-bats down to long-off"
nicely bowled. Saw him stepping away to make room and floated it up slow outside off. Through his lofted drive too early and it turns past his outside edge
"full now, driven straight to extra-cover, and he sets off for a quick single. Gunathilaka sends him back, and he's nowhere near regaining his crease when Satfraz whips the bails off. The square-leg umpire doesn't even call up his mate upstairs"
"flat and quick and full to start, on off stump, driven back to the bowler"
"wide-ish length ball, slapped to sweeper cover"
"gone! The low full-toss gets him the wicket. It was the pace, though, that did it. A quicker ball, at 116kph, slanting away from off stump. He bowled that because he saw Gunathilaka shaping to reverse-sweep. Denied him time to pick his spot, and all he can do is scoop it straight to short third man. Slomo shows he bowled that seam-up. Nice variation"
"flat and quick on off stump, clipped through backward square leg"
"back of a length on middle stump, clears his front leg to swipe to deep midwicket"
"full, close to off stump, driven firmly to mid-off, and Prasanna has to dive to make the bowler's end. Another direct hit, and this one goes to the third umpire. He's gone, by a couple of inches. Not sure who the fielder was, but anyway, that's Sri Lanka's third run-out. Mohammad Nawaz was the fielder - not sure who he's subbing for. Once again a batsman runs in a curved line, away from the pitch. In this instance, he could have shaved those two inches had he dived straight"
"full, close to off stump and slanting away. Thisara has a huge heave at it, and the outside edge loops in the air, to the right of third man"
"length ball, opens his bat face to slice it to third man"
"shortish, not short enough for the pull, and he hits from down to up, high in the air, and Nawaz, running to his left from mid-on and back towards the boundary, takes a superb running, diving catch. Two excellent interventions in the field in this over - what more can you ask for from your sub?"
"back of a length, angling into middle stump, wants to punch to long-on, only manages an inside-edge to midwicket"
"fullish outside off, driven through backward point. Literally through backward point, because Shehzad falls flat on his backside as he looks to get behind the ball and stop it. To be fair to him, he got a bit of bad bounce - it spun away from him"
"full, in the blockhole, jammed back to the bowler"
"full on middle stump, but not full enough to be a yorker, and that's put away. Exposes all his stumps to make some room, and frees his arms to drive between mid-off and extra-cover"
"slower bouncer angling into the batsman, and that's another excellent bit of fielding. Swivels into a pull, but the lack of pace means he can't really get power into it. Hasan, at short fine leg, still had some work to do to catch this: he had to jump in the air, to his left, and stretch out to grab it with both hands. Timed his jump perfectly"
"wide-ish, shortish, he goes for the uppercut, and all he can do is pick out Babar Azam on the point boundary. It isn't an easy catch by any means. He sprints hard to his right, and is still on the run when he completes his catch. Sri Lanka have lost six wickets in 17 balls, while scoring 11 runs. What a meltdown."
"back of a length, angling into middle stump, and that's a hat-trick for Faheem Ashraf! Keeps a little bit low, and Shanaka, looking to pull, plays well over the top of the bounce. Hit on the upraised front pad, in front of middle, and that kept low enough to make this the easiest of on-field lbw decisions to give. Though ball-tracking says umpire's call on height."
"full, at the left-hander's feet. Clips to long-on, but it hangs in the air for a while, and Hasan throws himself to his left for the attempted c&b and nearly makes it four in four"
"low full-toss, swinging in slightly towards off stump, swiped down to long-on"
"full on middle stump, Pathirana slogs, and all he can do is hit it high and then down the throat of long-on"
"back of a length close to off stump. Swipes across the line, only manages a bottom-edge that rolls into the midwicket region"
"wow. As if enough wasn't happening already, the No. 11 plays the shot of the match. Length ball on off stump, and Sanjaya clears his front leg and hammers a drive wide of mid-off"
"slower length ball outside off, and the innings ends with Vikum Sanjaya slogging across the line and missing"
"full and outside off, drives to mid-off"
"beautiful clip off the toes, placing the ball between mid-on and midwicket. His balance at the crease, ensuring that he plays the awayswinger late helps him pick the gap"
"good length ball outside off, blocks it gently"
full delivery wandering way down leg
"whisks a length delivery on middle away to deep square leg. Doesn't bother about moving his feet, and why does he have to when he can all but helicopter the ball over the infield"
"back of a length and outside off, runs it down to third man"
"yorker, tailing into the left-hander, Zaman is able to squeezes it out to the left of mid-on"
"flatter delivery on leg stump, Zaman punches it to long-on"
"stays around the wicket to the right-hander too, who nudges a length ball off his toes to square leg"
"a shortish delivery on off stump, Shehzad rocks back and drills it to deep midwicket"
"loops it up on off stump, drives to long-off"
"drifts down leg, and Shehzad misses his sweep"
"pierces the gap at cover! And it's a tiny one too. Plus he is driving off the back foot, when the ball is quick and full. All of that requires excellent balance, and a steady head. He exhibits both"
clips a good length ball on middle and off through midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, blocks into the covers"
"<b>falls just short of short cover</b>. A lovely delivery from Sanjaya squares Shehzad up so badly. His feet are rooted at the crease. His hands thrust the bat way in front of his body. The outswinger takes the leading edge, but doesn't carry"
"full on middle and leg, Zaman defends"
heaves a length ball on leg stump out to deep midwicket
"full on leg stump, but it's been speared to the long-on boundary. Pure bottom-hand power, ensuring a ball swinging quite late into the leg stump - essentially a pretty good ball - is absolutely punished"
"full and outside off, Zaman clears his front leg and slices the ball to cover"
"that's gorgeous, as are all late cuts. Shuffles across on off stump, waits for the slow, shortish delivery to reach him and then places it between backward point and short third man"
"shortish on middle, Shehzad whips it through midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, chops it to cover"
"premeditates to make room down leg, but Munaweera loops the ball outside off stump and in trying to reach the ball and carve it over cover, Zaman falls off his feet"
"excellent throw in from deep midwicket and Udana catches Zaman short of his ground. Tough on the batsman, after timing the short ball beautifully out into the vacant area. Zaman thinks there is a third on offer, Shehzad agrees to it at first but then sells his partner down the creek."
"shortish on off stump, Babar gets in line with it and drills it through mid-on"
"<b>gives him lbw</b>! Udana is the man with the golden arm, whether it is throwing from the deep, or bowling it to one of Pakistan's best batsmen. This is a fuller delivery, pitching on off stump, and starting to shape back into Babar. The right-hander flicks across the line, and doesn't connect with the ball. Huge appeal comes, and the umpire Shahab cedes to it. <b>HawkEye says it would be missing off stump by several inches</b>."
"full and outside off, Malik attempts to drive through cover, does so too early and the ball goes back down the pitch"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives to cover"
drills it to cover
gets forward to block a full delivery on off stump
"back of a length and outside off, glides it through to third man"
gets some turn as he plants a full delivery on off stump. Malik covers it well
stays leg side to drive a full delivery on middle to long-off
"much slower through the air, but the length delivery pitches on leg stump and carries on through the arm"
"shapes for the big hit, but with Pathirana able to get the ball to drop on the batsman on off stump, Shehzad has to check his shot"
"charges down the pitch, but Pathirana spots it, bowls quicker through the air, cramping him on middle and leg. Shehzad swings and gets an inside edge behind square leg"
drives a tossed up delivery quite sweetly to long-off
"despite a slip in place, Shehzad is happy to indulge in a late cut, makes sure to keep it down and place it to the right of the fielder. Even comes back for the third this time"
pulls a shortish delivery angled across him to deep square leg
"gets up off his toes to blunt a short ball to deep square leg. And by playing it gently, he's able to pinch a couple"
"too close to cut, and Malik nearly chops the shortish delivery onto his stumps"
"superb timing on the back foot punch, and Gunathilaka at point does well to leap to his right and parry the ball towards cover"
"inside edges a back of a length delivery, looks up to see if his partner wants a quick single, gets the nod and sets off."
short ball from around the wicket. Malik drops his hands and sways away
"plays around his front pad as Pathirana tosses it up on middle. Good thing that he got bat to that or he might have been lbw. As it is, Pakistan get a single behind square leg"
"goes on with the arm, does this flighted delivery and Malik's drive to long-off skews off the inside edge"
this time he accounts for the left-armer's angle into leg stump by keeping his front leg out of the way of his straight bat
"pulls his length back, and this delivery holds on the pitch, so much that Malik's push down the pitch nearly carries back as a return catch"
goes inside out and drives to long-off
pushes to the left of cover to keep strike
"charges out to the first ball and punches it to the sweeper. Shehzad wants two, he gets it and Malik also ends up in danger as the wicketkeeper collects the throw from the deep and aims at his end."
"back of a length and outside off, Shehzad slices it behind point, hoping to find the gap, but Gunathilaka does really well, putting in a big dive"
"another sensational save, Shanaka the man at short midwicket. A one-handed pick-up stopping a full-blooded, down-the-track pull shot"
"goes for the short ball on middle, but it gains a little too much height"
"excellent take, Shanaka! Pulled off a superb save earlier in the over to keep Shehzad on strike, now completes the catch that sends him back. Another pull shot from the batsman, aiming to clear the infield. But Shanaka leaps high, sticks both hands over his head and comes down with the little white thing firmly in his grasp."
clips a good length delivery just outside off to deep midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, he punches to cover"
"flatter delivery, sliding into the pads, he flicks it to deep square leg"
"loads of air on this delivery, so much that it ends up a full toss. Malik flicks it to long-on"
"full and outside off, drives sweetly, beating short cover on his right"
"gets down the pitch, but Pathirana doesn't allow Malik to get under the ball, spearing it at his toes. The batsman works it away to long-on"
"full and outside off - the line is so because he wants to prevent Hafeez from getting close to the ball as he charges out to meet it. As a result, the batsman can only play a circumspect shot to cover"
"shortish on off stump, cuts to cover"
"he's got two in two overs! And it's a big one. Malik was the man who ushered the chase through on Thursday. Twenty-four hours later, trying to play a shot that provided him such great dividends - the glide to third man - he's caught behind"
"back of a length and outside off, Sarfraz dabs it to point"
"slices a back of a length delivery outside off nice and fine, and though it beats the slip fielder, Pathirana on the third man boundary ensures it doesn't trickle through."
drives on the up the good length ball outside off and makes sure to place it to the right of point
turns a shortish delivery on his hips away to deep midwicket
"<b>hits high on the bat</b> as Sarfraz pulls a bouncer which seems to get big on him, and doesn't really allow him the freedom to free the arms. The ball lobs up, but falls safe towards the left of midwicket"
"pitches it right up there on off stump, Hafeez waits for it and clips the ball to deep square leg"
"full on off stump, drives to long-on"
"<b>keeps low</b> does the ball, pitching just short of a good length and outside off. Hafeez does well to block it"
"superb drive through cover, but there is a fielder sweeping on the boundary. Regardless, the shot, the way he hit on the up and times the ball, is quality"
"back of a length and outside off, Sarfraz thumps it to the sweeper cover"
"targets the stumps with a fuller delivery, Hafeez directs it to long-on with a perfectly straight bat"
opens the face to run a shortish delivery outside off to deep third man
slogs a shortish delivery from outside off to the right of mid-on
"<b>mistimes</b> the hook, but gets enough bat on it to clear the short midwicket. Thisara bangs the ball into the pitch and it rises towards the peak of the batsman's helmet. Tough to hoick balls away from there"
"lead feet - as a result of the short ball - and Sarfraz nearly nicks off to the wicketkeeper, flashing outside off. Excellent bowling from Thisara"
screws his head back on as he glides a short delivery outside off to third man
drives on the up and sends the good length ball outside off to the sweeper cover
"attempts to scoop a full delivery outside off, but it ends up going a lot squarer, just about clearing midwicket"
whips a short delivery on off stump to deep square leg
"slower ball, in the blockhole outside off, Hafeez squeezes it out to deep point"
"<b>appeal for a run-out</b>, with Samarawickrama taking the throw above his head and flicking it back down to the stumps without looking at them, like Dhoni does. A short ball, pulled to the deep square leg boundary, fetches the two Sarfraz wants"
"slogs a short of a length delivery on leg stump to deep square leg again. Sarfraz takes two, and Samarawickrama tries that back flick onto the stumps again. Doesn't hit the target"
"tickles off his pad and flies away to the long leg boundary. That's the first in a while for Pakistan. Length ball, meant to cramp the right-hander. Sarfraz tries to swing it over square leg. But he wouldn't mind this result"
"shortish delivery, from around the wicket. Hafeez is able to flick it from off stump to deep square leg"
"shortish and outside off, slices it to deep point"
defends a shortish delivery on off stump to point
simple straight bat comes down to meet the overpitched delivery outside off and the ball screams away through the covers
"excellent shot! Especially because the bowler has adjusted to Sarfraz making tons of room outside leg. Udana follows the batsman, and still he is able to pick the gap behind point"
"goes for the pull shot, but again, Sarfraz is slow on it and the ball lobs away into the square leg region"
"loops it up, and with the ball wandering down leg, Sarfraz tries to sweep it. Doesn't make any connection. There's an <b>appeal for a stumping</b>, but his back foot is well inside the crease"
"lovely bowling - pulls the pace off, gets the ball to drift into leg stump. A very cramped Sarfraz can only block down the pitch"
"loses his balance in playing the sweep - credit to the bowler again, bowling slow through the air and as a result not giving Sarfraz the pace to work with"
"backs away, but Pathirana insists on keeping his pace down. All he does is change his line to outside off and the batsman bunts it away to the sweeper"
"pushes it through on middle, Hafeez pulls to deep midwicket"
<b>misfield at cover</b> as Sarfraz backs away and slaps a flatter delivery off the stumps with a fair bit of power
"down to the captain at long-on and he takes it cleanly! Hafeez looks for the boundary, going for the lofted shot down the ground. Doesn't have enough power in it and Pathirana provides the wicket Sri Lanka have been desperate for"
finally connects the pull shot and the ball races away to the deep midwicket
slices a short of a good length delivery outside off to deep third man
presents the straight bat to a full length delivery that curls into the right-hander. Sanjaya's making the old ball jag about.
"backs away, Sanjaya follows him, looking for his toes, Imad is still able to lash it down to long-off"
"great work at long-on! It's Priyanjan, running to his right, diving to stop the ball from getting past him. A firm pull form Sarfraz results in only two"
"<b>this one darts away past the outside edge</b>! Sanjaya's bowled a lovely over, pitching the ball near the blockhole and getting it to swing in the air. Sarfraz's attempts to dig it out all in vain"
"traps him lbw! Awful shot from Imad - he's trying to sweep a proper yorker and as a result, the ball has a free path to slam into his boot before the bat is anywhere near it. Perfectly in line with middle stump."
"<b>nearly carries to point</b>. Sri Lanka's seamers are getting this old ball to swing in the air - this one, which is angled into the left-hander, nips away at the last second to take the leading edge as Ashraf flicks"
whips it away to deep midwicket
"<b>Sri Lanka think they have Sarfraz run-out</b>. The wicketkeeper has simply raced away, absolutely certain and he's right. The wicket is the result of a yorker length delivery, off a round-arm action. Sarfraz drills it to long-off and he wants to pinch an extra run - the result of all the pressure he's under, and he comes in second best. Superb throw from Gunathilaka, picking the right end and making sure it was right next to the stumps"
what a shot! He yanks a near yorker on off stump and slices it past point. Amazing that he is able to generate that much power
"looks to sweep a full toss, which is just outside off, doesn't connect, survives the lbw"
"<b>There's an appeal from Sri Lanka for obstructing the field</b>! The soft signal is not out. Right then, all this starts with another yorker, from around the wicket. it tails into the right-hander, who digs it out. The ball travels towards Faheem, who is down the pitch, looking for a single. And Udana isn't able to get to the ball until Faheem extricates himself and gets back in his crease. That's why Sri Lanka asked the question, but it really wasn't intentional"
"nails the blockhole again, Shadab clips it to the leg side and runs. He would have been run out had Udana hit the stumps direct at the non-strikers' end"
"full on middle, Faheem slogs wildly and gets an inside edge to long leg"
skews it out to deep square leg
"<b>yorker again</b>, just outside off, Faheem tries to slice it behind point but cannot get bat to it. This is absolutely brilliant death bowling"
"appeal for lbw as Udana bowls full and angles the ball into the pads. Faheem swings hard, looking for the midwicket boundary. He has to accept a leg bye and Sri Lanka have to accept that ball would have been sliding down."
"<b>caught at long-on! What scenes!</b>. A superb yorker, tailing in late to the left-hander, is whipped powerfully. But even with all that power, it doesn't carry the distance and that's only because Sanjaya puts the ball so full that Ashraf simply cannot get under it"
"full and swinging into the right-hander, who has cleared his leg, waiting for it. Even so, he can only hack it down to long-on"
"<b>dropped at long-off</b> Gunathilaka the man, racing in, and having to leap to his left. Good effort, but at this stage of the game, those three runs could prove pivotal"
"hoists it straight down the ground! What a shot! Sanjaya goes for the blockhole, but misses it, comes out as a length ball and Shadab smacks it with fearsome power"
"full and outside off, dabs it to long-on, with the express purpose of getting two and he pulls it off! Shadab is absolutely pumped! What a talent! Good batter, sensational bowler, top fielder and a gun player under pressure. He banks on the ball being close to yorker length. He sees long-off and long-on back. He gently taps it down the ground, soft enough to seal Pakistan's series win"
