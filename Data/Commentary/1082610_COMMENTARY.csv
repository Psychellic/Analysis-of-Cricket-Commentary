"back of a length, swinging in at off stump. Plonks a big foot forward and defends close to the body with an open face. Then steals a run, uncharacteristically"
"good length, slight movement away, defended off the front foot"
<b>nearly chips it to short midwicket.</b> He walks across the stumps and drags this outswinger into the leg side from a good length. It lands in front of Ishan Kishan who dived forward but wasn't close enough
"slower ball, back of a length at off stump, waits for it and drops it in front of Jadeja at backward point"
"edges it past the keeper! The slip was just taken out, probably as a reaction to his last shot. He swings it away from off stump at a good length. Kohli follows and pokes away from the body, gets an outside edge through where that slip was"
"good length at off stump, walks at it and looks to whip it into the leg side. Gets a leading edge to cover point...where Dwayne Smith misfields"

"good length, angled in at off stump, drops it into the off side with an open face, sent back as he strides forward to try and steal a single"
"back of a length, skids through quickly and thuds into Kohli's thigh guard. He's backing away and outside leg stump, but the bowler appeals anyway. Why wouldn't you if you beat Kohli?"
"good length outside off stump, pushed on the up to extra cover. That one didn't come on"
"oh unlucky. This is a good bouncer. 143 kph, in the corridor. Hurries Kohli on the hook. He's not in control of this but fine leg is in. It goes there. One bounce."
"next ball is 50 kph slower. 93 kph, good length at middle stump. Kohli walks at him early and has to wait a long time. In the end, watches it closely enough and taps it to deep square leg"
"good length, slides back in at him as he makes room. Inside edge, onto pad, rolls to the keeper"
"good length outside off stump, nervous defence into the off side. Was into that too early"
"shot. Gives him the charge, whips this back of a length delivery off his thighs and past short midwicket"
oh lovely. Back of a length at middle stump. A slight shuffle across to glance this past short fine. He was more relaxed after that previous boundary. This was all balance.
"good length outside off stump, walks down the pitch and offers the full face on the straight drive. He's not to the pitch and has to adjust slightly to keep this down, but he has managed to push it past mid-off"
"walks at it again, good length, outside off. Defended into the off side"
"back of a length in the corridor, under-edge wide of slip as he tries to dab this to third man"

"<b>there's 10k.</b> Full outside off stump, gets a thick outside edge as he tries to slice this through point, down to third man"
"good length, just outside off stump. Straightens after pitching, just enough for him to mistime this push on the up. McCullum can't collect it cleanly diving to his left at short extra. Parries it to mid-off's right"
"full toss, slower ball, just above knee height outside off stump. Easy for Gayle to hang back and lift it over mid-off. It lands on the boundary rope and replays confirm it is six"

"full outside off stump, thumps this back down the pitch and catches Kohli on the pad"

"helllooooo! Fired flat, good length at middle stump, in the arc for Gayle who gets down on one knee and nails the slog sweep to get it over the square leg boundary"
"<b>what a catch!</b> Oh this is stunning from McCullum! Unbelievable! One-handed dive to the right to hold on to it low at the long-off boundary. It's a low full toss outside off stump, Gayle slices this wide of long-off where McCullum runs fast to his right and sticks out his right hand to take it as he dives and then slides. But as he tumbles, <b>the brim of his floppy hat</b> has touched the boundary rope. Oh why is he wearing it at this time. His body was well away from the rope and it would have been among the greatest catches you would ever see."

"good length at the pads, flicked on the up to deep midwicket"

"full and angled down leg side, gives him the charge and pushes this to deep midwicket's left"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off stump, steps out and bunts it on the up to sweeper cover"
"there's a slight sound on this as it goes through to the keeper. It's full outside off stump, Gayle wants to drive through the off side. He's beaten. Big appeal from keeper and bowler, umpire says no. Replays show the sound was bat hitting ground"

"full and wide outside off stump, squeezed into the off side, straight to extra cover"

"full, well wide of off stump, past the wide marker"
"good ball. Slower ball, outside off stump, spins away from his bat swing which was targeting the midwicket seating area"
"slower short ball outside off stump, 97 kph. Takes an age to come to Kohli who gets it right off the toe as he pulls. It doesn't even get past the square"
"good length, angling in at leg stump. He looks to flick it into the leg side, gets a thin inside edge that's well in front of the converging long-on and deep midwicket fielders. Raucous appeal from the bowler is ignored"
<b>fantastic yorker.</b> This is perfectly in the blockhole at Gayle's feet. He tries to dig it out but it sneaks through between his legs and misses the leg stump
<b>lovely from Thampi.</b> Showed incredible skill to nail his yorkers in the last game conistently and repeats this time. Pings him in front of the stumps as he looks to flick this into the leg side. It caught him on the toes and Gayle is a little unhappy to be given out. Slight chance that could've slid down leg
"time for some running. This is back of a length and angled across off stump, he turns it into the leg side on the up and the fielders are at the boundary there"
"slower ball, good length outside off stump. Tries to hammer it on the up, gets an under-edge that just sneaks past the keeper who is diving to his left. They steal a run against short third man"

"back of a length outside off, chopped off the back foot to sweeper cover"
"nice. Full at off stump. This one is closer to him than the first ball of the over, so he can control it better. Hence can lift it where he wants. He choose wide of long-on again and hoicks it sweetly"
"wrong'un, short and wide outside off stump, mistimed cut to deep extra"
oh this sounds so good! Picks the wrong'un that's angled in at off stump. It's the perfect sweeping length and he brings out the perfect sweep to launch it over deep midwicket
"good yorker. Tails in sharply at off stump, he can't do more than jam it into the pitch. Steals a run though"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off stump. He nearly chops it onto his stumps on the attempted pull. It drops to Karthik's right on the bounce and he takes it cleanly and unleashes a throw that might have got Kohli short of the crease if it had hit the stumps. It hits Kohli in the end, but he's back up"
"slower bouncer, stifles his attempted pull, but he manages to turn it into the leg side"
"low full toss at off stump, bat turns as he tries to punch this wide of long-on. Two more"
<b>holes out to deep midwicket.</b> He bowls a slower ball at off stump. It's at a good length and might have disappeared with a slog on another pitch. But here he has to make all the pace and he can't do it enough. Finds Smith at the boundary line
"back of a length slower ball outside off stump, finds sweeper cover with the mistimed cut"
"what a shot. This is full outside off, he goes back and across like he would to play a back foot shot. Slices it wide of backward point, easy peasy"
"good length slower ball at middle stump, no feet again, uses his wrists to drop it into the leg side"
"slower ball, wide outside off stump, yorks himself with his stride and squeezes it into the leg side"
"oh beautiful ball. Knuckle ball, good length outside off stump. He walks at it and looks to drive through the off side, but he has played it early and played over it too. Beaten"
"slower ball, full at off stump, pushes it back down the pitch after winding up to drive this"
"fantastic slog overs bowling. Back of a length slower ball, too slow for him, he's through the pull shot early and is beaten"
"drops the slower ball short at off stump, Head is waiting and classily pulls this behind square on the leg side to fine the gap"
"Thampi is paying for not bowling his best delivery, the yorker. This is overpitched outside off stump, the front foot is out of the way as he slices this over extra cover"
"length outside off stump, it's not a slower ball but it cuts away sharply and in the end, saves him from his attempted slog on the up"
"low full toss wide of off stump, driven off the bottom of the bat to extra cover"
"good shot. This is just short of yorker length outside off stump, he gets deep in the crease and carves this wide with some power, but not enough to beat McCullum at long-off"
"slower ball, good length outside off stump, taps it off the inside half on the up and gets it past the non-striker, who comes back for the second"
"oh so good! This is so clean, the ruling party will be proud. Anticipates the slower ball and is down the pitch like he's facing a spinner. Meets it at the pitch in front of middle stump and lofts it over long-on"
"back of a length slower ball outside off stump, this time, too, he has anticipated it. But he hangs back and waits for it to bounce. Then lifts it off the back foot over extra cover"
"good length, angled in at leg stump, shovels it wide of long-on"
"perfect yorker, wide of off stump, squeezes through from under his bat as he tries to chop it square on the off side"
"gives him the charge, cramped by a bouncer, but it doesn't matter. He's in the zone. Keeps his eyes on the ball, stands tall at it and rolls the wrists to get this one bounce over the square leg boundary"
"<b>dropped.</b> He puts down a high return catch. It's another slower ball at middle stump, but it's back of a length. So it has enough time to move away even after Jadhav gives it the charge. He looks to turn it into the leg side, but gets a leading edge that Tye tips over the bar. It was a well-timed jump, but he couldn't hold on"
"overpitched at off stump, clears the front leg and bludgeons it past the stumps and the non-striker. McCullum puts in a slide and parries it towards long-off, who nearly deflects it off his boot into the boundary, but its all good in the end"
"yorker at off stump, can't get power on it, squeezes it to long-on"
"drops it short, Jadhav backs away and has almost made too much room. But gets enough bat to slice it behind square on the off side. Sweeper was positioned straight, at deep extra. So there is no way he's getting to it"
"this is in the slot. Full at middle stump, clears the front leg, looks a picture of zen as he lifts this over long-on on the up"
"<b>what a player.</b> Back of a length, round-arm ball at middle stump. Backs away, waits for it to pitch and lifts it on the up, over extra cover"
anti-climax in the end. Jadeja anticipates his backing away and bowls a wide full toss outside off stump. He can't get bat to this. Beaten.
"a flat delivery on leg to start, Smith misses a pull, struck on the pad. Sliding down"
"plonks in no-man's land. A flat delivery on off, holds in the surface and Smith is through his loft. Falls between long-on and mid-off"
"a flat delivery on leg, worked down to fine leg. No run"
"a bit of spin. Flat outside off, some turn. McCullum watchfully pushed to cover"
"this is darted in to leg, McCullum is taken aback by the pace as he misses a flick."
"great start from Negi. Flat and straight, sticks in the surface. McCullum defends. Excellent over, and that asking rate goes up"
"flat and full on off, Smith unwinds but finds midwicket with his badly-timed swat"
"and Chahal strikes. Kohli's move is vindicated. Lions in big, big trouble. A flat delivery on the pads, nothing much about it. But Smith struggles to get his bat through the line of the ball. It comes down at an angle and the ball takes the leading edge. Flies all the way to deep square leg. Six at the M Chinnaswamy, I'd say."
"nicely flighted on middle, blocked."
"flat and wide outside off, McCullum gives himself room and skews a cut towards point. They'll run one"
worked away to long-on by Raina to get running
"flat and quick from Chahal, nudged to deep midwicket. Another tidy over from RCB"
"there it is. Pace off the ball, a slower ball on off, pushed to cover for a run"
picked away for six. The first of the innings. A full straight delivery on a length. Raina just flicks it away. Uses the bottom hand to hit it up. Behind square for six. Sensational timing
"oh wow. What a shot that is. We've seen so many today. A full delivery outside off, Raina shimmies down and lofts the ball dead straight. Lifts the full face through the line of the ball. Superb ball-striking. Over long-off"
"better. Pace off the ball. Slower ball outside off, Raina backs away and slaps a cut towards cover for one"
excellently bowled. Sees Baz coming so follows him on a length. Dabbed to point
"sublime stroke. Back of a length on leg, Raina gives himself room, the bowler follows him but he whips the ball over midwicket. Didn't bother keeping it down"
"flat down leg, a wide. Pushed that through"
"that will be six more. Slower delivery outside off, McCullum stays low, gets underneath the ball and slaps a sweep over midwicket. Goes way back. Easy as long as he got underneath"
"quicker, fuller, wider outside off. A thick inside edge to fine leg. Deceived McCullum's swat this time"
"four more. Not a bad delivery, quick and straight, but Raina sweeps and does so really well. Past the square leg boundary for four. Runs leaking"
"flat on off, nice length. Worked to deep midwicket"
nicely played. Pushed towards cover for a quick run
"and the worst ball of the day accounts for Raina. Bad luck. Actually, that is pretty well bowled. He sees Raina coming so bowls a legbreak down leg. Once he's out of his crease, Raina has to play a stroke. He attempts a sweep but the ball goes straight to Watson at short fine leg. Raina's cameo ends. Gujarat just have to keep going."
"what a shot. Negi flight this outside off, so McCullum walks across, gets underneath the length and swings away over square leg. Another really good stroke."
"powerful. Does the bowler with the 1-2 trick. Negi thought McCullum was coming down because he feigned a forward movement. Negi drops short, McCullum stays back and powerfully pulls through midwicket. Fantastic batting, <strong>beaten in the mind</strong>"
"quick on leg, worked to short fine leg"
"fired in outside off, pushed towards cover"
"full and straight, McCullum backs away and slaps a drive back to the bowler. Mis-timed. Well picked up by Negi."
"good comeback from Negi. This one is slow but the length is excellent, a spinner's good length. McCullum pushes to point for a run"
"McCullum backs away, Chahal follows him. Pushed to long-off. Good result for Chahal"
"oh nicely bowled. Some flight, draws Finch forward, the ball turns away. Skewed to short third man"
"just over deep midwicket! Just over. Kohli applauds because that was good bowling. Slowed up on middle, the length isn't full. Finch backs away and slogs a skewed heave over the man"
"fullish on leg, this is full. Too full. Finch can't get underneath that. Mowed to deep midwicket"
"shortish and wide, again a result of thinking McCullum is coming down. Slapped towards extra cover where a fumble allows one."
"excellent legspin bowling. Tosses this up generously, knows there is sufficient spin so all he needs to do is ensure it isn't too full. Finch swings and misses because of some turn and that length."
"starts with a legcutter that doesn't cut. Flat down leg, McCullum misses a swat"
"if you can get it right. Another slower variation, but drifts down leg. Wide."
"140 kph, full and straight, towards off. Blocked to cover for a run. When in doubt, cross seam. Not sure if that was though"
"138 kph, leg side-ish delivery. Just struggling with line. Off the pad towards square leg"
"138 kph, good length on middle and leg. Mccullum backs away, gets forward and slaps a cut to cover"
"it's a slower delivery. 117 kph, thought that was the legcutter too. But it sits up on a good length and Finch swings away through backward square leg for four. Not quite timed"
"fullish delivery on middle and off, inside-edged into the pad"
"142 kph, fullish on the pads, clipped to deep square leg"
"good length delivery on middle, pulled away to deep square leg. Can't bowl that length. That length is perfect at the M Chinnaswamy with variable bounce, not here"
"good length on leg and middle, 126 kph. Another legcutter I think. Pushed to point"
"that's well bowled. Digs this in short, a proper bouncer outside off. Finch drags his pull to deep midwicket. Lucky he didn't time that too well"
"no, no. Bad ball. Full on off, right in the slot. McCullum clears his front leg and lofts the ball over long-off. With pulled in boundaries, even a miscued stroke is six"
"better. On a length and straight, carved to point"
"126 kph, another legcutter on off, pushed to long-on"
"beaten for pace. 145 kph, good call. Full on leg, Finch falls over as he misses a flick. Struck on the pad. Easy to give that with the stroke."
"a low full toss on off, picked his area. McCullum gives himself room and lofts the ball over mid-off. Good shot selection"
"that is a legcutter. 121 kph, a short legcutter outside off. McCullum slaps a forehand over cover and somehow gets enough power to clear cover. Sublime timing."
"good stuff from both parties. Sees Baz backing away, Milne follows him. Tapped towards midwicket. Milne gets around and under-arms towards the bowler's end"
"143 kph, full down leg, worked to midwicket. Finch yells 'noo'. Good loud call from Finch"
strays down leg for a leg-side wide
"lovely shot. Backs away, Milne is short and straight, on off. but Finch created room by backing away. He then scythes behind point from off stump. That's risk and reward in a steep chase. If he missed that, he was out. That's also the freedom of a tough chase."
"flat and straight, defended back towards midwicket. Nicely bowled"
"93 ks, sees Baz backing away. Negi bowls this down leg. Baz comes back in line and gets a wide"
"that's fifty for Baz. What? What an innings. Flat down leg, Negi follows him. McCullum hammers a flat pull that clears the boundary. Great timing, great skill"
"since he has the runs he needs in this over, there is no additional risk required. Pushed to short third man"
"superbly bowled. Finch is done in. Slow through the air on off and middle, Finch is drawn in by that full length. It dips late so Finch isn't close to the pitch as he looks to drive. The ball spins, beats the bat and settled in Jadhav's gloves who does the rest. A left-arm spinner's dream dismissal"
"flat outside off, pushed back to the bowler. Some turn"
"full and straight, carved away towards third man. Lovely pace from Negi."
"full and straight, defended"
"another offcutter on off, propped towards deep point. Baz knows he needs to be there till late"
nicely played. Chips down and drives over cover for a run to long-off. Karthik is in sensational touch
"ooh, beaten by the change down in pace. A slower ball on middle, beats McCullum on the inside edge. Hit in a rather unpleasant area. Needs a few seconds to calm down, let the pain ease away"
"backs away, Aravind follows him. Pushed to long-on"
"and gone! Big big big wicket. A few dot balls creates that kind of pressure. A cross seam delivery outside off, Karthik chooses timing over power, correctly. But doesn't time it well. Goes straight to Kohli at long-on. On short boundaries, if you can hit it hard and mis-time it, the ball can still clear the boundary. But Karthik rarely depends on muscle. Deserved wicket for Aravind"
"nice bowling. Slowed up outside off, the ball stops and rips and beats the bat"
"on the bounce. Flat and wide outside off, slapped to deep cover on the bounce"
"flat and quick outside off, chipped towards third man. Dot ball"
flat again. Wide. Carved to point. Pressure building
"great bowling this. Slowed up on middle, spins back in. Worked back to the bowler. Three dot balls in a row. Four in the over"
"sensational spell from Negi. Great finish. Flat and quick on off, pushed back to the bowler. Negi finishes with 4-0-21-1"
"mis-timed on the bounce. Full on middle and leg, chipped to long-off on the bounce"
"fullish on middle, clipped past midwicket. Jadeja wants two, Baz doesn't. Good fielding"
"pace off the ball. A slower ball on middle and leg, 120 kph. A wild swing results in an inside edge to fine leg"
"great timing. Good length delivery outside off, pace. Jadeja uses the pace. Carves it behind backward point for four. Nicely played"
"good length and straight, better. Pushed to long-on for a run."
"in the slot. Cannnnnot bowl there. Full on off, bowl anywhere else. McCullum clears his front leg and just lifts the ball over the bowler's head. Boom. Six to long-off."
"since it's the left-hander, it's the offcutter. Shortish delivery outside off, beaten on the outside edge"
"shot. Too short from Watson, a bouncer on off. Sits up for Jadeja to pull over midwicket for four. Nicely executed"
"good bowling. A slower ball on middle, worked to midwicket for one"
"on a length on off, swatted away over square leg. Isn't a terrible delivery but McCullum is in fine form."
"good length outside off, pulled away to long-on on the bounce. Just one."
"good end from Watson. Full on off, pushed to cover. Just a par over for Gujarat."
"shortish and wide outside off, slapped to point for a run."
"full and straight, pushed to long-on. Happy to give the leftie strike"
"the topspinner? Flat again, shortish outside off, hammered to deep cover. Just one more"
"huge wicket. Is that the match? Didn't mind tossing it up. Very slow through the air on leg and middle, McCullum gets under it but doesn't get enough power or timing behind it. Gets more elevation than distance. Milne takes a simple reverse-cupped catch at deep midwicket. End of a lovely innings from Baz. Chahal's control is impressive"
"flat and wide outside off, carved but straight to point. Another dot ball"
"slapped in the gap at cover for two more. Quite a good result for Lions. Superb spell from Chahal, hasn't conceded too many and has taken out Lions' top three."
"flat on off, pushed to long-on for a run"
"flat and wide, hit to long-off. He won't bowl anything full"
"pushed through outside off, a dab towards cover for one. Excellent bowling"
"short and wide, scythed to deep point for a couple. good stop at the boundary by Mandeep"
hit away to deep cover for one more. Superb over this from Head
"flat outside off, pulled to long-on for one. Just seven off it."
"slower delivery on middle, pulled into the pads. Another dot. This is getting out of reach"
"shortish on off, pulled wide of long-on for a couple more"
"mis-times his pull. Another cutter outside off, heaved to deep square leg for one."
"another slower delivery outside off, Jadeja is beaten as he misses a pull"
"shortish length outside off, pulled to long-on. Can't find any timing or power. This is sensational bowling, found the right length and pace"
"he's got that though. It is a good length but Kishan anticipates it. Stays back, gets the length he wanted and pulled over midwicket for six. Nice stroke"
"shortish on middle, scythed to deep point for a run"
"gets under that. Flat and straight, Kishan stays in the crease and sweeps over midwicket for six."
"flat and wide, pulled to long-on for one"
"a mix-up and Jadeja is run-out. Full and straight, pushed to long-on. Jadeja was on the back foot, Kishan was always coming back for the second. Jadeja puts his hand out but Kishan keeps coming. Jadeja was ball-watching. Negi picks up and does the basics well. Kishan made the crease at the bowler's end before jadeja came back"
"flat outside off, Tye misses a pull"
"<strong>dropped by Kohli</strong>. A catch he'll be disappointed he did not take. Flat and quick, heaved wide of long-on. Kohli runs to his right, sticks out his right hand but the ball pops out. Not an easy catch at all"
"<b>he's dropped another.</b> This is an easy catch. A slower ball outside off, Kishan swings. Kohli runs back from long-on, and spills his reverse-cupped catch. Was conscious of the boundary so close to him. But that should have been gobbled up."
a wide yorker. Just outside the tramline though. A wide called
"sliced through point. Full and wide outside off, Kishyan gets under it and carves the ball in front of point"
"gives himself room and misses a drive. Good idea, flawed execution."
"oh no. That's a low full toss, Kishan picks it up and swings merrily over midwicket. That's a massive blow. Much much needed. Poor ball"
"good delivery. A short, slow bouncer. It takes Kishan completely by surprise. He ducks underneath and then screams at himself after"
"he gets the boundary here. A slower ball on leg, right in the swinging arc. Kishan swings and gets plenty behind it. Way over deep square leg for six more."
"a wide yorker outside off, Tye misses a swing. Ooh, close. I'd have called that a wide"
"a legcutter outside off, heaved to long-on for a couple. Kohli was happy to give the second there"
"another legcutter on off, skewed to deep square leg for one"

"shortish delivery outside off, pulled to long-on for a run"
"youch! Smashes Thampi's helmet to finish. A searing bouncer from Milne. He goes straight up to Thampi to shake his hand. RCB resister a much-needed win, <b>beating the Lions by 21 runs</b>"
