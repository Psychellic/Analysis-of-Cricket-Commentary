loosener. Bad ball. Starts with a wayward leg-side delivery. Extras
and again. Drifts down leg for a wide. These are not marginal wides. Missed by a distance
"gets it right this time. Full and straight, off the outside edge to third man. Some wobbly movement"
"too straight, Tharanga closes the bat face to get a run towards square leg. Wanted two did Tharanga"
"nice and full, the ideal length with the new ball. Straight. Driven to mid-on"
"nice lines. Good length around off, defended up the pitch"
another terrible delivery. On the pads and Gunathilaka flicks the ball through square leg with nonchalant ease. Can't bowl there to no one
"the offcutter on off, dabbed away into the off side. No run. Not a great over from Mortaza"
"full and wide outside off, quite wide outside off. Left alone, too wide."
"oh yeah, pushed that full outside off. Tharanga just leant forward and caressed this gentle outswinger through point. Sublime timing"
"again. Full outside off, looking for some swing. Not much there, but enough. Driven to cover from the crease"
nice lines. Has brought this closer to off. Full on the fourth-stump line. Not much movement again. Defended to cover
"drifts down leg. A muted appeal. Tharanga misses his flick. Looked like it was off the thigh pad. No wide, no review"
oh my. Tharanga has been in really good touch since the start of the second ODI. Goes full again does Mustafizur. Tharanga shuffles his feet out of the way and drills a drive through cover. Delectable
"good length delivery around off, tapped to cover. Gunathilaka looking for one, but it isn't there"
"<strong>dropped. The parry almost carries to mid-on too</strong>. Fullish delivery outside off, Gunathilaka hammers a drive straight back at Mortaza, who gets his left hand out. The ball bursts out and almost carries to the fielder"
"better. Dragged that length back. On a length around off, worked towards square leg"
"good length delivery around off, played towards extra cover. This is a better length from Mortaza"
"bad ball. On the pads, Tharanga swivels into a flick, but the ball bobbles up to fine leg off the thigh pad"
"good single. On a length outside off, Gunathilaka opens the face and dabs one towards third man. Backward point runs after it, fumbles and forces third man to clean up. Sloppy"
"full and straight, flicked away through midwicket for some runs. Three of them"
"full outside off, in a channel. Tharanga opened up. Beaten on the outside edge"
"fullish delivery outside off, dabbed away towards point"
"on a length on middle, worked away towards square leg"
"<strong>big big appeal!</strong>  No, says the umpire. Tharanga missed his flick and was struck flush in front of leg. The angle was too much? Bangladesh think about, but decide not to review."
"back of a length delivery outside off, Tharanga leans back and looks to cut the ball, but it's too close for that type of stroke. Beaten"
"a slower offcutter on off, nudged to square leg. Easily done"
"too straight again, clipped away towards backward square leg. Tharanga wants two again, Gunathilaka doesn't"
"a slower offcutter. Heard something there. Good length delivery outside off, Gunathilaka fishes and edges that. Did the ball bounce in front of Mushfiqur?"
guided away towards point
played down quietly towards gully. Mushfiqur has to get across to field the ball
"he's connected with that. Oh yes, he has. Short of a length on off, sits up for Tharanga who stays back and lays into a pull that goes deep over mid-on. That just kept going."
a nice dab to third man. Opened the bat face late to get one down to the fielder
bad delivery. Loses his line and length. Back of a length and very wide outside off. Left alone
"four more. Picks the length so early. Back of a length outside off, sits up for Tharanga. Pulled away through midwicket. Playing in front of square is<strong> indicative of a slow surface, so can't drop short</strong>"
"great batting. Tharanga is in some form. Full delivery outside off, he stays in his crease, sees the full length and lifts the ball over mid-off for four. Fantastic timing."
"good comeback. A slower offcutter on off, played quietly to midwicket"
"four more. That is his bread and butter. Shortish delivery outside off, Tharanga arches his back and guides a cut over backward point. That's exceptional timing, but didn't have to play that in the air"
"fullish delivery outside off, guided away to backward point"
"oh yeah. Slow on off, the ball pitches full, draws Gunathilka forward and then it <b>rips past the outside edge</b>. Yum."
defended away into the off side nicely
"full and straight again, around off. Defended"
"this one was flatter and quicker on middle, pushed to midwicket. Used the angle from the crease well"
nice length. Around off with some offspin. Blocked
"gets under that and away it goes! Lots of flight on that, Gunathilaka picked up length quickly, got low and whacked that easily over midwicket. Fantastic timing."
"five more for SL. Pitches that on a length down leg side. Tharanga misses a nudge, the ball deviates off the pitch and Mushy can't get across. Five extras"
"<strong>beauty</strong>. Full on off, Tharanga plays for some inswing, but the ball deviates away sharply to beat the bat. Jaffa"
"almost five more. Full delivery on the pads, clips Tharanga's pad. Rahim gets across but almost ricochets the ball into the helmet behind the keeper. Just wide"
"drifts down leg again. Yikes, Bangladesh's lines have been awful this morning"
"looking for a mow over midwicket. Full delivery on off, Gunathilaka opens his stance and looks to hit that over mid-on, but inside-edges the ball into his pad"
nicely chipped through midwicket for a couple more. Another ill-directed delivery
"good length delivery outside off, dabbed to gully who leaps up and saves one. He attempts a throw at the batsman's end and concedes an overthrow. Not the worst run to give away"
"big inside edge into the pad. Full on off, Tharanga whacks the ball into his pad"
"strays down leg for a guess, what ... wide"
"better. Full and straight around off, played down to point. Some hesitation but all's fine"
"flat outside off, pushed to cover from the back foot"
"nice and full, blocked"
"gets it over mid-on and will get four more. Tosses this up generously on middle and leg, Gunathilaka gets underneath the length and lofts the ball over mid-on. Four more"
"brilliant batting. Sees square leg is up so he gets down and sweeps the ball over square leg for another boundary. Just clever, astute batting"
and a neat nudge through midwicket for a run. Fantastic stuff
"leg side delivery to start, worked through square leg"
"nice delivery. Flat on off, off the outside edge towards third man"
"flat and straight on leg, clipped to midwicket, another run"
"flat on the pad, around leg. Tharanga misses a flick."
worked away to square leg
"too straight again, a simple nudge through midwicket for one"
"lots of flight on off, pushed back to the bowler"
hit back to the bowler again. Still plenty of flight
"drifts on with the arm. Flat on off, slapped to cover. That's a good delivery"
"short and wide, that was an offering. Hit to cover again, badly timed"
"and gone! Gunathilaka chips his wicket away. He was looking so good. So so good. Plenty of flight outside off, dips late on Gunathilaka, and he can't keep his drive down. Maybe undone by the slowness in the surface. A simple catch for Mahmudullah. Good stuff from Mehedi, kept bowling it full."
"full outside off, defended"
"what's happened there? Good length delivery on off, pushed to cover. But there is an overthrow. Cover runs in, under-arms the ball past the non-striker for one. Rubbish. Why?"
"another leg side delivery on leg, played down to fine leg for a run"
"the short delivery on off, Tharanga gets underneath the length and lets that one go harmlessly by"

"flat delivery outside off, Mendis toe-ends a sweep into his body"
"good length delivery on off, guided to third man for a run"
"full delivery on a fifth-stump line, coming back in. Blocked"
"squares Kusal up. Fullish on off, the ball takes the outside half and carries to deep cover"
"a short loopy bouncer on leg, way over the head, a wide called"
"goes straight through! Tharanga falls. Fullish delivery around leg, Tharanga is beaten for pace as he plays around the delivery. The ball sneaks through bat and pad and hits middle stump. Another good delivery by Taskin, nice upright seam."
"floats it full outside off, watched through to the keeper"
"angles a length ball on middle, patted back"
"grip and turn. It was short, he shaped to cut but the ball stopped on him and he chopped one to the off side"
gets half-forward and blocks
goes back into the crease and nudges one to square leg for a quick single
pushes outside the line of a delivery that straightens and takes a thick inside edge onto the pad
check-pushes a tossed-up delivery outside off to cover
"tossed up on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
"bounce for Taskin from length on middle, Mendis is hit high on the bat as he defends to the leg side. Bending his back and bowling with a lot of zip is Taskin"
"beaten on the drive. Nips away late, he tried to play on the up. Lovely from Taskin."
"touch short, punched to point"
gets on top of the bounce and steers the short ball to point again. Lucky to get away with that this time

steps out and drives inside-out to wide long-off
"drifting into middle and leg, nudged behind square on the leg side as he jogs the single"
"chips down the wicket and works it wide of mid-on. Sensible batting this, risk-free so far"
"draws him forward with the flight, defended"
"flatter and angling in from wide of the crease, turned to short fine."
"this is a delightful extra cover drive. Taskin errs in length, this is a half-volley and the bat came down on it beautifully. What flow, what timing. That should break the shackles. Mashrafe, who is struggling with his knee, had no chance there at the edge of the ring"
"this time he floats one on the pads. Another half-volley and Chandimal will pick those for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Flicked into the gap between midwicket and square leg. Raced away to the fence."
"much better, shortens his length, gets it to nip away from middle, defended"
"poor. Wonder if Taskin is tiring. This is too full and snaking down leg, keeper can't collect it on the bounce, deflects it to fine leg"
gets an inside edge onto the thigh pas as he looks to whip it square leg
leaves the right-hander late to shave past the outside edge. Squared him up completely
punched to backward point. Excellent over for Sri Lanka
"steps out, dabs to cover and sets off for a run that may have not been on. A direct hit at striker's end from Mehedi and Mendis would've been walking back."
brings out the slog sweep and he's hit that firmly into the acres of open space at deep midwicket
"short, he rocks back and pulls him into the gap at midwicket. Picked the length early and hit it hard. Intent from Mendis"

"rocks back and cuts, but straight to cover"

"that is a delightful square drive, but straight to the boundary rider"
sliced down to third man. Wanted to drive on the up again
slapped but an excellent stop by Mehedi at cover

steps out and drives it with the spin to long-off
lunges forward and defends
gets outside the line of the stumps and turns the incoming delivery to short fine

"slower and fuller on middle, bunted to point"
"on the pads, worked to fine leg"
"in the slot to drive, does so but straight to Tamim at mid-off"

gets a good stride forward and blocks
"dabs gently to the off side, they were off for a single even before the bowler could take a couple of steps on his followthrough"
cut away to deep point
brings the broom out to play the sweep. Down to deep square where the fielder hurls a throw to the bowler's end. It was a very slow one. Chandimal ran across and wasn't running in a straight line but just about manages to get back in before Shakib removes the bails.
"fired full on off stump, worked wide of midwicket"
bunts it with the spin to point
"the bat was plonked inside but he lifted it even as both feet were in the air when the bails were dislodged. Excellent throw from deep point by Taskin, smart work from Mushfiqur. Very poor from Chandimal. Could have so easily just stretched back in. He was ambling down the crease this time. Bangladesh can't believe their luck. Third umpire S Ravi had a look at multiple replays, weighed his options and made the correct decision. Even though he was technically inside the crease, at the point of the bails coming off, both bat and feet were in the air. Rules state that is out."

"flat on middle, shovelled to deep square leg. Another productive over for SL."
"too full outside off, driven to long-off with the spin."
"tripe from Mehedi. Drops short on middle, Mendis pulls him to long-on. Can't pick the gap"
"is that another run-out? Hesitation between the two batsmen. Yup, he's short. Second run-out of the innings. He is actually run out this time. Flat delivery outside off, tapped towards point. Siriwardana sets off, Mendis says yes and no. Siriwardana can't turn quick enough. Sold him down did Mendis. The throw is decent. Mushfiqur takes the throw in front of the stumps and removes the bails in one motion, even while withdrawing his hands to create time with momentum. Lovely work from Bangladesh there. The point fielder didn't muck up."
"flat on middle, Gunaratne shuffles across and works the ball to midwicket"
pushed back to the bowler
"should have been stopped. Flat outside off, driven back. Mehedi gets across but lets the ball go through his hands"
"tossed up on off, Gunaratne runs down and drives to long-off"
"fantastic stuff all-round, except for the ball. A short offering on off, Mendis gets low and nails his sweep to deep square leg. The fielder gets across to his right and saves two with a dive. Well-drilled fielding unit"

nudged to midwicket
"good single. Driven to mid-on, called immediately and made the run easily. No hesitation"
"got low and paddles a sweep down to fine leg. Taskin gets across but lets the ball go through. Has he done some damage to his left groin? Seems in distress, he gets off the field. Could have pulled something."
driven to long-on. Too full
flicked to deep midwicket with a strong bottom hand
"too full again. An easy run to long-on, hit with the spin"

"good length delivery outside off, carved down to third man off the open face. Easy."
"a yorker outside off, sliced to backward point"

"walks right across, forces Taskin straight. Clipped off the exposed stumps to fine leg for a run"
worked to square leg for <strong>fifty.</strong> Fantastic effort again from Kusal
"sloppy. Good length delivery, short-arm jabbed to midwicket, who misfields and allows a run"

"slower ball, straight, pushed to midwicket who parries the ball away. No damage, but looks sloppy"

"good length offcutter outside off, rips past the outside edge."
"on a length on leg, worked towards fine leg for a run"
played nicely to deep cover again. One more. Keeping 'em ticking
"tries to dab the ball down to third man again, but fails to make any connection with the ball"
clipped to midwicket
"gone this time. Mustafizur strikes. It was going to be the last ball of his spell, but Mendis still sticks to an attempted dab to third man. It's another offcutter, but this one snicks the bat on its way to the keeper. Was a quality fifty from Mendis, but has got out at an inopportune moment. Good discipline from Mustafizur"
pushed down to long-on. Too full again from Mehedi.
Thisara gets right forward to defend this
"slightly shorter outside off, Thisara flicks to midwicket from the crease"
"good early call, and a hand signal. Flat outside off, pushed to cover. Thisara takes a step or two forward, but sends Asela back"

"nice length, good line - around off. Thisara gets forward and defends the full delivery. Tidy again"

"full on the pads, bunted to square leg for a run"
shovelled with a strong bottom hand to long-on. Forced that short because of the length

driven back to the bowler. Really getting through these overs now
"on the pads, flat. Worked to square leg. Three successive tidy overs from Bangladesh"
"flat and full outside off, a sliced drive finds the sweeper cover"
"is that off the boot? Or did that bounce? A flat delivery on middle, hurried onto the batsman. Thisara pulls and into the boot, but is there ground. Mushfiqur runs around to take the catch. Soft signal is <b>not out</b>. Looks like it's hit the ground. Oh yeah, most definitely into the ground."
""
worked to square leg from the back foot. Almost dragged that from outside off
neatly played towards square leg. Mustafizur was quick on the ball to save the second
"a yorker on off, pushed back. Just four from it. These overs are ticking along. Good stuff from Bangladesh"
"flat delivery outside off, slapped to deep cover"
"flat and full, pushed back. Another dot"
"well played. Shortish outside off, his first instinct was leg side, with the spin. But it was wide, so he rocked back and cut to deep point"
gets forward and defends
driven to long-off with the spin
"a flat delivery outside off, driven to long-off. 10-1-49-1, decent stuff from the offspinner"

flicked to midwicket. That's six successive tidy overs. SL stumbling here.
"good length delivery outside off, Gunaratne misses his cross-batted swat. Wrong shot choice. Had to drag that from far too wide"
"and he now looks to hit this through the off side. Good length around off, mis-timed towards midwicket"
"and gone. So much pressure over the last few overs and Gunaratne throws his wicket away. Gets down towards the pitch and mis-times a slog into the hands of mid-on. Just a full delivery, but he lost all his shape while trying to hit that away."
a loopy bouncer that is way over the head. Wide.
"<strong>how has he missed?</strong> He had one stump to aim at from a foot. Good length delivery on middle, pushed to midwicket. No run there. Prasanna's full-length dive wouldn't have saved him. Could have ran to the stumps. Didn't know he had that much time."
"worked away towards backward square leg for a couple. Was there two there? Probably not. Perera puts in a dive and takes plenty of dust with him, but was saved by the throw, which wasn't very good"
"full delivery on the pads, worked down to fine leg for one"
"what a shot that is. Overpitched on off, Thisara keeps his shape and lifts the ball over the bowler. Whistles away for four."
"on the pads and that will go for four more. A low full toss on middle, Thisara flicks his wrists and the ball to get it past short fine leg, to his right, and to the boundary."
"just wide of Mustafizur in his follow-through. On a length on off, a leading edge is just out of reach of the bowler."
a ripping offbreak outside off. Beats the bat.
"and another wicket falls. Mustafizur strikes. That's good captaincy again. Another offcutter outside off, Prasanna gives it all he has. The ball skews off the outside half because of the direction of cut. Lobs in the air, and Mahmudullah takes a good reverse-cupped catch at long-off. SL continue their slide."
short and wide from Mustafiz. Slapped to deep cover for a run
"that's fantastic batting. He knew his area, and picked it. Nice execution too. An offcutter on the pads, flicked away in the air and it bounces just in front of the deep square leg boundary. The fielder was in the circle."
"overpitched outside off, driven to cover. Dot."
"another slower delivery outside off, hammered down to long-off for one. Power. Didn't quite get underneath that"
"nicely played. Back of a length outside off, slashed to deep cover from the crease"
"<strong>stumps saves three. </strong>A low full toss on middle. Thisara smashes the ball with let's just say, power. Hammers the stumps and ricochets to long-off"
"that's four more. On a length outside off, Dilruwan gets underneath, sees mid-off is in and hits the ball over the fielder. Exquisite, thinking cricket"
"carved over point. A slower ball outside off, Thisara squeezes a drive. Wanted to go straight"
"excellent yorker. Jammed away wide of long-on because of that bottom hand again. Two more. A not-so-strong bottom hand would have hit that straighter, more towards long-on"
"that's six. In the arc, and that's outta here. Didn't hit that anywhere near where he would have liked. But so much power behind that stroke that it clears long-on easily."
"shortish delivery on middle, pulled powerfully to deep midwicket for one"
"a slower delivery gone wrong. 64 mph, down the leg side for a wide"
"good stop by Mushfiqur. A full toss outside off, looking for the yorker. Off the outside edge, but Rahim sticks out a hand and saves four"
"good change in pace. Slower ball outside off, off the outside half, sliced over point for a couple more. Third man gets around to save a couple"
"full and wide outside off, drilled to the sweeper cover for a run"
"shot! Good stop too. Slower delivery outside off, powered to cover from the crease. Tamim saves three, gets a good hand on it"
"on the bounce to the fielder. A slow, full delivery on off. Hammered to the fielder on the boundary"
"bad timing again, but that's just one more. Full and straight again from Mortaza, not very good bowling. On the bounce to long-on"
"oh yikes. Mahmudullah messes up at the long-off boundary. Full and wide, Thisara nails his drive and hits it with so much power. That actually spun away late. Mahmudullah over-ran it."
"a wide yorker outside off, jammed to long-off. Good delivery to probably end Mortaza's bowling for the innings"
"well bowled. A quick cutter on off, pushed to long-on for a run"
"<strong>out with a direct hit. </strong>But Mosaddek misses. Good length outside off, pushed to cover and Dilruwan sets off."
a low full toss outside off. Thisara gets underneath the delivery and chips the ball over cover for a couple to <strong>get to fifty</strong>. Fantastic effort
another good yorker. Not much Thisara can do but push to long-off
"full and wide outside off, a yorker. Dilruwan fails to make contact"
"good length delivery on off, swatted to midwicket for one. Good comeback from Mustafizur, 10-0-55-2"
"a wild heave. Full and straight from Mortaza, Dilruwan loses all his shape but gets some bat on that. Clears short third man for four. Pathetic bowling."
"juggled but taken. Full delivery on off, Dilruwan goes after it but can only mis-time a slog into the hands of Tamim at cover. Juggled, but taken at second attempt. To be honest, that isn't great bowling either. Right in the hitting arc, a better batsman would have done more"
"full delivery outside off, hammered down to long-off for one. Kulasekara should have been more aware and looked to come back for two"
good stuff from Kulasekara. Just bat on ball to get one and get Thisara back on strike.
"and taken by short fine leg. Not sure he needed to do that, especially with his power. It's a good full delivery way outside off, Thisara gets right across and scoops the ball to short fine leg. End of a superb innings through."
"full, and wide yorker outside off. Just outside the tramline says the umpire. Hmm. Right on the line"
"pulled away to deep midwicket. A slow bouncer on middle, pulled to deep midwicket on the bounce. Lakmal hurries back for the second, does excellently well to make it with a dive."
"nips away off the seam from length outside off, left alone"
plays inside the line and lets go the away-swinger again
gets half-forward and bunts a length delivery to the off side
"<b> Opportunity missed. How costly will that be? </b> Slashes, this wasn't there for the cut. Got a thick edge that flew between keeper and first slip. Both of them were looking at each other. Chandimal, with the gloves, should've gone for it. Mind you, it wasn't far from him."
"thumps a short delivery on the up, excellent stop by Siriwardena at point"
"leading edge back to Kulasekara. Dolly of a catch, really. Timed his jumped well and took the catch but lost the grip when he was trying to throw the ball up in delight. Grabbed it, swung it around and lost it while in the motion of throwing it up. Fair call in the end, Tamim shakes his head but has to walk off."
"too full, plenty of width as well and he drives it to Seekkuge at cover point"
gets back into the crease and dabs the length ball to the off side
"touch full on off stump, defended with a straight bat"
solid front foot defense to an away-going delivery

"full and swerving away late from leg stump, squeezed back down the pitch"
whipped off his hip to deep fine leg
"gets one to jag back in sharply from outside off, Sabbir firm in defence"
gets half-forward and steers one to point
"that really is a horror shot from Sabbir and he's paid the price. This had the width alright, he threw his hands at it with the feet going nowhere. All he managed was a thick edge that was pouched safely by Dinesh Chandimal, who moved swiftly to his right. Sri Lankans don't hold back in celebrating the wicket. The man with whom they've had a few tiffs in the series is gone."
gets forward and defends the incoming delivery from wide of the crease
"crisp drive, well stopped by a diving Tharanga at mid-off."
"hit on the back pad by a delivery that nips back in to beat the inside edge. The only bone of contention was the height. At the point of impact, the ball didn't have much distance to travel. He was given out on the field, so the decision could have been overturned only if the ball would have completely missed the stumps. On this occasion, ball tracking indicates the ball would have clipped top of middle and so the <b> umpire's call will stay. </b> Sri Lanka are all over Bangladesh like a bad rash. The pacers are turning it on here at the SSC."
steers one down to third man to get off the mark
"hint of width outside off, bunted behind point"
pushes outside the line and gets a thick inside edge to square leg. Bat face turned in his hand as the ball thudded into it

defended gently to short mid-off and they scamper across for a quick single
"covers the line, plants forward and blocks"
"nips away off the seam from middle, defended back with a straight bat"
once again gets forward to negate the swing and defend
"full and swinging away from middle, pushed to mid-off"

chops one down to third man
"slash and a miss. This one skids across, Shakib clearly late on the shot"
gets forward and meets the ball with the bat well in front of the pad
squared up by a superb away-swinger. Shakib nervously pokes at a delivery that nipped away late after pitching
"this time he's solidly behind the line of that length ball on middle, defended to the leg side"
"pulled imperiously into the square leg boundary. Picked the length, rolled his wrists over the ball to keep it all along the ground"
"chips down the track to flick, the leading edge lobs between mid-on and mid-off. Risky business."
chops an away-going delivery to point
gets half-forward and dabs it away to the off side
"on middle and leg, worked wide of midwicket"
"through him. Not sure how that missed the stumps. Played outside the line, ball sneaked back in through the gap between bat and pad. Bounced over the stumps"
"squared up by the length, awkwardly defended off the back foot to point where Gunathilaka slides to his right to stop"
"play and a miss. Slower delivery this time, touch fuller outside off, Soumya felt for the ball but done in by the late deviation"
eased behind point for an easy single
gets forward and defends an away-going length ball back down the pitch
"this time, Shakib cracks it into the gap between gully and point. Enough width for him to free his arms and smash that to the boundary"
direct hit at the bowler's end from mid-on but Shakib is in. Hit it straight to the fielder and took off for the run. Did well to do a full-stretch and then ground his bat in nicely
"pulled into the midwicket boundary. Too short at 124 clicks, he got back into the crease and muscled it"
thumped firmly to mid-off
"just a hint of width and he's smeared that into the cover point boundary. Here he was batting outside the crease to negate the swing. Saw this dropped short, had the width and boom!"
"angles a length ball back in from around the stumps, tucked to midwicket"
bunts a short of length delivery to backward point
"flayed uppishly, but just manages to elude cover. Played a touch early and toe-ended it"
"fired down leg, he sweeps and misses. Appeal from Chandimal, surely to just put off the umpire"
"drifting into the pads, he gets to the pitch and flick it wide of midwicket. Delightful timing, superb balance. Touch of Saeed Anwar in that stroke. Wow"
"delicate little late cut past Thisara at short third man. Nearly ran all the way before he put his hand out to pull it back in. Poor running though, should have come back for the third there. Shakib was jogging the second"
"squared up by turn but it is very slow, enough time for the batsman to adjust and defend"
thumped into the midwicket region. Once again too much flight
steps out and hammers this over wide long-on. Didn't get to the pitch but went through and picked the bones out of that
"slider gone horribly wrong. Drifts down leg, keeper can't get across in time."
looks to cut but can't get enough bat on it as he's cramped for room. Bunted to the off side. Biggest over the match so far
"thick inside edge into the fine leg boundary. On another day, that would have crashed into the leg stump. Shakib looked to flay that away with a horizontal bat. Half-hearted push really, lucky to get away"

"slow outside off, Shakib opens the bat face and works the ball to deep cover"
"slow on middle and leg, an inside edge towards square leg for one. Clever stuff from these two"
"nicely played. Superb shot. Just a tad short from Gunaratne, Shakib rocks back and nails a cut through point. Fantastic execution"
driven up to long-off with ease. Great batting by Shakib.
another gentle push up to long-off. Very tidy stuff from Bangladesh
"superb delivery from Dilruwan. Completely does Soumya in. Drift, and dip. Flat delivery outside off, the ball pitches and rips past the outside edge. Soumya's feet are nowhere, his momentum takes him forward and it's an easy stumping for Chandimal. Fantastic bowling. Almost a no-ball, but he has a smidgen behind."
worked away to long-on with ease
a top-edged sweep but lands safely to deep backward square leg
"ooh, ripping turn. Flat delivery outside off, rips back in and hits Mosaddek on the glove"

gives himself room and nails a cut to deep point
"shortish and wide, guided to backward point who dives and saves one"
"slow on off, nudged towards square leg for a run"
"and goes straight through Mosaddek. That's a really poor stroke. A flat delivery on middle, Mosaddek mistakes a short length for a bad delivery. And exposes his stumps in a bid to cut. The ball skids on with a bit of turn and beats his extravagant cut to hit the stumps. That's an awful stroke. No room to cut. Put pressure on himself by playing too many dot balls."
drifts down leg for a couple of extras
driven up nicely to long-on for a run
lovely stroke from Mahmudullah. Strides forward and nails a lovely cover drive through cover. Superb timing too
"worked away, just short of midwicket"
"shortish and wide outside off, guided away to third man"
a nice drive finds cover.
"flat and wide outside off, Shakib nails a drive towards cover. Gunathilaka dives to his left to save runs"
"and Shakib goes! With that, it seems Bangladesh's hopes are gone too. His back was clearly troubling him, but he took the easy way out. Didn't try and soldier through a tough period. Not very good from the experienced man. Full delivery on off, Shakib stays in his crease and nails a drive straight to Gunathilaka who takes the catch on a second attempt."
a sweet drive finds cover. Tharanga saves some runs by sticking out his left hand
hit back to the bowler

"shortish on off, pulled to deep square leg for a couple"
nicely pushed to long-off by Mahmudullah
"excellent delivery. Flat, some drift on off. Played well too. Pushed back"
"driven towards cover. A big appeal from Chandimal, thinking it was pad before pad. Not out is the on-field call. <strong>But Sri Lanka review</strong>. There is no pad at all. The ball hits just bat. The pad was quite a distance away from the ball"
nicely hit up to the sweeper cover
"flat on middle, defended"
worked away to square leg
"good length delivery on middle, shovelled to square leg. Got his bat down just in time"
strays down leg for a wide
a short delivery that goes waaaay down leg for a wide
"nice stroke. Full delivery around off, Mehedi nails a lovely drive to mid-off. Full face of the bat"
"good short ball. Pretty well played too. Bouncer on leg, rides the bounce and fends off towards fine leg"
"and gone. Mahmudullah perishes to a loose stroke. Bouncer down leg, Mahmudullah is through his pull too early and the ball kisses the glove on its way to the keeper. A golden chance for Mahmudullah to press his claim for a higher spot, but he's given it away. Bangladesh sink further"
"full and straight, defended towards mid-on"
"another excellent delivery. Spearing in the yorker on off, somehow Mortaza manages an inside-edge down to fine leg"
"full and straight around leg, blocked"
"plenty of flight outside off, driven away to deep cover"

"top-edges a pull into the fine leg boundary. Was late on the stroke, got away this time"
"right into the blockhole on middle, somehow manages to squeeze it out"
"looks for a yorker, slips in a high full toss that is bunted to mid-off for a risky single. Mashrafe looked like he was struggling with his wonky knees but may have just made it in time."
"legspinner this time, touch too full. Mehedi fe jabs it back down the pitch. Mashrafe was outside the crease, so all it needed was a touch from Kulasekara on the way to the stumps. Didn't get close to the ball this time"
eased past the bowler to mid-on
makes a bit of room and crunches a short ball to deep cover

flat hit to long-off. Got to the pitch and looked to loft it over the fielder there
"looked to paddle it behind, but played too early and missed. Hit high on the thigh pad"

"rocks back and cuts, this time straight to short third man"
"lured by the flight, looked to launch him over the ground but ended up hitting it flat to the bowler who took it right in front of his face on the followthrough. Had he missed, the ball would have hit him on the face. Wonder if he has dental insurance. Brings out the 'dab' celebration too. The resistance has ended."
stretches forward and deadbats the full delivery
squeezes a full delivery to cover
worked with the spin to midwicket

turns it with the spin to square leg

flicks and misses. The ball spun back in to miss leg stump
"too full on the pads, flicked to deep midwicket"
gets the bat well in front of the pad and blocks
eased with the spin to long-off

flicked straight to midwicket

driven with the spin to cover
pushed back to the bowler who moves swiftly to his left to stop on his followthrough
stabbed away to cover. The game's just meandering to a close. Bangladesh are just trying to bat out the overs perhaps
whipped with the spin to deep midwicket
"grip and turn, squared up as he defends from deep inside the crease"
"driven firmly to sweeper cover, the fielder there late to move to his left. Lakmal with a wayward throw too"

"low full toss, driven down to long-on"
"fired full and flat outside off, pushed to cover"
"fired full and flat on middle from around the stumps, worked with the spin to long-on"

"quicker through the air, lands it on middle, whipped to midwicket"
"turned to short fine leg, wants the single but Taskin refuses"
wrists one to deep square
"hit back straight to Lakmal who fires a throw at the striker's end. Didn't look like the batsman was expecting it, and so he reacted late and plonked his bat in. Just got it back in time"
"makes room to go over the top, ends up hitting it straight to cover"
banged in short on middle but it was way over the batsman's head. Lakmal is not happy with the decision but it's the right decision
"dug in short, he looks to swivel around to hook that over fine leg but the ball got a little too big on him, flew to the keeper"
"too full, he backs away and drills that full delivery into the cover boundary. The umpire signalled two bouncers for the over, which meant Lakmal couldn't bowl a bouncer. So he anticipated a full delivery and made room before making sweet contact. Very good from Mehedi"
"slower and fuller outside off, slices it to short third man"
"full and tailing into middle, eased down the ground to long-on"
steps out and blocks a quicker delivery back to the bowler

slower delivery that grips the surface and takes a thick inside edge on the way to fine leg. He pushed outside the line
"looks to take him on with the pull, gets a top edge that flies over the keeper's head. Easy runs, handy runs"
punched down to long-on as they jog the single
"how's that for placement? There's point and short third man. But he manufactures some width by moving to the leg side, then unfurls his wrists to pick that gap between the two fielders. Solid timing too"
tickled to short fine leg.
"too full on the pads, flicked to deep midwicket to bring up his <b> maiden ODI fifty </b>"
chips one towards the man coming in from long-on. Looked to flick that over midwicket but looked like it came off the back of the bat
"looks to muscle this over long-on but the ball took ages to get to him and by then, he was nearly through with the stroke, down to long-on"
squeezes a full delivery to cover
"slower delivery outside off, Mehedi takes it on the full but toe-ends it to the man at the edge of the ring at cover. Gutsy knock"
driven firmly to point as they scamper a single
"this is a length ball on middle which Taskin looks to mow over wide long-on but ends up getting it on the top half of his bat, which  means there's more elevation than distance. The  man coming in from the boundary had enough time to stop, settle underneath, then again run forward to complete the catch on the move. <b> Sri Lanka's first win in eight ODIs. Series ends 1-1 </b>"
