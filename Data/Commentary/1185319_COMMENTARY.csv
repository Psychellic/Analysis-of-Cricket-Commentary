"full and swinging, 143kph/89mph, <b>did that hit him on the boot??</b> Nigel Llong immediately turned away from the appeal, but Finch <b>reviews</b>, and this could be a sensational start for Australia! Definitely hit the bat, but it looks as if it crashed into the toe first - and this is stone dead, if so. Yes, boot first, that's plumb, <b>golden duck for Malan on debut!</b> Smashing the base of middle stump, Starc rips one out with his first ball! Boo-yah!"

"fullish, 137kph/85mph and clipped neatly off the pads, they'll pick up a couple through"
"pitched up in the channel, invites the drive and Bavuma accepts, <b>drilling four through the covers!</b> Decent chase from the fielder but he couldn't quite time his dive to reel it in"
"shaping away this time, not there for the drive and Bavuma leaves it be"
"touch full, 134kph/83mph and <b>skelped through extra cover once more!</b> Not a half-volley, by any means, and some swing, too, but it shaped right into the meat of Temba's bat as he stepped out to drive"
"shortish, 139kph/87mph and guided down towards third man"
"shortish, angled across from over the wicket, left alone"
"back of a length outside off, de Kock is across and taps the ball down square"

"short of a length, 143kph/89mph outside off and stabbed behind square, straight to Smith"

"oh Quinny... <b>dabbles one to the keeper,</b> South Africa's captain is gone! A respectable length ball in the channel, nothing more, but de Kock falls trying to open the face and run one behind square. Audible nick, straightforward take for Carey, Hazlewood does the business"

"dug in again, 141kph/88mph but too much bounce this time, Bavuma ignores and SA get one more to the total"
"pitched up at <b>146kph/91mph</b>, Bavuma is timing the ball like a Swiss watchmaker today, strokes three more through the covers to finish a somewhat expensive over"
"shortish around off stump, Temba defends"
"<b>dropped!</b> Shanked over the on side, should be a simple take for Starc running back at mid-on, <b>but he shells it!</b> Coming over his shoulder but he was in position, got both hands to it, only to bar-of-soap it and give Temba a life!"
on the stumps and nudged to the on side
"shortish outside off and squirted behind square, not cleanly stopped and they steal one"
"back of a length, Vereynne pulls, <del>feather to the keeper</del> gets one off the pocket! Brilliant spot from Nigel Llong, and Hazlewood knew something was fishy even as he celebrated. No review, and rightly so"
short and leg side
"back of a length outside off, Verreynne taps the ball down"
"<b>dragged on!</b> Cummins strikes and this is already looking sticky for South Africa... Bavuma had been playing nicely but he's misjudged the bounce, maybe too close for the cut shot, too, and he cannons a thick bottom edge into his timbers. Off stump flat on its back, SA wobbling!"

"over the wicket, floated up and worked for one"
"on the stumps, Verreynne stays in the crease and clips with the spin"
"flighted, skidding into the pads as Klaasen sweeps... Short liked it, but I thought it pitched outside leg. Finch, after some discussion, elects to <b>review</b>. Was that a googly? No, apparently the legbreak, and Hawk-Eye has it pitching <i>just</i> outside - umpire's call - and then spinning sharply past the wicket. So not a good review"

"no foot movement, flashes at it outside off stump, and <strong>feathers an edge behind! </strong>Finch departs early, throwing his hands at a back-of-a-length ball in the channel. Bit of extra bounce perhaps, struck the top edge as he look to flay a cross-batted shot through cover point, and the gleeful de Kock takes the catch!"
"cutter outside off, Smith shuffles across and works into midwicket via the inside half of the bat"
"outswinger on a length, <strong>thick edge</strong> from Warner looking to steer through point and it flies away for four! The man from slip had moved into the covers, and it races away to the fence"
"slightly full of a length, <strong>struck on the pad</strong>. Ngidi goes up convincingly, but it's definitely pitched outside the leg stump, and they decide against the review"

"length ball on fifth stump, Smith gets across to defend"
"half-volley outside off, squirted out to deep backward point with an open face"
"but Nortje's back-of-a-length ball is too straight, and Warner pulls it easy round the corner for four behind square. Deep in the crease, just rolls the wrists on it"

"chipped to the man in the covers, who <strong>takes a low catch and celebrates!</strong> Warner isn't going anywhere in a hurry... we're going upstairs, but the <strong>soft signal is out</strong>, which is so often important. Verreynne is the catcher... looks like he's jammed his fingers underneath the ball to me. These things always look worse in slow-motion. We're onto our second angle, which is completely useless, can't tell anything from here. Or from the third for that matter. I can't see that there will be conclusive evidence to the contrary of the soft signal... and <b>Warner is given out!</b> Slightly full of a length in the channel, pushed aerially to cover point, and Verreynne diving forward just about did the rest"
nibbles away outside off stump and <b>beats Smith's bat</b>

"cutter, sliding down the leg side, clips him on the pad as he shuffles across. Phehlukwayo lets out an ambitious, vociferous appeal, but that's surely very unlikely... hang on, <strong>de Kock reviews!</strong> Looked nowhere near to me on first viewing... no bat involved, impact outside, and missing a second set! One of the worst reviews I've <i>ever</i> seen!"

back of a length and Carey chops down in defence
"pinned on the pad,<strong> Nortje strikes and Smith is a goner!</strong> He asks Carey whether it's worth the review, but it looks fairly adjacent as Smudger trudges off! Length ball, decent bounce off the pitch. Smith was deep in the crease, looking to work through the leg side and pinned on the top of the pad. Might have been tight on height, but it's given, and that's a massive breakthrough for SA.... EDIT: Yep, ball-tracking confirms it was smashing into the top of leg stump. Good call!"

"cutter outside off, hacked to short midwicket on the bounce"
"length ball, decent turn, Short runs down looking to slug him into next week, <strong>swipes at thin air and doesn't even bother trying to get back!</strong> Miles out of his crease, punches his bat on the walk off. De Kock gathered coolly, just about nudging the bails off with as little effort as possible, and Shamsi taps his temple as if to say 'I've got in your head, D'Arce.' Australia eight down!"
