"very full, very straight, a hint of inswing, Guptill is lined up with a pre-meditated block"
"outside off, hits the seam and zips away towards the cordon. No stroke offered"
"on the toes, and Guptill clips urgently through the leg side. Not perfectly timed, but a good feel of bat on ball to get his innings underway"
"that's a sharp delivery, lifting into the gloves on an off-stump line. Ronchi reaches forward to smother on the front foot"
"yorker length, dabbed into the covers and a quick call from Ronchi. Guptill wasn't entirely on his toes, but neither was Henriques as he swooped late to gather"
whistles through to the keeper. Good signs from both sides in that over
"outside off, chopped through backward point with an open face. Off the toe-end but effective"
"off-target, reset the radar"
"tighter line, through to the keeper"
"on the pads, up and over. That's lovely timing, and strongly dispatched through the leg side. Four from the moment it left the bat"
"wider of off stump, a touch of swing, left alone this time"
"a woolly swish outside off, but there's no reaching that. Not sure how he got away with the wide. Very tight to the tramlines"
"battered through the off side, that's a fierce strike, Hazlewood's wide line costs him in the end as Guptill recalibrates and clobbers in one fell sweep"
"solidly onto the front foot, punched to cover"
"pace and carry through to the keeper. Another swish, but no contact this time"
"chancy! But effective! Opens the face on impact with a loose drive outside off, and the ball skews in the air, clean through the gap in front of point."
"low full toss outside off, no contact this time"
"tip and run to mid-off, and Warner's shy pings down the stumps! This looked close to the naked eye, but umpire Kettleborough is unconcerned. He's home by an inch! Brave call, or foolhardy? The latter surely."
bouncer to finish. Lively times
"back of a length, glided down to third man with an open face"
"that is a tremendous piece of timing! Angled back into the right-hander from wide on the crease, and Guptill met it on the front foot with a full-faced push, eased it past the stumps and just out of the reach of the sprawling fielder at long-on"
"tight line, through to the keeper"
"yee-har! Guptill swaps the cricket pitch for the golf course with a full-blooded tee shot, finding nothing but thin air as he's beaten by extra bounce"
"more circumspect this time, dabbed back down the pitch for a single"
"skimming drive, teasing the fingertips of mid-off, who can't intercept. Lots of intent now from New Zealand's openers!"
tight lines
"brilliant strike. Front foot planted, bat belting through the line. Cover had no chance. Still head, urgent hands. He's flying now"
"speared into the toes, defended up the pitch"
""
"too full again from Starc, you can see what he's trying but the ball just isn't swinging, and Guptill is loving this length. Smacks it right under the eyeline, clean down the ground"
"a fraction shorter, patted into the covers"
angled defence into the leg side
"down the track, Hazlewood sees him coming and drops it short. Tries to deflect over the cordon but can't connect"
opens the face to steer a back-cut through third man
"there's the breakthrough! A bit of seam movement and extra bounce. Chose the wrong ball to flick through leg, and took a leading edge straight to point. A fine innings cut short by the wrong shot at the wrong time"
"pushed onto the back foot, defended in front of the stumps"
tucked into the leg side

"onto the front foot, good strike, but cut off at point"
"defended on the back foot, to short midwicket"
nudged into the leg side
good lift through to the keeper
"banged in short, and utterly leathered through square leg. That's an emphatic finish to the over"
"extraordinary strike. Ronchi gave himself room, Cummins seemed to have followed him, but the shot was too good, right under the ball and launching it high and handsome over the off side. Fine take in the stands too"
tapped into the gap
"up on the toes, dabbed to the off side"
"banged in short and straight, met on the back foot with a slight hop into line"
defended back down the pitch
"huge let-off! How was this not a run-out? Ronchi had given up the ghost, both men stranded in mid-pitch, but the shy from mid-on missed initially, and Wade's sliding attempt to remove the bails was off-target. By the time his shoulder flicked the stumps, the bat was inches into the crease!"
"good wheels, tight line"
"attacking line into the pads from wide on the crease, dabbed to leg"
"leaning onto the front foot, pushed back to the bowler"
"beauty! Great start. Nibbles one around the off stump at length, Ronchi is beaten as he looks to play on the up"
hops back and across to guide the length ball to point
sliding stop by Maxwell at point. The wet outfield leaves plenty of patches on the grass thanks to the dive
tucks the incoming short ball to the leg side for a quick single
steers the length ball to third man
"pacy bouncer outside off, Ronchi ducks under that without a hassle. Touch too high, I thought. Lucky to get away"
"floated full on middle, Ronchi lofts this cleanly over the bowler's head. Stand and deliver. Not much of a followthrough but enough punch in the stroke"
hops back and bunts the short of length delivery to point
"gets into a tangle. Wasn't sure to flick or pull, went through with an attempted whip in the end, on the bounce to the keeper off the glove"
"angles a full delivery on off stump from wide of the crease, Williamson is half-forward as he defends"
gets across and knocks the length ball to the vacant midwicket region
"strong wrists. Fetches the whip from outside off, deliberately plays it behind square on the leg side. Fast enough even on this slow outfield. Starc with a desperate dive but it wasn't enough"
"walloped down the ground to long-off. Short, he shaped to pull initially but ended up flat-batting it"
"slides a length ball down leg, tickled to fine lef"
"stunning stop by Henriques. Hit firmly on the up, he moved swiftly a couple of steps to his left and then bent low to pull off a one-handed stop. <B> Saved four runs </b>"
driven firmly but straight to the cover fielder
hops back and runs the short of length delivery down to third man
"wow, what improvisation! Makes room - gives away his intention nice and early. Cummins looks to follow him but there's some room which Ronchi uses to slash it away over third man."
hops across and gloves an attempted pull over Wade's outstretched hands. <b> Fifty partnership us as well. </b> Cummins can only afford a wry smile
works the short delivery from off stump to mid-on for a quick single. Fielder late to react
turns the incoming short delivery towards mid-on again
"That's the region Williamson plays this through. Looks to cut, gets a thick edge down to third man"
"change in pace. Leg-cutter on off stump, Ronchi looks to hit through the line over cover but played too early. Beaten"
"wrong choice of stroke but gets away. A touch full, Ronchi looks to slash over point, gets a thick edge that flies into the third man boundary. <b> Half-century for the opener. </b>"
"looks to flat-bat the short of length ball through cover, gets a thick inside edge that rolls back to the bowler"
punched to the off side
"full on the stumps from wide of the crease, squeezed back to the bowler"
"floats one full on the stumps from wide of the crease, he looks to flick but gets an inside edge down to fine leg"
sways out of the way of that short ball. Pacy one at 145 clicks
crashed! Makes room to free his arms and slaps the length ball between cover and mid-off. No one moved
"<b> Dropped.</b> Oh, dear.  Starc has made a right royal mess at mid-on. Ronchi looks to slap this one away but didn't hit it as well as he would've liked. Starc was on the move as it came towards him. Should have taken that"
"cross-court forehand. 15-0, sir. Wimbledon is still a while away, can someone give Ronchi a wildcard, please? This is short on middle, Ronchi moves leg side and then flat-bats this down the ground. Too much muscle as he clears the infield comfortably."
"stunning batting!  Length on off, this time, Ronchi decides to go downtown, lofted through the line. Not much of a followthrough but it sails over the ropes"
opens the bat face deliberately to run it down to third man
thumped on the up to sweeper cover
"hint of width, steered to third man. Sensible from Williamson"
"picks the bones out of that but picks out Maxwell at point. The party is over. The ball deviates a wee bit from length, it seemed as if Ronchi wanted to hit it to the right of point, but ended up slicing it instead because of the minute deviation off the deck. Relief for Australia"
gets forward and outside the line of the stumps as he defends
"too close for the cut, that's exactly what Taylor tries to do. Beaten"
quality stroke. Hops back and punches the away-going length ball to sweeper cover

solid punch from the crease to cover

delicate little dab down to third man

plays the away-going length delivery with bat close to the pad

gets on top of the bounce and cuts but straight to Maxwell at backward point. Lucky to get away. <b> A meter on either side and it was four </b>
"this time he gets it up and over Maxwell at point. Too much width and he climbed onto it in a jiffy, one bounce to the point boundary"
"ill-directed delivery. Looks for the yorker, but the ball perhaps slipped down leg. Good work by Wade to effect a diving stop"
peach! Drew Taylor forward with the length. Played inside the line of the delivery that whizzed past
works a length ball form middle and off to midwicket
gets a giant stride in as he bunts that away to point
not there for the cut. Slashes and misses. <b> Ball shaved past the inside edge. </b> Didn't have the room either
hops back and across to defend the short of length ball back down the pitch
solidly defends the length ball on off stump to short cover

Hastings dives over the ball at short third man to give away two runs when there was none. <b> Sydney harbour bridge </b>

"slowed it down nicely, hint of grip, Williamson turns it to short midwicket"
"floats an accurate length ball on middle, defended"
"right into the blockhole, squeezed to mid-on"
excellent reflexes. Taylor struck that well but Henriques put his left leg out on the followthrough to stop the firm hit

uses the width to steer the length ball down to third man
gets on top of the bounce and fends the short ball down to third man

floats one at length on middle Taylor turns it to midwicket. Once again slightly overbalanced.
"slips this down leg, flicked to Starc at deep square leg"
"too far across this time in his attempt to tuck that one, ball deflects off the thigh pad to the leg side as they scamper through"
mistimes a drive down to mid-on. Looked to hit it straight back past the bowler
crashes the short ball to Starc at deep point
"short-arm jab, and wow. He's bisected deep square and fine leg. Banged in short, looked like Taylor got into a tangle but he still managed to generate enough power."
"steps out but can't get to the pitch of the ball, tucked to short midwicket"
driven inside-out but straight to cover
whips a shortish delivery on middle and leg to deep midwicket
"slow turn on middle and leg, wrists this behind square for an easy single"
"quality stroke! Slips this full, Williamson is waiting for it as he gets down on one knee and smokes this into the deep midwicket boundary"

inside edge to midwicket. Looked to force this through cover
squeezes a full delivery on off stump to cover
"cleverly done, runs it down to third man. Just past the wide slip"

"slips in a superb yorker, Taylor does well to jam his bat down in time to keep that out"
"fifty for Williamson, and he reaches it with a languid pull to a very short, stiff and loose leg-side long-hop"
"much better line and length, tapped back down the track"
wafted into the covers
"tighter to leg stump, can't quite get a flick away"
"on the back foot, angled to midwicket"
gives himself room but can't quite ease it through the covers
a strangulated appeal as Cummins raps the pad from wide on the crease. Always angling down. And an inside-edge too. Dot ball though
"short and sharp, Taylor is a bit miffed that that wasn't called a wide"
chopped out to third man
"nudged into the cordon, staying leg-side of the ball"
"outside off, jabbed to backward point. This spell is distinctly better than Cummins' first"
"wide of the off stump, nurdled to third man"
banged in short and hauled aggressively out to deep backward square. Good sliding stop to cut off the boundary
"short again, and launched handsomely over cow corner with a lovely lean-back-and-slap-it pull. Beautiful echo of willow around the ground"
"gives himself room on the leg-side, Henriques follows him, and they settle for a single to mid-on"
"flipped off the toes, that's sublime timing. Made the angle by skipping across the stumps and flinging his powerful wrists across the line"
"punched up to mid-on, was aiming a touch straighter, but another single to the cause"
"short ball, but a slower ball. Williamson goes for the big wind-up, but can't connect properly through midwicket"
nudged into the gap
"a bit of a dirty slower ball, very wide of off stump, but Warner's enthusiastic shy from mid-on gifts an overthrow. Fair effort, Williamson was a long way down"
tapped to third man
"down onto one knee, attempting a paddle-sweep, once again Hastings' lack of pace makes the timing hard to pull off"
leaning onto the front foot with a drive to mid-off
"there's the big shot! The big finish to the over that New Zealand needed. Steps across to outside off stump, meets a wide delivery with a fast and full-faced bat, and deposits a drive over long-off"
"tapped into the off side, a quick single to bring up the 200"
"tight line and length, solid defence"
"angling into the pads, an eager attempt to fillet a four through fine leg, but once again, can't quite time it"
"width, slapped to Maxwell at point"
"very wide on the crease from round the wicket, but that just encouraged Taylor to work with the angle and flick a beautifully timed on-drive to the wide mid-on rope. A valiant chase, but Hazlewood can't intercept without tumbling into the rope himself"
"struck on the toe, but Starc's angle is always taking it down. Throaty appeal though"
"too short, too wide, and too easy to put this one away. Up and over backward point"
"now then, now then! The pedal is heading for the metal, as Williamson plonks his front foot down the track, and launches his arms across the line of the ball. Dumped dismissively over midwicket, and this is an ominous over"
"very good slower ball. Williamson has to wait and wait, and miscues a pull to mid-on"
"tight line, good length, punched to short cover"
"there's the wicket! A cross-seam delivery, pace off the ball, Taylor climbs into an ambitious yahoo, but that is a spiralling top-edge, easily pocketed in the covers"

nudged down to long on
hops back and across to defend. Biding his time
"tapped off the hip, but can't beat the reach of short midwicket"
"once again, picks out short midwicket with an attractive, if unnecessarily classical, clip off the hip. That is a supreme over in any circumstances"

"well bowled, round the wicket, angled into the off stump and nipping past the edge"
"full toss, punched to mid-off for a sharp single"
opens the face and punches up and over the off side
"dabbed into the off side, another hustling single"
"on the toes, tucked to the leg side"

opens the face to guide a single to third man
another attempted squirt through backward point
"short and a bit of a rank leg-sided long-hop, really. A fierce swivel-pull to rack up the boundary"
"banged in short, that was leg-sided, but he gets away with it"
heave ho! A massive mow over deep midwicket and over the ropes! That'll help
"short and sharp, angled into the body, and Broom can't connect with a flappy waft towards third man"
yorker. Superbly executed. Nowhere for Broom to go but hard down into the crease to save his stumps from being splattered
"tapped to the leg side, at least he's handed the strike back to Williamson"
"outside off stump, glided to backward point"
low full toss on the leg stump. Worked to midwicket
opens the face with a deliberately placed steer into the covers
"middle-and-off stump line, and that's a delicate deflection through third man. A good tumbling stop to save the boundary"
"Broom does go vroom! Picks another cross-seamer from Hastings, and hauls a short ball out of deep midwicket's reach"
"good intent, but Hastings spots Broom's manoeuvrings, and fires the ball out wide as he aims to go leg-sided"
"no such problems for Kane! He's much more Ab(el) on that stroke, leaning inside the line to lob another short ball over his shoulder"
"tapped to cover, and there is Williamson's hundred! 96 deliveries, his ninth in ODIs, his first against Australia. And a vital finale to come"
"slower and fuller outside off, looks to run it down to third man but misses the legcutter"
"wide of off stump, tapped down the ground, and is going to be a run-out at the non-strikers' end. Yes, it is! Williamson was stranded as Cummins gathered and unleashed from a yard out, and that's the end of a fantastic innings"
"on the toes, plinked to deep midwicket"
"short, and straight enough. Well bowled, as Richard Illingworth signals the one for the over"
"that's a terrific welcome for the new man! Fierce throat ball, takes the glove and loops to square leg. No-one lurking, but the intent was plain"
"speared into the toes, can't get it past midwicket"
"a hard crack to short cover, but again, can't pierce the field"
"hoisted high and hard, but only as far as Glenn Maxwell on the midwicket rope! Broom is heading back to the cupboard, and New Zealand are in danger of dribbling to a sub-300 total"
poked back to the bowler
"that is a snarling delivery! Swung viciously out of the hand then exploded off the seam to boot. Beat the edge, all ends up"
stroked into the covers to pick off the single
"well bowled again, a tight line, and even tighter length to the new batsman, forcing him to gamble if he wants to have a go"
pierces the field with a cut through backward point
"angled down the leg side, but flicks the pad to save the wide"
"nurdled round the corner, another single to backward square. Australia will settle for this"
"well bowled, leaves Anderson on his backside as he limboes out of the way of a well-directed bouncer, kept following him from round the wicket"
"short, pulled, top-edged, and gone! Clears the rope at backward square leg, that's what sheer pace can do sometimes"
"another ambitious wipe, but this time it's simply spanged high into the off side. Who wants it? No-one really, but Henriques is the closest at backward point, clinging onto a steepler inches from the turf as he just about judges it in time!"
"on the back foot, tapped to short midwicket"
"wide of off stump, sliced to third man, where Starc slips as he jogs in to gather"
stand and deliver... deliver it straight to mid-on. Not the shot the circumstances required. New Zealand are sinking badly in the slog overs. They might struggle to use their full allocation at this rate
"that's more like it! A bit of a loose half-volley, but put away with aplomb, inches to the right of short cover, inches to the left of mid-off"
"good riposte, outside off stump and can't lay a bat on it"
"on the pads, whittled to backward square"
"on the pads, deflected to the leg side. Three to go"
"that's a loose delivery, and excellently put away. Flipped off the hip, very fine through fine leg. No cutting that off"
"another full toss, but zeroing in on the top of off stump. Flogged into the covers, off the back foot"
fenced into the gap
"another full toss, well, it's a tactic ..."
"outside off stump, floated into the covers with a loose-limbed drive"
misdirected. A good take down the leg side from Wade
"full length, in the blockhole, drilled to cover"
steps across the crease to waft a drive to mid-off.
"short, and slapped heartily over the leg side. Picked it well, stepped right back on his stumps, threw his weight behind the shot, and beat the sweeper"
"another supreme connection, but straight to Maxwell on the rope! He utterly smoked that pull, but some you win, some you lose"
"drilled into the covers, Smith reaches high, and Hazlewood has a five-for with his second in a row!"
good nut for a hat-trick ball! Ghosting past the edge from a very full length
"edged and gone! Hazlewood wraps up the innings with 6 for 52, a perfect Test-match line and length, kissing the edge of the No.11. What a regrouping from Australia. They'll be firm favourites when the chase gets underway shortly"
"angles a full-length delivery across Warner, who lets it go"
"pitched up on the pads and Warner flicks this into the gap between midwicket and mid-on. The outfield has slowed down significantly, would've been a boundary otherwise"
"length on middle and leg, whipped to deep square leg"
plays back to a delivery he could've been well forward. No harm done as he defends
"digs one in short on leg stump, Warner looks to take him on but is beaten by the pace. Wasn't far from the glove. Stifled appeal but a very optimistic one. Southee gets away with one"
punches a length ball to mid-off and scampers a quick single
"sharp bouncer which Warner looks to fetch from outside off, gets a thick inside edge onto the body. Guptill swoops in from point to cleanly pick up the deflection and prevent the single"
"full and sliding into the pads, tickled to the fine leg boundary. Too easy, like picking apples in the backyard."
"skids back in from length to cramp Warner for room, defended to short leg"
shows the full face of the bat in defence
leading edge but into the gap between cover and point. Extra bounce from length on middle
"sensible. Drops it gently towards short cover and scampers a run. Santner has a shy at the bowler's end, may have been close had he hit"
"struck on the thigh pad as he looks to whip the length ball on leg, they scamper a leg bye off the deflection"
"back of length on middle and leg, turned behind square"
"looked to hook that out of the stadium, but played too early and missed. Task made tougher by the fact that he had to fetch it from outside off"
"short of length outside off, he stands tall and punches it to cover"
"much fuller on off stump from wide of the crease, Finch hops back and punches. Could've pressed forward again"
"tucks him up with the angle from wide of the crease, bunted down the ground as they jog the single"
looks to slap this incoming length ball on middle but is beaten by the zip off the deck. Was deep inside the crease to execute that shot this time
drags an attempted loft over the bowler's head towards wide long-on. Santner runs in from mid-on to pull it back. The bat face turned in his hand as he made contact with the length ball
thick inside edge but a stunning stop by Corey Anderson at short fine leg. Looked to heave this to the leg side
"length on middle and leg, tucked to deep square leg"
"back of length outside off, forces it to mid-off and scampers a run. Santner doesn't pick up cleanly as he hares in to prevent the run"
"excellent leave. Touch fuller outside off, no swing whatsoever though"
"sweet timing as he check-drives, but straight to cover point."
"swing and a miss. Looks to slap this over cover, but played too early."
"steers one to short third man, quick single taken"
"upper cut, wow! Slapped that over square third man. Shikhar Dhawan plays this very well too. Both feet in the air as he used the angle to give it a whack. Strong hands"
drops it gently to short cover for a quick singe. Fielder a touch too deep. Williamson immediately asks him to come in a couple of paces
"cramped for room, hops back and dabs back to the bowler"
"shot brought out of desperation and an escalating asking rate. Warner sashays down the pitch to slap this length ball over point but can only get a big, fat edge through to Luke Ronchi"
"beaten! Looks to flay this over point, there was width alright but he was a tad late on the shot. Zip off the deck again"
crunching cover drive. Just leant into it and used the hint of width to play through the line. Wow
"looks to play a short-arm jab over midwicket, but was in no position. Got into a tangle as the ball kept coming back in to cramp him for room. Beaten. <b> Has played three shots already </b>"
hit high on the thigh pad as he shuffles across to whip that away
"bowls this across at length from wide of the crease, Smith stands tall and punches that between the two cover fielders. Stunning"
"138kph length ball outside off, punched to Kane at short cover"
"tried to hit this length ball through the line over the bowler's head, but toe-ended it behind the wicket"
"chipped straight to short midwicket. The extra pace of Milne has done the trick. Length ball at 142kph, comes back in to cramp him for room. Gets it high on the bat as he hops back to whip and Taylor takes a dolly."

"thick inside-edge, squeezed to square leg. Played outside the line of that length delivery. Feeble"
"not much power on that drive, tumbling stop at cover"
"slants a back of length delivery across, Henriques solidly behind in defence"
"slants a fuller delivery across, left alone"
"<B> top-edge,  but safe. </b> Looks to fetch it from outside off, gets enough bat on it to clear the keeper. One bounce into the boundary"
beaten as he tries to open the bat face to angle it down to third man
crunch! This is a short-arm jab to a length ball on middle. Flew off the middle. Made sweet contact. Deep square leg stood no chance even though he wasn't far away
"looks to pull, gets it high on the bat, rolls to fine leg"
"not much bounce this time. Looks to drive through the line, scoots off the absolute bottom to the keeper"
"short and angling into the body, Henriques gets on top of the bounce and keeps the pull all along the ground. Stayed right back in the crease, almost as if he was expecting it."
plants fully forward to bunt the length ball to cover
"gets this to jag back in off the deck from length on off, pushed to the leg side"
"edged and it bursts through Ross Taylor's hands at first slip. Bounced well in front of him, could've been stopped nevertheless. Henriques was squared up"
"the streaky innings has ended. Gets a big, fat inside edge onto the pad as he plays outside the line of the delivery. This one moved back in off the seam as well. Simple catch on the followthrough for Milne. Australia in tatters. <b> The rain arrives as they come together to celebrate. </b>"
