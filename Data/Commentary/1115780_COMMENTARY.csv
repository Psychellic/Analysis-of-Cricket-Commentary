"and the first ball of day-night Test cricket in New Zealand is a teasing little awayswinger, which Cook knows better than to mess with"
gets in line with a back of a length delivery and thrusts it into the covers
"nice and tight on middle now, and that's Cook's wheelhouse. He greets the ball with a genial smile and a firm pat that Gray Nicholls"
"the first full-length delivery of the over, and he dangles it just a tad wide of off stump, to see if Cook wants to chase it. He doesn't. Of course, he doesn't"
"on the pads and for the gazillionth time, Cook flicks to find funds behind square leg."
"shortish and outside off, lets it through"
"<b>prodigious swing</b>, only it's poorly directed, and the only person it troubles is Watling behind the stumps who has to fly to his right to stop the ball going for byes"
slants this good length ball way too far outside off. Cook doesn't care for it
"there we go, plants it on a good length, at around fifth stump, and has the ball jag back in to spur a few doubts in the left-hander's mind. However, Cook smothers them with a rock-solid leave"
"as always, he's fairly reluctant to push forward, and Southee does well to pitch the ball up on middle and off and force him to do so"
"attempts a drive into the covers, the front foot shedding its cobwebs. Doesn't quite time the ball down and it goes right down the pitch"
swinging into the pads and Cook dabs it away to fine leg
"full and wide, and Cook barely bats an eyelash"
refuses to be drawn into anything outside off stump again
plonks a straight bat down on a shortish delivery on off stump
he's pulling? in the third over? We might have slipped into the twilight zone a little too early if Alastair Cook is flat-batting the new ball over mid-on. <i>Just</i> over...
"good length ball on off stump, blocks safely"
"shortish and outside off, no interest"
"nice and full from Southee, seeing if there is some swing. And there is, some inswing. A thick inside edge down to fine leg for one. Pushes forward"
"137 kph, full again, straight again. Some inswing. But Stoneman flicks to square leg for nothing."
"that's too straight and Stoneman picks Southee off towards fine leg. It's the right length on the first afternoon with the new pink ball, though."
"full, angling away this time. 136 kph, left alone. Terrific variation, but he may want to be just a bit closer to that off stump."
"133 kph, full and straight, no flick, no drive. Cook offers the full face and blocks"
"137 kph, gets forward and drives that away in front of point for a run. Just a gentle push."
"excellent bowling and fielding. Bowls it full and straight, the ball moving away in the air late. Cook is not tempted into a cross-batted stroke, drives towards mid-off. De Grandhomme dives away to his left and stops a run."
"play that! No chance, even for Cook. That's sensational bowling and NZ strike. Boult goes slightly wider of the crease, but he persists with that length, full. His deadly accuracy means Cook is drawn into a stroke, it's around off. Moves away just enough with that angle from wide of the crease, takes the outside edge and flies to second slip at a comfortable knee height. Big strike."
that's full and too wide. Angling in after pitching. Left alone
"excellent again from Boult. Full but not as wide, fifth-stump line. Left alone."
"138 kph, slightly shorter this time, back of a length outside off, the ball moves back in. Root is right behind the line to defend"
"attacks the pad this time. Root is good enough to get bat on that, though. Full, the ball swinging in, Root inside-edges onto the pad."
"full and wide, inviting a drive, but Stoneman knows he has just lost his opening partner, so he leaves."
"a nice change in length, goes short this time, on middle and leg, forces Stoneman underneath that."
"full around off, 137 kph, Stoneman is right behind that to defend"
"nicely bowled again, 136 kph, full around off, played away towards point with a half prod."
"wrong shot selection, it's slightly short around off. Back of a length at worst. But Stoneman wants to pull, can't time his pull, back to the bowler. A punchy drive a better option?"
"maiden from Southee, full down leg, pushed back towards the bowler"
"full and straight, moving back in again. Root happy to defend from the back foot though. Still some inswing"
"and Boult has Root! England's best Test batsmen are done for today. Stunning bowling again, very full outside off, the ball moving back in. Root is drawn into a drive because he sees a run-scoring option. He drives at the ball, but the ball swings back and finds a big gap between bat and pad. The ball loves that unhindered path and hits off stump."
"134 kph, on the pads, wow, Malan would not have wanted it anywhere else, flicked to fine leg"
"back of a length around off, Stoneman right behind the line to defend"
"first boundary of the Test. Goes flying away through midwicket. Boult goes full and straight, looking to surprise Stoneman, flicked away through midwicket for four"
"very awkward. That's the length, short, back of a length. Stoneman thinks of swaying, then ducking but the length isn't there, so he pushes it towards point."
"138 kph, a full delivery around off, Malan gets forward and defends to mid-off"
"nice and full again, 132 kph. Malan is tentative but blocks to mid-off"
"the one that swings back in, full on the pads. Malan misses an opportunity to score, takes the pad towards square leg."
"another awkward pull. <strong>England seem intent on pulling today</strong>. Another nice short delivery, aimed at the neck. Pulled with bad timing to square leg for one"
"hands and eyes! Stoneman depending on the coordination between those parts. Full, wide, swinging back in. Does't matter. Slashed away through backward point"
""
"England in disarray! Boult is on faaayyyyaaa! It's the exact same delivery that got Cook, exactly the same. He goes wide of the crease and bowls it on a full length. Because of that, Malan has to get forward and play, or at least he feels like he needs to play. The ball moves away juust enough, takes the outside edge. It carries nicely to Watling, who dives in front of first slip and takes it with the gloves. Superb cricket from NZ."
"oh wow, what a leave. Wide of the crease again, the ball does <b>not move away and goes over off stump</b>"
"<strong>swing bowling at its very very finest</strong>! The previous one did not move, Stokes left dangerously. He feels he needs to play, so he goes full and moving away. Stokes gets forward, looks to play and the away swing takes the ball past the outside edge"
"slightly shorter and wider, left alone"
"bat on ball! Back of a length outside off, Stokes is behind the line nicely enough"
"full outside off, 136 kph, another wicket maiden. Stokes does not play at this."
"smashed. And a fine stop from point. Full and wide, Stoneman goes reaching, carved in front of point. The fielder dives to his left and half-stops it."
"that's not a great shot. A nothing shot. Full outside off, Stoneman just wafts with no intent to score. The ball beats the bat"
"full and wide again, angling away. This time Stoneman does not play"
"England are 18 for 4 on the first morning of the Test! Another terrific delivery, it's full, the ball moving away late. Stoneman has to play, he has to. The ball is straight afterall. Another outside edge and another nice low catch from Watling. Boult and Southee, not many better swing bowling combinations around."
drifts down leg for an ODI wide. No bat from Bairstow.
"back of a length on middle, Bairstow defends from the back foot."
"full delivery outside off, Stokes is behind the line to block."
"136 kph, full outside off, moving away late. Stokes watches the ball onto his bat as he defends."
"it gets worse for England. They have been absolutely undone by one of the spells of the summer! Boult goes wide of the crease again, he has been taking the ball away for most of the afternoon from that angle. But this one doesn't, it comes back in. Stokes wants to leave that, but the ball keeps coming back in, like the off stump is a magnet and the ball is a magnetic substance with an opposite charge. It perfectly finds the off stump by the time Stokes' bat thinks of coming down."
"a leave. Back of a length outside off, the ball moves away this time, left alone."
"shortish outside off, 136 kph, left alone"
"looking for off stump. Full and straight again, blocked away to mid-off"
"135 kph, full and straight, attacking the stumps again, pushed to mid-off"
"caught and bowled! <strong>Read this right: 18 for 6!</strong> It's full outside off, nothing much else to it. Bairstow drives, looking to counter-attack but the ball comes on a touch slower than he expected. It lobs back off the lower half of the bat, towards Southee, who doesn't panic in his follow-through. The ball goes straight in. WHAT A START."
"138 kph, drifts on the pads, worked to square leg"
"that's a positive punch for some runs. Goes wide of the crease, full outside off, punched through cover for two"
"drifts down leg, nudged down to fine leg for one."
"full and straight, Moeen is behind the line"
"full and outside off, Woakes won't go chasing."
"good length, angling across the right-hander, Woakes holds fire"
nudges it off his pads through midwicket.
shoulders arms as the shortish delivery flies harmlessly past.
"<b>hits him on the thigh</b> as he makes the ball dart in off the pitch - a very quick pitch, with just enough movement"
"<b>he's got a fifth, and he's only in his seventh over</b>! Boult is judge, jury and executioner at Eden Park and everyone is feeling his wrath. Not least the stumps as they take another battering. This is another inswinger, pitched up, drawing Woakes into a drive. But to play these kinds of shots, the front foot needs to move, needs to cut the gap that pops out when the hands go searching. Woakes' doesn't. And Boult thunders through to hit off stump. Epic bowling. Unbelievably epic."
flirts with a rising delivery outside off and he's left behind like puff of dust
"full and in line with off stump, with a hint of curl into the left-hander. Moeen tucks it to short midwicket"
teases the outside edge with a full delivery outside off. Moeen does well to let it go
"yorker! As if the swing and seam isn't enough, Southee is forcing the batsmen to deal with toe-crushers? This is borderline evil! Moeen is so slow bringing the bat down, and when he does, he makes it travel down the original line of the ball. On off stump. But it's swinging in. Just enough again to beat the inside edge and cannon into the base of middle stump"
<b>beats him</b>! This is seriously cheat-code-powered computer-game cricket. England batsmen are constantly caught in the crease. And New Zealand are being entirely free to do what they will with the little pink thing. Southee hits the deck on middle stump and gets just enough seam movement away from Broad
"full on middle, nudges it to midwicket"
follows the good length ball moving across him with the angle and ends up nowhere near it
"back of a length on off stump, guides it to point"
"full and outside off, he drives to mid-off"
"another example of how pacy Eden Park is - Boult digs in a bouncer and it hustles over the ducking batsman, on middle"
"skews it away to the point boundary. That's only the third of the morning, and it comes about by Overton reaching to a wide yorker and slicing it through the gap"
"<b>skirts past the edge</b>! Great discipline from Boult, keeping the ball full, targeting the top of off stump, making the batsmen play."
"looks to punch a full delivery outside off through mid-off, but he's into the shot too early and it hits the inside edge"
pushes at a full delivery - from the crease - and only mistimes it to point
"that's the Stuey special, clearing the front leg and going heave ho the moment he sees a length ball. Makes no contact whatsoever"
"<b>this has to be a dream</B>! It's one thing to have your bowlers looking <i>literally</i> unplayable. But when you couple that with your captain flying through the air to catch a ball hurtling past him, you are playing cricket at an entirely different level. Williamson is at gully. He sees a thick outside edge from Broad. He throws himself to his left. He's parallel with the ground, sticking one hand out to that little pink thing and it sits in it ever so obediently"
"full and outside off, flash and miss from Andereson"
""
"full on leg stump, Overton flicks all around it and is hit on the pad. Would be sliding down leg"
through the gap between the slips and gully! Overton flays at a back of a length delivery outside off and for once finds fortune going his way
"full and outside off, drives through cover, quite well at that. He's a fighter, but 33 for 9 isn't a battle too many can win."

"full on leg, Anderson deflects it to fine leg"
"goes around the wicket for a full delivery on off stump, Overton blocks"

clips the pad on the way through to the keeper
"back of a length and outside off, chops it into the covers"

"pulls it majestically to the square leg boundary. He looks very good against the short ball, even if he did get struck on the ribs by one in the Ashes."
"another bouncer, this one wider of off stump. Overton attempts the pull again, but trying to drag a ball from outside off rarely works"
"shortish and outside off, slices it behind point"
drops his wrists to avoid the menace in this bouncer that starts outside off but then keeps following him
zips through past the outside edge as Boult hits the deck. He's into his 11th over now. There ain't no way these two are getting rid of the pink
"gets the outside edge, but Anderson does well to use soft hands and make sure it doesn't carry to third slip"
"on middle and leg, Anderson clips to square leg"
"taken at point, Boult has six and <b>England are all out for 58</b>! This is the least glamorous wicket of all, but it still has an English batsman fearing the ball, Anderson shying away from a short ball outside off and poking it straight to the fielder. But really, what can No. 11 do when the rest of the line-up was so shoddy?"
"<B>run-out chance</b>! This Test isn't done doing its best impression of a roller-coaster! Raval does well to block a good length ball in the corridor, but then wants a very risky single. His partner Latham says he'll take it on as well. And that creates an opening for England as the cover fielder races up to the ball and flings in a throw at the striker's end. Direct hit would have had him"
"fullish on off stump, defends"
"back of a length, wandering down leg, Latham's leg glance doesn't really come off"
"nice and full on middle stump, Latham comes forward and presents the full face"
"excellent new-ball bowling, demanding the left-hander to play, and that fullish length means he doesn't get much warning when the ball starts to seam in. Latham manages to nudge it to midwicket"

"beautiful bowling! The Anderson trademark, keeping a fuller length, testing the outside edge and only Latham's pristine judgement of where his off stump is saves him from trouble."
gets up high and chops a shortish delivery outside off to point
"<b>delicious stuff</b>! Earlier in the over, a ball pitching on off stump didn't fetch a shot. So Anderson corrects his line - just by an inch or so - and a ball pitching on middle and angling across the left-hander beats the outside edge"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
covers the line of a shortish delivery on middle
<b>excellent leave</B> as Raval puts his front foot down to cover off stump and lets a good length ball go past it
"back of a length, going across the left-hander. Raval doesn't bother with it"
"<b>zips past the edge</b>! And it's the full delivery again that causes problems. For some reason, off that length, the ball both moves and does so at a sharper pace than the batsman expects"
"<b>dropped</b> in the slip cordon, with Malan moving to his right, jutting himself in front of Root and then not going for the catch! Up to that split second in which his fingers don't close over the ball, the cricket was perfect. The fast bowler turns the batsman around with a ball pitching outside leg stump and seaming sharply away. Raval looks to play into the leg side, gets a leading edge, and survives"
"full and outside off, he drives sweetly down the ground. Short cover does well to run to his left and stop it"
"goes full on middle, Raval keeps it out"
"<b>outside edge, through the cordon</b>! Latham thrusts his hands at a good length ball outside off, the kind out-of-form or inexperienced or careless openers often nick off. Luckily - and New Zealand have had plenty of this this morning - it goes through the gap"

"good length, outside off, no shot"
"<b>so close again</b>! Broad has been bowling like a vengeful demon, like the mere thought that the new ball would be taken from him is a slight on his family's name.

"full on off stump, he gets forward to block. And now umpire Reiffel asks Broad to veer away in his followthrough a bit quicker"
"<B>past the edge, and over off stump</b>! Bowlers can't really do much more than this - pitch it up, get it to move off the seam, have the batsman unsure of both his feet, and his best option of shot."
blocks a fullish delivery on middle into the covers and sprints across to the other end

steps forward to a full delivery on off stump and blunts it
"caught behind! Reward for persistent bowling. Both Anderson and Broad have been hunting the outside edge with froth coming out of their teeth and finally one snicks through. They look at each other almost immediately, flashing big smiles. This is a planned strike. A back of a length ball on middle has Raval squaring up, thrusting the bat in front of his body and basically praying he gets beaten. No luck for New Zealand this time"

"good length, outside off, lets it go"
""
"for half a second, he seems to want to play at this. But by virtue of that sensational ability not to commit to the ball until the last moment, he earns the right to see that the ball spits up off the pitch and bares its teeth. Now considering its outside off, he has a simple decision to leave it and take on the next one"
"full on off stump, defends"
"<b>pins him</B> near the unmentionables and Latham is buckled over on the batting crease, having been unable to cope with a back of a length delivery that jags back in off the pitch"
"excellent bowling! Plies it down the corridor of uncertainty, on a full length, because he wants the batsman coming forward, wants him to have lesser time to deal with the movement he'll get off the pitch. Latham knows all of that and simply lets it go with the angle"
"blocks it towards silly mid-off and they hare across for a quick single that really shouldn't be on. Credit to Latham for playing it with such soft hands, and to Williamson for responding immediately"
"<b>that is unplayable</b>! It has Williamson  unsure of how to play - forward or back - and trapped in the crease, he fishes for a ball that straightens past the edge like it thinks it's too good for such things"
"full on off stump, Williamson does well to play late, and inside the line so that he either gets some bat on it, or is beaten so he can keep batting on"
"good length, outside off, ignores it"
"gets the ball to nip in just a bit, Latham however accounts for that with a straight bat and more importantly by not planting his front leg across"
"a shade leg-sidish and that's all it needs for Latham to pounce all over it. A little roll of the wrists, after making sure he is right on top of the ball, waiting until the last minute so that he has perfect timing. Four through wide mid-on. Outstanding"
stand up and appalaud! For this is a cover drive from the top draw. Good stride forward. A little punch as opposed to  the bat flowing through the line. And straight in the gap

"back of a length on off stump, taps to cover"
"pierces the gap at cover. You know the quiet kind of chaos, where you can't seem to figure out what's going wrong, but you know something is.

"nice line, close to off and middle, the better channel. Defended to mid-on."

too straight and worked away for a run to fine leg.
"he's gone? <strong>Has Woakes got a hand on it?</strong> If he has, it's done. The third umpire is called upon. He's well out of the crease. Replays aren't conclusive. A full delivery was beautifully hit back towards the bowler, whose outstretched hand is very close to the ball.  The ball then hits the stumps at the bowler's end, with Williamson just staring. I can't see anything conclusive either way, and the old method of making decision: benefit of doubt to the batsman. Woakes should have known there, there was only a half-appeal from him. But what was Williamson doing so far down in a Test?"
"<strong>beauty!</strong> Full delivery outside off, the ball moves away and beats the bat."

five wides! Five more runs to play for New Zealand. It's a bouncer that climbs and climbs and climbs past Bairstow. Taylor was never interested.
"through backward point for four. So nine runs off two balls. England need their control back. Full and wide, sliced through."
"that's four more. 13 runs in three balls. This lead is ballooning quickly. Another straight drive, this time past Woakes' right hand. Four through mid-on."
"full around off, worked wide of midwicket, who dives to his left and stops the ball."
"full and straight, 132 kph, pushed to mid-on with the full face. With so many drives, Williamson can't be backing too much."
"hurried on a pull and Taylor's gone! The no-ball is juuuust fine. A short delivery outside off, Taylor reads the length early enough but is very late on his pull. To worsen things, he tries to drag the pull, instead of possibly cutting the ball. It lobs off the splice to deep midwicket. It was a scratchy innings"
"good leave. 131 kph, full outside off, the ball moving away. Left alone."
"132 kph, off the pads. Nicholls misses a simple flick, off the inside edge, then the pad, then square leg"

fourth-stump start from Overton. A new spell. Left alone by Nicholls.

"hurried on another pull. It goes through to the keeper. <strong>England go up in appeal</strong>, no says the umpire. No review either. Very late on that was Nicholls. Did it kiss the glove?"

"a full delivery around off, driven back to the bowler"
"angled away outside off, left alone."
"it looks like a ball that can be clipped through midwicket. It looks exactly like the one you can get runs off. Then you remember you're playing under lights, and it's Anderson who's sending it down. Cuts in off the pitch and hits him on the thigh"
"good length ball, outside off, Williamson doesn't wanna go near it"
"takes great care to meet the ball right under his eyes, and with those soft hands, he dabs the short ball down towards the slips"
goes wide of the crease to see if he can straighten the ball and snatch the edge. Williamson and the middle of his bat haven't been given the brief. Clearly.
"pings off the edge, through the cordon, and away to the boundary. Williamson is unsure... and whenever he is, he uses those soft hands and that means it never ever carries"
"lbw appeal as Wiliamson shoulders arms. Umpire Reiffel turns it down and <b>England review</b>. The New Zealand captain has often been shuffling across his stumps in this innings. And he does that here too. What's more, there's a bit of inswing as well. All that might have tempted Root into taking this up to the third umpire. And HawkEye reveals that the ball will be missing the stumps. England lose both their reviews"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
gets in line with a short ball on middle and leg
"<b>falls short of fourth slip</b>! This is the length - pitched up, on and around off stump. It makes Nicholls thrust his hands out at the ball, his feet asleep. The edge results, but it just doesn't carry to Anderson diving forward and to his right"

"gets forward to block on middle and off. It moves a tad, just enough to take the edge, but Nicholls is using soft hands and that means the ball doesn't carry to the cordon"

"leaps off his feet, looking majestic as he punches the ball through cover. High elbow. Vertical bat."

"better! This starts in line with off stump and Nicholls is brave enough to let it go, hoping and praying it goes on with the angle"
gets nice and tall so that he can work his wrists over the shortish delivery on off stump. The key to pulling the shot off though is in how late he plays it
"goes full and immediately finds something to troubled the batsman. Williamson is forward, looking to block, but a tiny bit of inward movement gets the inside edge and they pinch a single through square leg"
tucks it off his hips to midwicket
"<b>tight leave</b>. Once again, Nicholls plants his front leg on off stump and therefore knows anything outside his eyeline can be sent through to the keeper"
"shortish, but nipping back into him, if only slightly. Nicholls blocks as the ball gets big on him and gets an inside edge"

"lovely little lap sweep. With no turn. No extra bounce. Nothing for Moeen to work with, he's basically leaking singles every ball"

leaps to get on top of the ball on off stump and juts it to mid-off
"full and outside off, Nicholls is wise to the threat in play and just doesn't play"

"123 kph, the pace is going down, full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"126 kph, good length outside off, some seam movement back in, defended"
"digs this in around off, Williamson sways out of the line"
"back of a length outside off, 126 kph, blocked. Maiden. Williamson well aware there is rain and a new ball around the corner."
"shortish on and around off stump, Nicholls plonks it by his feet"
"he's conscious about getting his feet moving early, and well. Lunges at a ball that is essentially back of a length and blocks it"
meets the fuller delivery outside off right under his eyes.
a smidge of movement away from the left-hander has Nicholls pushing away from his body. But his wrists help him keep the ball down as it goes to point
"rock-solid defense, with a perfectly straight bat. This Nicholls innings has all the characteristics of a coming of age phenomena. If he can keep going, especially against the new ball"
shoulders arms having judged the line of this length ball to be outside off
"<b>movement!</b> Even if it isn't terribly discomfitting. The new pink ball slants into the right-hander, as Broad means it to, and then decks further off the pitch. Still not quite close enough to draw a shot"
"good length, outside off, Williamson waves it off to the keeper"
"spears it well down the leg side, giving Bairstow a proper work out behind the stumps"
"<b>bounce</b>! So much that Williamson, as he prepares to leave, needs to make sure that his gloves are high enough not to interfere with an indipper"
"plants it fuller, in line with off stump, making Williamson play finally. He looks to flick but is beaten on the inside edge."
turns it off his hips behind square leg
"a probing line, slanting into the right-hander's leg stump, assuming it swings away. Doesn't. And so Williamson flicks to midwicket"
"<b>delicious new-ball bowling</b> as Anderson pitches it in the 4 to 6 m area, where Williamson can't get to the pitch but still has no choice to come forward. From there, the batsman's judgment is the only thing that can save him and the New Zealand captain's is spot on. Leaves it outside off"
"fullish on off stump, stately block"
"back of a length and outside off, doesn't mess with it. Williamson's ability to switch on when the game is on the line is a thing of beauty"
"shortish on and around off stump, he dabs it towards the cordon"
keeps it nice and full and Williamson sends it back whence it came
"spears it through the covers. Course, Broad wouldn't mind a stroke like that, considering it makes a left-hander play away from his body, with three slips and a gully waiting. Nicholls, for the moment, wins the battle"
"<b>splendid timing</b>, as he plays the ball under his eyes, working the ball through midwicket. That little spell of rain might just have slowed the outfield down"
drifts down the leg side as Williamson attempts a leg glance
strides forward to block a pitched-up delivery around the off stump
"oh that's glorious. it's only a block, but his ability to wait for the ball and meet it right beside him, with the bat face pointing down, and soft hands such that it dribbles to the slips is just inexplicably good"
"fullish on off stump, blocks"
chops it down into the covers for a quick single. Good stuff from New Zealand.
"taps a back of a length delivery through the covers, getting up off his feet to make sure he bears down on the ball"
"short of a length, angling across the left-hander, and Nicholls reads it like a book and it appears to be a bad book case he wants nothing to do with it"
"<b>absolute peach</b>, decking away past the outside edge, snarling away with substantial movement, off the pitch as opposed to in the air"
pokes the fuller delivery into the covers and sprints across to the other end. It's risky.... Moeen sends in the throw... but Nicholls makes it. Just!
"<b>given lbw</b>! The new ball works! Williamson comes down to see if his partner things it's okay for a review. Somehow I don't think it'll work. New Zealand do take it up to the third umpire. HotSpot won't save him. Ball-tracking says this has pitched just outside off, swinging in all the way, then it decked in off the seam too to beat the inside edge by a good distance and pinned Williamson plumb in front"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
swipes a short ball on and around off stump to midwicket
stands tall behind the shortish delivery on off stump
clips the thigh pad as it wanders down the leg side
"full and wide outside off, no interest from Nicholls"
"excellent stuff, landing the ball outside off, searching for the drive away from the body. Nicholls won't be giving his wicket away that easily"
"teaser from one of the very best, greeting the new batsman with a good length ball outside off. An anxious batsman might have thrust his hands at it and nicked off"
presses forward to block a good length ball on off stump
"eases it sweetly off his pads nearly the distance to the midwicket boundary. Copybook stuff from Watling. The ball is on his pads, he deals with it"
"<B>spectacular bowling</B> but the batsman outsmarts it by leaving the ball. A very threatening ball, pitched up on off stump and jagging back in off the stump. Nicholls' judgment has been on par with Williamson's in this innings"
"good length on off stump, defends stoutly"
swivels on the back foot to pull a short ball on off stump down to deep square leg
<b>shoulders arms and gets hit on the pad</b> but England don't appeal because they know it will be going over the stumps. Appreciable inswing from Woakes
"fuller delivery, outside off, he blocks it out"
keeps that front foot away from the straight line his bat needs to track to deal with an inswinger on middle and leg
"leans into a drive, presenting the full face and playing close to the body. He is allowed to do so considering this is a half-volley"
"good length, slanting across the left-hander. Nicholls ushers it through to the keeper"
"another well-judged leave, with the ball pitching on off stump and going on with the angle. This innings has been full of it."
"lovely bowling, floating it up there to see if the new bat will want an easy drive to get some runs. Watling knows there is no such thing against Anderson and leaves"
"back of a length and outside off, Watling isn't tempted again"
"sharp movement into the right-hander, both in the air and off the pitch, and it all happens so late that Watling just can't get in position. He's trying to flick, but even before the bat comes down, he's struck in the gut"
"<b>he's in rhythm now</b>. The inswinger snarls at Watling, who makes sure to keep the front leg out of the way of a straight bat"
goes back to being a steady tease outside the off stump. Anderson giving the new man a proper working over
"<B>how does that miss off stump</b>?! Watling leaves the ball because it is travelling down a straight line, outside off, for three-fourth its distance down the pitch. Then it seams in wildly but not quite enough for England's purposes"
"<b>half an appeal for lbw</b>, and though the ball does straighten, the height at which it strikes the pad makes it too close to call for umpire Oxenford. Nicholls' is just a touch slow in bringing down his bat, and that's because of the late movement"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"short and at the body, Nicholls pulls to long leg"
"half-volley outside off and Watling drills it through the covers. That really should be four, but the ball pulls up on a heavy outfield that's taken a bit of rain. Oh wait, maybe Watling might still get the extra run since Broad, in pulling the ball back, makes simultaneous contact with the boundary boards"
"<b>outside edge</b> slips past the right of third slip. Soft hands, even if he ends up being squared up by a ball straightening off the angle"
firmly in line with a short ball on off stump
"the fuller ball poses a lot of threat, even when it comes down in a largely straight line. Even a set batsman like Nicholls is worried about what could happen - a little bit of movement either way - and as he comes down on it gingerly, he gets an inside edge through square leg"
"that's his favourie shot. Any chance to cut the ball, he takes it with open arms. He's out of the game for six months but this short and wide delivery is what he'd been dreaming off all that time"
goes a touch too full this time and Watling wallops it to deep square leg
"dangles it wide outside off, Nicholls won't bother with it"
"good length ball, darting just enough away off the pitch to make Nicholls not want anything to do with it"
on the pads and Nicholls knocks it down to the left of Broad at mid-on
"ignores a short ball outside off, even with Woakes having changed the angle and coming round the wicket"
"he's often left these go, but this time he can't hold himself back. Gets just close enough to the shortish delivery outside off and punches it behind point"
"full and outside off, no shot"
"<b>probing stuff</b>, landing the ball on the fuller than good length area, the angle bringing it into the left-hander, and the seam taking it away. It's only because Nicholls has been established at the crease does he know he doesn't have to play this"
"another carrot dangled outsde off, but Nicholls isn't the desperate kind, not in this form"
sees this delivery - a lot fuller than the others - coming for his off stump and so has a quiet word with it with a straight bat. Woakes giving a great account of himself to take the new ball for England in Tests.
"that's the length that makes him most threatening - around the 4 m mark, from where he can generate both extra bounce and seam movement. Watling presses forward and leaves outside the off stump"
<b>veers in prodigiously</b> and hammers into Watling's pads and he's nowhere near ready with a shot. That's what good length bowling with the new ball can do.
"back of a length and outside off, Watling ignores it as it zips through to the keeper. This is a battle now. A proper battle"
"he's careful to commit as late as he can to a shot, but the quickness of his hands helps and he ably protects his off stump from an inswinger"
slanting a little too far into the body and Watling clips it through square leg
"neat little flick to midwicket, taking the ball from around the wicket, pitching on off stump, down that route with a closed face"
jumps back and away from the shortish delivery outside off and punches it into the covers.
a gentle block to start the day
strays just close enough to the stumps that Watling gets low and paddle sweeps it away
good stride forward to present the straight bat to a length ball outside off
"'oh wow, that's close' says Bairstow behind the stumps, hoping to throw Nicholls off his game, which has really been avoiding balls outside off, like this one"
strides out to meet a tossed up ball on and around off stump
"lands it full, and outside off, scouring high and low for the outside edge. Watling hides his far too well"
"short and outside off, doesn't care for it"
blocks a fullish delivery outside off
"good leave from Watling, stomping that front foot across to protect his sticks in case of inswing"
"it's wide, and so it doesn't exist. Well, for all intents and purposes anyway"
"forces the bowler to come at him, and with the ball on middle stump, Watling looms tall over it"
"back of a length and outside off from England's spearhead, running in from round the wicket. Nicholls shoulders arms"
"searches for swing - with the length right up there - and he does fin some, shaping away from the left-hander. Nicholls shows pristine judgment in avoiding trouble"
"<b>that's fifty</b>! A very accomplished innings from a man doing his very hardest to establish himself as a first-choice Test cricketer. He has frustrated England, rarely baited outside off, and so when the bowler strays too close to the body, like this time, he flicks it off his hips through midwicket"
"a shade short of a good length, and outside off. Nicholls' bat goes up skyward"
"full on middle, keeps it out"
"<b>run-out chance</b> and if Woakes hits at the strikers' end Watling would have been gone! Ooooh, the innings began with a single much like this. If that had been on the off side, this time a left-hander pokes to midwicket and makes the ill-advised decision to sprint. Signs, perhaps, that New Zealand are desperate for some quick runs before the weather sours."
impressive judgment outside the off stump again as Jerusalem echoes in the ground.
plenty wide enough for Nicholls to leave it well alone
"a smidge of movement - through the air - but Broad's line is yet to threaten the stumps, or get the batsmen to play"
"<b>that's better</b>! Delightfully pitched up on and around the off stump, and a less careful person might have been driving on the up. Nicholls, however, withholds fire"
"shoves the bat skyward - and it's bright and blue there, thankfully - as Broad keeps hanging it outside off"
"excellent leave again from Nicholls. He considers the ball which is fullish on a fifth stump line, moves across to protect his castle and then shoulders arms"
"good length, angling in towards off stump, but not sharply enough to draw Watling into playing"
"<b>teaser</b>! And it's a serious one too. Pitching in the 4 m area, demanding Watling to come forward, but he knows it is still just enough outside off to leave alone"
"pulls his length back and Watling defends from the crease, stoutly"
"brings out the drive to a full delivery, but it skews more off the inside half of the bat, back down the ground"
<b>squares him up</b> with that trademark movement away after a steep angle in. Watling does well to play with soft hands
"good length, outside off, Watling lets it go. So, no heave ho cricket just yet from New Zealand."
forces the bowler to stray on his pads and finds a single through square leg
"fullish on off stump, Watling knocks it down"
"gets some nip into the right-hander, who meets it under his eyes and plonks it into the leg side"
floats it up and Watling drills it down towards mid-on
extremely wide and Watling's perfectly happy to indulge in a little sight-seeing
"targets the top of off stump, but Watling and his straight bat are quite vigitant"
"good length, outside off, and so it doesn't exist for Nicholls"
leaps up to get on top of a shortish delivery on off stump and punches to cover
"flirts with a back of a length delivery, pushing away from the body. But Nicholls does hear the alarms in his head and checks the shot to gully"
"very full and very wide, Nicholls continues starving himself"
slaps it through to the point boundary! This is a shot four days in the making. He has been ever so cautious around the off stump. But this is the straw that breaks the camel's back
"good length, nibbling away from the bat. Nicholls is tempted, that bat twitches in his hand, as if he wants to thrust it out at the ball. But his survival instincts kick in and he holds fire. Anderson spots it all and has a couple of words"
"belts it down the ground! And with class too. A straight-bat push past the non-striker, with enough timing to hit the long-on boundary. Fast bowlers live for that."
"shortish and around the off stump, chops it towards point"
"shapes in, sharply, towards middle and leg, and Watling defuses the ball behind square leg"
"excellent judgment outside off again, especially with Broad running in from around the wicket. The angle does not tempt Nicholls into a shot he needn't play"
that's about a pincode too wide with Nicholls in this mood
"a hint of movement off the pitch, but when he lands it near the one-day wide line, it posts no threat"
"<b>beats him</b> in typical Anderson fashion, the angle of the back of a length ball threatening off stump, then the seam taking it past the edge of a batsman searching for it"
holds firm behind the shortish delivery on off stump
"hits the deck, keeping it outside off, Watling doesn't bother with it"
brings the stumps into play and Watling has to show perfect defensive technique to survive
"<b>strikes the pad</b> as Watling attempts to flick through midwicket. But Anderson, and his staple delivery, the one that straightens off the angle, is fairly tough to deal with. Even now."
"full and outside off, no shot."
"pitches it up, but it's still too wide outside off to bring Nicholls' bat into play"
"cracks it to point - oh, he's missed out. The length is there for the cut, and the line's always been there, with Broad still to get his radar right"
pristine on-drive! And it only requires the straight bat coming down to punish the half-volley on middle. Top quality batting
"short and outside off, Nicholls extends his vigil"
"<b>beats him</b>, although he only has himself to blame, not moving his feet, but pushing his hands at a ball rearing away off the seam"
"<b>sharp bouncer</b>! That's Broad at his menacing best, the ball kissing the surface and erupting, the batsman beaten for pace as he tries a hook, hoping to drag it from his left shoulder, looking terribly worse for wear. Good stuff."
"goes full does Anderson, in a channel outside off. Watling gets forward and defends"
"some more swing. 130 kph, full and swinging away further, Watling plays the line and is beaten easily on the outside edge"
"full again, 134 kph, around off, defended back"
"<strong>just short of point!</strong> Invites the drives does Anderson with a full length, the ball pitches and moves away, skews off the outside half and almost carries to Stoneman."
"dabbed towards gully. Fullish length outside off, opens the bat face and guides the ball to gully."
"maiden! 132 kph, typical Anderson, very tidy around off stump. Watling defends"
"angling the ball away, on a length and moving away. Left alone."
"good length delivery moving away, Nicholls plays the line and allows himself to be beaten."
"too wide this time, full and moving away further, an easy leave"
"excellent channel, fourth-stump line. Looking to bring the ball back after taking three deliveries away. Nicholls leaves again, but he'd have been in danger had the ball swung back"
"closer to off this time, but Nicholls' judgement is impeccable. Almost bounces over off stump, but he leaves again."
"another maiden, 137 kph, full and moving away, left alone again."
"excellent again. A full delivery around off, played towards square leg. The short mid-on fielder is quick on it. Anderson applauds the effort. He wants to bowl at Watling"
"looking for the lbw but it pings off the middle of the bat. Full and straight, swinging in, worked towards midwicket for a couple."
"and again! The exact same ball, the same shot and the same result. On the pads and clipped away through midwicket."
"through gully and four. That's the result Anderson wanted, a drive from Watling. Good length, moving away, a thick outside edge flies away. <b>NZ's lead is now over 200</b>"
"back of a length outside off, 133 kph, played to point"
"<strong>off the boot and then into the face of Anderson</strong>. Overpitched outside off, Watling leans into a drive, right back at Anderson, who sticks out his left shoe, the ball ricochets into his shoulder and face."
drifts on the pads and Nicholls helps himself to a run through square leg
"good length delivery in that channel around off, defended into the leg side"
"excellent line, close to off, full and coming back in slightly. Watling lets the ball come to him before defending."
"pushed wide outside off. 135 kph, left alone"
"on a length around middle and leg, blocked."
"<strong>edged and gone!</strong> The wider one, the widest one of the over. And Watling nicks behind. Watling sees an opportunity to score as Broad errs, or at least he thinks he does. To be fair, it was there to drive. The ball may have just bounced extra and moved away a touch, which meant he wasn't in control of the shot. A thin edge."
"good length, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"walks across, makes a good delivery into a leg-side-ish delivery, nudged down to fine leg."
"good length outside off, left alone"
"full and wide this time, still no stroke."
"131 kph, another wider delivery that does not elicit a stroke. Calm now, no storm yet."
"four good leaves from CdG. Full and wide, moving away, left alone"
"full on middle and leg, 133 kph, worked through wide mid-on for one. Nicely played into that region"
"a full delivery outside off, 132 kph, defended into the leg side"
"136 kph, overly full but still a defensive block to mid-on."
"full outside off, another leave. Very unusual, the last 12 hours have been very unusual."
"a nice change in length, the bouncer on middle and leg, de Grandhomme thinks of pulling but bails out."
"full and wide outside off, 133 kph. The return of the normal. Full and wide and de Grandhomme says not this time, mate with a spanking drive through cover."
"good length down leg, worked through deep square leg."
"131 kph, good length outside off, punched to cover from the back foot"
"132 kph, full outside off, the ball moving away, driven to cover"
he picks the length early does de Grandhomme and goes boom! Way over square leg for six. Sensational hit. Just a short-arm pull
"good comeback from Woakes, in a channel outside off, left alone"
"full and wide outside off, the ball moving away, left alone."
"a full delivery outside off, defended into the off side"
"full and moving away late. Very late on the drive, looked like he wanted to leave but playing was an afterthought. The ball creeps under the bat"
"<strong>beats the bat this time</strong>. More seam movement. Full on off, the ball pitches and moves away to beat the bat"
"and again. Some applause from the crowd. Overton stands and stares. Full outside off, moving away late and beats the bat"
"130 kph, short around middle, pulled through square leg for a couple. Picks the length early"
"133 kph, good stop from mid-off. Overpitched outside off, driven away towards mid-off, who dives to his left to save four."
"edged and four. A defensive stroke, takes the outside edge and flies through gully for four. Didn't spar, let the ball come to him."
"137 kph, full outside off, leans into a drive to mid-off"
"toooo gooood! Yummy from CdG! All that was was a punchy push. Overpitched around middle, CdG drives the ball right back, full face, through mid-on"
"full outside off, a lovely, languid drives to mid-off"
"133 kph, <strong>a massive appeal from England</strong>. Pad or bat? Umpire Oxenford doesn't entertain the appeal, and England have no reviews. A full delivery seams back in, misses the inside edge (or does it?), clips the pad and then through to the keeper. A botch on HotSpot on the inside edge. Not out lbw because it was outside the line. Think that's a reprieve for CdG, England have themselves to blame."
played into the leg side.
"that's too full and four easy runs for Nicholls. Overpitched around off, Nicholls drives straight, right back from where it came, to mid-off"
"a length delivery around middle and leg, the ball comes back in, hits the inside edge and then into the body"
"past midwicket, four more. New Zealand are pressing on now. Back of a length outside off, Nicholls goes pulling, gets enough bat to beat the midwicket fielder."
"back of a length around off, 134 kph, pushed back"
"a full delivery around off, driven back to the bowler with the full face"
"on a length outside off, 136 kph, left alone outside off"
"good length outside off, 133 kph, left alone"
"overpitched outside off, another leave"

"on middle and off, 132 kph, worked to deep square leg for one"
"dug in short, back of a length outside off, left alone"
"another short delivery, back of a length, Nicholls drops the hands, watches it and sways slightly. The ball hits the body and through to Bairstow."
"an off drive just about as deflating as any for a fast bowler to watch. Strong stride forward, straight bat in play"
keeps to his crease against a good length ball on off stump and turns it through midwicket
dabs it off his thighs down to long leg
"bouncer, and it's picked early. Indeed, it's dug in so short de Grandhomme barely even has to duck"
"soon as its pitched up, he drills it down the ground, to the right of mid-on"
"swivels on the back foot to pull, and gloves it down to the long leg boundary. Just a smidge too close to the body for the stroke to work properly but Nicholls wouldn't mind. He's 80 not out now"
presents the full face to a half-volley on off stump. Mid-on comes in handy
"another straight drive, this time to mid-off"
belts it  through extra cover. That's basic bullying! Picks on the half-volley and abuses it until it cries and runs away to the boundary to hide from big bad de Grandhomme
"nice and tight on middle, de Grandhomme blocks it out"
"half an appeal for lbw, mostly from behind the stumps, but umpire Oxenford shakes his head again. Nice nip in off the deck from Woakes, having drawn the batsman forward. But de Grandhomme is outside the line of off stump"
"carves it behind point! Oh this is delicious. He just waits those extra few milliseconds, poised on the back foot, that backlift high and ready to punish the ball. What a cut shot."
"short on middle and leg, Nicholls pulls it to square leg for a quick single"
"teaser outside off, de Grandhomme doesn't bite"
drives on the up but finds mid-off
"skews out the hand as he tries a knuckle ball, and umpire Reiffel penalises him for straying too far outside off"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"cuts in off a good length, but not quite enough that de Grandhomme is drawn into playing"
"caught behind! Brilliant take from Bairstow, leaping up and taking it over his head, with the batsman going for a big old pull shot. Keepers wouldn't be expecting a top edge to come to them virtually the same way as an outside edge - in that the ball does not soar straight up. Decent cameo from de Grandhomme though. He had to throw his bat around to get some quick runs but this back of a length ball wasn't quite wide enough to attempt such a stroke"
"length, wide outside off, no shot"
"full and outside off, doesn't take the bait"
stands up tall and punches a back of a length delivery to cover
knocks it down into the covers and pinches a quick single. Good stuff from Astle
zips through past the static left-hander outside off
pitches it a little further up to see if Nicholls wants to bash it through the covers. Nothin doin
lunges forward to push a fuller delivery to mid-off
"good save from Root, moving quickly to his left at short cover and diving to stop a slice off the open face of the bat"
"nice swing into the right-hander, and Astle does well to keep it out"
"more inswing from Overton, and Astle does well to keep bat close to pad and pushes to mid-on"
"gets forward to block and gets an inside edge onto pad. Nearly 40 overs old, this pink ball, but its still moving around"
leans into a firm push to the left of mid-off.
"rock-solid defence from Astle, with a nice stride forward into the pitched up delivery outside off"
goes wide of the crease for a full delivery that is sent right back at him
off the bottom of the bat as he drives on the up to short cover
bouncer - just to keep Astle from pressing too far forward - and the batsman has no choice but to duck
stands tall and crunches the back of a length delivery to Root at short cover
"width on offer and Astle tries to dab it down to third man. But with Stokes at gully, that's a bit harder than usual"
has to keep the bat face straight with Overton's angle going across him. And a bit of seam movement away doesn't help either
"slashes a length ball, but it goes straight to short point. England are doing well to stall Nicholls' push to a hundred, and delay New Zealand's declaration"
walks across his stumps to drag a short ball from outside off out to deep midwicket
"short and wide, hammers it behind point - and it races to the boundary, despite England's best efforts to pack that side of the field. Poor ball from Overton, deserves punishment"
chops a back of a length delivery to point
"good length on middle and leg, nudges to mid-on"
"back of a length and outside off, knocks it towards point"
"the horizontal bat comes down at an angle, the feet going nowhere, and so a shortish delivery angled into body gets an inside edge"
gets up off his toes to blunt a short ball on middle and off stump towards midwicket. Soft hands gets him a single
"opens the face as he unleashes a square drive, placing it well behind point"
shifts wide of the crease to get the ball to straighten on middle and off stump. Astle keeps it out
"squirts the full and wide delivery to the backward point boundary, not perfectly timed, but the runs are pretty useful in any case. New Zealand's lead moving healthily towards 300"
"full and outside off, spears it to sweeper cover"
shortish and sliding down leg. Astle can't get the leg glance away
"nearly a yorker outside off, Astle taps it to mid-off"

"spears it into the pads, hits the target and belts out an appeal. But the umpire rightly says it would be going down"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"tosses it up outside off, blocks"
nice stride forward on off stump to get to the pitch of the ball and block it
"top edge, but the sweep lands safely at vacant deep square leg. Woakes runs around to his left from long leg to stop the ball trickling away to the boundary"
"full and outside off, defends well"
"full on off stump, keeps it out"
smothers any turn on offer with a good front foot block
just enough shape away from the left-hander - in the air - Nicholls' straight bat is on call
"looks to swing it away over midwicket, but he can't get around his front pad in time to meet the half-volley"
whips it through midwicket - ain't gonna miss out twice. Broad gives the left-hander a second chance to show off his leg side play and Nicholls accepts it gleefully. He's six short of a very well deserved hundred
"<b>Broad pings Nicholls with a throw</b> after the ball is bashed down the ground, right at him as a little bit of frustration boils over. The batsman was clearly not looking for a run, and in light of that, Broad does go up to him to apologise"
leans into the drive with the ball full and outside off. Finds mid-off
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"a gentle little lap sweep, as he plants his front leg outside off to prevent lbw, and then redirects the length ball outside off to its new home at long leg"
"full and outside off, gets forward to smother it"
pushes a full delivery down to mid-on
turns a ball heading down leg to short fine leg
"shimmies down to nudge the flat, straight delivery through square leg"
"shifts back to a slow, good length ball, and knocks it down by his feet"
"he's trying to leave the ball, swaying away from its line as it targets his chest, but the bat is sticking up and it pings off the edge and runs up and over the wicketkeeper"
"chops on as Astle tries an on the up drive, with no footwork. And if only to remind him he needs to do better, a good length ball outside off pings off the inside edge, onto his leg and then onto his stumps"
"starts with a bouncer, at 137 kph, rising up past Southee's chest as he does well to drop his wrists and stay out of the way"
"another bouncer, and this time Southee, even as he sways away, has his hands up near his chest, just where Broad wants them, for a little glove to the keeper"
"forces him back into his crease again, this time Southee is able to put bat to ball and guide it towards cover point"
blocks it to mid-on
gets forward to block a full delivery from around the stumps
"nice drift into middle and off, Nicholls keeps it out"
does he have it? Races down the pitch to launch a ball on leg stump down to the long-on boundary. But we need confirmation from the third umpire to see if this is truly six. Nope. Falls inches short
"good length, outside off, leaves it alone"
"cuts it backward of point to bring up a <b>second Test hundred</b> and Eden Park rises in salute! It's a brilliant effort, and the standout feature was his judgment outside off stump. Even against Anderson and Broad who hunt the outside edge relentlessly. Compared to that, this short ball outside off is a treat."
blocks it from the crease
"bangs it in short, on and around off stump. Southee sways away"
there's the fuller delivery - but Southee is deep in his crease and isn't quite ready for it. Pops it out back to the bowler instead
"full and outside off, pushes it to mid-off"
"bouncer again, right over middle, Southee refuses to play"
"back of a length on off stump, pokes it out to cover"
"fullish, outisde off, knocks it down, and <b>that is tea</b>"

"another cutter, 118 kph, slow and wide, carved to third man for one"
"swing! 125 kph, full delivery outside off, the ball pitches and moves past the outside edge. Southee is not close."
"good length around off, 128 kph, blocked back"
"oh yes. Overpitched around off, Southee smashes the ball back, full face, driven on the up through mid-on. <strong>NZ's 350</strong>"
"on a length around off, the ball moves away, off the leading edge to cover"
"<strong>out with a direct hit</strong>. A full delivery outside off, pushed to mid-off. Nicholls calls yes immediately. Stokes runs in, picks up with his left hand and hurls the throw under-arm but misses at the bowler's end."
"good length on middle and leg, 132 kph, inside-edged to square leg."
"on middle and leg, 132 kph, worked to midwicket"
"good length on off, 123 kph, defended to mid-off"
"on a length on middle and off, the ball skews off the outside half to point"
blocked back with the full face
"dug in short on middle, Southee misses a pull"
"back of a length outside off, 128 kph, carved to point"
"looks for the yorker, the ball drifts down leg. Southee misses a flick, struck on the pad."

"overly full again, on off, punched back to the bowler, who parries the ball to short mid-off"
"short and wide, carved past cover for a run."
"good length delivery outside off, left alone"
"looking for the yorker, swings back in on off, smothered back"

"drops short, on middle and leg, 134 kph, pulled to square leg"
"a nice change in length, short around off, Southee sways away"
"full and wide outside off, under-edged to point, looking to freely drive into the off side"

"on middle and leg, flipped away over midwicket for a couple"
"a short delivery around off, Southee looks to pull but can't lay bat on that"
"over midwicket again, three more. On the pads and Southee picks the gap perfectly with a neat chip"
"dug in, aiming for the hips. Pulled away in the air towards deep square leg. Overton runs to his right, dives but can't quite get there. <b>Would have been a one-handed stunner</b>"
"dug in, short down leg, worked towards midwicket"
"lovely straight drive again from Nicholls. Too full from Broad, around off, Nicholls drills it right back, full face, through mid-off"
"driven towards cover for one. Malan runs to his left, but fails to pick up cleanly"
"dug in short, Southee cannot reach his pull. It's too high and too quick"
"another short one, down leg. Southee sways away from his pull"
"very full outside off, driven to deep cover for one"
"good length around off, 132 kph, shovelled to wide mid-on for a single"

"a low full toss outside off, driven to mid-off for a run"
"a slower ball outside off, scythed away to deep cover for one"

"full and wide, chopped into the surface and over the bowler to long-off for one"
"slow down leg, 87 kph, worked to short fine leg"
"86 kph, flat down leg, Southee misses a sweep. Way down the leg side. As negative as you'd find. The keeper somehow stops it"
"flat down leg, nudged to square leg"
"88 kph, flat down leg, Southee misses a sweep, struck on the pad. Pitched outside, sliding down, not hitting the stumps."
"beautiful Test cricket this. Kidding. A full, wide delivery outside off, Nicholls stays low and paddle sweeps a fast bowler to the fine leg boundary."
"a slower ball outside off, 116 kph, pulled to deep square leg for a run"
"a slower delivery on middle and leg, 117 kph, tapped towards point for one."
"<strong>straight to second slip! If he was there</strong>! They had been working incessantly for 120 overs to get Nicholls out like that, but when they don't want to play for that, a thick outside edge flies to the third man boundary with no slips."
"a short delivery on middle and leg, Nicholls can't connect with a pull. Struck on the body."
"a high full toss outside off, Nicholls slashes this through backward point for four. Three fours in the over. <strong>NZ have 400</strong>"
"wow, a slow delivery on the pads in Auckland and Southee works the ball diligently to square leg. What's going on in cricket?"
"89 kph, short and wide, carved to point"
"very slow and very wide outside off, smashed to long-off for one"
"86 kph, Southee backs away, looking for a massive heave but all he gets is an inside edge into the pad, and then past the keeper for one"
"flat and wide outside off, goes through to the keeper"
"a low full toss, fast and quick, pushed to the bowler"
"very quick on leg, Southee misses a flick. Big appeal by Bairstow, sliding easily down"
"flight on middle and off, pushed towards point for one"
"<strong>is he gone?</strong> Bairstow seems to think so. Flat and wide, hit away to cover. Southee took a while to respond, but doesn't matter because he's just made it. Or wait, has he? The stumps light up when Southee's bat is on the crease, was it a direct hit? Did Bairstow's gloves make contact with the stumps? Was it all at the same instance? Too much doubt and the benefit goes to the batsman."
"88 kph, on the pads, worked to midwicket"
runs down and works to long-on for one
"goes through! Was there bat? Yes. Flat outside off, just a bit of bat through the legs of the keeper as he tries to reverse sweep."
"leading edge back to the bowler! Flight down leg, Southee looks to work the ball into the leg side, but gets a leading edge back to the bowler. A tame, lame dismissal."
"full and outside off, flashes outside off, misses."
"launches it over long-on. The slightest sign of flight and Wagner tales full toll, inching forward, keeping the front leg away from that clean swing of the ball"
"full and outside off, carves it to deep point"
smacks a full and wide delivery through the covers
"doles out a reverse sweep, but Root spears in a quicker delivery, very nearly at the blockhole, to beat him"
"tosses it up on middle and leg, defends"
"goes for a sweep, doesn't quite connect"
backs away to cut a ball off the stumps to point
shifts back to a flatter delivery on middle and knocks it to long-on
"full and outside off, heaves it to deep midwicket, and secures <b>his highest first-class score</b>"
nudges it through square leg
"<b>beats him first up</b>! Cook is a bit stuck in the crease. If anything, he is pushing back on leg stump, when the back of a length ball jags away off the pitch and past his bat"
<b>keeps low</b>! A short ball pitching outside off sneaks below the bottom edge and through to the keeper
gets in line with this one searching for the top of off stump
"shortish and outside off, leaves it alone"
"full on off stump, thrusts his hands, and a straight bat, down on it"
"shortish on off stump, knocks it down"
"slants it across the left-hander, who judges it to be wide enough outside off not to play"
"leaps back and across, trying to work through midwicket. But he ends up with sort of a leading edge down the pitch, soft hands ensuring it doesn't pop up"
"pitches it up, outside off, in search of a drive. Stoneman avoids the temptation"
"good work from the captain at gully, diving to his left and stopping an outside edge from racing off to the third man boundary"
"a short-arm pull! And it races to the long-on boundary! That's the anti-thesis of the first innings, the opening batsman bullying the seam bowler when he tries pitching short and outside off"
"he's drawn into thinking about playing the back of a length delivery moving across him, but at the last second, bails out"
concentrates on playing the ball late - which he should - and trusts his hands to adjust to the ball when it keeps its line. Good technique from Cook as he nudges it to midwicket
"when the line is at the top of off stump though, with the threat of outswing, Cook is caught in no-man's land. His feet are on leg stump. His hands are reaching for the ball. And they find it, this time"
"fullish on off stump, keeps it out"
that's the Cook special - carving a short and wide delivery through backward point.
"caught down leg! He has scored millions of runs with this shot, the dink behind square leg. He's played em even when he hasn't known where his next run would come from. Perhaps that's why he's searching for the ball - and it's a half-volley a foot away from middle. The kind that would've made Boult grin with embarrassment, not delight as the edge is taken"
"his pace is up - 139 kph - as he hits back of a length on leg stump. Root shapes to glance it down leg, but doesn't connect"
"leaps across, thrusting a closed face at an away seamer - the Southee special - but the leading edge zips through point"
firmly behind the back of a length delivery on off stump
keeps low as Root does well to force a straight bat down in line with off stump
"top-edge, which sails away to the long leg boundary. Root with a lucky pull shot as the bouncer keeps coming for his head, cramping him, making him uncomfortable"
blocks a shortish delivery outside off towards point
"offers him width and Root gets away with a stunning cover drive. Lovely flourish of the bat. Big player, the England captain. Needs to stand up, especially at No. 3"
"short of a length, angling across the right-hander. Root shoulders arms"
lets go a back of a length delivery outside off
"nice and full on off stump, Root strokes it down the ground and mid-off runs across to his right to stop it"
"shifts around the wicket and <b>beats him</b>! Root is surprised by the movement, for it starts only after the ball hits the deck. Then it snarls in at the right-hander and goes through a straight bat and pad"
"good length ball on and around off stump, leaves it"
"<b>low bounce</b> and Root stares forlornly at the pitch. One second he's all set to blunt a back of a length ball outside off. The next, it dips below his bat"
"full on off stump, defends"
looks for the cover drive. Looks high and low. Under rocks and stones and down secret passage ways. But it's nowhere to be found. Not against a splendid inswinger from Southee that bares its claws so very very late
"pitches it up again, on off stump, Stoneman blocks through cover"
<b>past the edge</b> as he draws Root forward with a block and does him with seam movement away
"shortish and outside off, wide enough that Root doesn't need to think about it"
"squares him up by going wide of the crease - but the length - the way he is able to consistently make the ball kiss off the 4m mark and dart away from the right-hander is utterly brilliant. Root too does very very well, playing it with soft hands"
"sharp bouncer, which Stoneman does extremely well to avoid. Then it soars over the keeper as well, all the way to the boundary"
has to jump off his feet to deal with a pretty pacy delivery on and around off stump
the front foot hits the pitch <i>after</i> the good length ball has pinged off the outside half of the bat towards cover
inches forward to push a full delivery on middle to mid-on
"bangs it in again, giving away width. Stoneman hopes to loft it over point. No luck"
forces him back but Stoneman does well to punch it through the covers and scamper back to his captain's call of two
"shortish and a shade outside off, punches to cover"
"angling into the right-hander, Root clips it to square leg"
"works it off his pads behind square leg and secures a couple again. This is how he gets in gear, exploiting little gaps in the field even if he can't get boundaries"
"again, too straight, and Root deflects it behind square leg. Good batting. Just putting the deficit aside, the bowler's reputation aside, and playing what is coming down"
"full and wide outside off, Stoneman's lets it go. That front foot is starting to venture out of the crease as well. This could be huge for England."
"<b>outrageous bowling!</B> It's too good even to nick, but Stoneman tries his hardest. He sees the ball starting on leg stump, then it swings exquisitely, then seams after pitching. All of that is just too much to handle and the left-hander pokes outside the off stump, with hope more than conviction"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"sweet leave. Root covers his stumps, puts that front foot down the line and then leaves outside the eyeline."
goes around the stumps for a shortish delivery outside off. No shot
gets up nice and tall to crunch the shortish delivery to point.
"over the wicket for a good length ball on middle stump. Root is resolutely behind it. The mood looks ever so similar to the day-night Test in Adelaide, when it was Root holding England up by the bootstraps"
"full on middle and leg, he clips it to short midwicket"
"good length, slanting across the left-hander. Stoneman shoulders arms"
"full and outside off, lets it go again"
wide of the crease to delivery basically a yorker outside off. Stoneman is nowhere near interested
"<b>how is that</b>! Off stump is visible as the ball zips past the leading edge to the keeper. That's how squared up Stoneman is as he gets a jaffa, pitching on leg and darting away"
guides it to point
beautiful batting - moves back and across to get right on top of a good length ball on middle and whips it to midwicket
"good length, on and around off stump, guides it to gully"
"full and outside off, won't be chasing that"
"drives sweetly through extra cover, with Raval putting in a dive to keep it to a single"
"skews past gully! Root looks for the drive, because a ball coming out at 120 kph, being so wide of off stump, is just too tempting. Only just manages to get it in the gap"
full on off stump - inswing taking it there - Root blocks
"lovely, firm sound of bat hitting ball. Root is holding court in Auckland"
"back of a length and outside off, leaves it alone"
"pulls the short ball through midwicket, and there's enough timing there to carry it almost all the way to the boundary. Raval is the man running across from long leg. And while he is pulling off his sliding save, he keeps the ball in his hand, as opposed to swatting it away, and that's when his feet hits the boundary boards."
<b>half an appeal for lbw</b> as Stoneman shuffles a good deal across his stumps. But this has pitched outside leg
"full on leg stump, nudges it to mid-on"
"spears it down the ground! Good shot from Stoneman, taking on the full delivery from around the wicket and trusting his timing to do the job"
"full and outside off, leaves it"
"full and wide, angling away, left alone, too wide to draw a stroke"
"full outside off, defended away to mid-off from the crease"
"good length outside off, 128 kph, played to cover"
overpitched outside off but Root lets this one go
"full delivery, 132 kph, moving back in, played into the leg side. No swing so far this session"
"<strong>creeps underneath the bat!</strong> Full outside off, Root stays back, the ball doesn't bounce as much, goes under"
"full and moving away, left alone again"
"full and wide, moving away, a sliced drive makes its way to point"
"131 kph, very full, quite wide again, left alone"
on the pads and worked away through square leg for a couple. Stoneman was waiting for that
"133 kph, full and wide outside off, Stoneman looks to drive, but struggles for timing, hits to mid-off"
"<strong>edged to the keeper, on the bounce</strong>. A fullish delivery in the channel outside off, edged away, a tentative stroke"
"full outside off, 133 kph, blocked towards cover for one. Wide open expanses"
"135 kph, a full delivery on the pads, beats Stoneman for pace. Beaten on the inside edge, but sliding well down"
"137 kph, nicely played. Back of a length outside off, punched past point for three. Just a tap into the gap"
"that's fine placement. A tad wide, Root opens the bat face and carves the ball through gully for four. Lets the ball come onto him before gliding."
"goes short outside off, left alone"
"on a length, straying down leg, worked into the leg side"
"a full delivery outside off, no swing, left alone"
"a full delivery seams away, but this is a good leave. No need to play that, so arms are shouldered."
"a full delivery around off, blocked into the off side"
"strays on the pads does Southee, but Stoneman picks out midwicket off the flick"
"mid-on runs around to mid-off to cut the ball off. A full delivery outside off, mis-timed into the off side as he's driving."
"nice and full around off, Root, this time, right behind the line"
"good length around off, carved to point from the crease"
four more! Goes on the pads and Stoneman works the ball down to the fine leg fence with a deft glance
"135 kph, on the pads, Stoneman this time misses a flick. Struck on the thigh pad"

"good length and wide outside off, left alone"
"134 kph, close to off, nice and full, right behind the line is Root"

"on a length on middle and leg, pushed to mid-on"
"full and wide, the ball moving away, left alone"
"a full delivery outside off, 121 kph, blocked to mid-off. This is what England would have been dreaming of on day 1."
"good length outside off, an open-faced dab through backward point for a couple. Rather easy here."
"<strong>inside-edged onto the pad</strong>! 123 kph, seam movement! Nips back in, takes the inside edge and lobs towards square leg. Big appeal, clear inside edge"
"drifts on the pads, too easy for Stoneman to turn the ball down to fine leg for a couple"
"good length outside off, left alone"
"drifts onto the pads, nudged down to fine leg for one more"
"full and wide, no movement, left alone"
"that's well bowled, 132 kph, full and straight. Stoneman drives to mid-off, who dives to his left and saves runs."
"good length, wide outside off, carved to backward point. Nicholls dives to his left to save three."
"attacking the stumps, full and straight, a nudge to midwicket"

"full and wide, 125 kph, dabbed to gully"
"full on the pads, worked to square leg"
"overly full outside off, defended with head over the ball, eyes are right on it."
too straight and clipped away through square leg for two more.
"short and wide, Root sees it as a run-scoring opportunity. Extra bounce takes the ball over the bat."
"well bowled, full around off, the ball coming back in, defended neatly"
"that's a nice over from Wagner. Full and straight, Root is behind the line ably enough"
"nicely bowled, on a length at 123 kph, squirted into the off side to point"
"right through the legs! A full delivery on leg, pushed to mid-on. He jammed a knee into the outfield and lost his balance, the ball found a big gap between the legs"
"short and wide outside off, Stoneman looks to cut, no connection as the ball passes bat."
"quite full outside off, left alone"
"full and wide outside off, a bit of seam movement, left alone as the ball angles away"

"126 kph, overly full outside off, driven to mid-off"

"<strong>Wagner's first short delivery of the Test!</strong> A bouncer on off, Root is easily underneath"
"another short one, this time wider outside off. Root sways away from the line"
"a good short one, on the ribs, worked to midwicket for one"
"another good bouncer, on middle and off. Stoneman hurries underneath"
"nicely bowled. 138 kph, a short one that doesn't rise up much. Stoneman awkwardly plays into the leg side and completes a run"
"nice and short around off, right behind the line. Not short enough, nor is it quick enough to trouble Root."
"122 kph, CdG strays on the pads and Stoneman helps himself to one with a clip to deep square leg"
"overpitched outside off, defended to mid-off"
"124 kph, full outside off, Root gets forward and pushes the ball in front of point for a run"
"full and straight, 125 kph, pushed to mid-off"
"on middle and leg, the ball moves back in, off the leading edge towards cover"
"excellent end. Full in the channel just outside off, Stoneman lets that one go"
the field doesn't fool Root as he reacts near perfectly to a good length ball outside off - in that he doesn't play it
"<B>outstanding shot</b>! This is a bouncer, angling across the right-hander, but Root sways away and swats it on top of the bounce to the point boundary. Well, almost, until de Grandhomme intervenes"
forces the fuller delivery into the covers and rushes across to the other end
"goes short, but it doesn't quite rise up high enough to trouble Root, who deftly puts it down at long leg"
"wanders across outside off and pulls the short ball, if a little awkwardly, down to long leg"
"bouncer, right over middle stump, Root slinks under it and flashes that old Cheshire grin that enraged Mitchell Johnson all that time ago."
"<b>inswing</b> which should please New Zealand, even if it is only gentle, and Stoneman has it well covered"
gets forward to drive the half-volley to mid-off. Would've hit it a little harder if not for the threat of sideways movement
<b>beats him</b> with a short ball as Stoneman seems a touch late on the pull. Good stuff from de Grandhomme. Always thinks like a frontline bowler
"back of a length and outside off, chops it over to gully"
"moves around the wicket for pretty much a wide yorker, which Stoneman slots through cover point"
"gets it to straighten just a touch, but Root is well in control, playing late and opening the face"
"pulls, yanking that front leg up to have the room to let the arms flow through the shot. Finds a couple at long leg"
"keeps going short, but it doesn't get up and Stoneman spirits it away to the long leg boundary. Good pull shot, rolling the wrists to keep the ball down"
"<b>fifty</b>! And it's a punchy little innings. Gets the landmark with a top-edged pull, the line of this bouncer, and its height, coming up to his head placing him in some strife. But the fact is, he's hung in there with his captain"
"<b>caught at long leg!</b>. Wagner's the man! As he's so often been for New Zealand. Shifts around the wicket for a big ol bouncer, and it rises up around the left-hander's throat and tries as he might to get inside the line and power it away, the bounce is just a smidge too much for him to properly keep it down. Boult is the man tracking the ball, running forward and to his right. Takes it right in front of his face in a manner that suggest he might not have seen the ball all that well. Chuffed that he's caught it though."
"another bouncer from around the stumps, at 138 kph. Malan avoids it"
"short, short and nasty. Malan lines it up well though and just ducks, as he should be doing."
"good length ball outside off, Root steadfastly ignores it"
"belting straight drive! There's been a few good 'uns in this game and this fits in just nicely, taken on the up and simply caressed down the ground"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
gets forward to block a shade outside off
sweetly timed as he stands tall against the shortish ball coming into him and flicks to long leg
"<B>beats him</b> simply by landing the ball in the corridor. There isn't too much sideways movement but Malan's new at the crease, his feet aren't moving just yet, and he's anxious to feel bat on ball. Fishes and is lucky not to nick off"
opens the face as he stays back and guides a length delivery to point
"goes short, Root spots it early and lets it go"
"gorgeous drive, finding mid-off. Root looks a class apart, reading the length early and putting himself into the perfect positions - either on the front foot or back - to handle them"
presses forward to a good length ball on and around off stump and lets it go like a boss
covers the threat of this length ball on middle
"full and outside off, drives smoothly to mid-off"
"shortish and outside off, Malan won't chase it"
"floats it up, daring Malan into a drive. He isn't so easily moved"
"smashes it behind point! Super shot! At that pace, short isn't quite the way to go. This ball isn't necessarily giving him much room but Malan still scythes it away"
that's better. He pitches it up on a fourth stump line and Malan knows not to mess with them
"good length on off stump, blocks"
pushes forward and blocks a fuller delivery on off stump
"full on off stump, and he gets right on top it"
"a hint of tail into the right-hander, Root does well to keep his front leg away so the bat can come down in a straight line. He closes the face on impact and finds a run behind square on the leg side"
"squares him up as he pitches it up. Malan's saving grace, of course, is his using soft hands."
into the pads and Malan works it down to long leg
"the 133 kph bouncer zips through as Root drops his wrists and prepares for the next one. Oh, and lets not forget the smile. Toothy and wide."
"fuller delivery outside off, Root won't be budged"
"back of a length, angling across the left-hander, Malan shoulders arms"
"fuller and outside off, no shot"
"good length on and around off stump, Malan defends towards point"
steps forward to pat the fuller delivery on off stump past the left of short cover. He's started to move better at the crease. New Zealand need to hit him with a frontline bowler soon.
"glorious through the covers! He used to be outstanding through that region, but only off the back foot. He's since worked on that and is now a pretty complete player. And rightfully he shows off. Leaning into the drive with the ball so wide and asking for it"
"good length on off stump, defends"
"<b>so close</b>! He really isn't a one-trick pony. With that short ball forcing batsmen to hang back, he uses the sucker ball outside off so bloody well. This one decks away off the pitch too, almost off the footmarks to leave a cover-driving Malan wondering about his choice of shot"
back of a length sliding down leg
gets perfectly in line with a shortish delivery on middle
"nice and full on middle, Malan skews it out to cover"
nice and full and outside off. Malan holds fire
"full on leg stump, Malan knocks it to the right of deep square leg"
waits until the shortish delivery is right under his eyes before clipping it to midwicket
"soft hands, with the bat face opening just a touch to deal with the angle of the ball moving across him. Block to cover"
"presses forward to a fuller delivery on off stump and having firmly plonked it down, he seems to want a different bat. Something the issue with the toe end"
leans into the drive as he finds mid-off
hangs back against the shortish delivery on off stump and runs it down to point
"full and outside off, blocks into the covers and sprints through. He's batting like his team isn't 258 runs behind and this bowling attack isn't probing his technique. But they are. And it is."
"back of a length and outside off, Root judges it early and lets it go"
"conscious to bring down a straight bat, and also bring that front leg back so he could deal with the full-pitched inswinger on middle"
"searches for the outside edge with a good length ball moving across Root, who knows its threat and doesn't engage"
"bouncer, which the England captain is wise and ducks"

"<b>hits the bottom hand</b> and Root is in serious pain! Seems like the back of a length delivery kicks up, and wildly at that. Root thinks he has it covered with that straight bat but isn't prepared for the pink thing misbehaving like that. Replays show he's struck flush on the fingers."
"<b>he's gone. Boult's done it!</b> That's nasty bowling. Right after taking a blow, he's in the firing line of a sharp bouncer, angling into the body, leaving Root no room, to hide or to hook. He's trying to fend the ball away, but only ends up gloving to the wicketkeeper. <b>That's the close of play</b>"

Stokes comes charging down and defends the ball back to the bowler

easily gets out of the way of this bouncer at an off stump line

"length on leg stump, pushed to short midwicket on the up"
"full on middle stump, punched back down the pitch and it's a close call for run out at the other end. From his reaction, CDG had got a finger on this and Woakes was scrambling to get back. The ball missed the stumps though"

"short of a length and slanted across the corridor, left alone"
"good length and in at middle stump, defended on the front foot"
"short of a length outside off, tapped to extra cover on the up"
<b>chipped through mid-off</b> but that wasn't the intention. It's a length ball pushed across him and he wants to drive on the up through cover. No feet again and this pings off the high part of the bat
"good length outside off, nicely leans in to this and gets it through cover with a high albow"
"short of a length outside off, tapped to extra cover off the back foot"

"god length and in the corridor, defended on the front foot"
"good length on off stump, blocked solidly on the front foot"
<b>bouncer in the corridor</b>. Stokes fends from under it and isn't convincing at all as this pings off his bat towards gully. The lack of sticker adds to the No. 11 illusion his body position gave...
short of a length and wide outside off. Jabs at it away from the body and gets it into the covers
"short ball at leg stump, he gets inside the line and tries to tickle it fine. Can't make connection"

"short of a length slider at middle stump, inside edge onto back thigh as he defends on the back foot"
"<b>review for lbw.</b> He's struck bang in front of middle and leg stump and it's spinning towards off . He's on the front foot. The only way this can't be out is if it's pitching outside leg. There didn't seem to be bat on it. Once again, bowler wasn't too confident for a review, captain was. Here we go....yes, that has pitched outside leg. Woakes survives. That's one review lost for New Zealand"
"<b>edge zooms past Watling</b> to his left! Oh there's the false shot. A bouncer across the corridor and he looks to bludgeon it over midwicket. Because of Wagner's line and angle, the slip is wide And Watling is slightly down leg too in his stance. Can't hold onto this"
"bouncer on leg stump, walloped to deep square with the hook"
<b>nasty.</b> This lifts up sharply at Woakes left under arm and he's jumping to get out of the way
"another bouncer, Woakes has ducked preemptively. Wagner is on fire..."
"short ball at the hips, loses his shape as he stabs this into the leg side"

"good length on middle stump, blocked on the front foot"
"bouncer at the chest, thuds him on the glove as he looks to fend this away"
<b>what a ball!</b> Oh this is stunning. Goes wide of the crease and gets this to climb steeply as Stokes looks to defend in the corridor. Then he gives him the eyes - constantly as he performs a faux moonwalk. Big smile from Stokes in acknowledgement
"short ball down leg side, doesn't climb at Stokes as he much as his exaggerated shoulder drop would have you believe. It flies past his hip"

"tossed up outside off, drilled straight to cover point"
"short ball just outside off, swipes above the ball and is beaten"
"nicely placed. Short ball outside off, watches it closely and taps this in front of square with a pull"
"<b>Wagner's done it!</b> Is this the game? Oh this is such a top spell from Wagner. He's breathed life back into a sullen-looking New Zealand side. Plugs away outside off and Stokes, with three balls to go for the break, has lost his concentration after a long, very good knock. Backs away and looks to swat this bouncer over point. There are two fielders in that region - a backward point and a conventional point. Southee is stationed at the latter and he has free path to get under this after calling for it. Has to really adjust his radar because he's running backwards and looking up at the same time. Follows it with his hands, and grabs on as it sways to his right. What an absolutely under-rated bowler this guy is"

"legbreak, dropped short and spins into the pad. Looks to glance it and gets an inside edge onto pad that lobs into the off side"

"bouncer down leg side, goes after it with a hook and gets a top-edge over the fine leg boundary on the bounce"

"pushed flat outside off, leans in nicely and executes a flowing drive through the covers"
"bouncer at the front shoulder, gets out of the way"

bounce across the corridor. Thinks of the upper cut and withdraws
"<b>has he got him? Yes he has!</b> Wagner has Woakes fending. That's an unplayable bouncer. Headed straight for his face and he has no way to get out of the way. Jabs at it with his feet off the ground. Gets it on the gloves and it lobs up for short leg to take a simple catch to his right. Simply incredible from Wagner to get that sort of lift in his 12th over of the spell, break in the middle or not. He screams as he sprints away in celebration and is promptly mobbed. What an effort"

"good length at leg stump, hangs the bat out and gets this down to fine leg off the inside half"
