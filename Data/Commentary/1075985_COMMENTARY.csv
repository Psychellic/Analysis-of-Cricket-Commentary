"<b>close!</b> So close! Not out says Nigel Llong. This has thudded him on the pads right in front of off stump after cutting back in. Paine reviews. It pitches on off stump, hits and cuts in from a length. But it also appears to be one of those that has climbed steeply....<b>yes it has!</b> Wow, that is an incredible decision from Llong.

"138 kph, full and wide outside off, left alone"
"the second time he has got out like that after a sensational hundred in the series! Back of a length outside off, Markram goes back, and carves a dab to gully. Not quite in control of that shot. It was a back of a length, moving away, and he chose to dab it fine. He has been scoring with that shot right through the series, a good low catch from gully."
"he leaves an inducker and Faf leaves! Struck outside off, and the umpire Llong's decision comes even before the appeal. It was full and swinging back in prodigiously. Faf left, then saw that movement, tried to bring his bat down but his body twirled into a half-duck instead, that's how his instinct took over. He chats with AB, but no review. That looked out."

"<b>has he got him? He has</b>, according to the umpire. AB de Villiers reviews straight away. A loopy inswinger that AB has not picked at all. He's looking to belt this on the up through cover with a massive gap between bat and pad. It's a very faint edge if there is indeed one there...<b>and there is!</b> Sayers' first Test wicket is AB de Villiers. That's an indipper, seam pointing inwards that zips off a length and narrowly misses off stump on it's way to the keeper. The snicko shows a faint disturbance as it passes the bat"

"<b>beats the outside edge and off stump!</b> What a ball that is. Again, evidence of the slower ball being effective. This is 82kph from Lyon and Elgar is in two minds about the forward press.

bounce again accounts for another batsman. Did that kick up off one of the cracks? It was a length ball but gets up like a bouncer.

Does all he can to try and get out of the way but the ball nips back in to find the outside edge of the high part of the bat. Paine snaffles the catch

<b>crack!</b> Misfield. That ball fizzes across the turf after Elgar gets on the back foot and slaps it through midwicket. Lyon is on the boundary out there and the ball almost orders him to get out of the way with the fury at which it's going. His tumble is not good enough to get the stop in

tat's plumb. Wicket for Morkel in his final innings. And the glee on his face tells how much this means to him. And it's a lovely length. Fullish and curving in.

No shot offered, it appears...<b>decision upheld.</b> Khawaja says he offered a shot there, he's not happy with the decision.

"shot. But can't pierce the field. Length ball driven firmly on the up, but Faf dives to his left at mid-off to stop this"
"good length ball keeps low, but he manages to watch this closely and block on the back foot"
"tossed up at off stump, driven to mid-off"

<b>inside edge</b> as he looks to drive on the up. He's not to the pitch of this outside off. Saved by the pads
<b>outside edge</b> won't carry to gully. Another one spits off the pitch as he looks to defend on the back foot
"<b>gets him!</b> Three length balls in the corridor of different flavour. That's the genius of this man. Draws an edge off each of them and on this occasion, Paine can only manage to guide this to the keeper. Drawn forward outside off and he can't defend this rising ball"
<b>past the outside edge.</b> Lyon late on the forward defence

"<b>shoulders arms, lose off stump.</b> Very late inswing from a length outside off Cummins expects it go away and has the off stump exposed as he tries to leave. Tonk. <b>Five-wicket-haul</b>"
<b>taken at third slip!</b> Oh man. Another bowler with the prospect of a hat-trick. Syaers chases a full and wide outswinger and gets a thick edge. Straight to Elgar at third slip
"<b>blocks it!</b> Length at off stump, slight tail away. Solidly blocked in the end"
"length just outside off, defended on the front foot"
"short of a length outside off, left alone"
<b>beats the outside edge.</b> Wobbly ball slanted across the corridor on a good length

"126 kph, full and wide outside off, a good, confident leave from Lyon"
"too wide from Morne, 127 kph, not his quickest. Left alone."
"back of a length, this one seaming back in, a thick inside edge onto the pads. Trickles close to the stumps."
"128 kph, that will reduce the margin of defeat! Back of a length outside off, Lyon cuts through point for a couple."
"that will be four! 130 kph, short and wide and Lyon sees an opportunity for some international runs. Slashed away through point."
"just past the outside edge, 125 kph. A full delivery in the channel outside off, the ball just misses the outside edge! Stunning delivery."
"a full delivery, around off, 127 kph. A leaden-footed poke to cover."
"back of a length outside off, 129 kph. Hazlewood stands tall and punches the ball to mid-off"
"no man there and that will be four more. On the pads and Hazlewood tickles him fine, through fine leg."
"short of gully! Back of a length outside off, Hazlewood prods, the ball dies in front of gully."
"close to the outside edge, but does not find it. Back of a length outside off, the ball just <b>beats the edge again</b>"
"back of a length on middle, 127 kph, worked away towards midwicket"
"full and straight, 131 kph, blocked away to mid-on, full face of the bat."

"back of a length outside off, 133 kph, pushed away to mid-on"
"full and wide, eliciting a drive but the ball flies away past the edge."
"<strong>another stunner of a delivery from Morkel</strong>! Lyon nods his appreciation. A good length delivery, fourth-stump channel. The ball goes past the outside edge."
"nicely done! <strong>Australia need under 500 now.</strong> Overpitched from Philander, Hazlewood stays in his crease and lofts the ball delectably over mid-off for four."
"good length outside off, 126 kph. Blocked back to the bowler"
"full and wide outside off, 127 kph, the ball moving back in. Blocked"
"129 kph, back of a length outside off, the ball beats the bat easily. That length leaves Hazlewood poking."
"nicely behind the line again, 128 kph, full around off, blocked away"
"back of a length around off, 124 kph, a thick inside edge towards square leg. Hazlewood will take strike. Morkel will be pleased."
"full and wide, drifting away. Hazlewood drives but makes only contact with the ground as the ball flies past"
"flat outside off, defended back"
"through the inside edge, slow outside off, the ball drifts in and beats the inside edge, big gap between bat and pad"
past the outside edge this time. Flat and wide. more drift. Hazlewood pokes

"edged, but falls short of second slip! 83 kph, full and wide, the ball drifts on, takes the outside edge and lands in front of Amla."
"133 kph, a full delivery around off, Lyon drives, and it goes flying through cover for a couple."
"the yorker on middle and leg, 130 kph, jammed out by Lyon"
"full and straight, a thick outside half as Lyon drives. Point fields."
"driven away with terrible timing through cover! 137 kph, full and wide outside off, Markram chases after it from point. And it's a risky two. Markram's loopy throw is close to Quinton de Kock, and he takes off the bails with Lyon inches short! That's out and <strong>SA win the series 3-1</strong>!"
