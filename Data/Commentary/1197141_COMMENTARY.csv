"around the wicket comes Ndlovu, and Gurbaz is immediately off the mark, clipping a single off his toes"
"darted in flat and fast by Ndlovu, and it's blocked back at him"
"low arm this time, and some drift across the left-hander, who tucks a single to cover"
"<b>big swing and a miss!</b> The ball zips past the batsman, and the keeper too, and they run some byes. Madziva is after it, and he falls awkwardly as he dives to stop the ball near third man. His knee plugs in the turf, and he's grimacing ... but he's eventually up, and fine"
"slanting in to him with the arm, and a single is glanced to fine leg"
"the bottom hand does the work, Hazratullah glancing wide of midwicket and calling early for a second"
"and he starts with a peach of a delivery! On a length, pulling him forward, and then shaping away from the right hander to beat the outside edge"
"this one hits the seam and nips back in, Gurbaz staying deep in the crease and poking to cover"
"<b>thick inside edge</b>, Gurbaz thrusting his hands out at a length delivery that seams back in. Short fine leg cleans up"
"<b>slower ball, lifted over mid off!</b> Floated up harmlessly outside off by Jarvis, and he just swings his hands through the line. Doesn't bother keeping it down either"
"<b>and now a pull</b>, a short ball sitting up on a leg stump line. It's met with a muscly pull to deep backward square"
"pulled again, but this one is off the splice and in the air. It goes well in front of square and plugs in the outfield. And they're back for a third as the fielder is slow getting to it. I think it's Madziva, who hurt his knee in the first over. Jarvis suggests he should go off the field if he can't run"
"outswinger to start, on a length just outside off. He's forward to defend to cover"
"a touch straighter, and slightly shorter. Gurbaz fends to leg and they pinch a single"
"<b>is this a drop?</b> Chatara pitches one up, and Zazai hammers it very hard back at him. He gets his hands down, but can't cling on. It was fiercely hit"
"straight, and shaping in to Zazai's pads. He likes to attack the leg side, but this one is softly dinked away for a single"
"<b>chipped over mid on!</b> This got more height than distance, but Williams running back from mid on couldn't quite get there in time"
"<b>picked up handsomely!</b> Rahmanullah's trigger movement is back and well across to the off side. That puts him in the perfect position to pick this hit-me delivery up over fine leg. The line wasn't great, headed down the leg side, but he made the most of it with a fantastic strike. First six of the innings"
"rising off a length, and straight. Zazai's got no room to work with, and nudges softly to leg"
"slower ball, an offcutter. Zazai reads it and angles a single just wide of short third man"
"<b>he gets inside the line, and scoops over fine leg!</b>. Rahmanullah manufactures the line he wants by getting right across to the off side, and purposefully lifts this one over the man at short fine"
"<b>thump!</b> Jarvis' riposte is a nippy bouncer, and Gurbaz takes his eyes off it as he pulls, and is hit on the back of the helmet. He doesn't have neck guards back there, but it's hit him on the rim of the helmet"
"<b>edged to third man</b>, off a booming drive. The next ball is pitched up, and he flings everything at it, a thick edge flying fast to the boundary"
"<b>skewed down to third man</b>, once again it's not the shot he was trying to play. Gurbaz was eyeing the leg side, but the ball flashed off a thick edge, over short third man, and down to the boundary"
"<b>and Zazai welcomes him with a huge mow!</b> Looped up on middle and leg, and he bends down to spank it over midwicket"
"but he misses this one. Zazai aims to repeat the treatment, but this time the ball spins past the shot and hits his shoulder"
"quicker, flatter, and it's pushed back at him"
"some grip and spin for Williams, the ball landing full and spinning in to strike Zazai on the pad. Headed down leg"
"flicked off the pads, and through square leg for one"
"speared down the leg side, Taylor jumping across to stop it"
"well bowled, landing on off stump and spinning away to keep him honest"
"Zazai steps half forward to push an offcutter just wide of cover, running a quick single to <b>bring up the fifty</b>"
"<b>pulled over fine leg!</b> Gurbaz is toying with Zimbabwe's bowlers, and once again he steps across to the off side to turn a straight delivery into a leg-side one, pulling the ball deliberately up and over fine leg. And it goes all the way"
"this time he stays put, and dabs a wide back-of-a-length delivery down to third man"
"<b>sliced, skied, and caught!</b> Zazai, who has been somewhat overshadowed by Gurbaz, targets a big hit over the leg side. But the ball is angled across him, and it flies off the outside half of the blade, looping up to be easily caught by Williams in the covers. Some relief for Zimbabwe after a rapid opening stand"
"nipping in off the seam, landing on a length, Gurbaz defending to cover"
"fuller this time, and he taps towards point and sets off. Ndlovu fires a throw at the non-striker's end, but it's slightly off target and they scamper through"
"this one scuttles through a little low, Gurbaz whipping across his front pad to find a single to midwicket"
"<b>appeal for a stumping!</b> Williams gives this one a real rip, and it dips and spins past Tarakai as he stretches forward to defend. Taylor is lightning behind the stumps, and it seems as though his back foot was raised for a just a moment. But has he got it down in time? Good grief, this is mighty close. The tv umpire eventually has to make a call, and decides it's not out. That was a tough decision to make!"
"spinning away from him outside off, and it's cut to backward point"
"pushed to cover now, and Tarakai wants a single. There's none to be had, and he's wisely sent back"
"nicely bowled once more, but Tarakai finds the right angle to push down to long off, beating short extra"
"<b>huge appeal, and he's given!</b> After an over of flighted deliveries, Williams fires in a quicker one that rushes on with the arm, beating the sweep and striking him flush on the pad. The umpire upholds the lbw appeal, but Gurbaz queries it with a <b>review</b>. The ball's pretty close to the gloves as it goes through, and once again Masudur Rahman the television umpire has a very difficult decision to make. UltraEdge seems to indicate there is no bat involved, and ball tracking confirms the umpire's call!"
"and immediately <b>there's another appeal for a stumping</b>. This is a much easier call though. Taylor is once again very slick getting the bails off, but his back foot is definitely grounded behind the line"
"<b>cracking delivery!</b> Ndlovu rips one outside off, beating a groping defensive push"
"<b>top edge, but it falls safe!</b> It was the quicker one, and it rushed on to him as he tried to pull. The ball goes up, towards long on, but doesn't have the legs to reach him"
"whipped off the toes, into the leg side"
"<b>biffed over long on!</b> Slightly too full from Ndlovu, and Tarakai's eyes light up. A big swing of the blade sends the ball flying over long on"
"good comeback, hitting the right length and getting some purchase to hurry a push back at him"
"dip, grip and spin! This one rags across his defensive push. Masakadza offers encouragement from slip"
<b>beaten outside off!</b> Plenty of spin here
"fuller, straighter, and it's driven back past a diving bowler"
"worked off the pads once again, and there's room for another quick single"
"pushed just wide of cover, and there's some indecision in the running. Eventually they decide to take the run, and make it to the other side"
"<b>beaten!</b> This was there to be hit, to be honest, as Williams digs it in much too short. But the ball just zips on, beating Tarakai's attempted pull"
"legbreak, spinning away from him, and he taps to backward point"
"big sweep, but it comes off the toe end and trickles to midwicket"
"was this the googly? It slid straight on in to him, cramping Asghar's push to cover"
"too straight, and it's flicked off the pads"
"<b>big slog sweep</b>, but the ball spins past him and he hits only fresh air"
"down the track this time, and he's almost beaten in the flight but manages a drive to long off"
"length ball on the stumps, punched off the back foot towards mid-on"
"down the ground and absolutely smashed, but straight towards the bowler"
"fuller and slower around off, turns it towards midwicket"
"fuller on the stumps, looks to slog it down the ground, mistimes it towards the right of long-on"
"short around off, sits up for the batsman but Afghan can pull it only towards deep midwicket"
"<b>a bit of a mix-up</b> but all safe in the end. Was a length ball outside off, Tarakai punched it towards covers and set off, Asghar was a bit late to react and there was almost a collision between the two batsman but Asghar makes it comfortably in the end"
"tossed up outside off and spinning away, goes for the cut but cannot middle, backward point comes into the picture"
"stops at the batsman who was shaping up for a cut, ends up hitting it in the air towards extra cover where Ndlovu makes no mistake, moving to his left"
"length ball outside off, flight and turn, defended from the front foot"
"<b>goes for the reverse sweep</b> but Williams has once again bowled it slower through the air, some turn as well to beat the batsman and hit on the body"
length but down the leg side and spinning further away
"length ball on the stumps, flicks it away but finds square leg"
"length ball on the pads, glanced fine this time to beat the short fine leg and collect a couple"
"short and wide outside off, Afghan goes for the cut but mistimes it into the ground"
"a slower bouncer outside off, Afghan was early into the pull and gets beaten"
"another slower one, closer to the batsman this time and Afghan swivels to pull it towards deep square leg"
"length ball in the line of the stumps, keeps a bit low as well, Najibullah goes for the flick and gets beaten, <b>a loud appeal for lbw</b> but not out. Pitched way outside the leg stump"
"another slower one, short outside off, Najibullah looks to pull but is beaten"
"<b>and again</b>, another slower one angling across the batsman who was early into the pull, no connection"
"down the ground  and lofted over deep midwicket, was a six as soon as it made that sweet contact with the bat"
"fuller on the stumps and Asghar once again looks to repeat the shot. However, he only gets the height on this one, not the distance. Ryan Burl settles under it at long-on and pouches it as it comes down after ages"
"short and flat on the stumps, Najibullah rocks back and smashes it over deep midwicket for the second six of the over"
"flatter and quicker, angling away from the batsman, Najibullah goes for the cut, gets a thick outside edge that beats short third man"
"length ball on the pads, turns it behind square leg, was looking to come back for the second but only one was available there"
"length ball around off, defended tentatively from the crease"
"short again, angling across, Najibullah was looking to ramp it over but it's a touch too wide"
"another slower one, this time on a length on the leg stump, Najibullah defends it on the off side and scampers across"
"short and wide outside off, punched firmly off the back foot, sweeper cover cuts it off"
"short outside off, cuts it towards deep point for one"
"another slower bouncer but down the leg side this time, the umpires signals a no-ball as it's the second bouncer of the over"
"slower length ball, Nabi can only drag it towards deep midwicket, comes back for the second though"
"slower again, fuller outside off this time, Nabi just places it between midwicket and square leg and sneaks in another brace"
"short of length aimed at the batsman, cramping for room, tucked away towards midwicket for one"
"fuller around off, Nabi backs away and digs it out towards long-on"
"short of length at the batsman, Najib stays back and tucks it away towards fine leg"
"short again, just around off, Nabi pulls it towards deep-backward square leg, fielder there"
"another short ball, looked like a slower one, but this time Najib manages to pull it fine, between the keeper and the man at 45 and collects a much-needed boundary"
"over long-on this time. Was in the slot, Najib cleared his front leg, and lofted it high and handsome to clear to boundary. 14 from that Jarvis over"
"fuller on the stumps, and Nabi drills it straight back, hits the stumps at the other end, a single off the ricochet"
"in the blockhole around off, looks to smash it through covers, loses shape and the ball rolls behind square leg off the inner half"
legcutter from Chatara but too short and Nabi just waits at the back foot before pulling it way over the deep midwicket boundary
"fuller, doesn't miss the yorker by much but Nabi clears the front leg and makes full use of the bottom hand it smash it for a straight six"
"<b>three in three for Nabi!</b> A low full toss on the stumps, Nabi was just standing very still in his crease and sends it over deep midwicket. Moves to 26 off 11"
"<b>is that the fourth one? Yes!!!</b> Another low full toss from Chatara, this time outside off and Nabi moves towards the off stump and lofts it over deep extra cover. Another big over for Afghanistan - 26 from that"
"<b>Madziva too disappears!</b> Was a length ball and Najib just pulls it with utter disdain, over deep midwicket, that's fifth six in last five balls"
"<b>makes it six in six!</b> Short, just outside off and pulled almost into the second tier this time, way over deep midwicket"
"<b>this is carnage!</b> A slower one gone wrong, loopy delivery down the leg side, Najib helps it over fine leg. Another six. Seven now. This must be some kind of a record"
"a full toss but way too outside off, called wide"
"fuller and wider and carved over point, <b>is that another six?</b> They are checking upstairs but looks like it landed just inside. That's fifty for Najibullah, off just 22 balls"
"fuller outside off, steered towards sweeper cover for one"
"short again, Nabi goes for the pull but cannot beat the man at deep-backward square leg"
"a low full toss on the stumps, whipped away towards deep midwicket but only a single"
"fuller outside off, digs it out towards deep extra cover"
"in the blockhole and Nabi brings out that bottom hand but only a single this time, to long-on"
"in the blockhole but just outside off, Najibullah squeezes it out past short third man for four"
"goes for the yorker but just misses, Najibullah lofts it towards long-off, a bit of fumble there allows the second run"
"wide, low full toss and Najibullah makes full use of that, dispatches it over deep extra cover, fifth six of the innings for him"
"another full toss on the stumps, swiped towards deep midwicket for a couple, the throw is in but Najib was dragging hi bat, they are checking upstairs and Najib was well in"
"another yorker gone wrong. Nabi smashes it over the bowler's head. Madzavi sprints from long-off, dives to his right and makes the stop"
"fuller outside off, in the blockhole. Finally they get one right. Najib mistimes it back towards the bowler"
"another full toss, wide outside off, Najib goes aerial over extra cover, didn't middle it but it still runs away for four before the long-off fielder could reach there"
"a wide yorker this time, squeezes it out towards extra cover"
"in the blockhole, almost a yorker at the leg stump, Nabi was deep in his crease, lofts it towards long-on with that big bottom hand but doesn't get enough to clear Burl who times his hop and takes it"
"Taylor attempts a reverse sweep, but misses the shot and is struck on the pad. Outside the line I should think, but they <b>ask for a review</b>. There's a flat line on UltraEdge, but ball-tracking shows he's clearly hit outside the line. A wasted review."
"misdirected down the leg side, and Taylor meets this one with a powerful orthodox sweep, placing it to perfection to collect a boundary"
"pushed through a little quicker, Taylor whips across his pad to midwicket"
"tucked just wide of mid on, but they decide against a single"
"<b>slog sweep, four more!</b> He didn't get all of this one, but made sure to hit it well in front of square, and right into the gap"
"quicker one, rushing in to him off the track, and it's inside-edged onto the thigh pad. Gurbaz keeps him in the crease with an energetic dive across from behind the stumps"
"he bustles in and delivers a back of a length delivery, the ball shaping slightly in to Masakadza and cramping him for room"
"<b>in the air, and safe!</b> He fetches the ball from way outside off stump with an attempted paddle sweep, skying the effort. Fortunately for him, it comes to ground safely, in front of midwicket"
"shaping in to Taylor off the track, and cramping his attempted push to cover. Tight lines"
"fine leg is inside the circle, and Taylor looks to beat him, walking across, but he inside edges the effort onto his thigh and pinches a single"
"uppercut over cover point, and they're back for two. Not particularly well timed, but he gets enough on it to clear the inner ring"
"this one angles across him, and Masakadza drives hard but straight back to the bowler"
"<b>picked up!</b> Mujeeb flings this down the leg side, and Taylor picks it up handsomely over deep backward square. Pinged out of the middle"
"<b>straight back over his head!</b> Mujeeb sends down a seam-up delivery, but it's over pitched and Taylor just swings cleanly through the line"
"another big heave, this time to leg, and the ball takes the bottom edging, rolling out to the man in the deep"
"a touch short, and spinning towards leg stump, but Hamilton is rushed on the pull and wears it on the thigh pad"
"<b>run out!</b> Oh dear. Masakadza inside edges a flick to leg and the ball rolls to midwicket. Taylor wants a single and calls immediately, but Hamilton hesitates for a moment before setting off. It's a fatal pause, as the throw comes in flat, hard and accurate to catch him short"
"nudged just to the right of short fine leg, and there's another quick single. Ervine's quick off the mark though, and safely through"
"<b>thrashed!</b> Fareed offers generous width outside off and Taylor steps forward to flay the ball, in the air but in the gap, through cover point"
"<b>past the outside edge</b>, the ball rising off a length to beat a slightly uncertain push off the back foot"
"angled across him, and close to the off stump. Taylor is half forward to poke to cover"
"<b>spliced to midwicket</b>, and Hazratullah holds a simple catch. Fine leg was inside the circle, and Taylor was targeting that region. But the ball just got big on him, and he spooned a simple catch in front of square, off the splice. Early joy for Afghanistan, and early strife for Zimbabwe"
"<b>beaten</b> by the outswinger. Fareed pitched this one right up, and Williams was caught with his weight back"
"<b>another one goes!</b> A rising delivery outside off, and Williams pushes out at it. It was too close to him to cut, and the movement took it away from him once again. A simple edge nestles in Gurbaz' gloves, and Zimbabwe are in all sorts of trouble now"
"pushed across him, outside off, and it's left alone"

"Tino skips out now, but Nabi spots him coming and darts in a slightly shorter one"
"chopped down to third man, just the one"
"flicked firmly into the leg side, but there's cover in the deep"
"<b>big appeal, and given!</b> Ervine stepped across to off and set himself for a paddle scoop, but it was too full and hit him on the heel of his shoe. Janat bellows an appeal, and it's upheld. Ervine converses with his team-mate, and then appears to gesture something - possibly asking for a review? - but it's too late. He's out of time, and out of luck. It was almost certainly out, too"
"angled down to third man, and he's off the mark"
"worked into the leg side, another single is the result"
"rising off a length, but slightly too straight, and it's worked off the hip"
"<b>through him!</b> Burl lunges forward but leaves a gap between bat and pad, through which an arm ball from Nabi sneaks through. But it misses the stumps, and evades the keeper, and they take a bye"

"drifting in from a wide angle, and Burl closes the face of the bat to work a single through midwicket, <b>raising Zimbabwe's fifty</b>"
"slower ball to start with, on a length and aimed at off stump. Burl is forward to push it back to him"
"Burl skips down and spanks a drive, but straight at mid off"

"Burl flashes outside off, the ball coming off the outside edge and bouncing down to third man"
"another slower one, out of the side of the hand, and Tino misses a flick to midwicket"
"another slower one, and Tino lays bat on this pull, fine leg scooting around to keep them to two"
"full, on off stump, and he's flicked through square leg for one"
"googly, and Tino is expecting it, hanging back to pull out to midwicket"
"another googly, and this one scuttles through very low. Burl has to jab down in a hurry, and just about keeps it out"
"legbreak, spinning in to him, and Burl plays outside the line. He's struck on the pad, Rashid bellows an appeal, and up goes the finger! Burl chats to his team-mate, and decides to <b>take the review</b>. There's no bat involved, but it's pitched outside leg, and he is saved! Good review there ..."

<b>HUGE!</b> Madziva spots one in the slot and just swats through the line to send it arcing high into the night sky and well over the boundary
"<b>there's an appeal</b> for caught behind, but Madziva's jammed his bat into the ground as it passes him by the looks of things. It was a full, wide yorker and zipped under his bat"
"<b>and again!</b> This was just short of a good length, on middle, and Madziva planted it over the midwicket boundary with a short-arm jab. Muscly stroke"
"another yorker, just outside off, and again it zips under Madziva's bat"
