But it stands, say the umpires.. He wasn't convinced and the bowler talked him into it. Rahane was looking to flick this length ball over the leg side and was struck on the knee flap in front of middle and leg. Not a big stride...<b>and it's hitting leg stump!</b> Middle of leg stump. That kept a little low and it was a good call to review it. Rahane is gone"

"<b>taken by extra cover!</b> Buttler loses his shape and skies an easy one for Rayudu! Thakur wins the battle. Short of a length ball, he gets on the back foot and looks to punch it aerially, but it seems he's too early on it and ends up getting a little under it.
