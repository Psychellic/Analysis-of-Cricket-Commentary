Big wicket

"banged in on a length, Billings defends from the crease"

"<em>how did that miss?!</em> Length ball, looked like an offcutter from Stoinis, which flew <i>just</i> over the top of middle-and-leg as Bairstow was through the shot early"
"length outside off, Bairstow swings and misses at it looking to pull"
"clears the front leg to give himself room, cutting a straight length ball <strong>for four behind square</strong>! Premeditated from Bairstow, who I think was looking to wipe this over midwicket again, but Stoinis hung it wide and he adapted brilliantly"

"hard length on fourth stump, guided to point again by Billings"
