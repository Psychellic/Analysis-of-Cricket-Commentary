"first convincing shot of the day. A bit too short, he goes on the back foot and swivel-pulls it off his pads to the square leg boundary"

Lovely bowling by the older Chahar, going away from the left-hander, pitching on off and jagging back in to hit him on the front pad's knee roll. And that's three reds on the review, plumb in front. Lewis goes, takes a review with him. Perhaps he was fooled by the movement off the pitch and thought he had a chance of being saved. But it was just a lovely, lovely ball."

"<b>Chahar is on fire!</b> Given lbw again, Hetmyer is uncertain, but there's no review left. Don't think it would have saved him anyway. Chahar's again got the ball to do a snake-dance to the left-hander, going across to pitch outside off and then taking a sharp left to nip in and hit the pad."
