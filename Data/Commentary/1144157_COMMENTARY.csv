"curving down the leg side, and it's an extra to start proceedings. That swung"
"<b>beaten on a booming drive!</b> Rabada pitched this right up, and again it snaked in to the left hander through the air, Imam swiping his drive outside the line of the ball"
"Imam reverts to Test mode for just a moment, watching a length delivery closely and raising his hands to let it past him outside off"
"right up to the bat once again, but this time Imam is forward to meet it, opening his account with a quick single into the covers as Hendricks tumbles to stop the ball"
"<b>emphatic way to get off the mark</b>, and Fakhar looks in excellent touch as he leans into a straight drive. Didn't over hit it"
"this one seams across Fakhar, who thrusts his hands out at the ball and collects a tip-and-run single to cover point"
"hint of an inside edge as Imam comes forward to one that swings in to him, but the ball comes off the thigh and there's no harm done"
"pushed right up to the batsman, and Fakhar is forward to smother the hint of inward movement"
"Fakhar jabs a full ball towards mid off and they steal a quick single as Miller charges in and throws on the dive. There was a dive from Fakhar too to make his ground, but no direct hit"
"quick running once again, Imam waiting in the crease and nurdling to leg"
"swing for Paterson, but his line starts too straight and it swings down the leg side"
"Paterson lands one on a length, aiming at the top of off, and Fakhar is forward in defence"
"nicely bowled once again by Paterson, as this one hits the seam and moves away from the left hander, Fakhar pushing it slightly awkwardly towards cover"
"just short of a good length, and it keeps Fakhar in the crease as he rises to cover the bounce and dabs to point. Solid first effort from Paterson"
"Rabada hunts swing, landing the ball close to Imam's toes, the batsman clipping the ball to mid on"
"shorter this time, and Imam meets it with a hop, working defensively to leg"
"swing for Rabada, but it takes the ball down the leg side and there's another one in the extras column. Not the most controlled start for the quicks in these conditions"
"ah, and now this one goes the other way and <b>beats the outside edge!</b> And it was bowled at 147km/h too, effort ball"
"fuller this time, and <b>beaten once more</b>, although to his credit Imam also drew his bat inside the line"
"on a length, and Imam is forward to push to cover"
"nudged off the pads, and they hurry back for the second"
"full, and angling across Fakhar, who meets it and drives to mid off"

Rabada aims one at Imam's pads and he's neatly clipped down to fine leg for one
"Fakhar stands tall at the crease and looks to muscle this length delivery through the leg side, but the ball bounces off the under edge of the shot and goes nowhere. Frustrated shot from Fakhar"

"full and angling across Imam, who is half forward but plays the ball defensively back to the bowler right under his eyes"
"<b>a pull, a top edge, and a simple catch!</b> Rabada dug this one in to surprise Imam, who was camped on the front foot. He rocked back on the pull, but not quickly enough to control the stroke. The ball loops tamely to midwicket, where Phehlukwayo holds a simple chance. That was a wonderfully set-up wicket from Rabada, who drew Imam further and further forward before mixing it up with a short one on a pitch that is not quick, but has shown appreciable bounce"
"Babar is welcomed to the crease with a low full toss on off stump, easing the ball through square leg for a boundary straight away. Rabada must have been aiming for the yorker, but it slipped out"

"a touch of wobble from outside off stump, but Babar is forward to cover it and defends to cover point"
"Fakhar thrusts his hands out aggressively at a length delivery, but the ball shoots off the inside edge and bounces into the leg side. Ooh's and aah's from behind the wicket"

"Rabada gets one to hold its line now, Babar rushing his defensive push"
"accurate stuff from Rabada, bowling right in the channel outside off to extend this examination of Babar's patience and technique"
"<b>too full, and driven on the up through cover point</b>, this wasn't even all that full but Babar leaned into the stroke and the ball pinged right out of the middle"
"Rabada pulls his length back this time, no driving this one as Babar hops to defend"
"a rare lapse from Paterson, who gives Fakhar a leg stump half volley that's clipped through midwicket for three"
"three more, and some real hustle in the running. Babar was forward to drive, and threaded the ball right through the gap in the covers"
"Paterson's line starts too straight again, and Fakhar swings across it to send the ball down to fine leg. There's a dive from the fielder, but he can't cut it off"
"a better line from Paterson, aiming outside off as Fakhar is forward to drive to mid off"
<b>big swing and a miss outside off</b> as Paterson hits that frustrating length again
"very full on off stump, and Fakhar crunches the ball straight into the ground, short extra cover leaping up to stop the drive"

"pitched up this time, and Rabada tests Babar's front foot defence"
"<b>once again the short ball does the trick!</b> Rabada digs it in, Babar steps back to pull but the ball balloons off the top edge as he's much too early into the shot. Again it's Phehlukwayo who holds the catch, but this time he's running in from the midwicket boundary. Two bouncers have brought two wickets, and Pakistan are re-living some of their troubles from the Test series. And Olivier hasn't even bowled yet!"
"on a length, angling across the left hander, and Fakhar's got nothing to work with and can only tap the ball to gully"
"Fakhar whips across the line with plenty of bottom hand, fetching the ball from outside off as Paterson's line contrinues to frustrate him. Straight to the fielder"
"Paterson attempts a bouncer of his own, and the ball bounces high but slowly off the spongy surface, and dies down the leg side"
"fuller, straighter, and yet another Fakhar drive pings the cover field"

"unusually full length from Olivier, and Fakhar is forward to push to cover"

"on a length and angled across the left hander, who plays it straight"
"Fakhar plays straight again, but this time it's on the drive and with much more authority. Olivier slipped in a very full one and Fakhar met it with a full flow of the bat"

"rising off a length, but a touch too straight and Fakhar finds space on the leg side with a little flick"
"Olivier bends his back on a bouncer, but Hafeez spots and early and smears his pull out to deep midwicket with a crack off the bat"
Olivier loses his line down the leg side and Fakhar gets a half a bat on it to collect one more before Klaasen gets around to cut it off. And that <b>brings up the fifty</b>
<b>timed to perfection!</b> Olivier floats up a half volley outside off and Hafeez just stretches out and eases his hands through the line to send the ball racing to the cover boundary
Olivier's looking a little rattled now as he reverts to the bouncer but sends the ball looping down the leg side

"rising outside off, and Hafeez rises with it to push to point"
"Phehlukwayo pitches the ball up outside off and Fakhar heaves impatiently at it, toe-ending his drive straight into the ground. Slow surface, this"

"nicely played by Hafeez, reaching out and cracking a rising delivery through the off side"
"Phehlukwayo aims much fuller, targeting the stumps, and Hafeez responds with watchful defence"
"<b>chipped and caught!</b> It's that sort of track. Phehlukwayo pitches the ball up, full and straight, and Hafeez leans forward to flick the ball into the leg side. But he's too early into the shot, chipping it in the air and at a very catchable height to du Plessis, who had positioned himself perfectly at short midwicket"
"Phehlukwayo offers a full ball, nibbling away just outside off, and Shoaib is forward to drive to cover"
"smell that! Olivier reverts to what has worked, digging the ball in short and getting it to rise up at Fakhar's grille. He flings his hands out to fend at the ball, but it takes the splice and loops easily to Miller in the gully"

"<strong>Shamsi strikes with his fourth ball</strong>, but no big celebrations here. Another stock ball from Shamsi, on middle, this perhaps bounces more than Shadab expects it to.

"googly to start, whether Hasan read it or not he manages to but bat to ball and swipe a run through square leg"
"nicely swept by Sarfraz, who bends very low into the shot and gets a feather on it to send the ball bouncing very fine down to fine leg. Hashim Amla is after it, and hauls the ball in just short of the boundary"

"Shamsi pitches it on leg and the spin takes it further in that direction, Sarfraz swiveling on the pull and pinching a single when the ball ricochets off the pad"
"<b>well bowled, and beaten!</b> Shamsi slips one out the front of the hand and the ball rushes on to beat Hasan's outside edge as he pokes forward"

"Hasan scythes a cut now, but it's cleanly stopped at point"
"<b>bowled him!</b> Phehlukwayo comes back and strikes straight away. This was an innocuous delivery, medium pace on a length and seaming slightly back in, but Sarfraz was neither forward nor back as he looked to work it to leg, and the ball shoots through the gate to rattle the stumps. How South Africa needed that strike!"
"Afridi is off the mark straight away, though in unconvincing fashion as he slices an edge down to third man. Still, Hasan on strike now"
"good grief, Hasan has charged out and tried to murder this through the off side, but Phehlukwayo's got the guile to send the ball floating out wide to beat a flailing bat"
"wonderfully bowled once again, <b>zinging in a yorker</b> that Hasan flicks onto his own pad. It was a slower ball too, a knuckle ball"
"<b>what a catch!</b> Faf du Plessis pulls off an outstanding catch at long on to close out the innings. Hasan cleared his front leg and aimed for the top tier, but he didn't get all of it. Du Plessis tracked the ball from wide long on, running round while maintaining his distance from the boundary marker, and finally timing his leap to perfection to pluck the ball out of the air. That was six if he'd missed it, but du Plessis holds on and Phehlukwayo ends the innings with a <b>career best 4 for 22</b>"
and he <b>beats the bat</b> straight away with a full ball that curves slightly away through the air and beats a late drive from Hendricks
"nothing late about this shot, and it's <b>perfectly timed</b> off the toes. Faheem was too full, and too straight, and Hendricks clipped it neatly through midwicket"
"Faheem pulls his length back and adjusts his line, Hendricks getting across to defend to leg"
"line and length from Faheem, and Hendricks is happy to play the ball watchfully back"
"Faheem aims for the top of off at 136km/h, and Hendricks defends from the crease"
"Hendricks is up on his toes to crack this off the back foot and in front of point, but he finds the field"
"he bustles in and hits a back of a length outside off, the ball seaming further away. Amla lets it go"
"<b>this was all timing</b> from Amla. Afridi fired in a full, wide yorker that Amla just dropped his bat down onto. The square boundary is a short one, and he placed the ball right past point"
"Afridi makes an adjustment to his length, pulling it right back, and Amla is happy to lift his hands and let it go"
"<b>and again, Amla dispatches the full ball</b>, leaning forward to caress a checked cover drive past a tumbling cover fielder. Vintage Amla"
"<b>what a comeback!</b> Afridi finally finds the right line, and some swing too back into the right-hander. Amla is not as far forward as he could be, and the movement snakes the ball in between bat and pad, via a thin inside edge"
"this one doesn't swing, but hits the seam and leaves van der Dussen off the deck. He has a look, and lets it pass"
"Faheem hits the seam, the ball nipping in to Hendricks, who rides the bounce and movement to collect a single behind square on the leg side"
"testing delivery from Faheem, who again finds a little bit of nip back in to the right hander. The ball is aimed right at the stumps too, and van der Dussen hurries his defence"
"fuller this time, and van der Dussen is forward to meet it, off the mark with a firm push through cover point"
"nicely bowled once again, probing on off stump. Van der Dussen defends back to the bowler"
"just short of a good length, and van der Dussen is on his toes to counter any extra bounce as he defends to cover"
"tight end to the over, pitched up at 127km/h as van der Dussen once again steps forward to defend"
"Afridi hits a length outside off, and there's no swing as Hendricks comes forward to push on the up to cover"
"<b>Afridi strikes again!</b> Both openers dismissed now. The ball that got Amla swung in, but this one just kept on going away from Hendricks as he stretched forward to drive at it. All he could muster was a thin edge that flew through to Sarfraz, and Pakistan have two early wickets"
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> and this looks very close. The ball was on a length and nipped just a little into the right-handed du Plessis, who was expecting it to go across him. It's too high though, the umpire says no and there's no call for a review"
"nice response from the South African captain, who leans over the clip a full ball through straight midwicket. Hasan Ali hares after the ball, and dives to stop it, but after a replay it's clear that he's in contact with the advertising foam as he flicks the ball back. Four runs"
"curving delightfully in through the air again, and pitched right up to attack the stumps. Top delivery from Afridi, and it tests du Plessis' defence"
"great variation from the young bowler to end a strong over, this one rushing straight on to angle across du Plessis, who leaves well alone"
"<b>beautiful placement from van der Dussen</b>, who defies the slow, bouncy track with a checked drive, on the up, and right through the gap to the right of cover"
"not quite there for the drive this time, and van der Dussen is nonetheless on the front foot to defend"
"<b>inside edge</b> as Faheem nips another one back into the right handed van der Dussen, who pokes and edges it down to fine leg"
"<b>what's happened here? This has spat off the pitch viciously at du Plessis</b>. Faheem just hit a length, but the ball popped up at du Plessis's splice, and he offers a quizzical look at the pitch"
"hard to fault the pitch if you can play a shot like this though, du Plessis pushing forward and thrashing a wide ball through point for four"
"<b>du Plessis flashes again, but misses this time</b>, this was wide again and there to be hit, but he just cut underneath it"
"Afridi aims full to start, snaking the ball in through the air just a touch as van der Dussen prods forward to defend"
"<b>in the air, but safe!</b> Afridi sends down a canny offcutter, rolling his fingers over the ball, and van der Dussen is clueless as he plays much too early but fortunately slashes it safely through gully"
"<b>Afridi is on a roll</b>! This is an outstanding spell of new-ball bowling. Afridi pushes another full ball wide and across du Plessis, who drives at it but sends another edge dipping through to a diving Sarfraz behind the stumps. Such skillful stuff from the young bowler, who has swung the ball both ways and cut it too"
"this one might have slipped out, Afridi was probably aiming for the yorker but it's come out as a full toss outside off that takes Miller a little by surprise"
"that's better, full and attacking the stumps as Miller defends from the crease. There's a buzz rippling through Pakistan in the field"
"a touch of wobble back in to the left-handed Miller, who stands to defend from the crease"
"Faheem aims full at 136km/h, van der Dussen coming cautiously forward to drive to cover"
"on a length this time, and honing in at the top of off, van der Dussen defends"
"a touch too straight, and van der Dussen flicks across his pad to find a single. Imam sprints across to cut it off, zipping in an accurate throw"
"<b>crunch!</b> Miller's batting has a reputation for brutal power, but this was all finesse. Faheem overpitched and Miller leaned forward into a drive, keeping his elbow nice and high, to send the ball screaming through cover"
"strong response from the bowler, who pulls his length ball and finds lift and movement outside off to <b>beat Miller's outside edge</b>"
"nicely worked by Miller, picking up a leg stump line and playing the ball in front of square. A hard push brings two runs"
"shaping across the right handed van der Dussen, who defends from the crease"
"van der Dussen is a touch tentative coming forward to a fuller one from Afridi, but he pushes a drive to mid off"
"this might have been the cutter from Afridi, at any rate it looked a touch slower and slanted across the defensive van der Dussen"
"effort ball this time, 142km/h, and van der Dussen is on the front foot to push it to point"
"Afridi slips in a short one, but van der Dussen is equal to it and stands upright to pull through square leg"
"Afridi missed a yorker first up to Miller, and he's done so again. This time the ball is aimed down the leg side, and Miller just angles a leg glance to beat short fine leg and collect four"
"no turn but some drift through the air, and van der Dussen is forward to defend"
"a little more flight at 80km/h, and a little more turn, but van der Dussen plays with it to get the ball through mid on"
"around the wicket comes Hafeez, Miller standing in the crease to punch the ball through mid off"
"van der Dussen stays deep in the crease, working a single through square leg"
"flighted up extravagantly by Hafeez at 76km/h, but it's a little too full and Miller is in no trouble driving to long off"
"quicker and flatter to end the over, and van der Dussen comes forward to defend"
"Afridi runs in with good rhythm and gets the ball to lift outside off stump, but Miller rides the bounce to ease a single to third man"
"it's the bouncer from Afridi, but it was very short and ballooned up at van der Dussen, who swatted it from head height but rolled the wrists too to keep it down and work with the angle, the runs coming at long leg"
"fuller this time from Afridi, and quicker too at 141km/h, and van der Dussen guides a single through gully"
"Miller hops at the crease to get on top of the bounce again, and it's one more to third man"
"Afridi comes around the wicket now, angling the ball in to van der Dussen, who defends from the crease"
"Afridi charges in and attacks the stumps, but van der Dussen is forward to counter the angle and defend solidly"
"<b>cracking delivery!</b> Hafeez comes around the stumps, drawing Miller forward and then beating his outside edge with a hint of turn"
"inquisitive lbw appeal from behind the stumps as Miller shimmies out and then misses the ball to be struck on the pad, but he's well outside the line"
"just a little too short, and Miller can hang back and work a single through long on"
"looped up outside off, and van der Dussen defends softly to cover"
"pushed down the leg side, and van der Dussen gets something on it to collect a single to fine leg"
and some solid defence from Miller rounds out the over
"well, that's charitably a loosener, floated full and wide outside off. Van der Dussen lunges out and slaps his drive wide of mid off"
"nothing loose about this one, Hasan bending his back and <b>beating the outside edge</b> of van der Dussen's defensive poke"
"there's some excitement as Hasan finds the inside edge of the bat and ricochets the ball onto the pad, but no harm done"
"nice, attacking line from Hasan, aiming at the top of middle with a full length delivery"
"pitched right up again, and van der Dussen is forward to defend"
"nice piece of timing from van der Dussen, who leans over a full ball and sends it bouncing through mid on. They turn for the third, and Miller is a little slow off the mark, but the shy is wide"
"floated up outside off, van der Dussen stays in his crease and waits on a dab into the gap at cover"
"that will ease the pressure! Miller stretches forward into a powerful sweep, slugging the ball in front of square on the leg side"
"floated up invitingly at 75km/h, but Miller covers the flight and clips two runs wide of mid on"
"that's the length, drawing Miller forward into watchful defence"
"a touch shorter this time, but Miller's response is defensive"
Miller waits in his crease and eases a single down to long on to end the over
"<b>neatly tucked by Miller</b>, who walks across to off and then whips across his front pad to send the ball bouncing through straight midwicket. The ball was there to be hit, too full and too straight"
"Hasan pushes his line wider of the off stump, and Miller raises his hands to leave it alone"
"full again from Hasan, but the line is outside off and angling across Miller, who is forward to press it to point"
"turned off the hip by Miller, who collects a single in front of square on the leg side"
"full, just outside off, and van der Dussen turns the strike over with another single through cover"
"<b>sumptuous stroke from Miller</b>, who comes forward to meet the ball on the full and slams it straight back the bowler without ever losing his shape in the shot. He's into the 30s, and looking very solid"
"he starts full outside off, and van der Dussen drives to long off"
"<b>Shadab strikes straight away!</b> Miller was drawn in by the flight, and suckered by the slowness of the pitch as he flicked too early to leg, presenting short midwicket with an easy catch. Imam holds the catch, and it's a mirror of Hafeez' dismissal in the first innings"
"<strong>two wickets in two balls for Shadab!</strong> He sends Klaasen back for a duck. Wrong'un, fizzes off the pitch and breaches the weak defences of Klaasen. The batsman sits back in the crease, he misjudges the length, and misses the ball altogether. Shadab is mobbed by his team-mates"
"legbreak on a length and spins back in, kept out"
"fuller and outside off, Andile drags a slog-sweep from there to the midwicket boundary. Swept flat and hard for four"
"mighty full on off, dead-batted away. Game-changing first over from Shadab Khan"
"on a length and outside off, van der Dussen drives on the up to extra-cover"

"fired on middle, dips late, jammed back to Shadab"
"tossed on leg, played back to Shadab"
"<strong>Shadab belts out an appeal for lbw,</strong> and the finger goes up. Andile reviews even before chatting with van der Dussen. Full, dips and turns in, Andile plays around his front pad and is hit on the front pad below the knee-roll in line with middle. It was turning sharply past the leg stump. Coach Arthur has his hands on his head in the Pakistan change room. Good review from Andile"

"Andile rolls out a reverse-sweep, swats from the stumps through point"

Hafeez holds this offbreak back as van der Dussen steps out and nearly chips it back
