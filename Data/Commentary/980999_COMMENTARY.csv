"length ball that nips away from leg stump, Gayle gets half forward and defends. Ooooooooooohs around the ground. They didn't expect that"
walks across the stumps and punches the short delivery on off to cover
"shapes away from outside off, Gayle shoulders arms"
beauty! Gayle is squared up by the late away movement from back of length area on middle. Didn't miss the edge by much
"driven firmly, but only as far as Miller at wide long-off. Interesting field position that"
he needs no sighters. Stands tall and punches that between cover and point. Shot of a man in the form of his life. Beautiful
"swung across the line to deep midwicket. He wanted to hit it a lot straighter, ended up dragging it"
"short, a touch of width outside off, bunted straight to point this time"
"backs away to go over cover, but Mohit follows him and tucks him up for room, bunted to the off side for a quick single. Slightly risky considering Gayle was his partner on this occasion"
"floats it full outside off, Gayle lets it go expecting it to be called a wide, but umpire believes it was touch and go. Harsh call, you have to say. Mohit lucky to get away"
"biffs that over midwicket, more like the Henry Gayle we know. Fetches the length ball from outside off, one bounce into the boundary. No half-measures"
"way too early into an almighty heave over long-on, beaten by the slower one that rolls through to Wriddhiman Saha"
whips the length ball on middle to short fine leg
"thumped on the up, excellent stop by a diving Mohit at mid-off"
"pulls and misses. Gayle was way too early into the stroke again, it was sitting up nicely for him to play it though"
swung across the line to Amla at deep midwicket. Looks like he's trying to hit it too hard. Didn't find the timing on that again
"slapped over the bowler's head, the length was just a touch short, pure muscle from Kohli to find the elevation. Sandeep briefly put his right hand up but that was just an instinctive reaction. Heart of hearts, he wouldn't have wanted to get his hands on that"
"tucks it to midwicket, wanted to play it more towards mid-on"
"sprays it full and well outside off, Gayle chases that one but can't get any bat on it. Easy call for the umpire"
"that's the shot he's been looking for! This one was right in his arc, too full and enough width outside off for him to swing through the line and hammer it back over the long-off boundary"
"this one over cover. Too much width and he's just dismissed it from his presence. Length ball this time, and it found Gayle's dead centre of his big broad bat."
"juicy full toss outside off, Gayle swings and ends up slicing it over cover, couple of bounces into the boundary. He wanted to hit it straighter, but gets the desired result nonetheless"
"goes leg side this time, gets a thick inside edge on the swing as Behardien swoops in at deep midwicket. Good work in the deep"
"play and a miss. Looked to smash the leather of that short ball outside off, carries waist-high to Saha"
"dabs it to point and sets off for a run that wasn't on, <b> Axar with a shy at the stumps from point. </b> A direct hit and Kohli was gone! Opportunity missed"
"Amla was in business for a couple of seconds at deep midwicket, but it just eluded him. Tossed up and Gayle went for the slog across the line, ended up dragging it, but still found enough bat on it"
"short, wide and he steps out to thump that behind point. Opened the bat face late to play it to the right of the fielder. Excellent awareness"
plays a half-pull to wide long-on
"flat hit for six. For a while, it looked it he didn't hit it well, but I was wrong. This one just flew off the middle. Gets to the pitch of the ball and goes inside-out, struck superbly over long-off. Makes it look ridiculously easy"
stays inside the crease and punches it to long on
"quicker one on off stump, pushed back to the bowler"
"driven uppishly, falls short of Vijay at cover"
"fires that one into middle from round the stumps, cuts it hard to point"
late cuts it to short third man
"touch short, he pulls but hits it straight to deep square leg"
"that's sped away into the cover boundary at the rate of knots. Much before Axar could turn to get back to his run up. Inside-out hit, a flat hit. Tremendous power"
"cheeky from Cheeku! And the result is the same. It was fired in full outside off, Kohli changes the bat grip to play the delicate reverse paddle past short third man"
pushes it to cover with soft hands for a quick single
"nothing mysterious about that delivery. Too much flight, enough for Kohli to get to the pitch, free his arms and loft it over cover, one bounce into the boundary"
"carrom ball on middle, Kohli goes back and defends"
"slapped, but straight to Vijay at cover, good stop, swift movement to his left to effect that one-hand stop"
"full toss on middle, a waist-high one, and he's pulled that over deep midwicket. <b> Free-hit coming up as well. </b> Looked like it slipped out of his hand"
"he's drilled that down the ground, flat-bats the tossed up delivery into the sightscreen. Cariappa has no answers. Imperious from Kohli"
punched towards deep midwicket. Can you imagine? This man is batting with seven stitches on his left hand
makes room and slaps it on the up to sweeper cover
"carved over cover, flew to Mohit on the bounce in the deep"
makes room and eases it to point with an open face. Slaps his bat on the pad for having missed out on a scoring opportunity
"yes sir, try stopping that but outside the ropes. Too full, Kohli sashays down the wicket and hammers it over cover, one bounce into the boundary. Wouldn't have mattered even if there were two fielders in the deep, he would have still gone through with the stroke. <B> Speed off the bat: 133kph </b>"
flicked to deep midwicket
"Diwali has come early for Gayle. His birthday is still a few months away too, but he'll gleefully accept gifts like those. High full toss outside off, he flat bats it over cover"
"checks his drive at the last moment, rolls to cover, deceived him in flight there"
"gets back into the crease and whips it to wide long-on. Another fifty for him, his 8475757th?"
"fires a full one outside off, tried to outfox Gayle by bowling it away from his swinging arc"
"goes for a slog, gets a thick inside edge towards deep square"
"sliding down leg, misses a faint tickle, good take by Saha down leg"
"fires a quicker one on middle and leg, punched to deep midwicket"
"he's cleared the fence effortlessly. Picks up the length ball on off and smites it over cow corner. Hailstorm, rainstorm, Gayle storm too!"
"lucky to get away was Axar, fired it full and down leg, Saha managed to move quickly to his left to stop five wides"
"and the Universe Boss unfurls his champppyan dance after swiping that over deepmidwicket. Gets down on one knee, underneath the flight and boom!"
"what's happened there? Kohli stepped out and went inside-out over long-off, Behardien was aware of the ropes behind him as he went for the catch, managed to take it but just lost balance as he crossed the ropes, and was in contact with the advertising triangle as he rebounded it back to David Miller. Full marks for the effort"
pulls and misses. The slowness of the surface did him in there. Was way too early into the pull
"two dot balls in a row, wow, that should be a Ripley's entry. Misses the reverse sweep this time"
compensates for two lapses with this one. Down on one knee as he hammers the flat delivery on middle over long-on
"he's hit that into Chennai, or has he? The sound of the bat was so loud and sweet as he made contact. Fearless stuff this. Stays inside the crease, down on one knee as he sweeps it over deep midwicket. Carnage!"
"swing and a miss. Looked to go over cover, the ball breaks away sharply from outside off"
"fires it full and outside off, Gayle lets it go"
"savage hitting! Too full and he simply swings through like he's having a net, smashed over long-on"
"and another one! This isn't a highlights package. People in the crowd will need helmets at this rate. Maybe even that may not be enough given the intensity of these blows? Gets underneath the flight and boom, over deep midwicket"
"slapped back to the bowler, good stop"
"fires it outside Gayle's swinging arc, at least that's what Axar thought, but he didn't account for Gayle's reach. Off side or leg side, his favourite area at the moment is deep midwicket"
"the party is over. Looks like Gayle was bored of going leg side. This time looks to flat bat that over long-off, but didn't quite get the elevation as Miller takes a comfortable catch. Walks back to a huge round of applause"
"flat hit over long-on for six! Continues on his merry way, so what if Gayle's gone? Right in the slot, too full on off and Kohli unfurls that swung like a golfer. Amazing"
helped down to fine leg
"way too early into the pull, ball deflects off his shoulder to Saha"
"they've got ABD for a duck. Would you believe it? Rare failure, but KXIP will take it. Lucky, but it doesn't matter. Smart bit of bowling. Sees de Villiers make room, so he slows the pace down and bowls it full and wide, de Villiers tries to reach out for it but can only end up dragging it back onto the stumps"
"slower bouncer, but directs it down leg, Saha gets an awkward bounce so they scoot through to a bye as well. Kohli back on strike"
"wickets or no wickets, there's only one way Kohli will play. Steps out to get towards the ball and then slaps it one bounce into the cover boundary"
"cross-court forehand this time to the short ball which he fetches from outside off towards long-on. <b> Oh, dear. Abbott has bowled a second bouncer. Rahul with a free-hit </b>"
"the extra delivery has been punished. Too full outside off, Rahul has enough room to open the bat face and play a one-handed carve behind point. Innovative"
"doesn't matter who comes at this stage, the ball will disappear. This one's a welcome full toss on middle and leg, and he's hammered that into the midwicket boundary, all along the ground"
"slower one on middle and leg, Kohli swivels back, rolls his wrists and helps it behind short fine leg. Half-trackers like those won't be missed. He'll have them for breakfast, lunch and dinner"
"there's a fielder at point, there's another at short third man. It's full outside off. What does Kohli do? Skips outside, reaches out for the ball, opens the face of the bat and directs it between those two fielders"
"yorker-length outside off, squeezed to point"
"slower yorker on middle, Rahul shapes to go over cover, somehow gets underneath that to play it towards cover"
"full toss on middle, he wrists it to deep midwicket"
"too full and tailing into middle and leg, smeared into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on, excellent running between the wickets. Rahul had to dish in the slide at the non-striker's end to make it back in time"
makes room and then drills the half-volley into the gap at wide long-off
"<b> fourth century of the season. </b> This man is unreal. Those wrists can fetch billions if an auction were to take place. Pumps his fist towards the dugout. Seven stitches on his left hand, but it doesn't matter. This ball was too full on the pads, and he simply got under that one by flicking it between deep midwicket and long-on. The crowd is up in arms. Breathtaking."
"bang, and dismissed. This one is a gift wrapped with plenty of 'makkhan' as they say. He's simply blasted that into the second tier at deep midwicket. Kohli was waiting for it deep inside the crease and simply swung through to get the elevation and clear the ropes"
"how hard has he hit that? This one was too full, Sandeep almost overcompensates, Kohli makes a bit of room and shows the straight bat to direct that down the ground into the long-off boundary"
"this was perhaps his first mis-hit and he's gone. This one was full but a touch slower on off stump, Kohli looked to go over long-off, but the bat face turned in his hand as he made contact as it lobbed towards Miller at long-off. Vijay, Miller and all the Kings XI players applaud him off the field. It was meant to rain buckets, it did. But wow, nothing like raining fours and sixes from Kohli's blade. Magical knock"
"easily done. Full and tailing into middle and leg, Rahul walks across the stumps and paddles it past short fine. Risky, but effective when it comes off. Play bold, indeed!"
drilled one bounce to long-off
"pulls and misses, banged in short it he rolled his fingers over the ball, Watson was into the stroke way too early"
"bunted straight to long-off, flat hit"
"makes a bit of room to play the short ball over the off side, ends up swatting it off the inside edge towards the man running in from deep midwicket instead"
"well, those are the advantages of training with AB de Villiers. This one was too full, and Rahul plays a reverse-flick into the third man boundary. Made his intention very clear even before the bowler delivered.Got down on one knee, changed his bat blade's direction and simply lent direction by opening the face at the last moment to lift it wide of the man. Wow"
"steps out and fetches the short ball from outside off, one bounce into the deep midwicket boundary"
"steps out and carves the full and swinging delivery on middle over cover point, Sachin Baby misfields at the ropes, Kohli isn't impressed. Have to say, it was a poor effort"
"slower one on middle, turns it wide of midwicket for an easy single"
"excellent work by S Aravind, throwing himself at short fine leg to stop that leg side flick"
"looks to drive, but there wasn't much room, squeezes it back past the bowler to mid-on"
"shapes away in the air from middle, Vijay pushes it to mid-off and scampers diagonally across the turf for a single"
"squared up by the movement from middle, Vijay feebly lent his bat to that, lands short of Gayle at first slip"
trademark Vijay shot. Too short and just a flick of the wrist to send that soaring over deep square leg. Picked the length up so early. Delight to watch when in full flow
"lucky to get away with a full delivery down leg side, Vijay gets  a faint tickle, but Rahul does well to dive full length to his left to effect a one-handed stop"
"there's the breakthrough. Vijay was trying to give himself room and slap that over the off side, but didn't have any room whatsoever, and ended up getting a thick inside edge onto the pad before the ball rolled onto the stumps."
drops it with soft hands to cover for a quick single
opens the face of the bat and steers it to Gayle at point or a quick single
"looks to flick, but played outside the line of the ball to get an inside edge that bounces in front of a diving KL Rahul. Looks like he's hurt his thumb there"
"reaches out to slice that half-volley outside off over point, Chahal chases it down"
swing and a miss. Beaten by the late away movement outside off
"fine shot, on the pads and he's flicked that in front of square over midwicket. Easy pcikings"
"top shot, this one has been lofted effortlessly over cover. Leans forward, not much feet movement, and just lifts it over the infield"
fetches the flick from outside off towards deep square leg
"dealing in boundaries at the moment. Nicely tossed up outside off, and Saha wasn't afraid to hit against the spin, struck it well, once bounce into the deep midwicket boundary"
"half-tracker on middle, and Saha swats that away with ease. Uses the depth of the crease to good effect, pulled into the gap between deep midwicket and long on"
"deceived in flight, but still gets a four. The thick edge beats the diving short third man fielder. Varun Aaron dived over the ball there"
"that one stayed low, and the leggie has his revenge. Or has he? Saha shaped to pull, perhaps gave away his intentions too early to allow Chahal to slide that one in, and once he missed, there was little hope. Umpires went upstairs to check the no-ball. Boy, it was cutting it too fine. Benefit of doubt to the bowler this time. Didn't look there was anything behind on the first point of landing. Even if there was, just a millimeter"
"slides one cross the batsman this time, Miller gets an inside edge as he defends"
flicked with the spin to deep midwicket
"poor direction this time, sprays it down middle and leg, lands in front of Rahul as he collects it down leg side"
"skips down the track to play the short-arm jab, but was cramped for room, beaten"
"looks to tickle it fine, the ball may have flicked the pad on the way through to Rahul. Arvind politely enquires, must say another poor call"
"punched wide of mid-off, Kohli charges in and fires a rocket throw at the bowler's end. A direct hit could have had Miller in trouble"
"pulled and pulled well. This was too short, he lined himself up to play the shot and crunched that"
"looks to hit it straight, but ends up slicing it towards Jordan, who comes running in from mid-off before diving full-length forward to complete a low catch"
driven wide of cover for an easy single
cuts it straight to backward point
"the look of disbelief on Miller's face tells you a story. This wasn't all that short, but Miller went through with the flt-batted pull in front of square. He picked the bones out of that one, but it was almost as if he forgot there was de Villiers lurking round the corner at long-on. That must have stung"
"banged in short, but just outside leg stump, some stretching exercise for the umpire"
"looks to squeeze that behind point, but jams his bat down awkwardly to hit it back down the pitch"
"short and wide outside off, crunched to Binny at sweeper cover"
"slower one on middle, turned to midwicket"
"can't get to the pitch of the ball, jabs it towards deep cover"
"slower delivery gone wrong, way outside off on the seventh stump"
"squeezed to Jordan at deep cover, once again has to reach out to make some contact"
"as clean as it can get. Presents the full face of the bat to loft it nice and clean, over long-on. Lovely strike that"
"looks to help it behind square on the leg side, the short ball was bowled well down leg, and he missed a scoring opportunity. Wide called though"
"that has been thumped down the ground. Too much pace, too full and all he had to do was get some bat on it to  beat mid-off. Quality stroke"
helped down to fine leg
poor bowling from Aaron. Can't give width like that. Enough pace on it for Gurkeerat to crack that behind point on this outfield that has copped a lot of rain.
works it wide of midwicket
"short of length delivery on middle and leg, tucked to Jordan at short fine leg"
"slower bouncer on middle, Gurkeerat gloves the to KL Rahul's left"
"through with the pull even before the ball got to him, misses the pull that bounces through to KL Rahul"
"Kohli takes a simple catch running in from long-off, but in doing so, he may have hurt his split webbing even more as the ball lands on his stitches. Coming back to the ball, it was floated full outside off, Axar threw his bat at that but couldn't only get the toe-end. Kohli is in visible pain"
"beaten on the hook, this was a rip-roaring bouncer at 135 clicks."
a direct hit from the edge of the circle at cover from Sachin Baby may have had the non-striker in trouble. This wasn't hit off the middle
"yorker-length on off stump, jammed to long on"
"slides one into middle and leg, tucked past square leg"
"tossed up outside off, Behardien slogs across the line when he could have hit it with the spin, only managed to hit it as far as AB de Villiers, who ran in a few paces from long-on to take a comfortable catch"
"big, ripping legbreak from the rough outside off, Gurkeerat swings, only to see the ball beat the outside edge. There was a feeble appeal for stumping, but the batsman's backfoot was well inside"
"cuts it to Aaron's right at backward point, but they steal a single courtesy a misfield"
"has he taken it? Superman de Villiers. This was hit well towards the long-on boundary, where de Villiers, mindful of the ropes behind him, judged a catch to perfection. Part-1 done. Then he realised he was going over, and nonchalantly lobbed the ball up, went outside the ropes, came back into the field of play to take it on the second attempt. Couple of years ago, you'd say it would have been an outstanding catch. It still is, but compared to some of his other efforts, this was a lot simpler."
"sliced away behind Aaron at point. Touch short, Gurkeerat rocked back and used the pace to play a lovely little cut shot"
stabs it towards point for a quick single
"fired into middle, flicked to deep midwicket"
"another quicker one outside off, squeezed to deep cover"
"full toss o middle, swung away to Jordan at deep midwicket"
"fired down leg, misses the flick, Rahul can't collect it cleanly either"
"into the blockhole, toe-ends the push to midwicket"
"angles one into middle from wide of the crease, worked into the vacant midwicket region, Rahul sprints across to stop that"
swipes and misses. Beaten by the sharp turn from outside off
"throws his bat at that, gets a thick edge that flies wide of Gayle at slip, into the third man boundary"
"this one's the slider that fizzes off the deck on middle and leg, Mohit is hustled for pace as he gets some bat on it, down past the bowler to long-on"
"swings north, ball goes south. There's turn away from off stump, bounce and Gurkeerat can only get a thick edge as he looks to go over long-off as Gayle takes a comfortable catch at slip."
