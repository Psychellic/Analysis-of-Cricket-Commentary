starts with a full-toss on off stump. Whipped down to long-on to bring Short on strike
"very full on off stump, almost a yorker, jabbed to extra-cover"
"lovely. Back of a length, googly, starts by angling across and turns further away from the left-hander. No feet as he looks to punch into the off side, beaten on the outside edge"
"another googly, shorter this time. Short has plenty of time to wait on the back foot and punch to long-off"
"third googly in a row. Starts very wide of off stump and Rahane looks to cut, but the ball spins in, cramps him, and skids through low to sneak under his bat"
"another shortish googly, spins in towards middle and leg. Deep square leg is back on the fence to keep Rahane's whippy pull down to one"
"flighted ball on off stump, swept along the ground to deep square leg"
"nicely bowled, wrong'un. Pitching on a good length outside off. Short goes hard at it, looking for the big drive down the ground, gets a thick inside edge onto pad"
another inside-edge onto pad. This time he comes forward for a gentle push into the covers and fails to read the wrong'un again. Rolls away into the short fine leg region
"down the track to a flighted ball outside off, drives hard to mid-off, just far enough to his right to pick up one"
"back of a length, slides on straight just outside off. Goes back and punches to extra-cover"
"slower now, another wrong'un. Turning down the leg side, but he doesn't pick it and the ball turns past his inside edge and hits pad as he looks to flick. Rolls away to short fine leg again"
so many wrong'uns already. This is a length ball turning towards Short's off stump. Goes on the back foot to push gently into the midwicket region - the bowler has to chase with the fielder back on the boundary
"tossed up outside off, Rahane goes for the reverse-sweep and misses"
"down the track and Chawla dangles it up wider and slower. Has to wait for it to land, brings his bottom hand into play to drag it down to long-on"
"another googly. Back of a length outside off, goes back to cut and the ball beats his outside edge"
"back of a length legbreak, turns into his pads, clipped to square leg"
"another googly, outside off, another attempted cut, another play and miss. Watching this, a lot of teams are going to throw their wristspinners at Short."
"slowish length ball on off stump and Rahane gets down low and sweeps hard and fine, beats short fine leg to his left"
"bam, two fours in a row. Jumps out of his crease early, slightly premeditated, to reach the pitch of this flat one outside off, and frees his arms to beat mid-off to his right"
"this one's just a bad ball. Short, outside off, and he slaps it away between backward point and cover point"
"four in a row. Almost a replay of the previous ball. Drags it down short on off stump, and he skips away to make room and cut it away into that gap between backward point and cover point"
a bit of flight now and he skips out to clip this to long-on
"flat and quick length ball on middle and off, and he goes on the back foot to clip towards mid-on"
"back of a length close to off stump, angling across the left-hander, whipped to mid-on with a turn of his wrists"
"back of a length again, on middle stump, whip-pulled to deep square leg"
"Rahane keeps playing his shots. He's probably read (and been angered by) our article questioning his place in the side. Down the track, and a shortish length on off stump ends up as a length he can lift over the bowler's head, to mid-off's right"
"short now, and it skids on with pretty decent bounce to cramp Rahane who was looking to cut. Chops it down late into the backward point region"
"in the slot, and Short finally hits one out of the middle. Slower ball, nice and full, just outside off. Just extends his arms through it to clear mid-off"
"back of a length, skiddy pace undoes Short's attempt to flick it off his legs. Hits him on the thigh pad and drops down by his feet, and Rahane calls early and is out of the blocks in a flash to steal a leg bye. Or did he get an inside edge on it?"
"tossed up, across the left-hander and drops onto off stump. Clipped to deep midwicket"
"tossed up wide of off, overpitched, and Rahane doesn't need to manufacture anything to put this away to the boundary. Just a nice stride forward and leans his weight into a drive to beat extra-cover to his right"
"a bit straighter now, the line, and he clips it down to long-on"
"back of a length on off stump, stabbed to cover"
"floated up slow and overpitched outside off, driven down the ground nicely, but long-off is in place to keep it down to one"
"googly, shortish and turning in towards off stump, waits on it and dabs to short third man for one"
"too full on off, eased down to long on"
"drifts in a shortish delivery into middle and leg, and Short tickles this past short fine leg. Easy pickings."
"shapes to play a full-blooded drive but is drawn well forward, still can't get to the pitch of the ball. Gets a thick inside edge onto the ground. Was very close to the boot even as Karthik took the catch and asked for the umpires to check upstairs. <strong>The soft signal was not-out.</strong> Replays confirm the ball clearly hit the pad-boot and bounced before Karthik grabbed that. Straightforward decision for the TV umpire."
goes back and across as he punches this down to long on
"some DK brilliance there to convert that into a wicket. Magnificent back-handed flick onto the stumps off his right hand. Smart bowling from Rana too. Saw Rahane step out, so he shortened his length and fired this in, Rahane looks to turn this to the leg side but ends up getting little bat on it. Karthik moves swiftly to his left, picks the ball up and flicks it back. I suspect Rahane took it easy and was done in by DK's speed. Stunning work."
"flatter and fuller on the stumps, eased to long on"
worked with the spin wide of midwicket
"shapes to cut but this skids through to cramp him for room, chopped into the off side."
"the wrong'un this time, the length just a touch short, punched to long on"
has he got him? Foxed him with this googly. Samson played for the one that spins back in and was struck on the back pad. May have pitched outside leg.
"too full on the stumps, worked to long on"
gets a good stride and smothers this.
late on the stroke. Looked to use the pace and steer this behind point but is beaten.
"skiddy back of length ball on off from wide of the crease, Samson punches back. Good one-handed stop by Mavi on his followthrough"
"ah, lovely. Square third man was no more than 10 yards away from the ball but couldn't get around. Just a hint of width, Samson opens the bat face to steer this behind point. Lovely timing."
"he's played the short-arm jab straight to Kuldeep at deep midwicket. Samson was cramped for room, hustled for pace as this angled back in to hit him high on the bat. Impressive effort delivery, the young man is elated. The dangerous Samson is gone."
Short was having a stroll like he'd do along the Yarra river back home. Saved because there's no direct hit at the striker's end from short midwicket. Just defended the ball and was casually wandering around the crease.
once again late on the forward defence. Gets a thick inside edge as he pushes outside the line of this delivery.
"slants in a full delivery on the stumps from wide of the crease, eased down to long on"
defends this full delivery from the crease to midwicket
"whips this full delivery to deep midwicket. Another mix-up, Tripathi had to dive full stretch to get back after Short said no quite late for the second. Correct call in the end, there was no second run there."
"squared up by the length, but Tripathi readjusts as he angles this down to third man"
"pulled away but not entirely in control, Kuldeep comes around to cut that off at deep backward square leg."
"this is a lovely whip. Too short on middle and leg, uses his wrists to play this behind square and beat deep square leg. <strong>The best shot Short has played this season!</strong>"
driven down to wide long off
too short and he's walloped this one bounce to the deep square leg boundary. Picked the length early. Key to the timing was he didn't look to smack this. All timing.
"defended back to the bowler, played this after it spun away."
gets a good stride in as he defends to short cover
works this full delivery on the pads to Curran at deep midwicket
tripe! Punished as Tripathi swivels back and slaps this to bisect long on and deep midwicket. Half-trackers too eas
slaps this away-going length ball back to the bowler
"works this behind square, towards Shubman Gill at dreep square leg"
glorious drive on the up but straight to sweeper cover
"<b> deep into the stands at deep square! </b> Backed away to slash but saw the bowler dish in a short ball on middle and leg, Short picked the length, swiveled back and hammered this. The bat speed was tremendous!"
"pure timing, pure pace. There's width on this short delivery, Short stays back inside the crease and then steers this behind point."
"slaps this short of length delivery, Kuldeep at wide mid-off does well to pull off a sliding stop."
driven towards Chawla at sweeper cover
forces this length ball from the crease to deep cover again
whips this down to deep midwicket as they jog the single
"slides back in and skids on, Short shapes to cut but ends up hitting it off the inside edge back to the bowler"
he's done him with a slider again. There's some drift back in. Short goes back to pull but is beaten by this 90kph delivery that goes straight on to beat his attempted whip and crash into the stumps.
works this off a thick inside edge to Curran at deep midwicket
"tossed up on middle stump, driven quietly down to long-off for one"
"short ball, and Tripathi's eyes must have lit up for a second, because it looked eminently pullable, but it kept low. Kept his eyes on it and shovelled it down to long-on instead"
"back of a length skidder, going with the angle towards off stump, punched down to long-on"
"short again, on off stump, and that's brilliantly done, super quick feet to jump right back and then swivel through the hips to pull into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on"
"flatter and fuller on middle and leg, pushed into the vacant midwicket region but Kuldeep sprints across to save the single"
"taken! Andre Russell, at short extra-cover, jumps and is at full stretch to grab this overhead chance two-handed, after Tripathi skips inside the line to try and loft this flighted wrong'un, pitching on leg stump, over the fielder"
"flat offbreak turning towards off stump, jabbed to midwicket"
looks to step out but Narine holds his length back slightly while hurrying him with his pace. Can only defend it back towards the bowler
"down the track again, this time gets closer to the ball to drive to long-on"
"offbreak turning towards middle stump, clipped gently to the left of deep midwicket. He has to come in a fair distance off the rope, and they use that time to sprint two"
"full now, on middle and off, jabbed to long-off"
"shortish on off stump, flat-batted to the left of long-on and they sprint another couple"
"wrong'un, pitching outside leg. Buttler picks it and reverse-sweeps, but straight to backward point"
"back of a length, slightly quicker. Another wrong'un hurrying on towards middle stump, punched to long-off"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to long-off"
"googly, but it's also a long-hop, but it doesn't get the punishment it probably deserves because there's a man back at deep forward square leg to keep it down to one"
"bang, Stokes is away. Tossed up on off stump, right in his arc, and even though he's hitting against the turn, and the ball has a certain distance to turn before it hits his bat, he still swings cleanly and clears long-on"
"flatter and fuller on middle stump, pushed down to long-off"
"Another dismissal against wristspin for Stokes. Excellent bowling from Chawla, saw Stokes coming early and tossed it wider and slower. He ended up too much under the ball and not enough behind it, and it was the googly too, spinning away from him and causing him to skew his attempted slog over mid-on to the man at cover, who moved backwards and to his left to get under the skier"
"back of a length, punched to sweeper cover"
"not short enough to cut, chops it straight to backward point"
"tossed up fuller now, outside off, driven to long-off"
"mishit. Wanted to drive this flighted off-stump ball through the covers, was a touch early on it and ended up dragging it out to deep midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to sweeper cover"
"fired in full at the pads. Probably knew he wanted to try and make room. Tries to flick, can't connect, the ball hits his pad instead"
"shortish on off stump, chopped away through point"
"some release for Royals, finally. Down the track, not quite to the pitch of Narine's carrom ball. Goes through with the straight loft nonetheless, and slices it a little, but that helps get it wider of long-off, Gill, who dives left at the rope, gets his hands to it, but can't hold on or flick it back into the field of play"
"dangled up slow outside off, turns away from Gowtham again. Slogs across the line and fails to connect"
"big offbreak now, looks to hoick into the leg side and gets an inside edge down into the fine leg region"
"drops it short now and Buttler punishes him, makes a bit of room to flat-bat this extremely hard, into the gap to the left of long-off"
"slower ball, full outside off, and Gowtham departs. Looks to hit it over cover, maybe, ends up slicing a simple catch to backward point"
"bowled him! Curran follows the slower one with a fast length ball, angling into off stump. Shreyas' feet are stuck, going neither forward nor back, and he plays with half a bat, opening the face to try and dab it fine. He misses, and Curran knocks out his off stump"
"back of a length outside off, this is a better ball to play that late dab against, and Kulkarni gets off the mark with a single to third man"
"full on middle and off, jabbed down to long-off, and guess what, Curran's overstepped. But Kulkarni will be on strike for the <b>free hit</b>."
"low full-toss angling into middle and leg, cramps him for room and all he can do is stay leg-side of the ball and jab to the left of cover"
"wide slower one, fairly full. I think Buttler was looking to stab that through point, but ended up playing too early and ended up flat-batting it to long-off instead"
"low full-toss outside off, and that brings Buttler's incredible bottom wrist into play. A table-tennis-style whip enables him to pick up a flat one-bounce four to the left of long-on"
"full outside off, Kulkarni had made himself room and threw his hands at the ball, ended up slicing it chest-high to Lynn at backward point, and he <b>drops it</b>. Allows Buttler to come on strike too"
"shortish, slanting away into a fifth-stump line, pulls it along the ground to the left of deep midwicket, and they hurry through for two"
"looks for the wide yorker, and from that round-the-wicket angle, there's a big danger of slanting it too wide. That's what he ends up doing. Buttler doesn't even try to go after it"
"and again. A misdirected wide yorker from round the wicket, ends up bowling it too wide. Karthik had been gesturing to him to bowl a wide yorker, with his right arm extended outwards"
"bangs it in short now, and gets the angle right on this occasion. Within reach of Buttler to play a shot, but perhaps not the pull he was looking for. Plays and misses"
oh no. Another wide full one - a slower one too - and it ends up waaaaay wide of off stump
gets the wide yorker right this time. Buttler reaches out and slaps it to deep point. Just about manages to turn around and hurry back for a second
"slants it away from Buttler's off stump again - not a yorker this time but quite full again. Flat-batted down to long-off and they chance the second just to keep Buttler on strike. Mavi fails to collect the throw cleanly, but he still collects it in time to catch Kulkarni short of his crease"
"slower ball, full and wide outside off, and Buttler swings and misses, looking for the long-off boundary. Looked tight, but the umpire decides not to signal wide. Good last over from Mavi, stuck to his plan despite bowling all those wides, and found his rhythm in the end"
"drifts in from wide of the crease, Narine lunges forward to defend, get a thick inside edge past midwicket"
"flatter length ball on middle, defended back"
tries to cut but this spins back in sharply from length to cramp him for room and sees the off and leg  stump flattened. The skid has done the trick.
"slides back in to hit him on the thigh pad, Uthappa was looking to whip this off his hip"
punches this straight to mid-off
goes back into the crease and steers this shortish delivery to point. Top first over from KG
"starts off with a full delivery outside off, Narine looks to squeeze this behind point but is beaten"
"just chips this over extra cover. Narine wasn't to the pitch of the ball but looked to hit through the line. The ball stopped on him just a touch. Narine turned blindly for the third, but saw Uthappa put his hand out in the nick of time."
"looks to slap this over point, toe-ends it to cover instead"
"thick outside edge as he attempts to slash over point, but this one flies over Buttler's outstretched hands behind the stumps. Streaky boundary"
"slower length ball on middle, punched to mid-off for an easy single"
works this length ball towards midwicket. Planted his front leg across a long way as he played that
"drops short and Uthappa dispatches that. Rocked back, opened up the off side and cut this through wide mid-off. Solid power"
"drops short again, this time he punches this straight to cover"
"not quite timed well enough, mistimes this attempted pull on the bounce to Stokes at long on"
"hint of width again, punches this straight to the edge of the ring at cover"
makes a bit of room and punches this length ball straight to cover point.
steps out and works this indrifter down to deep midwicket
"looks to carve this behind point, but is beaten. Too full again from Dhawal"
"cracked away but can't pierce the off side ring, hit straight to cover point"
"slower delivery but the length is too short, Narine backs away and slaps this one bounce to the point boundary. Held his shape nicely"
"cracked! There's cover and cover point but each one only saw the other's face. No one moved. Length ball, Narine cleared his front leg and walloped that through the line"
"slower length ball on middle and leg, this time Narine cleverly waited for the ball to arrive before unfurling a flat-batted pull to the midwicket fence. Dhawal assumed he'd look to cut again and bowled it closer to the stumps. Didn't matter."
superb yorker-length delivery that beats Narine for pace as he looks to squeeze this behind point
"oh, and guess what? <strong>It's not a cutter!</strong> Length ball angling away, defended back."
"imperiously pulled, one bounce to the midwicket boundary. Slower delivery, the off-cutter but too short. Uthappa had enough time in the world to line himself for that before giving it a proper whack"
looks to run this down but is beaten by the away-going length ball
belted back over the bowler's head. Length ball and Uthappa slapped this away with disdain. That raced to the fence even before Unadkat could turn back on his followthrough
deliberately done! Very clever from Uthappa. Opens the bat face at the last moment to use the pace and angle to tickle this past the keeper to the third man boundary.
"sumptuous straight drive, but this is an outstanding stop by Laughlin at mid-off. Ran quickly towards his right and then put out a full-length dive to cut that off"
"short and angling down, Uthappa helps this down to beat short fine leg. Too easy. Not an ideal start from Laughlin"
punches this length ball down to long on
gets on top of the bounce and tucks this towards square leg
"floats this full outside off, defended wide of mid-off as they scamper a quick single"
"backs away to go over cover but the bowler does well to bowl this full and straight towards his toe, squeezed to the leg side"
follows an outstanding yorker with a half-tracker. Narine uses the depth of the crease to muscle this pull over deep midwicket.
"touch short, this spins away sharply from outside off though, bunted to the off side"
goes back into the crease and defends this length ball
"half-tracker that Uthappa pulls way over the deep midwicket fence. Too easy, pie that was asking to be hit"
worked with the spin towards deep midwicket. This was a googly
"spins away from length on middle, defended back"
"floats this wide, in the swinging arc, Narine lofts this over cover. Stokes with a sliding stop at wide long-off"
beaten for pace. <strong>146kph.</strong> This length ball angles back in to hit him on the back thigh as he tries to work this to the leg side.
squeezes this flick towards deep midwicket
"looks to back away and slap this over cover, but gets a thick outside edge past the keeper, no chance for third man. More frustration for the Royals"
"full outside off, dug out to beat a diving Rahane at cover"
"late on the stroke, looked to angle this behind point. Length was too full. Beaten"
beaten as he looks to steer this behind point. Bounce nearly did him in.
"slow legbreak on leg stump. Looks to stretch out and flick, misses it, and it rolls off his pad into the square leg region"
"flatter length ball close to off stump, presses forward, opens his bat face, and dabs to short third man"
"down the track and Shreyas bowls it slightly shorter, a slider going across him towards off stump. Pushed gently to mid-off"
"run-out ends the partnership! Another skiddy slider. Narine misses the reverse-sweep, gets hit on the pad, and he ambles out of his crease looking for a leg-bye as the ball rolls towards short third man and Buttler goes up in appeal for lbw. He realises too late that the single isn't on, and by the time he turns around the throw from Jaydev Unadkat is nearly in Buttler's gloves"
"back of a length, wrong'un, turning towards off stump. Goes on the back foot to work it through forward square leg"
"tossed up on middle stump, and it's right in Uthappa's arc as he stretches out and slog-sweeps it waaay over cow corner"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, waits on it and stabs firmly towards backward point, who makes a diving stop but lets the ball roll away to allow the single"
"oh no, poor fielding on the rope from Unadkat. Length ball attacking the top of off stump and Uthappa slaps it in the air, on the bounce, towards deep point. Unadkat falls to his right to try and stop it, and doesn't cover for the ball spinning away from him - should have known because Uthappa sliced it"
"length ball on the stumps, clipped away through midwicket"
"in the blockhole on off and middle, clipped down to long-on"
"oh my god. Is that the widest leg-side wide in the history of the universe? Thankfully for the keeper, it was a slower ball gone wrong, and it gave him plenty of time to move to his left and stop it running away for more runs"
"full on leg stump, clipped to long-on"
"short, a bit of width, but there's a man at deep point to stop Rana's cut"
"Another misfield. Down the track and he bowls it quick and angling into the batsman. Drives it back towards him, and he lets it slip through his fingers and roll towards long-off"
"goes on the back foot to punch it, but it keeps low and he jabs it back to the bowler instead"
"length ball on middle stump, whipped to long-on"
"fullish on middle stump, gets forward to clip it away through square leg"
"ooh, good ball. Flat length ball and Uthappa jabs at it in front of his body, nearly pops back a return catch. Doesn't carry, though"
"appeal for stumping here. Fired in quick outside off, and Uthappa misses the sweep having stretched out quite far. He lifted his foot momentarily, but grounded it well in time"
"low full-toss close to off stump, and that's beautifully timed by Rana. Just opens his face slightly and sends it racing away to the left of the man sprinting from deep point"
"slower length ball on off stump, presses forward and defends studiously"
"back of a length on off stump, punched towards extra-cover, and then takes off for the quick single. Rahane moved quickly to the ball, but he took a touch too long to turn and aim at the bowler's end, and Rana would have made it home even if he had hit the stumps"
"slower ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"low full-toss outside off, a bit of outswing on that, flicked deliberately in the air, without too much weight on the stroke, so it drops well short of deep midwicket"
"yorker on middle and off, shuffles across to clip to deep square leg"
"flat length ball angling into the pads, and Rana tucks it away neatly, nice and fine and the man at deep backward square leg is too far from the ball to even be in the frame"
"angled into the pads again, and this time he sweeps it out to deep backward square leg"
"has Stokes caught that cleanly? The umpires are going to have a look. In Uthappa's slot for the lofted drive, which he hits hard and flat, but Stokes is on the boundary at long-on. He was stepping backwards as he took the catch over his head, about to tumble past the boundary, so he flicked it in the air, then stepped on the rope, and managed to return to the field of play and complete the catch comfortably enough in the end. Perhaps unwise of Uthappa to take on the deep fielder in this situation, but he's played an excellent hand for KKR"
"shortish outside off, slapped away to the left of deep point"
"shortish again, this time he slaps it to the right of the man at deep point"
"shot! That's speared in very full, outside off, and he opens his bat face deftly to pick up a boundary to fine third man"
"long-hop on off stump, pulled hard and flat, on the bounce to Stokes at deep midwicket"
"back of a length, sliding on towards middle stump. Karthik goes deep in his crease and tucks it away towards fine leg, to the right of the man on the boundary - picks up his third double in four balls"
"tossed up outside off, comes forward for a defensive push towards point"
"googly, quite short, cramps him a little and he opens up to pull to deep backward square leg"
"googly turning towards off stump, goes back to punch to long-on"
"flat googly, mostly just goes with the angle into the pads, clipped to deep midwicket"
"shortish, slanting across to off stump, punched to the right of deep point, and he picks up another two"
"short again, not so much width this time, pulled to deep midwicket"
"length ball on off stump, a bit of nip back in to tuck up Rana. He dabs it gently to the off side of the pitch and takes off looking for the quick single. Unadkat moves quickly in his follow-through, picks up and throws at the batsman's end and misses. Would have been comfortably out if he had hit, despite the desperate dive. Really didn't judge that at all"
"short now, gets off his toes to slap it on the bounce to sweeper cover"
"slower ball, back of a length on off stump, defended back down the pitch"
"another slower one, on middle stump this time, and Karthik steps across to flick. Short fine leg dives left to make a good stop"
"back of a length on off stump, Karthik tucks it smartly into the vacant midwicket area. Laughlin gives chase, with the fielder on the boundary, and they scamper two more. From this end, the leg-side boundary is quite long, so Karthik played the field cleverly"
"full outside off, Karthik drives hard, extra-cover dives left to stop it"
"length ball on off stump, clipped down to long-on"
"fullish on middle stump, makes a bit of room and punches to short extra"
"full, slanting away from the left-hander's off stump, a bit of swing away too, jabbed firmly to the left of deep point"
"shortish outside off, slapped away to third man"
"down the track to the ball angled across to off stump, and clips it deliberately in the air, one bounce to Stokes at deep midwicket"
"in the blockhole close to off stump, looks to make room to drive through the covers, ends up squeezing it down to long-on instead, off the inside half of the bat"
"short on middle and leg, and Karthik steps across and pulls it over the backward square leg boundary - picks out the short boundary on that side, and clears it despite only managing a 64m hit. Didn't look to hit it too hard, just helped it and found the gap to the right of deep square leg"
"back of a length, angled across to off stump, punched to deep point"
"shot. Unadkat looks for the off-stump yorker this time and doesn't miss his length by much. But Rana takes a big step back into his crease to create some swinging room, and simply lifts it over mid-off"
"slower ball on middle and off, fairly full. Lets it come and opens his bat face to steer to deep point"
"short, angling into off stump. Rana moves across to play a short-arm jab out to deep square leg"
"back of a length, angling into the body, whipped away to the left of deep backward square leg"
"and he sends down a stump-high full-toss outside off stump. A misdirected yorker. Karthik carves it away square, a long way to the left of the only man on the off-side boundary"
"back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face and dabs gently towards short third man"
goes wide of the crease and angles a bouncer into the stumps. Carries at shoulder height to Buttler after Rana makes room and fails to connect with his uppercut
"back of a length on off stump, Rana dabs it down to third man. He moved away from his stumps initially, then shuffled across them again to get close to the line"
"full on middle stump, makes room to drive to the right of long-off. KKR have picked up a million twos today"
"full, well down the leg side, Rana misses the attempted swipe over short fine"
"slower ball on leg stump. Was he looking to chip that towards long-off? Maybe. Ends up miscuing it, driving it on the bounce to long-on instead"
"slower ball, full outside off, whipped wristily down to long-on"
"slower short ball outside off. Makes a bit too much room, ends up having to reach for it, at shoulder height that too, and chops it down towards point"
"and that is that. Gets a full ball from Laughlin, just outside off, and he clears his front leg and launches the winning hit high into the Jaipur sky, well beyond the long-on boundary"
