"hard length on fourth stump, clipped to straight midwicket. 86mph/138kph"

"looks for a yorker wide of the off stump to start, down at 83mph, and Fakhar squeezes this out through extra cover for four! Billings, who is quick, gives chase, but won't cut it off. Turned into a low full toss - a freebie for Fakhar"

"full toss on leg stump, very loose ball, but only clipped out to Banton at deep square again. Curran escapes!"

"tossed up outside leg, clipped behind square for an early single"
"full on fifth stump, driven firmly out to long-off"
"<strong>huge legbreak which rips past the bat!</strong> Magic ball, enormous turn past Babar's outside edge and he does well to keep his back foot down as Bairstow whips the bails off"
"legbreak, too short though and Babar rocks back to nail this through midwicket for four! Stayed low off the pitch, so Babar had to wait and drag this in front of square, beating the man at cow corner"
"clipped into the leg side, Billings races in from the fence to prevent the second"

"pushed wider outside the off stump, out the front of the hand, <strong>pulled <em>miiiiiiles </em>up into the air</strong> and Banton runs in from the long-on boundary to pouch it! England finally get a breakthrough, Banton clinging onto the high ball. Pushed through a little quicker from Rashid, up at 57mph, and Fakhar didn't quite get the connection he was after"
drags a pull out to deep midwicket
"flat legbreak, drops short, but Hafeez can't beat the man in the deep"

"tossed up outside off and spinning away, cut for one off the back foot"
"<b>cracked through midwicket!</b> Goes back and gets hold of Rashid, hammers this on the pull"

"shortish outside off, cut through point to the sweeper"

angled in and flipped leg side
slower ball and flicked to the leg side
"sliced behind point, Malik wants a second, could be tight... <b>but Bairstow hasn't collected the ball cleanly!</b> Malik looked to be struggling as Billings fired in the throw, but the keeper wasn't in control as he broke the stumps. And they stole an extra run, too as the ball rolled away"
"<b>clatters a high full toss over deep backward square!</b> Latches on and kerplunks this into the stands! That's a no-ball, to increase Curran's pain"

"short, flipped over backward square leg"
"fires in a full-pace yorker wide of off, jams down on it towards backward point for one"

"low full toss, Malik is across and whips a couple towards deep midwicket, <b>that's the 50 stand up</b>, from just 26 balls"
"<b>blasts it straight to extra cover!</b> Jordan misses the yorker but gets the wicket... Malik was looking to do as he did first ball of the over and chip down the ground, but managed to slice this slightly, Morgan leaping to take a good catch high to his right"

"<b>belted down the ground!</b> Length outside off and Hafeez makes room to slap it over mid-off, picks up another boundary"
"fuller, outside off and he mistimes this, dragged into the leg side"
"pitched up, not quite yorker length and Iftikhar heaves across the line, deflects it back to the bowler... they are going to check whether the ball came straight off his boot, before Mahmood caught it. But no, definitely went into the ground"
"speared in full, Mahmood goes up for lbw, nearly rolls on to the stumps anyway... <b>then Bairstow throws down the non-striker's end!</b> Was Iftikhar ball-watching? He had to get his skates on after Hafeez called him through, they then stole another as the ball ran away. In fact, England <b>reviewed</b> for lbw, which was a terrible call, as it pretty much hit him outside leg stump; and Iftikhar was <i>just</i> in at the other end, too! So a lot of sound and fury signifying <del>nothing</del> two leg byes"

"another low full toss, swivelled away through backward square leg, Gregory does well to prevent it going for four"
"<b>plinked to cover</b>, Morgan takes a simple catch and Hafeez is done for! Maybe a slower ball from Curran, got right underneath it and barely travelled beyond the edge of the ring... but still been a cracking knock from Le Prof"

"leg-stump yorker, Rizwan and Shaheen <strong>go up for the lbw</strong> but it's not given. Babar shouts 'shabash, shabash!' but won't send it upstairs, might have pitched outside leg? Yep, just outside, I reckon"
"full and straight, clipped to straight midwicket and Banton sets off for a sharp single"
"oh my goodness, <strong>Tom Banton you are a freak!</strong> Imad has tied England down so well in this series, so Banton swaps round and reverse-sweeps this for six over third man! Shot boy! Clears the rope with ease"
heaves into the leg side through midwicket for a couple more
"Banton gives himself room, Imad follows him and is clipped to mid-on for a sharp single"

"skids on with the angle, Bairstow tucks out to deep square for one"
"length on off stump, heaved into the leg side... and <strong>it falls into no-man's-land</strong>. Babar was running back from inside the ring but couldn't quite get back underneath it. Premeditates the slog-sweep, no timing but gets away with it"
"slower ball to start, length on the pads and tickled fine for four! Freebie for Bairstow to start, worked away off the hip and it runs away. <strong>England flying</strong>"
"length on leg stump, Bairstow frees his arms and <strong>short-arm jabs this over long leg for six</strong>! Horrible start for Amir, too straight, and Bairstow cashes in"
"slower ball, banged in as Bairstow gives himself room, steering straight to point in the ring"

"full slower ball, dug out into the covers. 75mph/120kph, pushed down across the side of the ball"

"full toss outside off stump, plinked over mid-on's head and plugs in the outfield. <strong>Called a no-ball for height</strong>"
"length outside off, Bairstow <strong>heaves out towards midwicket</strong> but his bat skewed in his hand and it plugs in the outfield. Just a couple"
"struck on the pad, Afridi <strong>belts out an appeal</strong> but not sure this had much going for it - sounded like bat first, and might even have pitched outside leg. Babar doesn't fancy the review"

Full legbreak, pushed through, and top-edged miles into the air as Bairstow got down to sweep"
"Banton gets down to sweep, he's struck on the pad and given! <strong>Banton reviews</strong> but this looked good to the naked eye. Looked like the googly, Banton got down to slog-sweep but was slightly late on the shot. No bat involved, was the impact in line? Umpire's call on impact, hitting middle stump three-quarters of the way up, and Saggers can stick with his original decision. <strong>Shadab gets two in two!</strong>"
"legbreak, steered towards point with an open face. Malan thinks about a single but Morgan barks 'NO!'"
"legbreak, struck on the pad, <strong>loud appeal from Shadab and Babar reviews</strong> after Saggers says no. Looked like it might have taken the inside edge on first viewing, but Ultra-Edge says no bat involved.

"googly on a length outside off, cut firmly out towards deep point"

"pushed through and again there's width for Malan, he cuts powerfully but deep cover gets around to this one"
flicked through midwicket playing back
<b>cut behind point and he gets it through!</b> Morgan making room and he breaks the wrists on a late dab for four... Ifti's figures take a hit as England bounce back
"on the stumps, slugged back down the ground to long-on"
"<b>blootered into the stands at deep backward square!</b> That was a cutter, I think, but he picked it and swished up and over, in his arc and that's a lovely connection"

"in the arc, <b>out of the park!</b> Morgan unleashes a trademark slog-sweep off the fast bowler, low full toss and he's <i>belted</i> almost out of the ground at deep square! <b>Fifty for England's captain</b>, and he looks to be taking his side home here"
"full outside off, Morgan chops down on it, sets off for one anyway... and has to dive for his ground as <b>Shaheen toe-pokes wide of the stumps in his follow through!</b> Would have been tight, think Morgan was back"
"short, swivels on the pull, <b>sends it skittering away through backward square!</b> Uses the pace on the ball and beats the man in the deep leg side"

"<b>picks out deep backward square!</b> Is that the wicket that sparks Pakistan? Swings for the hills but doesn't quite get hold of this one... Straight down the gullet of the man in the deep. Morgan hasn't quite finished the job, but it's been a sparkling knock"
"good length, beats the bat outside off as Malan hangs in the crease"
