"lovely first delivery, shape on a full length and bending in from outside off, under-edged into the crease"
a cautious push into the covers on bended knee
"Lalor has got his inswinger going so far, this one curls back in on an off-stump line, solid press of the bat to mid-off"
"turned around in the crease and nurdled to midwicket, lots of shape to keep the honest so far"
"too wide this time, and Philippe <strong>whisks a flashy cut through third man!</strong> Deliberately and excellently played"
"full and straight, head over the ball to defend back down the line"
"<B>strikes first ball!</B> It's all about the angle for Hatzoglou as he shapes his leggie back in on a wickedly tight line, Edwards is down on one knee to sweep but misses, and the finger goes straight up. That looked plumb, and what an arrival this chap is making!"
"another tricksy delivery, shape on a full length, Vince blocks cautiously from deep in the crease"
whipped out to deep midwicket as Hatzoglou drops a touch short
"flicking with the angle into the pads, a sharp single to the man on the 45, but safely home"
fired past the leg stump this time as Vince threatens to advance but checks his intentions
"much wider line, dragging Vince into a firm drive to deep cover. That's a very tasty opening gambit from the leggie"
"<B>loose and wafty!</B> Vince at his worst is basically Vince at his best, minus the outcome. Flat feet and a fling of the bat, hits nothing but thin air on a tight line"
<B>that's more like it!</B> Stays leg-side of the ball and flings those hands through the line once more. Cuffed past point!
eased out to midwicket
"a crashing cut to point but Vince does well to intercept, and immediately expounds on his efforts on the player mic to the commentators"
"a french-cricket flick to the leg side, as Lalor aims a touch straighter"
"hopping down the leg side, but saved from a wide by a thin deflection off the hip. Another tidy over is ticked off"
"<B>width and slashed so fine through third man!</B> They all count. Not where Philippe was aiming but he'll take it, a snick past the keeper"
"full, straight and threatening, zippy through the air"
whipped off the legs to the on-side
"a bottom-handed clobber across the line, thumping the ball at the bottom of its arc out to midwicket"
"lovely fast-footed cut past backward point, jumping into his stance as Hatzoglou offered too much width. A tumbling stop on the third man boundary"
"hacked high and not very handsome, out into space at deep point once more. The runs keep coming in less than conventional fashion"
"full length, dipping into the blockhole and clipped to short midwicket"
a fraction slower on the same blockhole-bothering length. Short midwicket is on hand again
"short and not terribly wide, but <B>crashed on the up through the covers!</B> Enough time to pick his spot and slather it to the rope!"
"fuller length, and nurdled off the toes to square leg"
"knuckleball by the looks of it, just wobbled a touch through the air on a very full length, pumped to mid-on"
"full toss, poor finish to a decent over, and Vince pummels it through midwicket, in front of the despairing sweeper. A couple of loose balls and a good over gets taken down"
"width on a full length, drilled to mid-off"
"low full toss, outside off, picked up with a swing across the line out to deep midwicket"
"lovely delivery, really bent his back on that one, a fast length ball, inches inside the tramlines. Can't connect with those"
"a slightly off-balance claw into the leg side, reaching for the ball outside off and losing his shape in the process"
"<B>edged and gone!</B> That extra pace does the trick, and this time on a much tighter line. Real kick off the deck from the cross-seam delivery, 149kph, and Vince's attempt to run the ball down through third man ends up in the keeper's gloves!"
"wafty on a full length, and that looked mighty close to a snick as Richardson fizzed it through to the keeper. Excellent over to keep the Sixers in check"
"round the wicket, dipping on a good length outside off, chiselled to the leg side for the single"
"<B>clipped back to the bowler and dropped!</B> Ooh, that's a big miss. Philippe was beaten in flight and found a fat leading edge as he flashed across the line. The ball wasn't travelling too hard, but it came at head-height and startled Webster as he flung his hands up"
flicked back to the bowler on the bounce this time
nudged out to the leg side to wisely get off the strike
eased into the gap in the covers
tucked off the legs to complete an over that promised rather more for the Renegades
"back of a length, outside off, Hughes waits on the back foot and pushes into the covers"
"round the wicket this time, and eludes a flashing cut with some extra bounce outside off"
"an energetic pick-up from outside off, can't completely connect"
nibbled off the pads to midwicket
"shuffling at the crease, and thrashed with intent to deep cover, but this is a tidy over so far"
"on the back foot, eased out to deep midwicket and this time it's an easy second run as the shy comes in"
"full length, dipping into the blockhole, clipped uppishly to deep midwicket"
"probing length, on a middle and leg line, Hughes hits with the angle and accepts the runs to deep midwicket"
"<B>here we go, Philippe has seen enough!</B> Dancing feet to the fore, fleetingly reminiscent of Michael Slater as he gallops to the pitch and thrashes on the up over the covers!"
down on one knee and aggressively swept behind square
tucked off the legs for the single to midwicket
"advances to the pitch once more but doesn't quite get there, settles for a firm push to long-on"
thumped into the covers for another single
"bottom-handed steer to long-on, picked up on the full length outside off"
more aggression on the slog sweep but a fine sliding stop in the deep
fenced to the on-side
"<B>that's what Philippe can do!</B> Two steps to the pitch, and a ma-hoose-ive wipe across the line, down on one knee to massacre the length over cow corner! That's got the Sixers going!"
"and now the reverse sweep, <strong>superbly played!</strong> Hockey-style wrists, picking up the line outside off, and thrashing it firmly through backward point.  That's the over the Sixers needed"
"round the wicket, probing line on middle-and-off, tapped to square leg with a closed face"
another shimmying piece of footwork as Philippe steers a clip to midwicket
"<B>languid battery from Hughes!</B> He's been the silent partner so far, but that was forcefully played! Enough width to pound the bat through the line, clean through the covers"
a mistimed thump into the covers on this occasion
eased into the covers once more
"<B>oops, a big leading edge, but he gets lucky</B>. A low full toss, aimed through midwicket but plugging at mid-off"
"down on one knee, flogged around the front pad to backward square"
"<B>finds the gap at wide long-on!</B> A fraction too short, and a compact pull in front of square"
"extra zip on that delivery, and into the keeper's gloves past a slightly startled back-foot steer"
"flicked to midwicket, another single to the cause"
slides past the leg stump
"back of a length, outside off, Philippe rocks back to nudge the single to the leg side, and bring up an excellently crafted fifty, his eighth in 34 games"
"<B>banjaxed into the Sixers' dug-out!</B> Clattered off the back-of-a-length, over midwicket, so quick with the footwork, and that's a fine catch on the bench, high above his team-mate's head"
picked up into the leg side for another single
"dipping on a full length, clipped firmly to wide long-on"
"back of a length, and once again Howell is punished for dropping short! Philippe's feet are far too quick, as he snaps into position for the cut and batters it behind square"
punched to cover
"<B>that's right in Hughes' arc!</B> A lovely tempting length ball outside off, and Hughes has smoked that on the up over midwicket!"
"good response, a slower outswinger, shaping further away from the left-hander with every inch. Beats a flashing drive"
"<B>threading the needle through the covers!</B> Not a bad ball with so much protection on the drive, but Philippe's straight-batted push was perfectly weighted to bissect cover and mid-off"
"much wider line, Philippe flings the bat but that's too wide to reach. The fact that he went for it so emphatically is the only thing that deprives him of the extra"
hard-handed drive to cover
"outside off, Hughes is aiming into the covers but inside-edges to square leg instead"
"back of a length, Hughes leans back for a cramped pull to midwicket"
"full length, arrives as a low full toss outside off, and flashes past a flashy drive. Richardson applies a bit of a handbrake. His two remaining overs could be vital"
"<B>power cut!</B> There's the down-side of forcing the fielding side to bring their men into the ring... there are suddenly catchers in place for the muffed shots! Outside off from Hatzoglou, and Hughes' flaccid cut takes a top edge and plops to backward point!"
"drilled by Silk, lovely strike but an even better one-handed intercept at mid-off, diving back and across to wrap his fingers round the ball"
"<B>supreme from Philippe!</B> Striding to the pitch, opening the face, easing the ball up and over the covers"
nudged down to third man
"tipped off the pads, a single as the keeper gathers, a direct hit might have been interesting"
"two steps to the pitch once more, and a<strong> crashing square drive</strong> to the shorter point boundary! How costly is that dropped catch looking now?"
cracked into the covers. Five overs to go...
"back of a length outside off, and Silk meets it at the top of the bounce with a <strong>firm thump through the covers!</strong>"
"back of a length again, and too much width again! Silk slashes greedily through backward point and suddenly the Renegades' best bowler is feeling the heat"
"Richardson finds a fuller length, but with no third man, any width is asking for trouble! Silk kneels into an open-faced cut and glides surpremely through the gap"
"<B>four in a row!</B> Silky from Silk! He's seeing it like a comet now, Richardson still persists with a fourth-stump line, full length, and asks for another slice through the covers"
"a rare dot ball, some respite as Silk finds short cover with his drive"
"<B>five out of six!</B> Richardson has been eviscerated! Tremendous aggressive hitting, opening the face this time to guide the ball past short cover, and into the gaping wound of a gap in the deep!"
"a bottom-handed tonk to midwicket, just the single"
"a skip to the pitch, met on the full with a flick to the leg side"
"short, and Philippe's eyes lit up there, but he was too hungry to give it some humpty, and under-edged to the leg side"
tapped to third man to keep the strike rotating
"<B>power and placement!</B> Two men patrolling cow corner, but he bissects them both with a meaty flick off the legs"
"<B>godzilla-ed over the ropes!</B> Philippe is cantering towards his century now, meeting this on the full with a violent twitch of willow, high and handsome over cow corner!"
"whoops, that's a wild wide, swinging away, and missing the cut strip on the full! Nearly a no-ball ..."
"A pre-meditated shuffle to the off-side, anticipating the wide yorker, and fenced to third man"
"into the 90s with a tumble-ramp through backward square! Flicking with stunning wrists from outside off, and falling across his crease for extra impact as he did do!"
"width once more, and punched to cover"
"<B>h-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-g-e!</B> SIlk gets right underneath this one, targeting the midwicket floodlights, and nearly picking them out. It's coming apart at the seams for the Renegades!"
"over-pitched on the legs, and that's a majestic pick-up behind square. Kneeling on impact, and deflected with such poise, past the man on the 45"
"slapped out to cover, anotther single to keep the strike. Twelve balls to push this total beyond 200..."
"<B>clattered back at the bowler, whose right palm takes the sting!</B> Technically a dropped catch, but a saved boundary would be more accurate. Long-on sweeps round to gather"
"pumped on the up out to deep point, doesn't get hold of it, fortunately for Philippe as it lands safe"
"a roundhouse pull, and top-edged behind square, safe again as the batsmen cross"
"flicked to the leg side, Silk gets in a tangle, but sets off for the single as Richardson swoops and shies. He knows he's in trouble as he flings himself for the crease, but the throw goes wide..."
"slower short ball, Philippe waits on the back foot to pull urgently to leg"
"can't get this one away, but it keeps Philippe on strike for the final over, five short of his hundred"
"wide line, and <B>battered to short cover!</B> Philippe thought it was the money shot, he seemed to have anticipated the line and length, and connected sweetly enough, but Finch was lurking right in harm's way, and ends a tremendous aggressive innings!"
"<B>that. verily, is a long ball!</B>Predicting the wide yorker, and kneeling into a pre-meditated slog-sweep, high over deep midwicket!"
"<B> crashed through midwicket again!</B> Another kneeling pick-up from outside off, and this is a proper injection of impetus"
"better ball, pushing Christian back onto his stumps as he opens the face to run a single to cover"
"width on the full, and <B>belted through the covers to bring up the 200!</B> More or less the same shot that Philippe attempted first-up, but this one eludes the catcher and races to the rope!"
"a baseball biff out to deep midwicket, Silk finishes his innings with the same intent that he showed throughout. That is a formidable total"
"dobbed onto a good length, and tapped calmly to midwicket to open the account"
"round the wicket again, Finch strides forward with bat and pad tight and picks the single to cover"
another rotation of the strike as Marsh eases to midwicket
"<B>power from Finch!</B> Set in his stance early, back and across to create the angle, and a firm swing through the gap in the covers"
eased into the off side
"sharp fielding at point as Marsh cuts firmly. he's looking for the single, but has to turn for home, and is inches in as the bails are whipped off"
"full length, shaping into the legs, flicked very fine behind square"
"<B>dead for all money if the shy had hit!</B> Finch charged Sandhu, inside-edged his swing across the line, and was too far out to bother saving himself as the man on the 45 picked up and threw. He had more time than he though!"
"back of a length, a bit of tail through the air, but Finch opens the face supremely to guide the ball through the covers!"
"<B>a firm-handed flog, and straight to mid-off!</B> Just too tight to manipulate any angles this time, so Finch opts for raw power, and doesn't get it right. Scuffed to Christian on the edge of the circle, and that's a massive blow"
"back of a length, tight line, pushed to point as Harper finds his range"
"a cramped pull to the leg side, Harper is off the mark"
"<B>a leading edge and a brilliantly judged take at third man!</B> Harper took it on first-up, aiming Dwarhuis over midwicket, but the left-arm liine suckered his intentions. It's a horrid swirling chance down towards the on-rushing O'Keefe, who does tremendously. This chase is holed below the waterline"
"cramped on the pads, nudged to mid-on"
"back of a length, a roundhouse pull to midwicket"
"<B>another one bites the dust!</B> Rossouw gallops to the pitch, looking to thrash Dwarhuis off his length, but he's managed only to scuff it in the air to third man, and it's another brilliant catch - albeit very different. This one is faster, and flatter, and Brathwaite judges his dive forward perfectly to scoop it off the turf!"
"swinging into a pull, can't connect properly"
"whipped off the pads, behind square for the single. The rate is creeping towards two a ball already"
"rocks back to thump Manenti off his length, it's not the percentage cricket that Marsh was playing yesterday, but there's no time for that. Somehow gets it over Brathwaite at mid-off"
"pulled to the leg side, another single to the cause"
"drilled to cover, another single as the shy comes in"
"fired past the leg stump, Marsh swings into a pull but can't connect"
"<B>scuffed to mid-on, and this time Brathwaite shells a low chance!</B> That was easier than the one he gathered, and he seemed to have it for a moment, but the ball bobbled out as his elbows hit the turf. Can't that change the Renegades's fortunes (you know what, I somewhat doubt it...)"
"nudged to the leg side, can't elude the field"
"power on the back foot, and cracked hard to deep midwicket. Good shot for the single"
"nurdled off the legs, past mid-on, picking off Dwarshuis's fuller length"
"back of a length again, Marsh swings into a pull again. He's ticking over at the moment, nothing more"
<strong>extra pace and bounce!</strong> That zings through as Webster's hopes of a pull are gone before he can play it!
"line and length on off stump, and a <B>regulation nick to the keeper!</B> Renegades are in freefall now, that's a proper wicket, reward for a probing line and a cunning change of pace. Webster leans forward to cover his off-stump, and is done by a hint of nibble off the deck"
"width on a full length, and slapped through the clutches of point. Dwarshuis has brought the house down"
"tossed up from round the wicket, dipping in the blockhole, and clawed to the leg side"
"looped onto an off-stump line, a respectful nudge to midwicket"
"Marsh rocks back for a cut as Manenti drops a touch shorter, but the cover sweeper is in situ"
pumped out to long-off
lopped into space at mid-off as Brathwaite rushes in to gather from the rope
"eased along the ground to long-off, there's slim pickings for Renegades here"
"round the wicket, tonked to long-off as FMcG doesn't quite get to the pitch"
"another violent crack of bat from Marsh, but it's more sound than fury as point gathers"
"squared up on a tight line, patted back to the bowler"
"a high-elbowed drive to long-off, nothing aesthetically wrong with that, and it's another two runs"
"plays around a full one, half an appeal but there's bat in that"
"<B>a hideous hoick from Marsh</B>, but he was on a hiding to nothing. Full, straight, stump to stump, Marsh's head rocks back as he sizes up something optimistic over cow corner, but manages only to lose his off stump. I think it's fair to surmise that this contest is as cooked as a Christmas goose"
"on the legs, muscled through wide mid-on with enough legs to elude the fielder"
"<B>ping!</B> Top of leg stump from Brathwaite, as FMcT plans for a wildly over-ambitious inside-out drive, and is beaten on the inside edge by a perfect length delivery. This is a terrible run chase"
"<B>heave ho!</B> Length outside off, and another swing and a miss"
closes the face for a nudge to midwicket
"on the back foot, hopping into line and stabbed down into the crease"
"<B>stunning diving take at deep square and another one is gone!</B> Two in the over for Brathwaite, and it's the extra nip on his length ball that does it. Howell gets inside the line for the pull but manages only a top edge. Silk has so much work to do, but judges his sprint and sprawl to perfection to scoop it up!"
"<B>what is going orf out there!</B> That's a total non-event of a dismissal. A wide full toss, too wide to reach with any conviction, so there is indeed no conviction in a lobbed poke to point! End this farce now!"
a bottom-handed thump to the off side
"<B>stand and slog, under-edge into the leg stump!</B> Hatzoglou gallops to the pitch, doesn't get there, and miscues his mow, down into the crease. Ping go the zing bails for the umpteenth time. This is abject!"
"<B>cuffed into the deep .... surely not.... no</B>. Falls short, a mishit fortunately"
better contact on the club to leg as deep midwicket gathers
"cuffed to long-on. Gosh, this is quite the non-event"
"<B>slogged to the leg side</B>, right underneath the shot, but Brathwaite has too much ground to gallop in his followthrough"
"panned out to midwicket, one bounce to the boundary rider"
"tantalising tonking from the tail, every ball is plugging just short of the fielders now. This time it's third man on an uppercut"
"biffed around the corner, hitting Brathwaite off his length to no great effect, but finds enough of a gap to come back for two"
"slapped through the line, over the bowler's head and into space at long-off"
<B>a swish and a miss!</B> Through the swipe like a dose of the pox. Misses leg stump by a whisker.
"right up to the blockhole, open-faced push to backward point"
"<B>absolutely Kane-ed into the stands!</B> On a good length, right in the arc for a carefree tailender to give it a bit of yeetage!"
"full length outside off, passes the bat on the full as Richardson misses out"
"round the wicket, <B>t-i-m-b-e-r!</B> All out for 60! That is an absolute massacre, and the Champions are properly up and running in this year's BBL after their false start on the opening night."
