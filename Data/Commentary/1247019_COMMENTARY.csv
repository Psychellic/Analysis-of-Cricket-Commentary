and it's a loose start. Strayed down legside and Rizwan helps it past fine leg for a first ball boundary
charges down the track and helps it to cow corner. Very alert running helps them get three. Quick start for Multan
"poor line again, allowing Lynn to flick it past fine leg. Off the pad, mind you"
eased to midwicket for a single
driven to mid-off
defended back to the bowler
"full and wide, driven to cover"
"swinging nastily back in, but it manages to clip Rizwan on the pads and trickle down to fine leg. Amir appeals vociferously and hopefully for a leg before, but that never pitched in line"
"<strong>absolutely gorgeous</strong>. Yorker that seamed ever so slightly away from the batsman and appeared to beat him. Amir is convinced that it took a slight edge, and reviews. The review shows no spike, though, so it's not out"
"brilliant bowling once more, <strong>this is a sensational over</strong>. Seams away and beats the outside edge. You don't say that often these days but Rizwan's been put through the ringer at the moment"
"<strong>huge appeal for lbw again from Amir</strong>! Rizwan shuffled across and it swerved back in and struck him on the boot. Umpire unmoved, so they review again. Pitching just outside leg so Rizwan survives"
yorker driven back to Rizwan. <strong>What a magnificent over that was! How did Rizwan survive it? Fantastic start to the game</strong>
"that's not quite the same quality, and it allows Lynn to prance down the wicket and smash him over long-on for his highest core in the PSL this season"
"slower ball, but it was short and wide. And very slow. Lynn set up and pummelled it through the point area"
driven through the offside
dabbed to short third but doesn't quite get it in the middle of the bat
angles that down to deep backward point
"too slow, too predictable. It sat up for the Australian to blister through the offside, and Lynn suddenly seems like he's coming back into form"
"Rizwan pokes it through the offside and gets the hell off strike, as any sensible man would"
"and Lynn slashes at it, but as is key, he slashes hard enough that the top edge <strong>carries well over short third man and sails away for a boundary</strong>"
<strong>Amir went short and Lynn went up and over fine leg for six!</strong> Seemed like he was waiting for it and just muscled it over the rope
clever bowling. Saw him charging and sent a slower delivery wide outside off where he couldn't reach it
low full toss bludgeoned through extra cover. Amir's getting a pasting here now after a really good first over
dragged wide of off stump
and that's even wider. Turning into a bit of a horror over for Amir. Joe Clarke had to dive to ensure there weren't extra runs conceded
around the wicket and into the stumps. Lynn gets a single to keep the strike. <strong>18 runs off that over</strong>
"around the wicket, but it makes no difference. Lynn clatters him inside out over cover to <strong>bring up Multan's 50</strong>"
"<strong>gets the wicket, and Imad roars in delight/frustration</strong>. Tried to go over the man at cover again, but doesn't get the elevation this time and goes straight into the hands of Babar Azam"
"flat and fast, driven through the offside"
"rapped on the pads, going down legside"
"skidded on from Imad, driven back"
"squeezes a single to mid-off. Great over from Imad, and very brave to decide to come on while Lynn was going berserk. <strong>Excellent captaincy</strong>"
"prodded to mid-off and the pair exchange ends. The running in the in-field has been smart, but Karachi could have been more alert to it"
"exquisite placing of the ball. Saw that coming into him, and just steers it past short third man to pick up four. He understands how to use the field placing against the bowling side so well in the Powerplay now"
"that was in the slot, but Rizwan couldn't quite get it out of the middle. A single, and Maqsood has been spared somewhat"
"crunches it past cover-point, and a wayward bounce at just the wrong moment evades a diving fielder there. waqas is frustrated but that was just pure bad luck"
<strong>slapped back down the ground for four</strong>. Vince has begun rather brightly
"around the wicket, but it still goes for four. Tickled to short fine leg, and it was poor fielding by the man I couldn't quite make out. 18 off the over, and Multan have managed 72 in the Powerplay. Outstanding stuff"
driven to long-on
punched back to long-off
defended
worked away to midwicket. Smart running brings them a couple
uses his feet and clatters it back past the bowler but without quite the timing
"flat, tailing into the stumps. Vince makes room and slashes it through the offside. Just a single"
"deft little flick to midwicket, where the deep fielder fumbles, allowing Vince to get back on strike"
guided to point for a single
lands it on a length once more. Multan get one to long-on
nudged into the onside
"this is just abysmal fielding from deep point, and Dan Christian is fuming. It was a straightforward stop and he just went with his hand rather than get his body in line with the ball. That boundary has been donated, really"
single to long-on to round out the over
"steers a length ball outside off to midwicket, and this time Sharjeel puts in a dive and just about manages to prevent that one going for four, too"
opens the face to third man for a single
"a bit of a slog, that. No real foot movement and it sailed into the air. But as tends to happen so often, it lands safely"
"squeezes it past the keeper for four. Very fortuitous, that, it was a thick underedge and just evaded a flailing dive from Clarke"
"another quick single to short mid-off. They needed to hurry, but Rizwan was quick enough to ensure he wasn't in any trouble"
short and wide. Arshad is lucky it goes straight to the fielder. A misfield - again - allows them to come back for two
single down to long-on
"worked away to square leg, and <strong>that brings up Multan's 100</strong> in the tenth over"
"slower ball, single to extra cover"
"slower ball, Rizwan danced down the wicket and ended up yorking himself"
slower ball. Rizwan gets down on one knee and scoops it above fine leg for a boundary. Brilliant improvisation from the Multan skipper
"worked away to fine leg and excellent running fetches them two, and that's a strategic timeout, as well as time for Peter to take over"
"loosener to start after the strategic timeout, lands too short on fifth stump, slapped through the covers and it races to the rope."
"Vince is giving Nabi some stick right off the bat... and sailing over long-on! The Englishman charges a fullish length ball, gets to the pitch and whacks it straight down the ground."

"short outside off, tapped away for one."
"length ball in the slot on fifth stump at 144 kph, tries to whack this with a front foot pull over the leg side but it hustles him a bit and mishits it toward Nabi at long-on, he backpedals a few steps and settles two yards inside the rope to claim this reaching up in front of his beautifully presidential face."
good length ball flicked square to get Maqsood on strike with a tight single. Shy at the stumps was just wide <b>but Maqsood was out if it hit because his bat got stuck in the turf just an inch short of the crease line. </b>
good length ball flicked straight to the fielder square of the wicket.

"fullish length wide outside off, heaves this flat through midwicket and races away to split deep square leg and cow corner on the rope."
"short and wide, this time tries to flay this over cover instead of shuffling across to flick to the leg side, couldn't have picked out the cover sweeper any better where Ingram takes a basic catch at head height three yards inside the rope."
"good length ball on off, slapped back down the pitch and knocked down."
"length ball on middle, clobbered high and deep over midwicket. Not a bad way to get off the mark."
"slower legcutter lands too short on off stump, sits up for Maqsood to muller over long-on."

"full on the stumps, driven to long-off for a long single."
yorker on off stump dug out back to Christian.
"another yorker, this time jammed out through mid-off."
"<strong>gem!</strong> What a delivery by Christian landing on a good length on middle, just continues on with the angle. Rossouw was caught flat-footed and plays inside the line, off stump is knocked back."
"nearly another wicket! Length ball on sixth stump, tries to heave this over midwicket instead of going with the angle through cover and nearly pays the price as an inside edge just whistles past off stump and goes through fine leg to the rope."
"<strong>goodness! Arshad nearly heaves this all the way over the rope for six!</strong> No ball full toss sails not just 10 yards over the batsman but the keeper as well, it didn't land on the turf until halfway between the 30-yard circle and the rope before going over on one bounce. The dugouts are giggling uncontrollably."
"he pitched it this time! Full length ball on the free hit, flicked down the ground for a far less dramatic single."

"wide yorker again, was outside the guidelines but Khushdil stabs at it to toe it out to the point sweeper."
"yorker is on the money on off stump. Instead of trying to jam this out defensively to play for the next ball, Khushdil tries to whack this back over the bowler and now his happy heart has turned a bit sad on his way back to the pavilion as middle and off stump are rocked back."

"bouncer over the stumps, deemed legal by the leg side umpire. Afridi is not pleased on the legal determination after he was beaten hooking."
"chips this to mid-off! Yorker on the stumps, somehow Afridi wound up getting underneath this ball trying to flick through mid-on, splices it to Nabi at mid-off instead who takes a sharp catch tumbling to his left on the ring."
another wide too far outside the off stump guideline.
"full and wide yorker, jammed out to extra cover."
"full and wide, carves this over extra cover. The sub fielder relays in to the keeper Joe Clarke for what should be a straightforward runout to deny the second run, <strong>but Clarke panicked collecting the ball two yards in front of the stumps. Instead of just walking to the stumps to knock the bails off with ball in hand, he tries to flick it from point blank range and misses. Maqsood would've been two yards short had he just walked back to flick the bails off himself. </strong>"
"full on the stumps, jabbed out for a single through the ring."
what kind of shot is this?! Maqsood shuffles almost past the wide guideline outside off to flick a good length ball in between his body and off stump through fine leg. He essentially nutmegged the pace between his pads and off stump.
"full ball flicked high over midwicket, relayed back in for a simple pair."
"Sohaib stays in his crease this time, slower ball lands on a good length wide outside off and he can't flick this to the leg side."
"full toss on fifth stump at knee height, mishits this over midwicket."
"full on the stumps, driven straight down the ground where long-on has to cover a lot of ground to field. Last ball of the innings and instead of charging back for the second, they are content to turn back into their creases and settle for a long single. Gotta have that not out to protect the average!"
"little inswing to get started, tucked away to fine leg"
runs it down to third man and pushes for a couple
"coming back in, flicked to midwicket"
a bit of shape away. Fuller length going away from Babar
driven through extra cover. Excellent diving stop from James Vince. Could the fielding make a difference here?
lazy swing and a miss. Very close to the bat but the umpire calls wide. I thought that might have been harsh.
"thick outside edge to third man. Stellar start from Sohail, this"
"brings it back into Babar, who's cramped up and defends"
"that was short and ever so slightly wide, and you can't afford that against Babar. Allows the Pakistan captain an opportunity to free his arms and spank that through the covers"
"tailing in, squeezed away for a run"
clipped off the hip to midwicket
"slashed by Babar and Multan are convinced it took a faint nick off his bat. Babar looks nonplussed, but <strong>Multan have taken a review</strong> UltraEdge shows no spike, and Multan lose a review, while Babar survives"
"little dab back to the bowler and Babar thought about a single there. It was never on, and he thinks better"
"good bowling. Tails back in and the attempt to cut was never really on. Both batsman have tried to play that shot too close to their bodies, and it hasn't often worked"
"comes back in and hits the pads. Multan appeal, but don't review, and to add insult to injury, the ball trickles away for four. Poor Maqsood was appealing while the ball was scampering past him!"
"another four for Sharjeel, and another one that's really fortuitous. too close to cut once more, but it gets an inside edge that narrowly misses the stumps and runs away past short fine for four. Rizwan recognises that's just rotten luck, and applauds his bowler"
"poor delivery, and it gets the treatment it deserves. In the slot, Sharjeel latches onto it and <strong>clobbers it over long on for the first six of the innings</strong>"
"expansive drive attempted, but Sharjeel's inside edge fetches him a single to fine leg. That inside edge is doing most of the work for him at the moment"
"drags it down legside this time. Turning out to be an expensive over, this one"
"this is a pretty unlucky over for Multan. Babar got that one nowhere near the middle, with the leading edge sailing over third man and nearly carrying all the way for six! <strong>20 off that over, and only about six of them came off the bat's middle</strong>"

""
"short at a fairly placid pace, allowing Babar to get underneath it and clatter it to cow corner"

"flatbatted slap over the bowler's head, and <strong>that brings up 50 for Karachi</strong>. This is an ideal start for the chasing side"
off stump line that Sharjeel tries to guide past the wicketkeeper. Narrowly beats the outside edge though
"not at the moment. Length ball from the bowler, Sharjeel just moves across and jabs it through midwicket off the back foot for another boundary. Rizwan moves over to give Dahani some advice"
"no idea what happened there. Big appeal for lbw, a run-out attempt, overthrows and footwork on the boundary to prevent it going for four. All a bit slapstick, really"
"Waheed Safi was right, <strong>Dahani did get Sharjeel out</strong>! Cross seam delivery banged in short. Sharjeel's attempted hoick gets a faint nick on the glove, and Rizwan celebrates exuberantly"
"short and tailing down legside, all he needs to do is help it down past fine leg for a boundary. Poor delivery to start off"
"slower delivery, but drags it down slightly"
driven back to the bowler
biffed through the onside for a single
worked into the onside and the pair come back for a couple
""
"tucked past mid-on, and it's placed well enough against or Karachi to ease another couple of runs closer"
lovely picked up towards midwicket. It was a length ball and Clarke sort of swivel-pulled it to the onside. Only smart fielding stops it from going all the way for four
"confident stride out, driven to mid-off, where a smart stop keeps him on strike"
"drift and flight, driven to mid-off again"
"drops this one ever so slightly short, and Babar gives it the treatment it deserves. Goes onto the back foot and slaps it past fine leg for four"
"short again, punished once more. Short ball, almost a long hop, and Babar awaited the googly on the back foot and clobbered him just wide of long-on"
"driven back to the bowler. That was better, more flight, and fuller"
"pulled to cow corner once more, Qadir might be disappointed with his lengths this over. Just the single on this occasion"
"sensational timing. Greets Afridi with a square cut for four first ball. Played it under his eyes almost, and the lateness of that cut took the ball away from the point fielder"

"short ball, smashed through the offside. Required sharp work in the deep to cut off the boundary"
punched through the covers for a single

"fuller, more flight, and it was closer to the stumps. Babar could only angle it to the backward point fielder"
"full, but slightly wide, and <strong>Babar gets it perfectly between the infield and sweeper cover</strong> on the boundary, allowing him to pick up another four. Glorious boundary"
"bat-pad, or was it pad-bat? They don't review, though it was really straight"
"nudged into the onside, and <strong>Babar gets to a 32-ball half-century</strong>. Babar in a chase is such a luxury to have"

a touch of width that Babar pounces on again. Sharp dive put in on the boundary to keep it down to two
