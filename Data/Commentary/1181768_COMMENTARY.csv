pitched up and de Kock drives but straight to extra cover
"<strong>lucky to get away with this!</strong> Too short and wide outside off, de Kock reaches out and slaps this straight to cover point"
<b> nearly drags it onto the stumps! </b> Looks to thump this on the up through extra cover but didn't have room. The thick inside edge rolled onto the pad and nearly to the leg stump. Just wide. Slice of luck for Mumbai early in the piece
"beaten by zip and extra bounce. Not much of pace or so to say, just 129.2kph, looks to flay that through point but is late on the shot."
"length ball on middle and leg, Rohit works this into the gap at midwicket"
mistimes a cut to cover point. Cramped for room again
"beauty! When he gets it right, Shardul can get the ball to bend away. Banana swing this time, Rohit with no feet movement as he throws his bat at this to drive, beaten."
"nice and full on the stumps, gets this to move away late again, Rohit jams his bat down in time to squeeze this to mid-on"
"that's what he can do often, does Shardul. Bowl beauties and then follow it up with half-trackers. Drops short and into the body, Rohit was waiting for it. Pulled imperiously over deep square. Super hit, so instinctive, very very effective."
caresses this full delivery to Raina at cover point
"smoked! This is floated full and across, de Kock walks across and whips this over midwicket. Strong bottomhands, sailed over. Super hit, mind you it's a 73-metre square boundary. No problem, I'll hit it over and beyond."
"the consequence of that six is Chahar goes wider and ends up toeing the wide line. De Kock cleverly let that go. Extra ball, the bowler is under pressure early in the over"
punches this length delivery to cover
"sliced for six! Backs away to go extra cover but doesn't quite get the timing or bat. Went off the thick outside edge. For a split-second, Harbhajan looked set to lap it up at square third man but watched this sail over in the end. Woah, how did that carry? I really don't know."
wrists this full delivery on middle and leg to mid-on
"scorcher! Length ball slanted across, de Kock makes room and lofts through the line over mid-off. Pure hand-eye coordination this. Timing is incredible too"
slashes hard to Harbhajan on the bounce at third man
driven with the spin to long-off

"no point of that fielder if Shardul's going to bang it in. Pulled again  but Rohit gets this high on the bat, on the bounce to Harbhajan at deep square leg"
beaten as he bowls this full and wide as De Kock makes room to scythe that behind point
"slapped! This is gully cricket style. Fab shot. Saw him drop shot, reached out and was on one leg as he hammered this in front of square. Disdainfully done"
"excellent comeback! Shardul has his revenge this time and he's done him in with a real quick delivery. Bounced on middle to cramp him for room, de Kock late on this, gets it on the glove and lobs behind to Dhoni who takes a dolly. Shardul gives de Kock a send-off and Hyderabad roars."
"nice and full outside off, defended back"
"overpitched, on off, and struck straight back to the bowler. He bends to intercept on his followthrough"
"<b>slower ball, and edged!</b> MSD dives forward to complete the catch. Knuckleball just outside off, and Rohit tries to drive straight, but he's through his shot too early and Dhoni was not going to make any mistake. Terrific delivery from Chahar"

"slower ball, offcutter to begin proceedings. Length ball, just outside off, and Suryakumar mistimes a front-foot drive to mid-off"

"length ball, angling away from Kishan. He opens the bat's face and steers it down to third man"
"full on leg, and he offers the bat's straight face to drive down the ground. Long on runs to his left to clean up"

"sharp turn off a length, bunted to point"
"brings out the switch hit but toe-ends this to point, they squeeze in a single"
"goes through with the shot and just eludes Jadeja at deep midwicket. magnificent effort. Gets away with the release shot does Surya. Didn't get to the pitch of this tossed up delivery but went through with that whip. Top, top effort from Jaddu, running around the ropes."
pushes this length ball to short midwicket
"fired full outside off, squeezes this to deep point"
picks this full toss into the gap at wide long-on and deep midwicket. Lovely wrist work from Ishan
works this off a length into the gap at wide long-on. Lazy work in the deep. Should've been no more than a single.
"chopped on and Imran beings his victory run! The length does Surya in, looking to dab this past short third man but is cramped for room. Thick inside edge back onto the stumps. There wasn't much turn this time. <b> Tahir equals Rabada for most scalps this season - 25 </b>"
lunges forward and turns this gently into the leg side
"skids one across, Krunal plays this delicately past slip. Bravo gives it a good chase from short third man to pull it back in"
"nicely tossed up, Krunal is well forward as he smothers this"
gentle dab into the gap at point for an easy single
punched uppishly into the gap behind point
"driven on the up into the gap at sweeper cover, Chahar cuts this off as he comes around"
"beats him for pace and takes an excellent return catch as he hares across to grab it! Shardul, you beauty. Krunal, like de Kock, is beaten for pace as he looks to pull this skiddy delivery but gets it high on the bat. Lobs so high that Shardul has enough time to cover at least 20 yards but in trying to grab it the ball bobbles out. Somehow he still manages to retain his composure and take it on the second attempt. Heroic from Shardul as he tumbles over. What. A. Catch. No repeat of Krunal's heroics at the same venue where he delivered Mumbai the title in 2017."

fired full to hit him on the pad as he looks to work it to the leg side
works this down to long-on
"backs away to hoick, top-edges the slog and point takes a dolly. Imran Tahir is off again. This is very poor application from Kishan. Looked edgy all evening and has succumbed to the man who has dismissed him four times in four matches earlier to this."

"wide, length outside off, and cut of the back foot to the man in the deep. Just a single for Pandya"
"<b>hammered</b> over cover, but lands just short of the Chahar in the deep! Terrific commitment from Chahar to attack the ball, but the ball drops just in front of his dive and bounces away to the boundary. This was a fast ball outside off and Pollard slapped it over the infield"
"length ball, wide outside off. Punched back to long on"
"faster one again. Length ball angling into his body, and drilled to long on once more"
"half-tracker, just outside off, and he offers the bat's full face to play this down to long on"

"full, on off, and driven down the ground to long on. Gives Hardik the strike"
"<b>up and over</b> off the back foot, and Raina is getting under it from cover, but <b>he's dropped it!</b> <i>Chinna Thala</i> fails to hold on. How rare is that? This was a short ball from Shardul, and Hardik tried to lift it over cover, but alas"
"<B>rubbing salt in Shardul's wounds!</b> Back of a length on off, and Pollard rocks back deep before punishing Shardul for a six. Thumps a pull over cow corner"

"<b>helicopter shot</b> with Dhoni looking on! The audacity! Love it. Full, on off, and Hardik stays really deep in his crease before letting his bottom-hand do the rest. The crowd roars!"
"low full toss, very wide outside off, and thumped to long on for a single. Hardik keeps strike"
"back of a length, wide outside off, and  <B>Pandya flat-bats a pull</b> through to the wide long-on boundary! Chahar tries for the slower short ball, but Hardik was up for the challenge. What timing!"
"yorker on middle, and Hardik can't flick it square. Ball hits his front leg, and Chahar appeals for lbw. <B>Ian Gould raises the finger but Hardik reviews right away!</b> Bat involved? Looks like the bat did not hit the ball, it only hit the ground. No edge according to UltraEdge so far, and replays show that ball would've crashed into leg stump. Big wicket for Chennai."
"length ball on middle, and worked away to the leg side"
"full on middle, and his attempted slog over cover is sliced only to mid off. Pollard hasn't crossed over either"
"length ball, wide outside off, and Mitch pulls off the back foot to midwicket"
"<B>delightful!</b> Slower ball, short on middle and teasingly over Mitch's bat as he tries to swing to the leg side. Great comeback for Deepak Chahar tonight after getting tonked by de Kock earlier in the evening"
"full, very wide outside off, and <B>hammered</b> past cover to wide long off. Rayudu goes around the boundary to stop the ball, but <B>Pollard opts not to run!</b> They could've taken two, but Pollard was never interested. McClenaghan did try to run though"
"<b>through to the keeper!</b> Full, slower from Bravo, but wide outside the tramlines. But since Pollard walked across to the ball, umpire Nitin Menon deems that a legal ball"
"yorker, but very wide outside off. Pollard lets the ball go despite not moving across, but <B>Umpire Nitin Menon says that's a fair ball!</b> Pollard throws his bat in the air, since he can't believe it"
"yorker, just outside off, and drilled to long off. They need to go for two, and McClenaghan is running to the danger end, but he can't make it back in time. Good news for Mumbai is that Pollard is back on strike"
"full, wide outside off, and this time Pollard manages to free his arms. <B>Smashes</b> a four through the covers, and even manages to pierce the gap between deep extra cover and long off"
"slower ball, full outside off, and <B>that's been smoked!</b> Drilled through the covers and <B>Chennai Super Kings 150 to win IPL 2019!</b>"
driven back to mid-on. Hint of late inward movement for Mitch
"beaten as he looks to flay this on the up through cover. Lovely delivery, done in by the zip."
"blitzed! Too full, a half-volley that Faf will put away 99% of the times. Crunched through extra cover. Couldn't have asked for an easier ball for his first runs"
"full on the pads, flicked to Malinga at deep backward square leg"
"bunted to point from the crease, this was bowled full and across again"
pulled nicely but there's a man strategically placed in front of square - between deep square and deep midwicket - for the shot. Two it will be to round off the first over.
"<b> just eludes Krunal on the followthrough! </b> Stopped on Faf, who looked to work it to the leg side. Got a leading edge, finger-tips stuff. Lucky break"

"slower and fuller on off, Watson's feet glued to the crease as he defends"
"beaten again! Backed away to pick the gap behind point, deceived by the slower one. Pressure building."
"<strong>a direct hit at the bowler's end from point and Watson would've been walking back!</strong> This was a gentle bunt, waste of a run, loaded with so much risk. Ishan Kishan the fielder. Lucky break for Chennai Super Kings again"
"another risky run, this time they'll get four more because there's no one backing up. Faf had to put in a dive to beat De Kock's throw from behind the stumps. No one covering that from mid-on. This was another slower ball from Malinga, bunted behind the stumps. Even before Faf looked up, Watto was off, so he had no option but to go. It's all happening!"
"makes room, Krunal follows him, bunted to cover as he's cramped for room"
"steps out and thumps this over the bowler's head, no chance for mid-on. Watson had to duck for cover as this was drilled!"
"clean strike, clears long-on! Backed away again, but Krunal went full and this was right into his swinging arc. Lovely, lovely hit."
"makes room to open up the off side and slices this between cover and point. Wow, incredible batting this. The decision to follow him by firing it in isn't working for Krunal."
"backs away and cuts, straight to short third man this time. Deceived in flight but went through with the stroke"
"this time he's gone! Krunal sees him back away and fires this full and wide. Faf is so far off that he can't reach the ball and de Kock effects an excellent stumping. Rohit is pumped, Krunal is pumped. There's life in the game or what?"
"skids one through on off, steered to third man"
"this is a snorter of a bouncer from Bumrah! Good evening, Mr Raina. He's as usual camping back, expecting this on his ribs and somehow sways out of the way. Terrific gather one handed by de Kock"
glances this fine to fine leg to get off the mark
once again opens the bat face to ease this down to third man
whips this over short square as he walks across. <strong>Ishan Kishan was standing right where the ball went</strong> and was moved out only a ball earlier to leg gully
hops back and across to keep out this full delivery. Tight first over from Bumrah
"back of a length, just outside off, and fended off the back foot"

"length ball, just outside off, and cut off the back foot to point"
"<B>swiped!</b> Full, on leg stump, and Watson simply flicks this over backward square for half-a-dozen. Watto spotted that slower ball (120kph) super early"
"back of a length on off, and Watson tries to pull but misses. Ball flies over his head to the keeper. Watson's not happy, he says a few things we can't repeat and the umpire calls it a wide. Ian Bishop apologises on TV for Watson's language. Think Watson wasn't happy with a wide not given in the Bumrah over"
"back of a length, just outside off, and cut behind square past the fielder at point! Allowing Watson to free his arms, and he doesn't disappoint"

Looks like the decision has to be overturned, but before that the umpire wants to be sure he's got this right. Yep, not out! Umpire Gould changes his decision to 'one bouncer for the over'"
"length ball on middle, and nudged off his pads to fine leg for a single"
"full on leg stump, and he misses the flick off this slower ball. Hits his pad, and Mitch appeals for lbw, but not given. Replays suggest it pitched outside leg"

"full on leg stump, and worked off his hips to deep midwicket. Tidy over, just the three runs"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> again with the slower ball dipping in late. Raina flicked this to fine leg, but McClenaghan believes it went off the pads. Nah, they aren't reviewing. It definitely came off the bat"
"<b>hammered!</b> Full, on off stump, and Watson's fast hands makes no mistake. Demolishes this half-volley past the non-striker to the long-off boundary"
"slower ball, full outside off, and goes through to the keeper. Umpire Gould calls it a wide, but replays suggest the ball was inside the tram-lines. Touch and go"
"slower ball, full outside off, and Watson drags a slogged shot to deep midwicket. No real timing there, but that's what allows him to come back for the second run"
"<b>top-edged</b> and Malinga drops the catch. Is this Watson's night? Length ball on middle, and Watson was through his pull too early. In the air for a long time, but Malinga - at square leg - cannot cover the ground. Attempts a valiant dive, but the ball didn't even get his fingertips. Yikes"
"another slower ball, short and slow on middle. Mistimes a pull"
"length ball on middle, and he tries to play a delicate late cut. Played to short third man"
"length ball on middle, and spins sharply into Raina. He tries to fend, but the ball has sneaked through to QdK behind the stumps"
"<B>Chahar celebrates even before the umpire raised his finger!</b> Another skidder, length on middle and going straight through. Raina goes onto the back foot to defend, but he misses, and it hits his front leg. But Raina <b>chooses to review</b> after a long deliberation with Watson. Pitched on middle, impact on middle, and the ball would clip middle stump. Raina falls as Chahar drags Mumbai back into this game! Oh, and CSK lose their review as well. Ay Caramba."

hops back and angles this down to third man
"has he got him? Yes, Rayudu walks. Ripper of a bouncer from Bumrah, Rayudu walks across to help this along but is beaten for pace as this flicks the glove on the way through to de Kock. Massive moment in the game. MS Dhoni will once again have to do all the heavy lifting to see CSK home."

chops this slower delivery to backward point. Pressure building.
"bowls his too far wide outside off, and it's been called rightly so by the umpire as Watson let that go"
cuts this slower ball straight to backward point
"has Dhoni been dismissed here stealing a second for the overthrow? Yes, yes. He is. Or is he? One angle says there's some doubt. Another suggests he's an inch short with the direct hit. In the end, he has been given. Dhoni started walking off even before the third umpire pressed the button. Then he stopped. Huge, huge moment in the match. Back to the ball: this was bunted to short fine as Malinga fired a throw at the bowler's end. They chanced a second because the mid-off fielder Ishan Kishan was a touch wide, but in thinking so, they may have been a tad too casual. Kishan moves to his left and hits direct at the bowler's end. Dhoni may have lost a split-second because he had to run around the bowler to get back into the crease. What a moment in the game."

"<b>fast!</b> Back of a length, on off, and the ball whizzes past Watson's bat. Misses the attempted cut"
"<b>hits Watson near the gut!</b> Back of a length on middle, and angling into Watson again. He misses the pull, and the ball rolls away after hitting his body.

"<b>wiiiild!</b> Back of a length on middle, and soaring over Watson. QdK dives to his left to try and stop the ball, but the ball flies off his glove. An extra run for CSK"

"yorker, at the base of leg stump, and Bravo makes room before driving to deep extra cover"
