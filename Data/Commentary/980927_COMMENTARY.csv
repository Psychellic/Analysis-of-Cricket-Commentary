"length ball, swinging away from a fourth-stump line. Kohli dabs with soft hands towards third man. Made sure he played that close to his body, so even though it was a bit of an outside edge, it wasn't really dangerous"
"back of a length, close to off stump, gets behind the line to defend towards second slip"
"a bit fuller and wider and Rahul slices his drive between backward point and cover point. Not timed perfectly, and third man slides around to keep it to two runs"
"digs it in short, rising over Rahul's left shoulder. He gets on top of the bounce to hook it down to fine leg"
"beauty. Fullish, not quite driving length, and Kohli's footwork is a little slow at this stage of the innings. Late outswing from just outside off stump, and it beats Kohli's attempted drive through mid-off"
"length ball straightening on off stump, Kohli's bat comes down at an angle as he defends this, and the ball goes off the leading edge to short extra cover"
"banged in short, and that's hit the back of Rahul's helmet. He was looking to sway and get under it, but the ball moved in sharply off the pitch and followed his head"
"short on off stump, Rahul rides the bounce and chops it to the right of third man"
"another bouncer, and this time Rahul evades it, keeps his eye on it and sways his upper body away"
"short, this one's cuttable, and he doesn't quite keep it down. Buttler falls forward at point and the ball bounces just short of him"
"short on middle stump. Gets on top of the bounce and defends with soft hands, down to backward point"
"another short ball, this one turns out to be the slower one angled across Rahul, who leans away, looking to ramp it to third man, and can't put bat to ball"
"down the track comes Kohli, and while the length is right for the flat-bat drive over extra cover, the ball swings away and beats his outside edge"
this one doesn't swing. It's full and it carries on with the angle into off stump. Kohli plays the checked drive to mid-on
"looks for the magic ball swinging from leg to off, and, as it often happens, the ball doesn't swing. It's on the pads, and Kohli flicks it away easily over square leg"
"length ball on middle stump, clipped down the ground towards mid-on"
"back of a length, angling into middle stump, defended into the on side, and Rayudu pounces quickly from midwicket to cut off the single"
"bouncer outside off, keeps rising steeply and defeats both the batsman's hook and the keeper's outstretched right glove, runs away for four byes. Ah, hang on. That was a top edge, or so the umpire thought. Can't say for sure from replays"
"short again, rises to chest height. Kohli pulls it down to deep square leg"
"makes room and McClenaghan's angle offers him some width. Just a touch short too, and he just slashes it away, up and over point, and it carries all the way for six"
"bouncer - this is becoming predictable - and though it follows the batsman, Rahul is ready for it. Sways his upper body out of the way, and ramps it expertly over the keeper, and times it well enough to carry all the way"
"wide of the crease, angles it in, ends up offering one on the hips, and Rahul clips it away to the left of short fine leg. This is rubbish bowling"
"back of a length, there's a bit of width outside off. Rahul pokes at it, looking to steer it to third man rather than play a full-blooded slash, and he ends up nicking to Harbhajan, who makes the catch look simple at slip. It was going quickly to his left"
"shortish, close to off stump, left alone"
"short outside off, Kohli rolls his wrists nicely over the cut and McClenaghan has to sprint a long way to his right from third man and dive full-length to cut off a very well-timed shot"
"back of a length, close to off stump. Lets it come on and dabs to third man"
"short on off stump, pulled to the left of long leg. Bumrah puts in a good dive to stop it"
"shortish on off stump, steered quietly down to third man"
"back of a length on off stump, straightens a touch and goes past the outside edge to hit the back thigh. AB was deep in his crease, looking to work this through the leg side"
"length ball on middle stump, and AB hangs back and swats it away to the square leg boundary. That wasn't a short ball. He just waited for this sort of length, and pounced as soon as he saw it - which, needless to say, was earlier than 99% of other batsmen"
"back of a length, close to off stump, dabbed down to third man"
"in the blockhole on middle stump, AB goes on the back foot to make a bit of hitting room and drive to mid-on, who's deep enough to allow a single"
back of a length on off stump. Kohli lets it come on and dabs to the left of backward point
"low full-toss on off stump, smacked back down the ground off the inside half of the bat, and mid-on moves to his left to stop it"
"shortish outside off, straightens and bounces extra to beat Kohli's poke. He was looking for third man again, I think"
"short, some width this time, and Kohli slashes hard, gets a thick edge that flies to the third man boundary, too fine for the fielder to stop it"
"Ooh, nearly a run-out! Clips it to midwicket and sets off immediately. Kohli is ball-watching, and he sends him back. AB has to dive to beat Rohit's throw. Direct hit and he was gone. Parthiv was a little slow getting the bails off too, and he's in. Just about."
"tossed up, drops on a good length on off stump. Driven past the bowler to long-off"
"back of a length on middle stump, goes back to punch to long-on and Rohit dives in from midwicket to intercept"
"fired in flat and wide outside off. A touch too wide, and Kohli doesn't even attempt a shot"
"floated up slow on middle and off. Hits a nice length again, and Kohli clips it away through square leg"
"very full on middle, clipped to short midwicket. Was looking to beat the man and find the single to long-on"

"length ball on leg stump, nurdled away to the left of short fine leg"

"full on the pads, clipped to deep midwicket"
"full on middle and leg, whipped to deep square leg"
"a bit slower and loopier on middle stump, swept to deep square leg"
"flat, angling down leg. Kohli skips away from leg stump and drives inside-out. Pollard has to chase a long way to his left from long-off to cut it off with a sprawling dive"
"back of a length, angling down leg. Kohli simply moves himself out of the way"
"full, fired down the leg side again. The pressure of bowling to AB seems to be telling on the young left-arm spinner"
quickish length ball on middle and leg. Stays inside the line to push into the cover point region
now it's Harbhajan's turn to fire a full ball down the leg side. Kohli simply moves across and ignores it
"not really short, not really wide, but Kohli is back in a flash to bring his wrists into a rasping square cut that races to the point boundary"
"tossed up on off stump, clipped to long-on"
"dipping offbreak on off stump, and AB gets his front leg across and plays a risky - in any other format - whip that races away to the right of short fine leg. If he missed, he was lbw for sure"

"flighted ball, wide of off stump, flat-batted out to sweeper cover"
"length ball on middle and leg, clipped to deep midwicket"

"slower ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"back of a length, angling down leg. Kohli works it off his hip into the square leg region"
"length ball outside off, and that means swinging room for AB. He just swats it away over midwicket. Doesn't middle it, but it just about carries over the leaping fielder"
"length ball outside off, looks like a slower ball this time, and he swipes it down the ground to long-on. Doesn't really time this either"
"length ball on off stump, whipped to long-on"
"length ball on off stump, clipped away neatly towards deep midwicket, and they scamper two by the time he can rush in from the rope and cut it off"
"got him, huuuge wicket! Doesn't get close enough to the pitch of the ball for the lofted hit over extra cover as he steps down the track, and the ball hits higher on the bat than he would have liked. Ends up hitting it down the throat of long-off"
"fullish on off stump, swept away to deep backward square leg"
"back of a length on leg stump, pushed down the ground to long-on"
not as short as AB would like as he steps away from the stumps. Opens his bat face to stab it to backward point
"Kohli and AB in one over! And this is an excellent delivery. Sees him making room again and pulls his length back just a little. AB reaches out to drive, drags his back foot out of the crease. The ball turns past his outside edge, and Parthiv does the rest"
"length ball on middle and leg, clipped away, excellent timing, and Rayudu sprints quickly to his left and dives to make the stop"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched to short cover"
"full on off and middle, clipped to long-on"
"shortish and wide. Head doesn't get his back foot across to cut, and has to reach for the ball, and doesn't make contact as a result"
"length ball angling across into the corridor, and Head doesn't move his feet again. Looks to push into the covers and the ball beats his edge"
"lovely. Another length ball that angles away, just a bit wider this time, and the leaden-footed Head pushes at it and misses"
"quickish on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"slower this time, nice change of pace. Hangs in the air and drops on a length on leg stump. Watson is too early into the sweep and he's hit on the pad"
fuller now and Watson drives to long-off
"back of a length on off stump, punched to long-off. No footwork again"
"flighted on middle and leg. Watson looks for the big inside-out drive, is cramped for room, and hits it back to the bowler. Into the ground and bounces up to the bowler"
"that's one of Watson's weaknesses, trying to pull spinners even when it isn't short enough. Plays the trajectory rather than the length of this quickish delivery, and he's lucky that goes on with the arm and misses leg stump"
"beaten again! There's just a hint of movement into the left-hander after this length ball angles across him, and the ball beats the inside edge of his drive away from his body. No footwork again"
"shortish outside off, pulled towards wide long-on"
"gone! That was a little too close to cut, and Watson ends up getting a thick outside edge. It was flying quickly to the right of the keeper, and Parthiv dives across to take a good catch"
Dug in short and he jumps to ride the bounce and drop it softly into the off side
"another good short ball, following Sarfaraz. He's not sure what he's doing, caught between ducking, ramping and hooking, and he's fortunate the ball slides down the leg side and misses his head"
"a touch too predictable, another short ball, and it's rising over off stump. Sarfaraz just leans back a little and uses the pace to help it over the keeper"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched into the covers"
"length ball slanting away from off stump, and again Head is beaten. His front foot didn't get out much at all, and he just threw his hands at that drive"
"length ball outside off, flat-batted to sweeper cover"
"back of a length on middle stump, tucked away to deep square leg"

"slower short ball outside off, lets it come on and whips it towards deep midwicket"
"slower ball, a bit fuller outside off, slogged away, along the ground, towards deep midwicket"
"quick bouncer, and Head is a little late on the pull. Pops up in the air, but falls safely beyond short fine leg running to his right"

"back of a length outside off, uses the pace to ease it towards third man"
"back of a length slower ball on off stump, and that's an excellent shot to a difficult ball to hit. Lets it come on and uses his wrists to pick the gap between short fine leg and deep square leg"
"off-stump yorker, dug out into the midwicket region"
sees Sarfaraz backing away from leg stump and bowls a slower short ball wide of off. Whipped away towards deep midwicket
"yorker just outside off, flat-batted to long-off, where Southee allows a second run with a fumble"
"The short ball arrives, and Sarfaraz pulls it away brilliantly, between deep square leg and deep midwicket"
"slower bal. Sarfaraz slogs too early and it just about clears the top of middle stump, rolls down to the keeper, and Head calls early to sneak a bye"
"another slower ball, but Head is expecting it, and it's just the right length to clear his front leg and clout that high over deep square leg"
"fires it in full, close to off stump. Head looks on-side again, and inside-edges it to the right of the keeper"
"another bouncer, and Sarfaraz knows what's coming. Clears his front leg, opens up at the hips, and clobbers the pull over midwicket"
sees him stepping away from his stumps and spears a full-toss outside off stump. Sarfaraz swings and misses
"in the blockhole on the pads, and he clips it to deep backward square leg. They look for a second as Harbhajan moves to his left from the square leg boundary, and I think that's a run out. Throw is rifled in flat over the stumps - Harbhajan has a super arm - and Parthiv barely has to move his gloves to complete the run-out"
"low full-toss wide outside off, and Binny stabs it away, slices it in the air  to the left of deep point"
"slower ball outside off, and that is serious power from Sarfaraz. Not too much pace on the ball, and he swivels his  body powerfully through the hips to meet that pull outside off and clear the straight midwicket boundary"
"gone. Third man was back on the rope, and Sarfaraz goes down low looking for the scoop over short fine leg. Bumrah moves his line wide of off stump, and Sarfaraz adjusts and picks out third man even though - or because - he meets it on the full and middles it"
"full-toss outside off, and Binny doesn't time the big hit as well as he'd like. Bat spins in his hand and he hits it straight to long-off"
"in the blockhole outside off, jabbed to deep point, and they can only pick up one as Harbhajan fires in another flat throw to the keeper"
"short and climbs on off at 141kph, Rohit dabs a single in front of mid-on"
"back of a length and just a shade outside off, hits the deck hard, 140kph, Parthiv drops it defensively in front of cover"

"back of a length and outside off, 141kph, Parthiv plays away from the body and is beaten"
"dug in short around off, cramps Parthiv for room. Flat-batted to mid-off for one"

"shortish outside off, defended into the point region"
"length ball on off and middle, and Rohit clips into the leg side and sets off. Richardson moves quickly to cut it off, and nearly has Rohit run-out again. No way was there a single there, Rayudu sends him back, and Rohit has to dive home to make his crease. Throw misses, but he would have been home even if it hit"
"back of a length on off stump, dropped into the off side with soft hands"
"back of a length, angling in to cramp Rohit, who tucks it quietly towards long leg"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed to third man"

"short outside off, Rayudu steps across and dabs to third man"
length ball on middle stump. Rohit flicks uppishly but the ball drops short of square leg. Looked like Aaron took a bit of pace off the ball
"back of a length, not enough room to cut. Rohit slashes it straight to point"
"back of a length outside off, and that's a suicidal single. Pokes it straight to backward point and sets off, and Rayudu responds to his call. Direct hit at the keeper's end and he wasn't even in the frame, but Head's throw misses and they get four overthrows instead"
"short outside off. Rohit has to fetch that pull from well outside off, and ends up top-edging it over slip. Richardson is getting the ball to hurry onto the batsmen"
"back of a length outside off, punched to cover point"
"length ball close to off stump. Rohit gets forward, dabs softly towards point, and this time the single is on and they take it comfortably"
"down the track, and Rayudu puts that away. It's shortish, gives him just enough width to flat-bat through cover point"
short on middle stump and he steps across to pull to long leg

"short outside off, Rayudu takes a big step back and across and guides it to third man"

"high full-toss - chest high - from Aaron. Surprises Rohit, whose bottom hand slips off the handle, but he manages to pull it away through square leg. No-ball signalled"
"full outside off, too much width, and Rayudu lifts that over point, easy as you like"
"fullish on off stump, Rohit pushes it gently into the cover point region"

shortish slower ball outside off. Rayudu is through his slash too early and the ball beats his edge
"looks to bowl wide and make the batsman hit to deep point again, but this time the line is too far outside off, and the umpire signals wide as Rayudu leaves it alone"
"ooh. That's a jaffa. Angling into off stump and curling away late to beat Rayudu's poke. Squares him up a little too. On the shorter side of a good length, and Rayudu was playing half-forward"
"down the track now and that's too much width from Watson. Shortens his length, and he flat-bats it to find the cover boundary"
"back of a length outside off, glided away to the right of third man"

"short outside off, pulled away to the left of deep square leg"
"fullish, close to off stump, defended into the on side"
"short, angling in, and what a shot that is. Rohit just steps back and across, moves outside the line, and helps the ball over the backward square leg boundary. Fine leg was back, but it was hit to his left, and he had no chance"

"length ball close to off stump, dabbed towards backward point"

"tossed up slow on middle stump, slog-swept along the ground to the right of long-on"
"tossed up outside off, a bit of width, and he's lucky Rohit's flat-bat drive isn't too far to the right of Head at sweeper cover. A few meters more to the right, that was four"
"fullish on off stump, clipped to midwicket"
"low full-toss on middle stump, and this time he clips it to the right of that midwicket fielder. Abdulla misfields at deep midwicket and allows a second run"
"yorker on middle stump, jams his bat down to block it, and sends back Rayudu, who had hared out at the other end"
"shortish on off and middle, pulled to deep square leg. More of a short-arm jab, actually, with front leg in the air"

"back of a length on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"length ball outside off, chipped away to the right of sweeper cover"

"back of a length on middle and leg, tucked away through midwicket. Buttler wanted two, with the deep midwicket fielder having to rush in a long way, Rohit sent him back"
"length ball outside off, not up there to drive. Looked like an offcutter too, and the attempted cover drive rolls into the leg side off the inside edge"
"back of a length, another slower offcutter, and Rohit, who looks to lean back and dab it away into the off side, can't put bat to ball"

"down the track, Abdulla shortens his length, and Buttler pushes it quietly to the left of extra cover"
"full and wide, and Rohit can't put bat on ball as he chases the ball for the big drive"

"gone! Down the track, not quite to the pitch of the ball. Looks to go through with the big shot anyway, and ends up slicing it high in the air and down to the man at long-off"
"very full outside off, jabbed away to deep point"
"short outside off, waits and taps down on top of the bounce to play that to third man"
there's the bouncer. Pollard simply bends at the waist and gets under it
"shortish outside off, and for some reason Pollard is on the front foot, looking for the flat-bat drive. Doesn't put bat to ball"

"short outside off, pulled to deep midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, poked to short extra cover"
"short, sits up outside off, and Pollard swivels on his back foot to pull it powerfully in front of square. Deep square leg doesn't have too far to move to his left, but there's no way he's stopping that"
"length ball on the stumps. Pollard misses it, looking to work it across the line, and there's an appeal for lbw. Not given. It semed to be slipping down the leg side"
"bouncer outside off, top-edged pull, and it flies too fine for fine leg to stop it"
"fired in full on middle stump, Buttler squeezes it back to the bowler with a turn of his wrists"
"down the track, and that's a super strike. Keeps his shape even though Abdulla fired it shorter and more leg-sidish than he would have liked. Waited an instant longer and whipped it away, over the long-on boundary, and finished with his back foot in the air, a la Azhar or KP"
"down the track, and this time he gets closer to the pitch of the ball and is able to swing freely through the line to launch high over long-on again"
"and Abdulla gets another. Sees him coming down the track again and fires it wider. Buttler goes for the big hit anyway and slices it in the air, and down to the fielder at short third man"
"huge appeal for caught behind, and the umpire waits, waits, and signals wide. Back of a length, sliding down the leg side, and I don't think Pollard got any bat on that leg-side tickle. May have clipped his thigh on the way, though. No disturbance on Snicko even as it passes the thigh"

"tossed up on off stump, driven to long-off"
