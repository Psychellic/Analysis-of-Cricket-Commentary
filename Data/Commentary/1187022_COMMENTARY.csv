"<b>beat him</b>. Rohit is a little stuck in the crease and he reaches out with his hands, the ball hits the deck and moves away and leaves the outside edge behind"
"continues with the angle across the right-hander, Rohit does better and just leaves now"
"<b>swings into the right-hander</b> and Rohit does well, not committing that front foot forward, allowing himself the best chance to reach the ball and flick to midwicket"
"full and outside off, with a hint of inswing again, Rohit steps forward and blocks"
"back of a length on off stump, Rohit guides it to point"
punches it through the covers. Rohit stands tall against a short ball that gives him the room to free the arms and he picks the gap to the right of Lewis
"digs it in again, and though the ball is still outside off, it comes up towards his chest and Rohit has to be a lot more circumspect"
chops the back of a length ball outside off to third man
"<b>rises on the batsman</b> and Rohit has to sway back to keep control of his glide to third man. Excellent bowling from Holder, using all his height to get help off this hard pitch"
he's displeased after missing out a straight forward flick off his pads. Rare blip in line from Holder. Rare blip from finding an easy boundary for Rahul
"wait, wait, wait someone says, but Rahul has placed this dab well enough to the right of point to collect the single. He even points it out while he keeps running across"
"pitches it up full, but Rohit doesn't seem to expect it at that length, he's slow on the flick. The ball takes the pad and goes to square leg."
lets a back of a length ball outside off go through
"<b>pulls it away</B>. He's very good with that shot, starting from picking up the length sooooo early. The swivel is almost immediate. He knows fine leg is inside the circle. So he just helps it over the guy"
low full toss and by some bizarre circumstance he hits it right at mid-off
"looks for a quick single, but Paul doesn't allow that. Rushes in from cover and sends Rohit back. Excellent fielding"
"<b>outside edge</B> but it falls short of slip. Signs that Rohit never uses power in his shots, just timing, so the hands always hold the bat softly. Good bowling though, using the left-armer's angle"
<b>shapes it into the right-hander</b> again and Rohit does well to not fall over and flicks it smoothly to deep square leg
"the wide yorker is speared away to the third man boundary. Not entirely intentional, Rahul is probably looking to squeeze it through point but the extra pace from Cottrell means it gets onto the bat sooner than he expects and pings away behind the batsman"
"short and wide, Rohit goes for the cut, the extra bounce prevents contact"
taps a back of a length delivery outside off to cover
"flays it over point. There's just enough on the ball to beat Pierre flying away to his left. Holder is definitely getting extra bounce, but it's not quite quick bounce"
rises up nicely with the short ball outside off and steers it past the wide slip fielder
"cramps him for room and with the ball consistently coming up towards the chest, Rohit can only check it to point"
"gets up on his toes to try and do better, and although he does time the cut shot well enough, he finds the cover fielder. Good, tight new-ball bowling."
"oooh, that's a good ball. It seems as though it would be shaping inward, but it just holds its line. Rahul, thanks to playing late and close to the body, defends it well"
"<b>top shot</b>! He makes it by stepping to the leg side just a little bit and he does that because he sees the length short. He makes the room to beat the field and he does that with great precision, to the right of the cover fielder. No over-hitting. Just simple batting"
"tries to nick a single to midwicket, dinking the ball there with soft hands, but no such luck"
"<b>full toss, smears it away</B>. India are very good at being patient. Waiting for the opposition to slip. And here Cottrell does and Rahul lashes it past point"
leans into the drive as a full and wide ball skips away to third man
eases the drive to cover
"he really gets that ball to creep up where the batsman doesn't want it. Rahul is settling on a single option towards point, but it keeps coming up and he has to chop it down to gully"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
<b>good leave</B>. This is Holder's variation - the pitched up delivery - and he gets it to slant in and and shape away. Rahul is originally thinking about playing but then he spots the swing
plays late and close to the body and steers the back of a length ball to point
"full on off stump, defends"
"<b>hammers it</b>. There again, Rahul's strengths are blindingly obvious. Spots the bad ball early. Short and wide. Gets into position. Making even more room to flay the bat. And the rest is just glorious. Six over point and they ain't easy. Rohit knows it. He goes 'ooohhhhh'"
"angles it into the right-hander, Rohit goes inside out to long-off"
"flicks his pace down a little bit, tempting Rahul to go hard at the ball, but then the batsman checks himself and sends the ball back to Pierre"
"angles into the pads, Rahul turns it through to deep square leg"
"skids straight on as he pitches it short on off stump, Rohit keeps a straight bat and punches to long-off"
"full on leg stump, pushes to long-off"
"goes on with the arm again as Pierre bowls the quicker ball on leg stump, Rohit flicks through midwicket"
slides a shortish ball that straightens outside off to point
climbs up to hit the top of the bat even as Rohit is up on his toes defending it in front of off stump
floats it up but because his staple length has been short Rohit doesn't lean into the shot as he normally does and that's why he finds mid-off
goes wide of the crease to angle the pitched up delivery into middle and leg for lbw. Rohit manages an inside edge to midwicket
whips a full delivery on middle through midwicket
presents the full face as Holder searches for the top of off stump
pulls - and so quickly onto the ball again - but because the ball is slightly cramping him up he doesn't get all that much power on it
picks it up and launches the short ball from outside off stump away to deep midwicket.
drops a shortish ball on off stump in front of point looking for a quick single. Not there. Not against Pierre
"full on off stump, defends"
"sweet drive to the left of mid-off. Rahul waits for the ball to arrive - when he wasn't in form, he wasn't doing this - and he plays within himself which may as well be why Cottrell is able to cut across in time"
pushes down the ground gently and pinches a single
"<b>no slip</b>. It would've been a simple catch to first slip! Worse, the short third man fielder, Chase, isn't able to stop the ball from running away. Excellent bowling from Pierre, pulling his length back, drawing Rohit to play in front and away from his body. Does everything right and yet..."
"flights it into leg stump, works it to the left of deep midwicket"
"full on off stump, blocks"
"steps out and launches it over long-on. He's seen that Pierre doesn't have much variation, that his game is built on bowling wicket to wicket, so to throw him off, he flies out of his crease and sends the ball flying too"
waits on his back foot for the follow-up which is quicker and shortish and clips it to short fine leg
leaps back and away from leg stump to have the room to crunch a shortish ball on middle to cover
"defends a good length ball on off stump with an open face, single behind point"
slices a back of a length ball that keeps coming into him away to third man. Another shot that exemplifies how late Rahul is committing to his shots
punches a shortish ball on off stump through point
shifts back and across to cut a slower short ball away behind point
waits on the short ball to come to him and glides it down to third man
stands up tall and crunches a shortish delivery on off stump through cover
plays away from his body and that's why there's a shout of catch it. Rahul slashes a ball over point; not sure he was entirely in control
flicks a shortish delivery on middle through to midwicket
"full on off stump, he blocks to the right of cover and Pollard misfields"
nudges a good length ball off his pads to midwicket
"goes wider of the crease for a shortish ball outside off, Rahul cuts to point"
"looks for a single with a clip towards square leg, nope, not happening"
"<b>beats him with swing</b>! A snapshot of this kid's talent. Pitches it up, makes it move away, draws Rohit into a false shot and then makes the keeper reach up over his head to catch it. Massive ball first up"
<B>hits the deck</b> at 133 kph and Rohit has to get up off his toes to block the ball coming up to his armpit
"<b>launches it over fine leg</B>. It's in the arc for Rohit's pull and he just steps outside the line and helps it on its way. All that pace, coupled with the mistake of bowling too short, hurts Joseph"
"length ball on off stump, steadfastly defends"
dabs the shortish delivery on off stump to short third man
works the ball angled into his pads to deep square leg
pushes the full ball outside off to long-off - he has to reach in front of his body because the ball isn't as full as he originally thought but this time there's not much turn
keeps the front leg away with the flatter ball angled into his body and whips it to long-on. That one might have stayed low and skidded on
"opens the face and steers the shortish ball to backward point. Rohit wants the single, Rahul is a little late to respond, they go for it in the end, and make it in time"
whacks a short ball speared into him to long-on
works a back of a length ball outside off to long-on
"full on middle, defends"
"almost toe-ends it, but there's enough there to beat point and even reach the boundary. Rohit has had enough of being circumspect. That is a foghorn of intent. The ball isn't bad. It's a Test match ball outside off. But the batsman just flays it away with a straight bat"
"<b>jaffa</B>. Joseph stood and stared at Rohit after the last boundary and now comes back with a beauty, hitting the deck and seaming away and beating the edge. That takes a LOT of effort on this pitch"
blocks a shortish delivery on off stump to point
clips the shortish ball on off stump to deep midwicket
<b>nearly a run-out at the non-strikers</b>. Rohit has to dive back into his crease as Rahul drives down the ground and Joseph tries to get a hand down in time and maybe deflect it onto the stumps
nicks a single with a flick to mid-on. He's playing away from his body a bit but India have decided to go searching for the runs now. West Indies under pressure
"<b>top edge</b> but it lands safely! Rahul goes for the sweep but the good length ball on middle bounces a bit more than he likes. Deep square leg comes running in, Pooran does his best but the ball is already dropping. Maybe he's a bit slow to react to the ball coming his way. His throw is also off target though and there's an overthrow"
works it to midwicket
<b>nails it this time</b>. Too short. Very slow. Sitting up to be smashed and Rahul uses the pull shot to absolutely punish the bowler
"very full on leg stump, Rahul sweeps without getting down on his knees, just hacks the bat down"
"<B>fifty and it's a glorious one</b>. The shot that gets him there is typical of his innings today, playing with himself, not overhitting, just gently working the gap, this time past point. He had Rohit going 'ooooh' after a six earlier in the innings. Now he has Kohli in the dressing room celebrating by raising his own bat in tandem with Rahul"
flick to short fine leg
steers the shortish ball outside off to point and for once he doesn't get in line with it. Clearly he's thinking of big runs if he wants to stay legside like that

"full on off stump, defends to mid-off"
straightens away from the angle making Rahul block on off stump
"chops a shortish delivery, that keeps rising on him, to cover"

"touch ahead of length outside off, left alone"
"gets a good stride forward as he pushes it to cover. Three of that, West Indies have the stranglehold over India now"
"<strong>no timing, yet it'll go to the boundary</strong> on the bounce! Short of length on the stumps, Rohit looks to muscle this but is cramped for room. Goes through with the shot to get it high on the bat, more elevation than distance but there's no long-on."
defends back with a straight bat
flicked wide of mid-on for an easy single
"<strong>that's a Rahul special!</strong> It's a low-flying helicopter. Too full on the pads and he brings out his magical wrists into play to whip it into the gap, to Pollard's right at midwicket"
not much width but it's Rahul's picking of lengths and his unfurling of his wrists that have made that shot possible. Rocks back to transfer weight and just crashes that away effortlessly behind point. Stunning
punched on the up to cover point
"width and cut away to the point boundary like a? Yes, that's right. <strong>Tracerrrrrrrrrrrrr bullet</strong>"
"<strong>under-edges this pull</strong> on the bounce to the keeper! Had to fetch it from outside off, too early into the stroke"

"beats short third! So clever, knew where the fielder was, so he used the pace of Keemo and lent direction"

"slower and fuller on the pads, turned wide of short midwicket"

"another attempted cut, another thick edge, <strong>short of short third man again</strong>"
"he's hoicked this ugly. This was in the air for a long, long time. Hetmyer running in from long-off briefly looked at Holder coming in from long-on, and that split-second cost him valuable time. Eventually the dive wasn't enough. He was in no position. <strong>Rohit dropped on 70</strong>"

works it through square leg and moves to 99
"good length on of stump, taps it down to long-on and the crowd revs up again. They know Rohit is on 99"
blocks a ball coming up over his chest on middle
<b>there it is</b>! A simple dink to long-on gets him a single and he raises his arms to an adoring crowd. It's weird though. He almost looks tired. But Rohit has made a career out of batting out 50 overs in an ODI and there's 16 overs left
taps a good length ball down to long-on
"<b>pulls, but falls short</b> of Keemo Paul running in from deep square leg. Rohit goes for the shot even though the ball isn't quite short enough. He mis-hits it which is probably why it doesn't even carry to the man in the deep. Very hot out there. Is it showing on Rohit?"
backs away but Joseph follows him. Rahul has to settle for a push through the covers
"a near yorker tailing into the right-hander, Rohit works it to midwicket"

smooth strike but straight to cover
"shifts legside but the ball keeps coming into him, also it's up at his chest, Rahul has to check his shot, punching into the covers"
"<b>how?!?!??? Rohit is on the floor and the ball is out of the park!</b>. He is totally off balance. He is reaching well away from his body. He barely even makes contact with the ball. But at the point of contact, he puts power into the shot - that's rare, Rohit only times his shots, but here the bottom hand grips it harder, the wrists come into play as well, and he slashes a very good change-up delivery - Holder sees Rohit making room and goes well wide of off stump - over extra cover. This is unreal"
"slips down leg, Rahul can't get bat on it, would've got him the hundred because the guy is inside the circle"
"<B>punch the air time</b> and the ground rises up to salute another centurion. Rahul celebrates by dropping his helmet and bat and putting both hands on his ears - an emphatic signal that says he is just shutting out all the noise - whether he should be playing for India, what position he should bat, is he good enough, why is he not getting as many runs as his talent suggests - all of that is given the gut punch with one little flick past fine leg"
works it through midwicket
half volley has been smashed down the ground. Rohit is playing on a different level now. You can't give him freebies like that
tries to cramp the room for his bat swing and does so well enough. Rohit works the full ball on leg stump to midwicket
"ooooh, that's a full toss and it's way down leg as well. India will only get the wide for that. Odd that Rohit couldn't connect with the pull"
excellent bowling! Nails it in the blockhole at 134 kph and even Rohit in his ultimate form can't do much outside of digging it out to cover
"<b>outside edge and taken at third man</b>. Rahul has to go but he walks off to deafening applause. he won't be shutting his ears against that. Gets a pat on the head from his opening partner as he walks off. With so little overs left, he had to go for shots like these, the low percentage back away slash."
scoops it over fine leg. There is no pace on the ball but he still manages to harness it and get it over the infield. Told you. <b>Rohit in his ultimate mode</b>. It's just unreal
"back of a length and outside off, slashes it to cover point"
"<b>gone first ball</b>! He'd been in full gear for the entire afternoon. Even the helmet. He'd been celebrating each of the landmarks of the openers. Even raised his own bat when Rahul raised his. But when it comes to his turn, he's been done in. Pollard's slower short ball outside off results in a top edge and a simple catch at short midwicket. The West Indies captain races off Imran Tahir style in celebration"
drifts down leg as Iyer tries to flick it fine
blocks a slower ball into the covers and returns to strike to a man not really playing cricket anymore. It's something else. Something magical
"cracks a back of a length ball to backward point. Okay, that was unfortunately straightforward after all the set up"
"length ball outside off, he drives to point"
"lofts it over cover, but the lack of pace on the ball means Rohit has to make all of it himself and he doesn't quite succeed this time. See, this is what should happen when you play away from the body and are off balance"
"<b>through the gap at cover</b>! All along the ground. High elbow. Pure timing. It's a half-volley, sure, and it's a simple putaway, but Rohit does it all so dominantly."
guides the back of a length ball outside off to deep third man
turns a shortish ball on leg stump through square leg
works a shortish ball on middle and leg through square leg
<b>hammers it</b>. Backward of point is a huuuuuge region for Iyer and he gets the perfect ball for it. Short and angling across him. All he has to do is wait that little bit and put all his power behind the ball
"full on middle, ticks it to short fine leg"
"<b>too easy</B>. Fine leg is up. The ball is on his pads. Well, Rohit makes it be that way by backing away, forcing Pollard to follow him. Alright then, he's now mindbends boundaries into existence.  What mode is this?!"
lashes the short and wide ball to the point boundary. Nothing but orthodox batting there. The ball deserved a whack
"he walks across his stumps and waits for the slower short ball. Then when it is in his hitting area, he pulls strongly and nearly gets a boundary at deep square leg"
"back of a length and outside off, chops it down by the pitch"
drives down to long-on
"back of a length and outside off, he pushes it back to the bowler"
slices the shortish ball outside off to point
brings his wrists into play to send a back of a length ball outside off down the ground
"<b>and awaaaaaaay she goes</b>. It's a poor ball, yeah, short on leg stump with fine leg up. And this is to a man who pulls as good as anybody in the game. Rohit wolfs down his gift and buuuuuuurps"
"slower short ball, back over the wicket, Rohit delays his pull and find a single to deep square leg"
backs away to cut a ball off the stumps to the sweeper.
<b>yorker</B> and it's helped on its way. Tiny bit unlucky there. The line is off by only a couple of inches. But those inches take it down leg and Iyer flicks it away to the fine leg boundary
"back of a length and outside off, pushes into the covers"
"rises with the short ball outside off to drop it by the pitch and Rohit - after spending the entire innings out in the ugly heat - is able to push through for a quick single. Man, this guy!"
<B>into orbit. That's 150</b>! And it comes up with a straight six. That's about as Rohit Sharma as you can get. Just stand and deliver the picture perfect hits. And he ain't done yet
yanks a banged-in ball from outside off away to deep midwicket
low full toss on middle and he works it to deep square leg. That's the fifty partnership in 28 balls; Iyer has made only 15 of those runs
"hides the ball outside off, but he takes it too far"
"another very wide ball outside off, but this time Iyer decides to shift across and cut to the sweeper"
"<b>Reverse sweep now, but he doesn't connect</b>. Good on Pierre, seeing the change in stance and slowing it down and keeping the ball well outside off"
reaches out and cuts the flatter ball outside off to the sweeper
"Iyer goes for the reverse as well, with third man up, but Pierre holds his nerve and hides the ball away from the hitting zone"
pushes down to long-on
"would've been a wide ball had he left it, but he goes for the slog over long-on and mis-hits it back down the pitch"
"walks across his stumps for the heave over wide long-on, but again, Pierre is uncannily calm. He keeps his pace slow. He doesn't flight it at all. And he keeps the ball well outside off stump, and well outside the batsman's hitting arc. <b>Reeealllly good over</b>"
"charges in from around the wicket for a good length ball on middle, Iyer flicks through midwicket"
"fakes moving across his stumps, and as he expects that makes the bowler look to target the stumps, to take them out, and Rohit is there, waiting for the ball, pulling it to the fine leg boundary"
"<b>caught behind and the salute is out</b>.  But soon after that, as Rohit walks off, Cottrell pats the guy on his shoulder saying well played. That's classy. So, the dismissal. Rohit is a master of the cross-bat shots. But here he is only able to feather a nick through to the keeper. And now he walks off to the dressing room for a well deserved drink. What an innings. This was a slow pitch and yet he never seemed to mistime the ball"
"walks at the bowler, and across his stumps as well, which prompts Cottrell to go short. Pant pulls to fine leg"
"<b>almost through the gap</b>! There's something obscenely awesome about an orthodox cricket shot, all along the ground, in the final overs of an ODI. This is the perfect off drive. High elbow. Excellent contact. To the left of the mid-off fielder as well. But it's Holder, the very tall Holder, and his reach comes in handy here"
slices it to backward point
walks across his stumps to flick a short ball outside off through midwicket
"looks for the heave ho - because it's a length ball moving across him, giving him room - and loses his shape and fails to make contact. Good idea, not the greatest execution"
"<b>that's outta here</b>. He's immediately corrected the mistake. The last ball, he was looking to hit too square, looking to hit too hard. Here he goes straight down the ground, the front foot moving in line to the full ball outside off and odd as it sounds about a ball that's into the crowd, he doesn't over hit it at all"
"full and outside off, tries to loft it over cover, can't reach it."
"<b>away she goes again</b>. One of the more uglier ones from Pant, the bat turning in his hands, but if you've seen him in the IPL, he keeps doing that and he keeps getting sixes, this one over cover, which is one of the harder shots in the game"
"good length on off stump, defends gently down the ground to keep strike."
<B>monsters it</b>! This shot isn't about Pant's power. NO. This is about him spotting a slower ball - the very ball that bowlers use to stop batsmen as free flowing as Pant - staying calm and pulling it over deep square leg
"<b>oouuuch</b>, he's struck on the back leg, Cottrell now going full pace, angry at the first-ball six. The ball is too quick for Pant and now he has to weather <b>a review for lbw</b>. Ultra-Edge says there was bat there. So no lbw"
outside edge over third man. West Indies are trying to keep the ball away from Pant's leg-side arc. But he's still good enough to reach those very full and wide deliveries and has enough power that the mis-hits sail away too
he's left the block back in the dressing room. He's forgotten the concept of singles. He only knows sixes. He only cares for sixes and this is a ridiculous one. Length on off stump and he practically sweeps it down the ground
"<B>whoa</b>! A front foot punch to a ball that is still on the rise. Batsmen can't really control the shot when they can't be sure of getting on top of the ball but Pant is so confident, so insanely gifted that he doesn't care about such nuances. The shot pops in his head and he executes it. Four through cover"
"launches it over cover again, getting under the length ball and giving it the full swing of the bat. Outrageous hitting"
"full toss way down leg! It's a no-ball! It's a free hit! And Pant's on strike! Iyer leaves the ball, Hope somehow dives across to save a boundary, but this looks bad."
"finds the yorker outside off, Pant squeezes it out to the sweeper"
"<b>dropped</b>! Pierre is on the deep midwicket boundary and he's a top fielder. He tracks the ball well, moving to his right, times the jump right, goes two hands too, but the hit, Iyer's flick is so damn powerful, that it goes right through his hands"
"another full toss and Iyer launches it over long-on. West Indies are unravelling. RAPIDLY. <b>Fifty partnership, off only 19 balls</b>"
"goes around the wicket, spears it into the pads, Iyer stays off side of the ball and smacks it to the fine leg boundary. No nuance here. Just power"
"<b>brutal</b>! Iyer holds his shape so well to pull this off because this is a very slow ball and it's so far outside off too. Batsmen have to wait, they have to delay pulling the trigger, when every impulse in them screams otherwise. That's controlling your urges. That's playing to the situation. That's six down the darn ground"
low full toss on leg stump and it's disappeared over deep midwicket. India on a rampage. <b>Most runs off an over by India in ODI history</B> And <B>partnership 71 off 22</b>
"stands perfectly still but the hands keep moving, trying to scoop a low full toss over fine leg"
"walks across to the short and wide slower ball and cuts it to the sweeper and he thinks he's brought up an incredible fifty. Raises his bat straightaway but scorecard says 49 though... and the dressing room comes to his aid, saying one more needed"
"<b>that's too high, and not long enough</b> and it's taken by Pooran running in from the sweeper cover. Good work from Paul. Digs it into the pitch, doesn't put any pace on the ball, keeps it wide of the left-hander too and for once Pant mis-hits and it stays inside the ground. Glorious little innings to propel India to an unreal total"
cuts the short and wide ball to the sweeper and now he moves to a half-century. No celebrations now because he'd already got that out of the way. <b>Fourth fifty in a row</B>
slices a shortish ball outside off to short third man
slaps a length ball down the ground
"yorker on off stump, drills it down the ground"
pulls the short ball from outside off to deep midwicket
"walks across his stumps, inviting the bowler to hit the target, backing himself to get the bat down and find the fine leg boundary. Almost pulls it off, but fine leg, Joseph is very alert"
"steps away to try and open up the off side, but does so too soon, allowing Cottrell to slow it down and keep it well outside off and beat him"
works it to deep midwicket
too far down leg
<b>strangle down leg!</b> Cottrell continues banging it into the pitch. Iyer continues to walk across his crease to target the fine leg area. He gets too fine a contact on the ball with his pull shot and it goes straight to the keeper
goes properly short and keeps the ball well outside off. Jadhav isn't prepared for it. He's moving into the shot as he tries to cut and is easily beaten
"poor work from Lewis at deep point and a low full toss outside off is smeared to the boundary with the fielder not even getting down properly, let alone dive. Could be a fitness issue (he's only just come back from injury)"
"digs it in again, but this one goes way too high"
"slower ball on middle, he swings it away to the wide long-on boundary, one-handed!"
"lifts it over point! Jadhav is able to hold his shape well enough even with the ball always well wide of him outside off. He wanted to take it over cover, but it's four nonetheless"
nails the yorker and beats Jadhav outside off
"low full toss on middle, pushes it down to long-on"
"floats it full and across, not much swing, left alone"
"length on middle and leg, deflects off the thigh pad to fine leg. Lewis is still limping a bit. Here he was looking to tuck it fine. Beaten by the pace and zip"
"<strong>edged and put down by Rahul!</strong> Straight in, straight out. Got him driving, lovely shape away from Chahar, Hope fell into the trap, got a thick edge, Rahul bobbled it twice and eventually put it down. Oh dear"
punches off the backfoot to cover
"full and swinging away from outside off, left alone. Lovely from Chahar"
"goes wide of the crease and angles it close to the stumps, gets this to move away and Hope leave"
"<b> Run out missed!</b> Gets this to bounce off the deck, Lewis is deep into the crease as he defends. Hope calls for the run and they make it eventually. A direct underarm flick at the striker's end and Hope would've been gone."
works this short of length delivery into the leg side
"slips this into middle and leg, worked behind square leg"
"huge appeal for lbw as he gets it to bend back in nicely. There may have been an inside edge. Okay, replays confirm there was a big one."
"tickled fine, wide of the diving Pant. Easy runs these, can't ask for a more friendly delivery than this as a batsman"
"tucks this wide of short midwicket, quick single taken"
"gets this to move away from the left hander but the length is short, whipped uppishly to deep square"
"full and straight on the stumps, defended back"
"wrong line, veering into middle and leg, worked to deep square leg"
uppish but they scamper through for a single as Iyer stops it at short midwicket
gentle tap into the off side to this length ball
delightful wrist work as he puts this one from middle to the midwicket fence. Bisected midwicket and wide mid-on superbly there
"floats this full on the stumps, hint of movement back in, Lewis gets a thick inside edge to mid-on"
width and put away! Uses the depth of the crease to punch this behind point. Superb hand-eye coordination
driven firmly but straight to mid-off
"full and swinging away from outside off, defended back off the inner half of the bat"
"mistimes an expansive drive, just rolls towards the adjacent square"
"too short again, sliding down leg, Hope looks to whip it square but the ball whizzes past his gloves"
"much better, full on middle, defended back"
punched wide of mid-off for a single
"banged in short outside off, he looks to pull but bails out of the shot"
too full and he's put that away without much fuss through extra cover. Glorious!
wrists this to mid-on for a quick single
sways out of the way of this short ball on middle
"<strong>deceived by the change in pace</strong>, looks to loft him over his head but is beaten by the knuckleball as he played much before the ball arrived"
"starts with a short ball but down leg, wide"
"thuds into the thigh pad, rolls to Pant down leg, they scoot through for a legbye"
"wanted to play, then leave. But the ball thuds the bat and rolls behind the wicket as he tries to bail out"
"zips across on a length, Lewis is hit on the top part of the bat as he looks to defend off the backfoot"
beaten for pace but will get four because this has <strong>flown off the top-edge</strong> over the keeper's head
"much better length, fuller and around middle, defended."
"full and angling away, left alone"
"slower, fuller and he drives crisply to cover point"
"through with the pull even before the ball arrived, just about carries to Pant as he dives forward. There's a <strong>stifled appeal but they don't review</strong>"
defended from the crease to extra cover
"slower and fuller, cramped for room is Hope as he looks to hold shape and belt this over cover"
pulled away very nicely! Climbed into this short ball and hit it all along the ground. <strong>In total control</strong>
"tickled fine to beat short fine. He's playing the field very nicely. This was a knuckleball on a length, angling in. Knew where the field was and adjusted well"
"chases a full and wide delivery, beaten"
punches this to cover
"beauty! Leaves the batsman late, Lewis has a waft at that and is beaten"
"<strong>cracking stroke!</strong> The point fielder dives over the ball to concede four. Welcome boundary. Kohli won't be happy with that. Half-volley, hit hard and <s>Jadhav should've done better</s> He had no chance, which I can tell you from the benefit of replays. My apologies to him."
"<strong>this is a corker!</strong> Shortens his length, gets it to nip away a wee bit to square him up, beats the edge"
right behind the line as he defends back
"lovely delivery! Late movement from middle, Hope gets a leading edge that rolls to mid-off. He was looking to hit through mid-on"
squirted off a thick inside edge to wide mid-on
"driven superbly, the timing is absolutely magnificent. Just a gentle forward push before he let his hands do magic."
worked off his hip to deep square
gloves an attempted pull to fine leg
"no timing, no control but this pull beats Iyer running back from midwicket. But wait, have they got a run out here? No, all safe. The dive has saved Lewis."
"length ball outside off, eased to point"
confusion in the running but Hope makes it easy as he wrists this to mid-on.
beaten as he looks to belt this over the bowler's head
right back and across as he defends this short of length delivery
"edged, races past the vacant gully region to third man"
punched to short cover
"short of length on the stumps, defended back"

squared up by the length but manages to get behind the line as he efends
dug in short but this is way down leg
"edged and four! Slower length ball, Lewis looks to belt this over mid-off but gets a thick edge to the third man fence"
"<strong>excellent grab on the dive by Pant</strong>. Another pull, this one rolled to him off the bottom-edge."
"straight down Iyer's throat at deep square! Lewis looks to fetch this pull from outside off, but gets no timing or power behind the shot. Got a top-edge and this turned out to be a simple catch."
"lunges forward, doesn't get to the pitch as he drives, rolls back to Jadeja"
"cuts to short third man, can't get the single"
"cramped for room, too full for cut as well, chopped to the off side"
cuts hard but a superb stop by Shardul at point
works this down to long-on to get off the mark
"square turn, defended off the backfoot to point"
"short of length on middle and leg, worked to deep midwicket"
squeezes this full delivery to mid-off. This was only his fourth full ball in 26 deliveries
driven hard but straight to mid-off again
he's clobbered this! Held his shape and just hit through the line to clear long-on. What a shot
"slips this down leg, zips past as he tries to help it along. Wide not called, poor call me thinks"
"whips this from middle to deep square, excellent running"
"<b> outstanding work from Iyer,</b> deserves all the plaudits for converting a sure-shot boundary into a wicket. What athleticism! Simply wow. Talk about making an impact on the field when the fielding has come in for some sharp criticism. This is cut hard, cut very well by Hetmyer. Iyer from point hares back, absolutely sprints and puts in a full-length dive just as the ball is about to cross the ropes. The even better part comes next: Iyer quickly tumbles over the ropes and then recovers to come back into the field of play and fire a rocket throw on the bounce to Jadeja who whips the bails off to catch Hetmyer well short of the crease."
dabs it behind point and looks up to see his partner respond. West Indies need a huuuuuuge partnership and they've got a good pair for that. Hope and Chase both have very cool heads
"tosses it up on middle, Chase defends"
goes inside out with his drive and finds a single to long-off
"<b>glo-oooooorious</b>! The plan from India is to cramp the batsmen, but Hope sidesteps it and then lofts the ball inside out over cover and makes all of it look utterly, comically simple"
taps it down to long-off
hard-hit sweep to deep square leg; rare to see Hope look like a caveman but with the required rate always rising...
"loops it up outside off, Chase defends"
"loops it up on middle, and Chase isn't quite sure how it'd spin, then the dip causes him to hurry into bringing his bat down"
drills it down the ground as Kuldeep goes a shade too full
"shifts right across his stumps to defend the quicker delivery outside off - quicker, but still full"
attempts the inside out drive but he mis-hits straight to point. Thick outside edge takes the ball away from the cover region that he is targeting
steps forward and blocks in front of middle
forces the full ball on leg stump down to long-on
"a tad too short, allowing Hope to rock back and flick to deep square leg"
leans into the drive with the ball tossed up outside off. Single to wide long-off
cracks a back foot punch down to long-on
"<b>jaffaaaaaaa</b> and Chase looks completely freaked. His off stump is gone. His mouth is in the shape of an O as he looks back at the bowler then down at the pitch then away to the dressing room as he walks back. What a ball from Jadeja. Gives it a good old rip and even in these conditions it grips the pitch and turns a mile. Chase is squared up, originally playing the angle and looking for runs through midwicket then never in a position to adjust as the ball rags away"
<b>googly</b> and even the set bat can't pick it. Hope is trying to flick it through midwicket but gets a bit of a leading edge
"second on the trot and Hope once again plays down the wrong line, closing the face too early and watching the googly take his outside edge and almost go to first slip"
"pushes it quicker, but it is still so full, Hope punches back at the bowler"
"prefers to play off the pitch now as he goes back to a good length ball, sees it turn into him, then flicks it through square leg"
"<b>beats him</b> with a delightful legbreak. It is looped up, drawing Pooran forward, then it dips sharply, making sure the left-hander can't reach the pitch and then turns past the outside edge"
"lunges out with a premediated sweep shot, just about reaches it for a single through midwicket."
whips a full length ball down to long-on
"full on off stump, defends towards point"
"<b>inside edge</b> as Jadeja keeps getting sharp turn - that's the thing, the turn is quick, allowing the batsman no time to adjust. Single behind square leg"
blocks a good length ball down the pitch
"full and outside off, he drives at cover"
hangs back and cuts a shortish delivery outside off to the sweeper
"turns a good length ball on leg stump to square leg, but he has to wait for it, to hold his shape to make sure he makes contact"
"good length ball outside off, Pooran is reaching away from his body to defend it. Oooh, this is right up India's alley. There is turn. They have run-rate pressure. The perfect recipe for their middle-overs dominance"
carves a shortish delivery outside off to the sweeper
"looks like the googly, targeting leg stump to make the batsman play into the leg side, but it's too full, allowing Hope to drive smoothly to long-on"
blocks a tossed up ball drifting into off stump. Kuldeep is bowling nice and slow through the air and that is creating just enough uncertainty
"googly on off stump, Pooran picks it and blocks"
"good length ball on off stump, guides it to point"
pushes past extra cover's right to get the single he wants
"good length and outside off, Pooran defends into the covers. Hmm, these two aren't panicking. This could go down to the wire"
a little turn away from the bat as Jadeja bowls it quicker. Hope taps it towards point
<b>fifty with a rasping cut shot</b>.  This one comes on the heels of back-to-back hundreds as well. Hope has been very good for West Indies
tucks a length ball on leg stump behind square leg
"waits in his crease for the good length ball, sees that it doesn't really spin off the pitch and then flicks behind square leg"
"<B>beats him</b> with a loopy legbreak, daring Pooran into a big hit, but the dip and turn make sure the ball skips past the outside edge"
"follows up with a quicker delivery skidding into Pooran, who backs away and blocks down the pitch"
"goes for the cut, and the ball is there for it, but a little bit of extra bounce helps Kuldeep beat Pooran"
loads up the sweep - the usual route a batsman looks to break the shackles against a bowler who turns it both ways - single to deep square leg
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> but this might be turning too much. Umpire Choudhary doesn't give it but India have gone for the review. It's a really good ball, pulling Hope forward, dipping before he can get to the pitch and turning into him sharply enough to beat the inside edge as he tries to flick. No bat there, UltraEdge confirms. And HawkEye says it would be missing the stumps as well. <b>India lose their review</b> and Kohli is angry at the world"
"charges out of his crease and nails it through midwicket. Quick feet, which is necessary if you want to step out to Jadeja and hit him like that. The guy is rarely sent packing like that"
backs away against the predictably short follow-up ball to cut but he finds point
"another back away cut shot again, but he finds the field"
"<b>huuuuuuuge appeal from Pant</b>, several huuuuuge appeals actually, but umpire Tucker just looks bemused. Pooran just laughs after a good length ball pitches outside off and breaks sharply last the left-hander, down leg"
"nails it through the covers. Pooran has hit his zone. His feet are moving really well. His eyes are focussed on the ball, right over it as he makes contact. Excellent technique"
whips it through midwicket
pushes down the ground
"loops it up on middle, Hope skews it to cover point"
mis-hit sweep shot as Hope tries to go big. Doesn't even carry far enough for the fielder to have any chance of a catch
"rocks back and cuts the short ball to the left of the sweeper. Pooran wants two, but Jadhav does well to prevent that"
"that's in the slot. He hits with the turn. And it's <b>a massive six over long-on</b>. Finally he gets the chance to get under one and he doesn't miss out. Kuldeep though hands both hands against the sides of his head, repeatedly and relentlessly admonishing himself for that bad ball, that pressure release"
"good length ball on middle, turns it to square leg"
"loops it up on off stump, Hope comes charging out to hit it to long-off. Think that's the googly"
"the ball sticks in the pitch so much that Hope is way too early into his pull shot and has to delay his bat swing, making him almost overbalance. Eventually he does strike it well enough to find a single to midwicket"
"<b>veeeery high... and long enough</b>. Pooran clearly feels he's got the handle of the situation. And with the bowler spinning into him, he launches it down the ground and it clears Chahar at long-on"
"<b>dropped</b> at long-on by Chahar. It's a fairly straightforward chance, if a bit of a steepler. The fielder has plenty of time to get under it. He gets both hands to it but the ball just pops out. Jadeja winces as he watches it all happen - for a fielder of his quality even watching it is gruesome. A repeat of the big hit down the ground and again Pooran is lucky"
punches to long-on
"<b>ooooh, that's unreal</b>. He sweeps a near yorker for six over long-on. Jadeja tries his best to cramp Pooran for room, but the left hander clears his front. Then it's about getting under the ball - a ball that is very very close to the block hole - but somehow he shovels it up and over the field. Outstanding talent"
backs away and cuts the short ball on off stump to point
"<b>there's no stopping it</b>. India would have hoped to keep a leash on the run-rate in the middle overs, especially with a spinner taking the wicket, but Pooran and now Hope aren't allowing that. This is a length ball that the batsman just steps forward to and smokes through the line. Six over long-on"
slaps the back of a length ball through cover point
<B>beats him</B> as a good length ball drifts across the left-hander
<B>excellent work on the long-on boundary by Iyer</b>. Runs across to his left to hunt down a brutally hit ball destined to go for the boundary. And it almost does; nearly bursts through his hands
whips a shortish delivery on off stump through square leg
shapes to pull a back of a length ball outside off but it ends up an inside edge onto pad and becomes a single to cover
"<b>sails over square leg</b>. Pandey's the fielder and he's a good one too, tracks it all the way, but there is enough power in the pull shot from Pooran to clear the rope"
cuts a shortish delivery outside off to point
mi-shits a cut to cover with the ball cramping him
<b>disappears down the ground</b>. Pooran spots the ball tossed up. He knows he can free the arms. He loves doing it and he absolutely shows off. This is a superb innings
"rocks back to cut the follow up ball, which is obviously shorter, but there is some extra bounce"
"<b>nails it through point</b> - this shot and those straight hits - are messing with India's spinners. When they bowl flat, no matter how much it turns, and it is turning, Pooran is quick enough to make room and hammer it away. Then when they toss it up, he's onto the front foot with a bit bat swing. Zero margin for error and because of that it's hard to judge the team that already has 387 runs on the board"
picks the slower bouncer and holds his shape for long enough to pull it in front of square leg
"<b>that is pure power</b>! He makes Chahar look as Chahar is, a 130 kph medium pacer bowling a short ball. And he pummels him straight of midwicket."
"pitches it up and beats him, that's Chahar's USP. He gets the ball to nibble when he pitches it up and the only reason he isn't doing it often enough are the short boundaries and that scary bat swing"
"almost a yorker on leg stump, he whips it to deep midwicket"
"digs it in short, but it soars over Hope even as he tries to bring it down with a pull shot"
"another bouncer, the slower kind, and this time he manages to keep it below the wide line"
"goes wide of the crease to nail the yorker, Hope steers it backward of point"
<b>and awaaaaaaay we go</b>. A length ball on leg stump is simply a gift to a man in form and Pooran just flicks it over the square leg boundary. Minimum effort. Absolutely minimum. He doesn't even look to see the ball go over the boundary. Just turns his head down to look at the ground. What a player!
"back of a length and outside off, Pooran looks to drive on the up and gets a thick outside edge to the third man boundary"
"nails the yorker on off stump, Pooran digs it out"
"<b>soooo quick, both the ball which flies across the turf, and Jadeja who stops it going for four</b>. Pooran has such a range of shots - his pull here is absolutely beastly. So are his cuts and that big wind up down the ground is just awesome too"
<b>tails into the right-hander</b> and Hope is just about able to turn it through midwicket
"full toss outside off, smoothly driven to long-off"
<b>beats him</b> with big turn. Lovely from Kuldeep. He tosses it up and keeps it wide of Pooran's reach. The flight on the ball though makes him swing to leg and he misses completely
"<b>just over the diving long-off</b> Iyer is there and he's already pulled off an epic run out. If it flies over him, it's a proper shot. This legbreak was just close enough for Pooran to swing right through the line"
the short ball follow-up is hammered down the ground and the <b>long-on fielder just lets it through him</b>. Rahul there with the mistake and Kohli is not too impressed
"short and outside off, clatters it to the sweeper"
"leading edge as he tosses the googly up on leg stump, wanting Hope to do what he does, hitting into the leg side. Doesn't carry back to the bowler"
tosses up the wrong 'un but Hope picks it and just defends
"low full toss outside off, he drives to mid-off"
"<b>top edge</b> and its taken! Second innings Shami? Close enough! He digs it into the wicket. It's also outside off so Pooran, who goes for the pull, is not only struggling to get on top of the ball, he has to drag it as well. Low-percetage shot results in a mistake and Kuldeep skirting on the long leg boundary takes an excellent, composed catch. End of a fabuous innings from a talent who will no doubt light up the T20 World Cup next year."
"<B>two in two</b>! India have indeed come roaring back! And Vizag absolutely loves it. The horns are out. The cheers are back. Shami's brought them into uproar with a beautiful over. This ball, the perfect Test match ball, pitched up outside off, swinging away even, draws Pollard to play away from his body and nick through to the keeper. Both captains out for golden ducks today"
"avoids the hat-trick by steering the ball towards third man. Shami didn't go for the stumps here, it well outside off on length and Holder steered it behind square with minimal footwork"
"<b>nasty bouncer and a stare from Shami</b>. He bangs it in short, it rises on Hope who takes his eyes off the ball while protecting his face with the bat which sends the ball to midwicket. Shami is on fire"
"another short ball, this one not a bouncer and Hope tucks it to fine leg"
"<b>missed stumping</b>! Hope is lured forward by a peach of a ball, the googly dipping as it comes down on off stump. Hope thinks its the ball that turns in, he's trying to reach the pitch and flick through midwicket. He's completely beaten and Pant is completely unsighted. He can't see the ball coming to him and he misses the stumping"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
presses forward to block outside off
"shapes to cut as soon as he sees the ball wandering away outside off, but Kuldeep gets it to turn sharply and makes Holder block"
chips a good length ball outside off to long-on
"tosses it up on middle, it's the googly again, Hope keeps it out"
<b>beats him</b> with a good length ball that holds its line outside off. Holder fishes outside off and comes in second best
crunches the back of a length ball outside off through to the sweeper
"<b>dropped</b> but this is a seriously tough change. Kohli picks up these catches, especially in the outfield, running back,tracking it over his shoulder, he reaches his left hand out, it has to stick, but it doesn't. Audacious pull shot from Hope, when he has no room to free the arms and midway through he has to change his shot and try and hit over the top with a straighter bat"
pulls the short ball on middle stump away to long leg
"back of a length and outside off, pushes to cover"
pulls the bouncer down to long leg and Chahar almost messes it up again
"tosses it up outside off and he wallops it over wide long-on. Excellent shot, making use of those long levers"
"<b>beats him with the googly</b>, pitching it on off stump, and pulling his length back and doing everything he needs to"
nudges a good length ball on leg stump away into the midwicket region
"<B>excellent catch, right on the edge of the boundary</b>. Kohli again. At deep midwicket. He tracks the ball all the way - a fairly hard hit sweep shot against the wrong 'un - waits on the edge of the rope, leans back over it, takes it with both hands above his head and signals the wicket by sticking his forefinger up in the air. Superb stuff"
"have they got him? Looks like they have. Holder deceived in flight as he looks to drive against the turn. Except, this is a googly that he hasn't picked. Ends up dragging his feet out of the crease. As he tries to get back, the back foot is in the air and Pant effects an excellent stumping."
"edged and gone! The second of his career. This is a wrong'un from around the stumps, lands this on middle and off. Alzarri looks to work it to the leg side, and closes the bat face, gets a thick outside edge and Jadhav takes a good catch at second slip. <b> Kuldeep is the first Indian to take two international hat-tricks </b>. A good time to remind you all that Kuldeep also has a hat-trick for India at the Under-19 level."

"hustled for pace, rapped on the glove as this rolls towards fine leg"
