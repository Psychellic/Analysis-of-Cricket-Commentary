"pitched up on middle, driven to long-on"
stays back and tries to whip a length ball away but it drifts down the leg side
shot! Timed and placed sweetly through the right of extra cover
<b>in the air and short of mid-on</b>. Kulkarni bowls this full and Yadav flicked early to slice it in the air. Mid-on dives forward but it just drops short

"short of a length, nips away off the deck and makes him reach out as he gets beaten"
"fullish length, swinging away, covers for the movement and drills it to cover who gets a hand to it and takes momentum out of the ball"

works away a fuller one off the inside of the bat to deep backward square leg
"short and holding its line outside off, arches back and lets it go"

drifts a back of a length delivery down the legside
"short, angled into him, hits the elbow as he tries to fend it away"
"<b>in the air, stays there for like forever, and Binny can't get his hands to it at mid-on.</b> He got in position nicely, mind you, but that took so long to come down Binny might as well have taken a power nap.  Goes reverse-cupped and the ball just about grazes the fingers before landing on the ground. Lewis gets lots of elevation but hardly much distance on this loft down the ground"
angled too sharply down the leg side and Yadav can't put it away with the glance
""
tries to open the face late for a run down to third man but manages no contact
"extremely full outside off, Lewis squeezes it out to point"

"short of good length, jumps inside the crease to get on top of it and uses the angle to tuck it through midwicket. Good timing on that one"
"full on middle and leg, pushed down the ground to mid-on"
"almost knocks over the non-striker. A slower full ball, gets a bit of a leading edge as he closes the face and chips it in the air. Lewis just about gets under it as the ball races down the ground for four"

too full and sneaks from underneath the bat as he reaches out for it
picks the slower ball really early and waits before opening the face and running it through backward point. Knew his field to perfection
"dipping fuller one outside off, reaches out and squeezes it out to short third man for a quick one"
"yorker on middle, this is good, tight bowling, drilled away to the left of mid-off where Stokes hurries across and cuts it off"

"walks down the ground and Unadkat pulls his length back, Lewis steers to third man with an open face"
"legside fuller ball, Lewis gets down for a sweep and he's timed it alright, but it's ridiculous how that's carried over the backward square leg fence. A flat six"

"non-turning length ball on a leg-stump line, whipped off the pads through square leg"
"short of a length, spinning away, punched down to long-on"

"back of a length, misses the flick behind square as the ball goes off the hip"
tries to pull this short one but skews it in the air off the top part of the bat. Unadkat at long leg moves forward and takes a superb low catch. Around shin height
"and now Unadkat grabs a chest-height catch. Rohit is out first ball, and Mumbai are losing some ground. Rohit flays a pull to this short ball but it goes straight to long leg. That was travelling and Unadkat reverse-cups and falls over as he completes the catch. That's a brilliant piece of fielding"

gets down for a sweep but the ball drifts down the leg side
"full toss, lots of elevation on that one and it seems as though he's mishit it. But on the Wankhade, that's a six. What's more, it's <b>smashed into the press box. But no damage done</b>"

"good length, a bit of width, Lewis opens up and slaps but slices it in the air and Sanju Samson moves to his right and snaffles it at deep point"

"short outside off, Hardik doesn't even arch back as much as he ramps it through the third man region"
"short of a length around off, punched to short cover"
"shortish, it's slower at 113.1kmph, and that gets in the way of Kishan's timing. Skews it off a bit ofa top-edge and Samson judges a catch to perfection at deep midwicket. Moves slightly back and grabs it reverse-cupped with the floodlights in his line of vision"

"wide of the crease, slanting in at off stump, Hardik opens the face, tips the ball to short third man and hares across. The fielder (Kulkarni) misses a direct hit at the striker's end"
"big lifter on off from over the stumps, Unadkat forces Krunal to duck under it"
"another short ball, wide outside off, away from the reach of Krunal's hook. Beaten in the end"
"<b>Gowtham nearly drops it</b>. He hangs onto the catch on the rebound. After playing out two dots, Krunal goes for an almighty leg-side swing. He doesn't have the pace to work with. This is the offcutter from Unadkat, bounces from a length outside off, Krunal wants to drag it from there. But he can only skew a catch to long-on, where Gowtham nearly made a mess of it"
"short on middle, shimmies out and whips to deep midwicket"
"Hardik shuffles across off and throws Archer off his line. Sprayed down leg, leg-side wide"

"<strong>147ks - pace like fire</strong> - bouncer, aimed at the head, rocks his head out of the way. What a way to finish your spell. Well done, Archer"
"timely boundary for Mumbai. This a monster six. Length ball on middle, Hardik stretches out, shows off his high elbow and smokes it straight down the ground. Into the second tier. Bam!"
"Unadkat goes for the wide yorker, it comes out as a low full-toss outside off, not quite the MS Dhoni slice over backward point, but still effective. Back-to-back boundaries for Hardik"
"the pressure gets to Unadkat. Full and spared wide outside off, past the marker"
"seam-up, the yorker isn't coming out right for Unadkat. Low full-toss outside off, Hardik rocks forward, lets his hands flow through the line. Smeared up and over extra cover for another six. <strong>Last four balls 17 runs</strong>"
"lifter outside off from around the stumps, gets big on Hardik, who lines up for a hook. Top-edges over midwicket, does not carry to the man in the deep"
"<strong>Archer now drops an absolute sitter</strong>. Look at Warne in the dugout: he has his hands on his mouth. Slower offcutter outside off, Cutting is way too early into his slog-sweep and toe-ends it into the sky. It drops down and Archer drops it at backward point"
"seam-up, bouncer, fizzes through outside off, beats the batsman's lousy attempt to uppercut it away"
"Cutting tees off in the final over. Slower ball, 100ks, but too full on middle, Cutting clears his front leg and smites it over the long-on fence. Muscled away. Royals continue to err in lengths"
"seam-up, short and angling into the body, beats the batsman for pace, hits the thigh and rolls away to short third man"
"The man behind the stumps is a master of this shot. The man in front shows off he can do it too. Hardik jumps across off, meets a slower length ball and flips it away past the left of the diving Buttler"
"107.8ks slower ball outside off, Hardik goes for an encore. Hardik fails. He can't touch the ball"
"<strong>Samson pulls off a blinder</strong>. He is a wicketkeeper but he tears across to his right in the outfield and plucks a diving catch at deep midwicket. He tumbles onto the ground but still holds his balance and hangs onto the ball. Full and drifting into the pads, Samson picks it up and shovels a catch. That it was a catch was down to Samson's brilliance"
"slower short ball outside off, Cutting can't manufacture his own pace. Dragged away to wide long-on. Cutting hares back for the second"
"<B>Zoinks, that is a staggeringly good first ball</B>, a massive booming inswinger, Short jabs down late and somehow digs it out through fine leg for four!"
"not such a good ball... a horrid leg-side wide... sublime to ridiculous, much like the earlier catching..."
"Short is creasebound, and pokes awkwardly as the ball zips through from back of a length"
"on the back foot, dragging the length back well this time"
"a good zippy length, sliding into the bat, on the back foot once more"
"<B>edged and gone!</B> And that had been coming all over! A bit of swing, Bumrah gets his line right, Short's feet going nowhere, and the keeper snaffles a comfortable nick!"
"<strong>that's the way to do it! </strong>Good positive footwork, stretching to meet the half-volley and slice-driving it through the covers"
"on the back foot, left-arm over the wicket, Buttler slides back to meet the ball under his nose, deep in his crease"

"back of a length, tapped to point and a jogged single ensues"
"<B>swept hard to square leg and has that carried to Markande?</B> No it hasn't ... a flurry of excitement, but Buttler was unbothered. Good connection, if a touch early. Nope, just short"
tucked out to midwicket once more
flicked into the leg side for another single
"whipped off the pads, that's a superb connection, timed through the 45, and away to the rope"
"<B>attempted ramp from Rahane, but he wears it on the glove</B>. Leaning back, attempting to pinch a four through third man, but the slower ball did for him"
sliding down the leg side
"short and sharp, and though it's down the leg side, it's tight enough to the body to get away with it. More aggression in that delivery"
"<B>dinky wristwork!</B> Played it so late it was almost into next week, and when you've got angles like those in your locker, who needs extreme power?"
punched on the up to mid-off
"pounded with massive intent, front foot cleared to the leg side, but Cutting gathers in the long barrier at mid-off"
"swept once more, out to backward square"
"nurdled out to deep midwicket, no need to rush for the Royals"
"makes room early, Krunal follows him, Buttler retreats some more, lofts inside out over cover, <strong>and away for four!</strong> Skill and power"
"down on one knee,<B> and away she goes!</B> High over backward square, just high enough to lob over the flaying fielder"
"crunched to extra cover, they decline to take the single for the slight misfield"
"pumped into the covers, more intent for no runs this time, but they are starting to flow now"
another intentful glide into the covers
"more wristy flipping, from a good length on off stump out through backward square."
"Buttler inverts his stance for his trademark scoop shot, the length was safe enough, but no contact as the ball hops over his stumps"
"<B>blam!</B> So much bottom hand! Over-pitched, in the arc, and utterly butchered for a one-bounce four through long-off"
"another attempted scoop, another non-connection. Nothing ventured, nothing gained..."
"that's a good response from Pandya, shorter and sharper, tempting Buttler into the ramp shot, but the ball is through him too quickly. Cat-and-mouse stuff in that over"
"just back of a good length, angling into the right-hander, tucked off the legs"
nudged into the leg side
"crunched into the covers, on the front foot"
"on the back foot, dragging the length back, and worked back to the bowler. This is a very good over so far"
"opens the face to glide down to third man, a good release shot but nothing wrong with the ball. Tight stuff"
"<B>whoops, that's ruined the effect!</B> An attempted slower ball, but it comes out as a horrid hip-high wide full-toss. Contemptuously blatted through long-off"
bottom-handed punch down to long on
"marching down to meet the pitch, <strong>and deposited back over the bowler's head!</strong> Such poise, power and timing"
shuffling feet and pushed into the covers
flicked off the legs to fine leg

tossed up and driven to long off
back of a length and pushed to long-on
"attempted back-cut, can't get it off the square but they scamper the single, Krunal has been effective tonight"

"<B>stunning ball!</B> Tossed up, dips late, spins and bounces, and whistles through his pushed drive and over the top of middle! Takes a good ball to get past Buttler at the moment"

"worked to the leg side, on the back foot"
"flicked in the air, but one bounce, down to the sweeper at backward square"
pushed to the off side
"down on one knee, an ambitious sweep and a huge appeal! They are tempted to have a look, and yep, here we go, it's a <B>review!</B> It's Buttler, so it's worth the gamble, though it did look optimistic. Going to have to be smashing leg to be overturned... nope, <B>it's missing leg!</B>"
eased down to long on
"no contact this time, as this one zips through Buttler's swing and into his thigh-pad"
pounded down to long-on with a fierce swing through the line. A good shot for just a single
"width this time, and cracked hard out to point"
"slapped in the air, and <B>just wide of short third man!</B> Bumrah is the man, can't quite get his feet moving quickly enough to intercept a rare chance"
worked into the covers to hand over the strike
"flicked to the leg side, they scuttle the first in a jiffy, and turn sharply for the second. Excellent pressure"
"<B>that's just power and placement!</B> Pounded through the covers, to bring up the five in a row! Not a lot wrong with the ball, but the shot was poetry"
"fizzing through to the keeper, the left-arm line taking the ball clear of an ambitious wallop"
"through to the keeper once more, good pace and line"
"a round-house pull, out to midwicket. Not perfectly timed but gets enough bat through the ball to steal the single"
"<strong>mown through the covers like a combine-harvester across the outfield!</strong> Such fast hands, giving him time to angle the ball through the field"
"inverts his stance, for the third time this innings. And for the third time, he makes no contact. That one's not working today Jos"
"slower-ball bouncer, Buttler has the big wind-up but he can't make any contact. There've been some moments in this innings where Buttler's been out-smarted, but he finds a way to hit back every time"
"in the slot, spanked high and hard, there's a fielder lurking at deep mid-off, and <B>he just about clings on!</B> Yadav over-ran that shot at first, and almost slid back into a position to catch it in his midriff. Ungainly, but timely!"
flicked down to fine leg to get off the mark
"<strong>absolutely slaughtered into the stands!</strong> He's having a lot of fun out there now, head right over the ball, even at the point of contact, and slammed with Popeye forearms over cow corner!"
"<B>flat, hard, frightening power!</B> Get in the way of that if you dare. Long-on can't, he doesn't have time!"
"spanked with more power down to long-on, and this time it's intercepted"
pushed out to deep cover to keep the strike
sliding back into the crease to guide a length ball into the covers
guided down to third man
"too short for a man seeing it this well. Buttler stands firm, such a solid base, and baseball swings over the leg side"
"<B>banjaxed into the stands!</B> Where do you bowl to this man? A more aggressive short ball this time, but it just brings out a more aggressive swing of the blade, over square leg!"
pushed into the off side
"tucked into the leg side, to keep the strike. The Royals are ticking along nicely"
"sliding down the leg side, and paddled calmly down through fine leg. Cute and effective"

"eased down to long-on, calm as you like"
"width outside off, attempted slap into the covers but no proper connection"
"very full length from round the wicket, driven with an open face and gathered in the gully. An almost Test-match flash of play there. It won't last"
"outside off again, back of a length and pace off the ball, inside-edged into the pads and they steal the single"
"pounded down to long-off, clearing the front leg and connecting with power and intent once more"
"short, <B>too short!</B> The keeper does exceptionally to take off like a jump-jet and get a glove on that to slow its path to the boundary"
"slower ball, aiming for the tramlines, and that's worked out in the end. Buttler left it alone, but was adjudged to have shuffled close enough to have a swing"
"<strong>panned over long on!</strong> The beast is tearing up the Wankhede! One bounce, inches inside the rope, and he's 12 away from his hundred with 16 runs to play with..."
"fully forward, driven into the covers"
"slower ball, too short, and Samson responds with arguably the <strong>most massive spank of the night</strong>! High and mighty into the floodlights and 20 rows back!"
"Samson has no interest in landmarks, he just wants a quick finish! Powered over cow corner, and this one is utterly cooked!"
"through to the keeper this time, but it's a dot ball too late"
"an inside-out slap over the off side, but he hasn't got enough on this, and <B>holes out to deep point!</B> Comfortably snaffled by the sub Chahar"
"<B>finished in style!</B> Stunning feat of beast-mode batting, clobbered violently into the midwicket stands, and the Royals have stolen a critical march on Mumbai in the battle for the play-offs..."
