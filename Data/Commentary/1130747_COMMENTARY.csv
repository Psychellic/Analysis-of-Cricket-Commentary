"full on off stump, driven down the ground to long off"
"good length on middle stump, comes down the wicket and sticks his bat out. tapped to deep extra cover"
"<b>Gunathilaka shows the cobra celebration to the non-striker!</b> Good length outside off stump, angling further away and the batsman shimmies down the wicket to meet it. Misses, and stumped! <b>Sri Lanka win by 75 runs</b>"
