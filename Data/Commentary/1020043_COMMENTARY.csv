<strong>Morne produces the breakthrough</strong>! Lovely delivery. Elgar pouches a smart catch at third slip. Latham's woes continue. You don't need DRS for this. Full and Morne runs this across the left-hander from over the wicket. Seams away and bounces at the batsman. Latham is stapled to the crease as he prods with an angled bat and edges it behind. He had to play at it; the line was around off. Morne finds reward for an excellent opening spell

Williamson brought his bat in line, but the ball did too much. TV umpire Oxenford says: <b>'Ball-tracking is not available'</b>. What? Bizarre. Williamson has to go.
