"gentle outswinger to start outside off, not very pacey. Warner shuffles across to pat to mid-on"
fullish length and wide outside off. More movement. Nice away shape at 135 kph. Pushed to cover with minimal feet movement
"very wide outside off, good length outside off. Warner shuffles across to chop to point. Nice lengths"
"closer to off without as much movement. Good length outside off, Warner taps a defensive stroke to point with the intent of getting one. makes it easy. Well run"
"superb delivery. Lots of movement. Full outside off, fifth-stump line. The ball banana swings away from Dhawan's drive. Exemplary bowling"
"really good start from Zaheer. Back of a length on off, the ball doesn't move as much and so Dhawan is a taken aback by the delivery holding its course. Awkwardly hit to cover"
"a bit of spin initially. Good signs for Daredevils. Quite full and straight, Warner blocks"
"flatter trajectory delivery on off, Warner rocks back to punch into the off side"
"too full on middle, But Warner is rather watchful so he drives back to the bowler"
"slashed for four. Shortish on off, Warner hurries back and laces a cut past the gully fielder. Came on with the arm and Warner dispatched it with ease"
"lovely batting. His form on display. Clears his front foot, makes room and thrashes a superbly-timed cover drive through extra cover. Not a bad delivery at all from Jayant"
"and now straighter and tucked into the leg side, against the spin. Flatter on middle, Warner goes back and clips to wide mid-on"
"length on off, not as much movement. Warner pushes to mid-off for a quick run."
"nice intent. Didn't bother keeping it down and went after the full delivery. Outside off so Dhawan threw his hands at it, the bottom hand coming off the bat upon contact. Whistles away over extra cover"
"great batting. Nagging line around off, Dhawan taps by his feet and Warner responds. Easily done"
another very good delivery but Warner makes room to drive to cover. Good length on off and middle.
"a bit ugly there. Good length on off again, Warner shimmies down and mis-times his lofted drive to mid-on. Another run"
"huge appeal, Zaheer isn't happy. A very full delivery on leg, Dhawan surprised by the length gets his bat down late. The ball hits the pad first but too much doubt regarding direction, I presume. Sliding down leg?"
"another slash for four. Full and wide outside off, Warner clears a foot and reaches out toget bat on ball. Sends the skew over point for four"
"changes the length and gets punished again. Short delivery on middle, Warner swats his forehand in front of square. Square leg cleans up"
"wow. Back of a length on off, Warner backs away and pummels his slap over cover this time. Easily clears the infield and races away"
"shorter and shorter goes NCN. Very short on off, Warner reaches out to upper cut but can't get bat on it"
too straight this time and worked to midwicket for another quick single
"nicely played by Dhawan this time. NCN hasn't bowled a good over, trying too much this time and angles a full delivery on Dhawan's pads. Discernible use of the wrists to work it uppishly pats short fine leg. Just out of the fielder's reach"
lovely bowling. Anticipated the forward movement from Warner so shortened the length on off. Bunted back
slogged away. Off the inside half of the bat to deep midwicket for a couple
"much too flat. And that is sensational timing. Shot of the tournament. On middle and leg, Warner backs away and closes the bat face at the last moment to work the ball past mid-on. How did he get so much power behind that?"
four more. This is a short delivery on middle and it sits up for Warner to power over mid-on. Clears the fielder comfortably
"too short again, Warner backs away and laces a cut to extra cover"
another flat one on leg. Warner backs away yet again but chops his cut to cover. Not a bad over but still plenty of runs from it
"overpitched outside off, pushed to mid-off for a brisk run"
"good stuff. Cramping Warner for room. Good length on middle and leg, Warner inside-edges onto his pad"
"change in pace, the slower delivery on off. Skewed to deep square leg. So big are the dimensions of the ground that two easy runs are available"
"dropped. Good length outside off, Warner hammers the ball back at Brathwaite so hard that his parry almost carries to mid-off. Brathwaite just about got a hand on it. On the bounce to mid-off"
"shortish delivery outside off, Warner gets on top of the bounce to slap to deep cover"
"superb from Brathwaite. He is pumped. Wow, what fielding. Amazing stuff. Big moment in the game. Full delivery from Brathwaite on off, Dhawan hits towards mid-on and thinks he has got the ball through so he hurtles away for the run. But Brathwaite gets his big frame down to stop the ball with his left hand. He then turns around and fires an accurate throw at the striker's end with his body on the ground"
"Mishy starts with a flat delivery on middle, Warner backs away to hit to cover"
"googly outside off, Warner goes back and turns the ball to deep midwicket"
edged on the bounce to first slip. JP gets a hand on it and ricochets the ball to third man
"what is happening? Hooda run-out this time. Warner wasn't interested in the run at all because there was no run on offer. Another googly outside off, Warner swats it back to the bowler who parries it away towards short cover. Hooda sets off for the run, but Warner refuses. Hooda returns, or tries to but Mishra is quick on the ball and effects a direct hit at the bowler's end"
"fullish on middle, bunted down to long-off"
"flat outside off, pushed to point to get off the mark"
"good length on off, turned to midwicket"

"back of a length on off, Yuvraj chops the ball back onto his body"
good lines. On and around off. Yuvraj hurries into a defensive stroke towards cover
back of a length on leg. Aimed at Yuvi's ribs. Off the thigh pad to short fine leg
"nicely tossed up on off, driven to wide cover for a run. Warner wanted two, but Yuvraj didn't"
"too straight on leg, and nurdled away to wide midwicket"
"nicely played. Very intentional. Shortish and flat on off, comes on with the arm. Yuvraj waits for the ball to come to him before thrashing a late cut through third man. Very Test match type stroke. Nice"
well done again. Uses his feet to get to the pitch of the flight. Driven to long-off
slowish on leg and middle. Worked to short midwicket for one. Warner has to lay down anchor it seems
"quiet flat again on middle. Yuvraj tickles towards square leg. Many twos will be seen tonight, this is one of em"
"slower delivery on off, squeezed to deep cover. Warner gets back for another brace"
"shortish length outside off, slapped to deep cover"
bowled im. Big wicket. Did that keep low? Brathwaite goes wide of the crease and angles it away from Yuvraj who drives away from his body. A thick inside edge clatters into off stump and Sunrisers in a bit of trouble
very wide. Banged in mid-pitch. Way over Henriques' head. De Kock does well to leap to the ball
"back of a length outside off, swatted to midwicket"
"straightish on middle and leg, hit to midwicket with a rather straight bat"
"uppish but safe. Was there a bit of glove? Back of a length on leg, off the thigh pad to square leg. May have kissed some glove too"
"googly on off, Henriques doesn't pick it and is lucky that his inside edge evaded the stumps. two to fine leg"
another googly. Henriques picks it this time and turns the ball to square leg for a couple. Nice
"flat on middle, the legbreak. Worked to wide midwicket"
"ooh wow. Just wow. Mishra sees Warner switching his hands and so bowls the seam-up quick delivery outside off. Warner would have wanted to sweep hard but since the ball was flat and quick, he just helped it over short third man. Switch hit"
"flat and short, swatted to wide midwicket"
"lovely bowling.  A nice legbreak on middle from wide of the crease, Henriques drives too early, a thick outside edge skews to point"

another slower variation on middle. Henriques shovels a straight-bat flick to the right of midwicket
"back of a length on off, awkwardly played to cover"
"massive. A golf swing for six. Warner picks the slower delivery, clears his front foot, sets himself by getting on one knee and then a swat for six over long-on. Makes it look so easy"
"full and wide, scythed to deep cover"
poor delivery. Short on leg with no protection. Square leg is in the circle. Henriques dispatches the ball with a well-timed pull through backward square leg
"flat on off, slapped to deep point. Large pockets so an easy couple"
"just a tad short and Warner picks the length early, goes back and clobbers a pull past midwicket. Magnificent innings"
oh lovely. Slowed it up just enough to extract just enough turn to sneak it past Warner;s outside edge
and again. Rips past Warner;s outside edge from a good length. Good comeback
"a lot more respectful. Flight on leg, a thick inside edge toward short fine leg"
"flat outside off, chopped to Mishra at third man"
"smashed straightaway. Flat on off, Henriques clears a foot and slog sweeps with adequate timing wide of long-on."
"lovely batting. That is the way to play on this ground. Tossed up on off, pushed to deep cover. Henriques wanted two immediately."
taken at deep midwicket. Too big a ground to clear those square boundaries. Henriques tries and goes after the slog sweep. Times it beautiful but doesn't get enough power behind it. The fielder backtracks and takes a good overhead catch next to the boundary

leg side-ish and pushed to long-on
"short and wide from Brathwaite. Warner stretches out to reach it, slaps it in front of cover for a couple"
"huge huge wicket this. Shortish outside off, Warner could have picked any spot in the ground but chose to thrash a ball. Couldn't quite get on top of the bounce and so top edged his cut. Straight to Mishra at third man"
"shortish and straight, Naman gets high to fend off, back up the pitch"
too leg side-ish and worked to fine leg from the crease
"good length outside off, Morgan lets the ball angle off his bat to third man"
"poor calling from Naman. Good length outside off, steered past point. Naman completes his run, turns around, steps out for the second before yelling 'no, no, no'. Morgan didn't leave his crease"
"good length outside off, ramped off the open face to third man. Just one"
"dropped. Should have been taken. May have been some pace off the ball on off, Morgan was through his drive early. Just about carried to Pant at cover. The ball smashed into his wrist"
worked away into the leg side from a good length
"offcutter, just down leg. Morgan shuffled across and the ball almost clipped leg stump"
"low full toss on middle, chipped to midwicket. Another run"
"fullish on middle and leg, uppishly driven to mid-on. Looked like a long run, but Ojha again said no. Not great running from him"
"wow, what power. Another full delivery outside off, Morgan stays in his crease and forehands his swat over long-on. Immense power"
"back of a length on middle, slapped awkwardly over the bowler. Long-off fields but two easy runs"
"another timely wicket for Daredevils. Shortish delivery outside off, Morgan cannot keep his pull down or cannot get enough behind the pull. Skied straight to long-on. Could be a 10-run difference"
hitting the middle of the pitch again. Ojha pulls in front of square for a couple
another short delivery outside off. Ojha gets on top of the bounce but just misses a steer
"some lucky runs. just the one bye. Full and wide outside off, Ojha looked to glide to third man but missed. Through de Kock too"
"six. Big. Short on leg, Naman gets behind the line and then pulls with sufficient timing to get the ball over the square leg boundary"
"good intent. Slower delivery on off, leading edge skews past point. Naman labours back for the second and makes it in with a full-length dive. Would have been out with a clean collection but de Kock doesn't collect"
"another cutter outside off, misses"
"more pace off the ball. Offcutter outside off, Naman chops to point for one"
"another offcutter on middle. With mid-on up, Bhuvi backs away and smashes the ball over that fielder. Did not get enough power behind the stroke but enough for a one-bounce boundary"
"short on leg, glided off the open face to third man"
great batting from Bhuvi. Picking his strokes and executing beautifully. Slower delivery and full.Mid-off is up. Bhuvi powers a lofted drive over mid-off. Four more
"a bit of a wild slog that. Back of a length on leg, Bhuvi comes down and misses his swipe"
"low full toss on middle, Ojha drills a drive to Zaheer at mid-off. Some miscommunication but just one"
"short delivery on leg, awkwardly pulled to deep square leg. Good length that from NCN"
"misfield from Zaheer at mid-off. Costs Daredevils one. Full and wide outside off, hit off the back foot. Zaheer dives over it and the ball bursts through"
"could be out. Fullish on leg from around the wicket, miscued to long-on. Bhuvi comes back for the second but the throw from long-on is good to the keeper and de Kock whips off the bails with Bhuvi short"
awful start from Bhuvi. Leg stump start down leg. Even Ojha's full-length dive doesn't help. Five
too wide outside off this time. Starts the outswinger too wide. Six free runs for Daredevils
"fullish outside off, pushed down to mid-off. Enough movement for Bhuvi"
nice comeback. Nice length around off from Bhuvi. De Kock defends from the crease
"fullish and wide outside off, lots of width. Not a great delivery. De Kock thrashes a cut to extra cover"
"through mid-off for more runs. Good length outside off, the ball moving away. Not great timing but enough"
"very tight around off. The ball moving away, hit towards mid-on"
"good end after a horror start. Fullish and wide, moving away. Driven with his feet moving towards the ball to cover"
"back of a length on off, Pant stays in his crease and blocks"
"a naughty misfield from Williamson. Chaos all around. Short and wide outside off, laced to KW at backward point. Pant comes for the second, de Kock doesn't then steps out. Both watching the ball. All good in the end"
"oh yes. Full and wide outside off, enough away movement to beat de Kock's drive comprehensively"
"oh no. De Kock misses a routine flick. Full on the pads, a leg side offering. Pings off the pad to midwicket"
"gone. Big wicket for Sunrisers. Fullish and wide outside off, De Kock clears one foot and loosely wafts at the ball. A thin outside edge is gladly accepted by Ojha. Lacked fluency there did de Kock"
"nice length. Full and wide, inviting the ball to swing. Swerves back in but Nair defends confidently to point"

"back of a length outside off, Pant punches from the back foot to cover"

"<strong>dropped. Warner has dropped a clanger</strong>. Uh oh. Back of a length on off, Nair backs away and mistimes his pull. Warner ran in from long-on, maybe ran in too hard"
"what happened there? yorker down leg, off the pad. Naman fumbles while diving. Nair wanted one and reached the middle of the pitch before Duminy turned the run down. He scampered back in time"

back of a length delivery on middle. Duminy backs away to dab to third man.
"offcutter outside off, Nair goes across and tries to ramp the bowler but gets a top edge into his helmet and almost carries to point too"
good batting. Moving around in the crease. Mustafizur tries to follow the batsman but fires it too wide. Called
"lovely. Gets it across this time. Back of a length on off, Nair shuffles across and gets bat on his scoop, over short fine leg. Vital boundary"
"short delivery on leg, 132 kph. Nair can't quite execute his pull. A run to square leg"
"<strong>dropped. Bhuvi has dropped a sitter this time</strong>. Big moment in the game. This could prove very costly. Full and wide outside off, Duminy walked across and tried to loft over mid-off but ended up skewing to sweeper cover. Bhuvi got under it and the ball smashed into the hard part of his palm and then bounced out"

"beautifully bowled. Wide yorker, Nair reaches out for it but cannot reach"
"short delivery on middle, too leg side-ish. Therefore Nair can go through with his swing and doesn't have to reach for it. Way over the square leg boundary. Not a bad option but line was wrong from Sran"
"nice comeback. Low full toss on middle, bunted to Warner at long-on, who scurries onto it to prevent the second. Great fielding"

"tries another. Full and wide, too wide, outside the tramline. Called."
"back of a length on leg, off the thigh pad back up the pitch. Bhuvi gets to the ball and kicks it but misses the stumps. Would have been out"

"a ripping offcutter outside off, Brathwaite tries to steer to third man but misses. Not a bad option from CB. Bat on ball required"
"what a catch. Sran shows his team-mates how to do it. Unbelievable. Amazing. Did I say unbelievable? Wow. Another offcutter outside off, Brathwaite gets a thick outside edge and it looks like it is destined for the third man boundary. Sran leaps to his left and holds on with both hands. That will test the catch of the tournament. What a moment to pull this off. Sran judged it perfectly and timed his jump too"
"fullish on leg, bunted to long-on, on the bounce to Warner"
great bowling. Sees Nair backing away and fires a full yorker outside off. No run
"full on off, pushed to Warner at long-on. The throw is good to the keeper but even the labouring Nair is comfortably back for the second"

"there is one of them. A short delivery on leg, awkwardly pulled past square leg. An easy two"
excellent yorker. Just the one this time. A leg bye to fine leg. Great execution
"this is god change-up. Nair is sitting back, waiting for the yorker, like me. But it is a back of  a length delivery on leg, surprises Nair for pace. Off the glove to point"
"another leg bye. Full on leg, Samson cannot get bat on his flick. Not easy to execute at this stage, but Bhuvi has handled himself well."
"four. What a moment. Back of a length on middle, Nair is hurried for pace again but slaps it down the ground, past mid-off. Warner gets across but cannot haul it in"
"through Warner at mid-on and Daredevils have a much needed win. What a game. Nair has done it. Back of a length on middle, Nair slaps another to wide mid-on. Warner, it seemed, dived over the ball. And to the long-on boundary. Warner beats the turf as he misses"
