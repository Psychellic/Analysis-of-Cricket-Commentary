"wow, what a start first up. Length ball, Agarwal plants his foot forward and lofts it cleanly over cover. Just a firm push and the ball flew off the bat, couple of bounces into the ropes"
hops back and taps it with soft hands towards point
way over the batsman's head. Looks to test his technique against the short ball by banging it short on middle. Agarwal was in no position to play the hook
uses the pace and runs it down to third man
"play and a miss. Not much feet movement as he looks to force that behind point, beaten for pace. Good bounce for Russell, thuds into Uthappa's gloves"
"whipped away behind square. Sweet timing, good work in the deep by Munro"
"outstanding stop at backward point by Manish Pandey, fires a throw at the bowler's end where de Kock had almost give up, but there was no one backing up. End result: four overthrows. Delhi won't complain, Gambhir lets out a cry of anguish"
lucky to get away with that short ball as De Kock hops back and thumps it straight to point again
"Pandey into the act again at point, predictably, de Kock cracks the short ball straight to the fielder"
"full and straight, he mistimes a straight drive, good work by Umesh on his followthrough. Not much swing for him yet"
"his hand-eye coordination is just out of the world. 140kph delivery, but he was ready to play the pull in a jiffy. Picks the length in a split second and pulls him in front of square, one bounce into the midwicket boundary. Cracking stuff!"
"imperious! Can't bowl short and get away in this format. He was in position to play the stroke, rolled his wrists to hit it behind square this time, and boy, it sailed away."
"slower one, he mistimes a slog to midwicket this time. Intent very clear, though"
dabs it down to third man
"that's the end of the de Kock show, all too brief. It was the short ball again, but the bounce did him in. He looked to pull off the front foot this time but was in no position, ended up skewing it to Yusuf Pathan who juggles it and takes it on the second attempt at mid-off."
worked away behind square to bring the Ranji Trophy season's highest run-getter on strike
"sliding into middle and leg, tucked to midwicket, Iyer looks to get off the mark but is sent back, dishes in a full-length dive to get back in even as the throw is fired wide of the stumps"
ducks under that pacy bouncer on middle
"was it sliding down leg? The umpire had no doubts about it whatsoever. This one was angled it full from wide of the crease, Iyer looks to work that across the line but is late on the shot as he is struck in front of middle and leg. I'll say it's a good decision from C Shamsuddin"
beauty first up. Nips away late to beat the outside edge
pushed to Gambhir at point. Accurate stuff this from Hastings
in the slot to drive but he hits it straight to the cover fielder again
"gets on top of the bounce and glides it down towards Umesh, who dishes in a slide to stop it"
"nicely driven, but can't pierce the off side ring"
"beaten by one that moves away late. Feet nowhere near the pitch of the ball, Nair feels for it but is late on the stroke. The bat face was slightly angled as well. Excellent first over by Hastings"
works it wide of midwicket for an easy single
"looks for some late away movement as he floats it full, but gets the radar wrong as he slips it down leg. Nair would be kicking himself for missing the faint tickle"
"picked away off the pads this time, work to do for Hastings at deep backward square, they're back for the second easily"
"short ball on middle, he gets out of the way easily, good carry through to Uthappa"
"super drive, but Pandey took the pace off the ball by throwing himself full length to his right to save three runs"
"poor stroke! Looks to force one on the up but can only manage to slice it down towards Hogg who takes a regulation catch at third man. Once again, it bounced more than he expected. Delhi in a familiar spot"
"wristy flick, VVS would have been proud of that stroke. Wow! This one's full on middle and off, he fetches the flick that soars past the diving mid-on fielder. That punch off the bottom hand was something else. Dream start for Samson"
"third one that has zipped past the outside edge. Back of length delivery on off, moves away late, another play and a miss"
"nibbles away off the seam again, Nair is late on the drive, doesn't miss the edge by much"
"what has has he done? It was a juicy half volley outside off, he leaned forward to drive but the bat face opened to send it in the air and Pandey, his good friend and Karnataka teammate, takes a simple catch at backward point. Dravid isn't happy with that stroke. Couldn't keep it down, Delhi in trouble, yet again."
"jags away from the length area on middle, Negi is nicely behind the line of the ball as he defends with soft hands"
eased to the man coming in from point
turned to midwicket. <b> Wicket-maiden to finish the Powerplay </b>
he's squared up but somehow manages to get an edge that flies past the diving slip fielder. Third man was square and the ball raced away
pats it towards midwicket and scoots across for a quick single
"mix-up, confusion, pandemonium! This one was dabbed to point but Negi wanted the run, only to turn his back to Samson, who was more than halfway down the pitch when he turned back. Pandey's throw hit Samson, and so there's no damage done"
"ball gets big on him, lobs off the glove but just wide of the slip fielder"
"he plays inside the line as the ball nips away late, somehow gets some bat on it, rolls to the off side"
angled down to Hogg at third man
driven to sweeper cover
"pokes at one that is angled away, misses. Through to Uthappa on the bounce"
good stride forward as he defends
"that's come out of nowhere. The frustration of not being able to tee off showed as he picked the bones out of that one. It was floated full, Negi gave him the charge and made clean connection. Sailed over long-off"
dabbed to Pandey at backward point
"full on off, squeezed to point again"
"sprays it onto middle and leg, whipped to deep midwicket"
"tucked towards midwicket, no one there, Umesh had to hare around to stop it, by which time they were comfortably back for the second"
"turns the bat face too early, deceived by the slower one as the ball takes the edge, lands short of the slip fielder"
"backs away to swing across the line but is made to adjust his shot at the last moment as Umesh changes his length and bangs it on length, defended to midwicket"
"excellent bouncer on middle, Negi looks to sway out of the way but then changes his mind and tries to ramp it over the keeper's head instead, misses"
"slower and fuller on leg stump, worked behind square"
"appeal for lbw, but the ball turned sharply after pitching outside leg, Negi is hit high on the pad as he looks to nurdle it round the corner"
"steps out to slog over deep midwicket, gets a thick inside edge to the man instead"
"breaks back in to hit Samson high on the thigh pad as he looks to work it past midwicket. Turn and bounce now, hmmm. Interesting"
pushed to long-off for an easy single
"quicker one on the stumps, trifle short, turned to midwicket"
"deceived in flight this time. Steps out to go over long-on, but it was a lot slower through the air, the wild swing only connected with the humid Kolkata air as Uthappa whipped the bails off in a jiffy"
"slow turn from outside off, steered to deep point"
"drifts back into middle and leg, Uthappa is late to move to his left, gets a bit of glove but there's enough pace in it to roll past the fine leg boundary. Useful runs"
"he's taken off from where he left off last week. His eyes light up as he sees the flight and boom! The cross-batted slog soars into the night sky and into the stands, 40 rows back. Or maybe the second tier"
"sweeps and misses. Big, big appeal but that struck him outside the line of the stumps"
"hint of width on offer, steered to point"
"and there's his revenge. Well-disguised googly, lands it on off, Brathwaite was late on the stroke, didn't pick it up at all and the ball had already thudded into his pad even before the bat came down. Chawla gives him a 'goodbye' send-off. The Brathwaite show failed to take off tonight. Dravid has a worried look on his face"
gets back into his crease and punches it to deep midwicket
"interesting stroke! Changes his bat grip in a jiffy and revere-sweeps Hogg over point. Gutsty stuff, difficult to execute that against the spin but he timed it superbly"
"driven straight to cover, it was tossed up over Morris' eye line"
"full toss on middle and leg, turned to deep backward square leg"
stays inside the crease and plays it with the spin to midwicket
paddles the full toss from outside off to deep square leg
"once again, Uthappa has trouble with collecting one down leg. The slider gone wrong this time as the ball rolls into the boundary"
worked towards midwicket for an easy single
"drifts back in to middle and then turns away a wee bit, Morris is half forward as he is struck on the pad, but was well outside the line, so all good there"
"driven back down the ground, good stop on his followthrough"
thumped into the deep extra cover boundary. Overpitched this time and there was a good crack of the bat as Morris came down on that. Authentic stroke. Using his reach to get to the pitch
"dream delivery for any legspinner. Tossed it up nicely on middle, gets a bit of inward drift as well, Morris is invited into playing the big stroke against the spin but is done in by the turn as the ball sneaks through the gap between bat and pad to disturb the stumps."
cuts and misses
"can't read the wrong-un, hit on the pad"
"the young 'old' man is on fire. Samson shapes to drive but fails to account for the turn, goes through with the stroke as the ball takes the inside edge, Uthappa did well to pick that one and stayed low to complete an excellent catch."
"width on offer, pushed to point"
steps out and thumps it towards long-off
"goes back to a delivery he should have played forward, beaten by the sharp turn"
"gets to the pitch of the ball and hammers it back past the bowler. It was only about 10 yards away from Suryakumar Yadav at long-off, but it was drilled down the ground"
beaten by the wrong-un. Grips the surface and rips away as he prods forward to defend
"looks to get outside the line of the stumps and paddle, tied himself into a knot"
played wide of Gambhir at midwicket
superb ball again. Just lands it on that spot from where there's enough turn to keep the bowlers interested. Beaten
played with a straight bat down to long on
"eased to short third man, but Yusuf's throw is wide and they steal a run"
gets it off the inner half of the bat as he prods forward to defend
"short but is lucky to get away with that. Mishra looks to hit it a little too hard, toe-ends it to cover"
"looks to play the switch hit this time, but was way too early into the stroke, gets an under-edge that Uthappa stops with his pad"
"fired into middle and leg, hint of turn, Mishra gets an inside edge that deflects off the pad and nearly rolls onto the stumps"
"crafty stuff this! This was superbly flighted, but the wrong-un. Mishra was lured into the drive, but was late on the stroke, got a thick edge and Gambhir made that catch at slip look ridiculously easy. Excellent captaincy in the first place to position himself there."
"Zak, who probably didn't expect to bat on his return to competitive cricket, is completely deceived by that wrong-un"
stopped by Yusuf at second slip
driven with the spin to cover
"mistimes a drive, but enough to get it wide of the bowler to long-off"
"fires a quicker one outside off, sharp turn away, play and a miss from Zaheer"
"drifts in to middle, somehow manages to get some bat on it"
"hides the bat behind the pad, watches it into Uthappa's gloves"
"looks to play across the line to that googly, misses. Umpire reckons it was sliding down"
"lands in no man's land. It was a half-pull, lobbed high in the air but there was no one at square leg"
"backs away, but Hastings bangs in a length ball to cramp Zaheer for room, defended"
"pulled, but not entirely off the middle. Does it matter? No. It was hit towards the shorter side, and the ball races away into the midwicket boundary"
"as easy as they come. Zaheer looks to make room and go over cover, but is cramped for room, he goes through with the stroke, but can only lob it towards Pandey, who runs a few steps back to take it."
"full and swinging away from outside off, Uthappa looks to drive but decides against it at the last second, watches it through to the keeper instead"
"beaten by a jaffa! Uthappa looks to play that wide of midwicket, but the ball nips away late from the length area on middle"
"length ball again, some movement in the air and off the pitch as well from outside off, left alone"
"edged, but Morris does well to stop it at second slip. Uthappa didn't go hard at it, took the bottom hand off to ensure the edge didn't carry"
"pushed to the cover fielder, again delivers it a touch ahead of the good length area on off. Excellent bowling from NCN"
"finishes off poorly, a buffet ball really. Half-volley on the pads, had 'hit me' all over it. Uthappa times it sweetly past midwicket"
"angles it down leg, Gambhir shuffles across in anticipation of a short ball"
"pure wrist work that. Excellent timing. Zaheer angles it into middle and leg, and Gambhir times that superbly between square leg and midwicket"
"and again, sprays it into the pads, flicked neatly past midwicket, better running would have given them three perhaps"
"floats it full outside off, watched through to the keeper. There was an open invitation to drive though"
"he will be picked away all day, all night if he feeds him with deliveries on the pads. Just one man behind square, so he can't really afford to drift. Gambhir accepts the invitation as he wrists it superbly"
"too full on the pads again, another neat flick but this time there's a man at deep midwicket to prevent the four"
"crunching cover drive. Easy pickings again. Too full, not much swing as Uthappa latched onto that scoring opportunity by bisecting cover and point"
"hit high on the pad as he looks to work it away, this one had much more pace and bounce from the good length area on middle and leg"
"leans forward to drive but was too early into the stroke, it was a slower delivery and a touch fuller, squeezed off the inner half of the bat to the leg side"
"hops back and nudges it to square leg, Gambhir was hustled for pace"
"driven on the up, but straight to mid-off"
"looks to force that behind point, gets a thick edge that races away into the third man boundary. Second slip was taken off just before the start of the over and it went through that region. Not much is working for Delhi at the moment"
"leans into the drive and manages to time it beautifully along the carpet. Right in the slot, and Uthappa gleefully accepts the challenge by bringing down his big broad blade into a fine arc, races away on this fast outfield"
"sensible stuff, drops it with soft hands into the off side and gets across for a quick single"
"whipped, but a tumbling stop by Zaheer at midwicket"
"gets it to straighten a wee bit after landing it on middle, Uthappa is nicely behind the line as he punches it back to the bowler"
"onto the pads and he's whipped that superbly. Plonked the front foot across and let his wrists take over. Deliberately played it in the air, there was no one at midwicket."
pushes the length ball on off to mid-off
"rip roaring bouncer, but got the direction wrong. It had Uthappa awkwardly fending that as he was angled towards his ribs, he somehow managed to get out of the way"
"bunted towards point, mere eye contact and off they went"
"floats it full on middle, driven back with a straight bat, Zaheer stops it with his foot on his follow-through"
shuffles across and works it to deep square leg. Would have been a dead duck had he missed that
"nicely behind the line of that short ball, confidently defended back towards the bowler"
"pats it towards short cover, looks for the single, but is sent back"
"turned towards midwicket, Brathwaite looks to deflect the ball towards the stumps at the non-striker's end with those big boots of his, goes wide"
"straight as a dye. This wasn't all that bad a delivery, but Uthappa's nice high elbows as ball met bat generated the power and timing as it beat Zaheer's outstretched foot. Bisected mid-off and mid-on"
"driven, straight to point"
"goes for a big booming drive, doesn't time it well but steals a run"
defended back to the bowler
"that's a straight drive Tendulkar would have gone 'wow.' Comes down on it as straight as he can possibly get, races away past the bowler. Strong forearms"
"slower one this time, authoritative drive but straight to mid-off"
"banged in short on middle from wide of the crease, Uthappa is upto the mark as he avoids that with ease"
"length ball on off, steered to point"
worked towards the vacant midwicket region
tucked towards deep square leg
gets half-forward and eases it towards point
"beaten by the late movement. Not far from the edge, Gambhir tried to force that on the up through cover"
"glides it to gully, where Nair stops it well"
"gets to the pitch and strokes it back to Mishy, who stops it on his follow-through. Was firmly struck"
eased with the spin to long-off
"spins back into middle and leg, nudged wide of square leg"
"nicely tossed up, gets some purchase off the pitch, Uthappa smothers the spin"
"the skidder on middle this time, Uthappa punches it towards wide long-on, was in total control"
"the wrong-un gone wrong, Zaheer dives over the ball at point, the cut finds deep point"
"no timing or power whatsoever behind that forceful drive, back to the bowler"
"pulls and misses. Once again beaten for pace. Got big on the keeper too, de Kock got some glove on it to take the pace off the ball"
crunched off the backfoot to sweeper cover
"beamer this time, perhaps slipped out. Effects of dew? He immediately apologises as Uthappa is hit on the glove. <b> Free-hit coming up </b>"
"looks to slog that across the line, was too early into the stroke"
"whipped, uppish but safe, down to deep square"
"poor ball, and punished. Half volley on the pads and Gambhir wrists that behind square to beat the boundary rider, who had no more than a few yard to get to the ball"
"walks across to sweep, the keeper was blinded by that perhaps, it was the wrong-un alright, and once Uthappa missed it, it was always going to beat the keeper to the boundary."
"looks to sweep, then tries to dab it gently, but the ball breaks back in to hit him high on the right thigh"
"sweeps across the line, gets an inside edge onto the pad, rolls to square leg. Mishra went up in an appeal"
worked with the spin to deep midwicket. Sensible
"clean strike, but he's picked out Morris at long off. Did most things right, but it was almost as if he forgot there was a fielder there. Didn't get the elevation. He walks back for yet another attractive knock"
lunges forward and smothers the spin
gets forward and plays it back to the bowler
"lovely ball. Short on middle, but it was angling away, Gambhir was caught hobbling back without any conviction. Feeling for that ball, didn't miss the edge by much"
"worked wide of square leg, there was a man there but it was a gamble really"
"walks across the stumps and picks it behind square on the leg side. Not entirely convincing but the ball flew off the bat. Shreyas Iyer at fine leg did all the hard work in getting to the ball, but palmed it over as he tried to push it back into the field of play"
"good work at deep fine leg this time. There was a leg gully in place for the short ball, but Pandey's fierce pull had him trying to evade"
slices it towards point
"yorker-length delivery on the pads, worked towards deep midwicket"
"he climbs onto the short ball. Looks like he was expecting it. Got into position early, rolled his wrists to keep it down and pulled it in front of square"
whipped to deep midwicket
"looks to swat that over midwicket, but is cramped for room, gets some bat on it and they steal a run"
"slower one on off stump, defended towards short cover"
"length ball angled into the body from round the stumps, tapped towards point"
uppish but lands short of short midwicket. He isn't looking all that comfortable with the short ball around his ribs.
walks across the stumps and punches one to mid-on
"looks to back away and slap that over point, beaten for pace"
"dangerous. Walks across the stumps, Morris sees that and floats it dead straight on middle, he somehow gets some bat on it, hits it to short fine leg"
"looks to help it over short fine, gets some glove on it, just eludes the leaping fielder at 45"
tickled down to third man
"looks to play a cross-court forehand over mid-on, gets a bottom edge to the keeper"
gets a thick edge that flies into the third man boundary. Didn't have the width he was looking for but runs nonetheless
"way too early into the pull, Coulter-Nile rolled his fingers over the ball, lucky to get away with that"
"too short and angling down leg, easy call for the umpire"
drops it into the off side for a quick single
"what-a-shot. That was hammered into the cover boundary before I could move my fingers. Too full, he lent into the drive, picked the bones out of that one. No chance for sweeper cover"
muscles the pull into the midwicket fence. Too short and he climbed onto that. Making batting look really easy
"banged in short, but way over Gambhir's head, de Kock does well to leap like a goalkeeper to stop that"
eased behind the wicket for a quick single to complete what has been a cakewalk
