"slower ball, and he makes room to drive through covers. The ball keeps a bit low, and hits the base of off stump! Goes off the inside edge, and that's what keeps it as low as it does on impact. Lahore have the breakthrough they were looking for, and the decision to bowl Wiese pays off immediately"

"goes to drive over mid-wicket, but gets the outside edge, that carries it past Dunk through the slip cordon. Too fine for third man to cut off!"
"yorker, and he blocks this towards point for a quick single"
"<strong>oh, super shot!</strong> It's a yorker, and he picks the length early, gets low down on his haunches and just paddles this down to fine leg, with the man inside the circle. Fifty for Khushdil!"
"slower ball, fuller, and he looks to blast this down the wicket. Misses out, and Shaheen takes a tumble in his follow-through. A lot happened there, but crucially no runs for Multan"
"yorker length, and he is able to get this down towards long-on"
"<strong>innovation from Rohail Nazir this time!</strong> He's opened his stance up, and then effectively reverse paddled this ball with his legs wide apart, and got it to third man for four. A yorker nailed, but put away"
"the fast bowler's response is emphatic! Yorker, a bit fuller than what the previous ball was. Nazir looks to move away and get it towards cover, but is beaten by the pace and accuracy. Crashes into the base of off and middle. A handy little knock comes to an end"

"yorker, and he drives this down to long-on. Brings back Khushdil for the last legal delivery"
