"<strong>Stirling with a stunner at backward point! </strong> On the 10th anniversary of KOB's epic knock against England, another Irishman creating fresh memories today by reaching up high to his right to intercept a loose drive with a spectacular grab. Similar length to the previous ball to encourage a drive on about sixth stump, not much footwork and can't get to the pitch to keep this down, it flies off the edge and Stirling reads it well moving to his right and reaches high above his head on his tippy toes to claim it."
"full on the stumps, flicks this through square leg and it's slapped back just short of the rope after a long chase."

"length ball on leg stump, Faf goes to ramp it over the keeper, huge noise as it passes him and the keeper appeals for caught behind denied. <strong>They call for the review. Almost sounded too fleshy to be bat or glove though. Maybe thigh?</strong> Replays show it came off the top of the pad flap. So no catch. Ball-tracking shows the ball was clearing leg stump as well so LBW is not out as well. Review lost."

"good length ball on off, Faf went way too far across and misses a flick to the leg side, huge appeal from Hasan is upheld after a long ponder by the umpire. <strong>It looked pretty out live, hitting him in line with off. But Faf appeals anyway. </strong> The only doubt appeared to be whether or not he was hit in line with the stumps or contact was made outside off. Sure enough he's hit in line with middle more than off stump and a third red lights up with the projection KO'ing leg stump. <b>Gladiators lose a review. </b>"

"<strong>short ball brings a wicket! </strong>Wasn't even a proper bouncer. Really sat up wide outside off, Azam tried to slap it over the ring but fails miserably as the ball just flutters up gently off his bat. After being on the front foot all innings, first time he was tested on the back foot he can't handle it and a simple catch is taken on the ring at extra cover."
