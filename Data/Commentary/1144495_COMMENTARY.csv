"high in the air, very, very high. Colin de Grandhomme and Guptill were looking at each other, neither went full throttle and the <strong>catch goes down.</strong> The wind was taking the ball away from them, three players converging, in the end De Grandhomme went one handed as an afterthought and fluffed it"

slash and a miss. This was just flirting with the wide line

"went for a big swing down the ground, beaten by the slower ball. Zazai has decided he'll either go hell or high water this afternoon"
"slapped! This races to the cover boundary like a tracer bullet as Ravi Shastri'd famously say. Too short, enough width and he gave it a proper whack"

"fullish length on middle, clipped through to deep midwicket."
"<b>finally gets him after surviving two lives on 16 & 18!</b> Zazai loves clearing the front leg to go over the on-side and Neesham wisely teases him dragging this line wider outside off stump, the front leg still flies out and the arms try to flay this over cover. The ball flies in the air toward the point sweeper Munro, who charges in 12 yards and takes this at chest height while crouching down. Zazai taps his helmet with the bat. Soaring like an eagle at the start, his wings have been clipped by Neesham."
"back of a length ball, Rahmat doesn't get the feet moving as this seams away a touch to beat the prod."
"<b>gobbled up down the leg side!</b> Ferguson banged it in on the hips, Noor Ali tried to do a penguin shuffle across to feather this behind square but only manages a slight tickle and Latham with the grace of a pelican takes it with ease at neck height. Kiwis on top now."

"nice and full on the stumps, he gets well forward and blocks"
"punched into the gap between cover and point. Rain or no rain, when your timing is pristine like that, you will get full value for your shots. Terrific placement, got into great position. Right on top of the bounce"

Henry went short on off stump to Alikhil, who fended at it with an angled bat leaping off his toes. It clipped the edge and flew high to Taylor at slip, he hopped in the air and reached high over his head with his right hand but could only manage to parry it away to third man.

"<strong>sucker ball claims Alikhil at backward point!</strong> Attempted wide yorker outside off just pitches before Alikhil drives hard, but Alikhil's back knee dips instead of getting on top of the ball to be able to drive this into the ground. Instead he slices under it and it flutters like a peaceful dove toward Guptill at backward point, taken on his haunches at chest height with fingers pointed to the sky."

"<b>brutal!</b> Ferguson with a skiddy ball short of a length that has a touch of extra bounce at 138 kph/86 mph. Rashid came a step forward to defend but it climbs into his helmet and ricochets down onto the stumps. Kane Williamson, his captain at Sunrisers, comes over to put his arm around Rashid and check on him as the champion leggie is shaken up. Physio is out on field to escort him off as his eyes start bulging."

"<strong>top edge sails almost for six!</strong> Ferguson angled this away from the stumps on a fullish length trying to create that skied chance from around the stumps. It happens as Aftab backs away from leg to slog once more but it sails straight over the keeper, one bounce over the rope."
"cat and mouse backing away game here continues. Aftab backs away, Ferguson pitches this outside leg, swing and a miss."
"Aftab's adventurous stay ends. Identical shot to two balls earlier backing away to a short ball. That angle was going to keep producing top edges and sure enough this one is skied over the wicketkeeper towards third man. Latham tracks back to the edge of the ring calling off third man running in from the rope and takes a very sharp catch over the shoulder, 7.5/10 on degree of difficulty particularly with the ball tailing away. <b>He's got five takes in the innings, one away from tying the ODI record.</b>"

"yorker-length outside off, squeezed to backward point"
"lifter outside off, excellent leave"

"dream start! This is a skiddy short of length ball that comes back in sharply to surprise Guptill who hops back to defend, but only manages an inside edge onto the thigh pad as it lobs to point. Aftab Alam, you beauty."
