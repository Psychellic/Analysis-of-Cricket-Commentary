"short of a length, nudged behind square"
"brilliantly taken by Kedar Jadhav. Bhuvi bangs this in, gives next to no room. The batsman pulls compulsively but doesn't get room or manage to get on top of it, off the top-edge to deep backward square leg where Kedar dives forward to snaffle it low, inches from the ground"

works this away with the angle behind square
"full on middlee and leg, pushed straight back"
"short of good length on off, gets on top and blocks to cover"

"gets down to sweep from outside off through square leg, DK runs across from deep midwicket but <b>dives too early</b>"
"that's poor.. shoddy batting from Shakib. Goes for a repeat of the previous delivery but this one's not full enough. A length ball outside off, swept straight into the hands of square leg for a tame end"
"full and outside off, he drives past mid-off"
jams his bat down on a very full delivery on off stump to pick up a single at long-off
"loops it up temptingly outside off, but Mushfiqur keeps his head and defends"
"a little too generous with the flight this time and Mushfiqur deals with a full toss capably, driving it to long-on"
lures the drive away from the body with the line of this googly (?) well outside off. Mithun pokes to cover
"pushes into the leg side, with the turn"
shifts back seeing the length just a touch short and dabs to short third man
"dangerous to sweep right off the stumps, but Mushfiqur does it well, head over the ball, wrists rolling on it to keep it down to long leg"
eases it through the covers
looks to slice what is effectively a wide yorker but ends up missing it
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"flat, quick and wide - perfect ingredients for a smoking hot cut shot - but Mushfiqur finds point"
"shifts back to nudge the length ball on leg stump through midwicket. Can't beat the field, and Jadeja, rushing across to field the ball, may have dome some damage to Mushfiqur's leg"
rocks back to push through the covers
<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> with Mushfiqur playing a half-hearted sweep. It's a smidge too full for the shot - he doesn't even get down on bended knee for it. Ball might not have hit leg stump. Umpire Brathwaite makes the call and Dhoni doesn't challenge it
pushes through the covers
picks the googly as he keeps to his crease and defends it smoothly
leans into a drive and finds long-off
"googly again, Mithun plays for the legbreak, looking for a run through long-on. Instead, he gets one off the outside edge to long-off"
"pulls his length back and Mushfiqur, quite comfortably, flicks to square leg"
"brings him forward as he angles a good length ball into the pads, looking for lbw. Mithun's bat intervenes just in time"
"pushes it through on middle, Mithun stays back and nudges it to the leg side"
invites the big shot with loads and loads of flight but Mithun's drive doesn't work with Jadeja getting the ball to dip sharply
dabs towards point
<b>reverse sweep</b>! And it's excellently done too. The pressure was building on Mithun. He couldn't beat the infield in front of square. Then he remembered that Jadeja bowls very quickly and that third man is up
"defends a very quick delivery on off stump, and even as Jadeja goes to his left to field it, he belts out a <b>big lbw appeal</b>, hoping it hit pad first. And he's right. Replays show it was a good shout and <b>HawkEye confirms it would have been out had India reviewed</B>!"
"gets it to drift outside off, Mushfiqur reaches the pitch and smothers the turn"
brings out the sweep again - he seems to go for the shot the moment Kuldeep puts some flight on it - and gets a single to deep square leg
"good length, outside off, going on with the angle from round the wicket. Mushfiqur tries a late cut and misses"
turns it around to square leg
"that's a googly, Mushfiqur plays it from the crease, using his wrists to keep the ball down. Single through square leg"
lunges forward to drive to mid-off. <b>That's drinks</b>
gets forward to block on off stump
<b>turn</b> as Mushfiqur presses forward down the line to play the angle and then has to push his bat away from his body to make contact with the ball
"picks the short ball very very quickly, rocking back to cut to point's right. Pandey's there, keeping it to a single"
"huge appeal for lbw and umpire Raza gives it. <b>Mithun reviews immediately though</b>. This is the typical Jadeja delivery - attacking middle stump, and quickly at that. Replays - the slow motion kind and they're highly necessary to make this decision - suggest the ball hits pad first and then goes on to bat. Mithun has a long stride forward but it won't do him any good. Jadeja skids these balls through and very rarely does height matter in his lbw appeals."
<b>a little turn again</b> and Jadeja has his hands in his head as he watches Mahmudullah not moving his feet and playing away from his body
"full on middle and off, he gets the feet working better now and looks much better in defence"
gets the legbreak to drift into Mushfiqur - and sharply - to beat the inside edge and hit the pad
"<B>hits all across the line and Dhoni believes he's got Mushfiqur stumped</b>. The batsman goes for the sweep, playing against the turn, but this time he's left lunging for the ball, and in the process has pulled his back leg out of the crease. The third umpire is brought into play and he's got a wicked decision to make. Mushfiqur does take the effort to push his back heel into safety, but replays aren't conclusive whether it is on the line or behind it when Dhoni breaks the stumps. This will be hard and Marais Erasmus has gone by the book - <b>benefit of the doubt to the batsman</b>"
"loops it into middle and leg, Mushfiqur makes a little room and drives to long-off"
<B>misreads the googly</b> as he looks for the cover drive. But this ball is dangled that far outside off with the express purpose of producing that shot - that mistake. Inside edge past leg stump
eases himself legside of the legbreak on leg stump and drives to short cover
"looks to flick a full delivery on leg stump through midwicket, but ends up with a leading edge to cover"
"good length ball outside off, Mushfiqur defends well"
"continues playing the sweep and this time he nails it, reaching out in front of his body to drag a ball just outside off away to deep midwicket"
"the left-armer responds with a quicker delivery on off stump, Mushfiqur expects it, ready with a block to cover. He wants a single too but Mahmudullah isn't as keen"
<b>beats him</b> as Mushfiqur plays a late cut to a ball that isn't quite as short
taps into the covers
"<b>reverse sweeps it straight to short third man</b>. Soft dismissal, and it's resulted out of Jadeja's accuracy and India's field placements. There's very few runs available in front of the wicket. The left-arm spinner keeps attacking the stumps at high pace. Mushfiqur tries to find an unorthodox solution and pays for his lack of patience"
"tosses it up on leg stump, Mahmudullah blocks"
"<b>beats him</b> with a wicket legbreak - angled into off stump, pulling Mahmudullah forward and ripping past his outside edge"
gets to the pitch of the ball on middle and blocks
stays legside of the ball to open up the cover area - single with a smooth drive
gets squared up as he blocks a legbreak that drifts into leg stump and then spins off the pitch
"<b>googly</b> that Mosaddek doesn't pick, pressing forward to block and getting an inside edge to square leg"
goes back to push the good length ball on off stump to cover
"good length on middle, Mahmudullah keeps it out"
"slides it into leg stump, Mahmudullah puts his front leg aside to defend"
a little bit of turn as he shirts his radar to off stump. Mahmudullah guides it to point

makes him reach out in front of his body and secures a bit of an edge to short cover
closes the face to one that pitches outside leg and gets a <b>leading edge into the off side</b>
"length ball that comes on dead straight around middle, inside-edged onto the back pad"
now he gets one to spin away and Mahmudullah keeps it out
undoes all the good work earlier in the over with a long hop that's dispatched with a pull through midwicket
advances down the ground and drills it out the sweeper at cover
cracking delivery to end the over. Pitches and spits and turns as the batsman has no clue on the forward press. <b>Beaten</b>

"length ball, slid into middle and leg, tucked away to midwicket for a quick one"
"quick length ball, angled into off, pushed out to cover"

"pitched up on leg, defended off the outside of the bat into the off side"

"flighted on middle, driven to long-off"
"fullish length, spins down leg, gets it away through square leg"
"flighted outside off, driven to cover"
<b>Dhoni whips the bails off</b> as Mosaddek is deceived by this wrong'un. Lovely bowling. Tosses it up and draws him forward. Really has to reach out but the backfoot never left the ground
shifts back and keeps out a wrong'un
"full, comes on with the angle outside off, eased down to long-off"
"stays back to defend a back of a length delivery, chops it into the ground close to the feet"
reaches out to a short one and guides it away to third man

"fullish, angled into off, pushed through the covers"
"good length on off, plays late to point"

"full, clipped with the angle between midwicket and mid-on. They push back for the second and Kedar's throw misses the stumps. Direct hit may have made things more interesting"
punched off the backfoot to point
steps away from his crease and ends up dragging the googly from outside off to long-on
"loops it up on off stump, defends"
tosses it up on off stump - it's the legbreak - Mahmudullah pushes it to cover
"unleashes a reverse sweep - it looks premeditated, the result of the pressure he's under - and he's lucky that this ball is quick and flat from Kuldeep. It gives him all the pace he needs to find the third man boundary"
"<b>that's lovely</b>! It's another flatter delivery from the wristpsinner and Mahmudllah rocks back, and away from the line, and slams the ball through the cover field"
"<b>rips in from off stump to strikes his pads</b> but there's precious little excitement from the keeper or the bowler. Spinning too much, perhaps"
presses forward and drives to cover
"spears it into middle and leg, Mosaddek pushes it back at the bowler"
opens the face against a flighted ball on middle but can't beat cover
slower through the air this time and Mosaddek ventures forward to blunt it
"slides it into the pads and hits his target. Jadeja belts out an lbw appeal, but there's an inside edge playing spoilsport"
pokes it into the covers for a quick single. Only one run off the Jadeja over
steps down the pitch but finds the ball getting big on him. Mistimed push to cover
<b>beats him</b> as he attempts a late cut. A little inward movement off the pitch for Bhuvi
opens the face to send a back of a length ball to deep third man
dabs a shortish delivery outside off to point
"<b>gives him out lbw</b>, Mahmudullah wants to review, but Bangladesh have already used theirs up and so their last specialist batsman has to go even though <b>he's got a big inside edge onto pad</b>. All this trouble is caused by a skidder from Bhuvi, pitching on off stump and zipping through to hit Mahmudullah on the back thigh. Umpire Brathwaite believes it's plumb and raises the finger immediately"
"full and outside off, Mashrafe blocks"
"plants it full on leg stump, defends"
"<b>he walks after being caught behind</b>! Goes for a wild sweep, but finds himself reaching out for the ball. Jadeja - clever, unstoppable Jadeja - slows it all the way down, dangles it in front of the batsman who goes for a rank slog sweep and toe-ends it through to the keeper. Good work from Dhoni, great change of pace from Jaddu. He's one shy of a five-for"
goes back to block a full length ball on leg stump
"good length on off stump, defends to point"
"loopy delivery on off stump, he digs it out well"
drives it past the left of silly point for a single
"good length on off stump, defends to point"
<b>falls short of short midwicket</b> with Karthik diving forward. Mehidy gets away with a flick
keeper comes up to the stumps as Bhuvi keeps it wicket to wicket. Mehidy works it to mid-on
"drives on the up and to the left of cover. Looks good at the crease, does Mehidy"
"goes short against Mashrafe, who ignores it outside off. Square leg umpire Raza calls it the first bouncer of the over"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"handsome shot, over square leg! Mehidy looks like a boss when the ball is on his pads. He whips the No.1-ranked ODI bowler with supreme ease for straying in line just a tiny bit"
stands up tall against a rising delivery outside off and crunches it to cover point.
fine shot! He gets up off his toes to deal with a short ball outside off and has the presence of mind to keep his late cut down with third man on the boundary. Sensible batting... and Bangladesh have had to wait until their No. 9 for it
"looks for the yorker on leg stump, doesn't quite get it there. Mashrafe flicks it to deep square leg"
"bouncer outside off, Mehidy lets it go and offers a wry smile when it's called one for the over."
lifts it over the lone slip fielder and finds a second boundary in the over. Why is he hiding in the Bangladesh tail? Clearly shows he's capable against the short ball as he ramps it over Dhawan
"good length legbreak on off stump, Mashrafe defends, reading the turn off the pitch"
toe-ends his cut shot having made room against a ball pitching on leg stump and being surprised by it when it turns the wrong way
"tosses up the legbreak outside off, Mehidy strides forward to smother the turn"
sweeps a well flighted delivery on middle away to deep square leg - his footwork is so good that he gets to the ball on the full

"uses the depth of his crease and the quickness of his hands to blunt a flatter, but full-length, legbreak"
"picks the short ball ever so early, rocks back and pulls powerfully to deep square leg. Mehidy looks a proper allrounder"
<b>the googly</B> rushes past the forward defensive from Mashrafe
steps away from the legbreak on off stump and chops it towards cover
googly to finish the over and Mashrafe doesn't pick it again. Leading edge to cover
"shapes for a massive sweep shot and, in the time he takes the decide whether he wants to play the shot, he's nearly bowled! Just about jams the angled blade down to keep his sticks standing"
"goes for the slog sweep this time and he's comfortably beaten - Chahal danging the ball wide as he often does to attacking right-handers, forcing them to hit against the turn"
"flighted delivery on middle, clips it to midwicket"
the bowler dares him to go big again - loads of flight and some room outside off - and this time Mehidy goes full-blooded and gets six over midwicket. Massive strike
"quicker delivery angled into the pads, Mehidy works it to midwicket"
nudges it off his pads through square leg

"shortish, makes room and finds short third man after opening the face"
short and slapped hard to sweeper cover
"angles in a length ball, has everything Mashrafe needed: a helpful angle, in his swinging arc, and shovelled over long-on"
"this one's shorter and he backs away before slapping it straight over, lands just after crossing the boundary"
"<b>straight to short fine leg</b>. Bumrah was right there, waiting for that, and Mashrafe has picked him out. Hardly a delivery that deserved a wicket. Full toss - a yorker gone wrong - around off, Mash shuffles and tries to paddle it away, goes no further than Bumrah's reverse-cupped hands"
walks across and blocks to point
"backs away, leaving his stumps dangerously exposed, manages to get bat on ball"
drills a full toss straight back
throws his hands at a wide fuller ball and carves it over the in-field through point
"snapped up by Dhawan at deep midwicket. Doesn't get hold of his pull, doesn't quite come onto the bat. Besides, he has to fetch it from outside off. Doesn't get the distance. Dhawan runs in and snaffles it low and slaps his thighs"
"full, angled across, pushed to cover"
backs away and swings. Angle's too sharp across him and he gets beaten
"yorker, pushed across outside off, dug out towards mid-off"
"short of length on off, punched to extra cover and is sent back"
"full, pushed down to long-on"
swings for a pull and makes no contact
"<b>dropped</b>. Jadeja nearly got there, though. Leading edge as he completes the swing on the pull early. Jadeja sprints from short third man, bends forward and gets a hand to it but the ball pops out. Very tough chance"

"fullish length, backs away and slaps to extra cover"
"short ball, tucked up for room, scampers away and awkwardly tilts away as he tries to slap it. Miscues it to cover where Dhawan takes it easily"
gets up tall to drill a back of a length delivery into the covers
"a hint of swing for Mashrafe as he hits a good length outside off, but it's nothing to trouble the batsman as Rohit eases it to cover point"
"nice and full again and Rohit, as he usually is, stays cautious early in his innings"
"drives on the up and the ball clatters into the cover boundary. Outrageous batting, comes out of a solid front foot push and quick decision to exploit the width on offer"
"he's a little more circumspect when there isn't so much room outside off, defending the good length ball"
strong in defence now
waits on the offbreak to come to him and then slices it in front of point
"short again but Dhawan isn't able to take advantage, his forceful push off the back foot finding cover"
slows it down and tosses it up outside off and that change in length makes Dhawan suspicious. Checks his shot as he drives to point
rocks back against the short ball and flicks it to deep square leg
"he's reaching in front of his body to make contact with a beautiful offbreak, dangled outside off. And try as he might, he can't get to the pitch, which is why it goes uppishly over to long-on"
"sliding into the pads of the left-hander, who easily works him away to deep square leg"
runs in from round the wicket and cramps him up with a good length ball on off stump. Dhawan keeps it out
"firm front foot defence from Dhawan, the ball pinging off the middle to cover"
"carves it over point! Far too much room given to a man who absolutely loves it there. Lunges forward and lashes it away, no intention of keeping it down"
"again! This time along the ground and through extra cover! Mashrafe doesn't quite adjust his line well enough and has to go back to his mark grumbling. Dhawan, meanwhile, simply admires the shot, his free-flowing swing of the bat makes it end up behind his back"
works it off his toes to midwicket
"slower ball from the Bangladesh captain, Dhawan drills it to cover"
"flighted delivery around the off stump, Rohit steers it to point"
clips it off his pads to short fine leg
"waits on the flatter delivery, clips it to the right of midwicket and sets off"
misfield at cover - Dhawan does hit them hard and he leaned into this drive with great conviction
width again and Dhawan lays into it with a slap to long-off
"neat little deflection to deep midwicket, Rohit playing close to the body, and judging length ever so perfectly"
126 kph - might well be the cutter to start off. Rohit holds his shape (just about well enough) and blocks to point
"that's at his top pace, and back of a length. Rohit has an easier time guiding it past gully's right and away to third man"
lets the short ball come to him and calmly turns it around to square leg
"superb hit! He takes on the bouncer, swivelling on his back foot and dismissing it over the square leg boundary. Doesn't rise high enough to cause any concern to Dhawan and he makes the bowler pay"
nudges the back of a length ball from off stump to square leg
there's perhaps the first mis-hit of the innings - Dhawan going for an ambitious pull shot when the length isn't quite so short. Gets beaten on the bottom edge
tosses it up and gets such lovely drift away from the bat. Rohit covers it with his big stride forward
"solid block from the India captain, even though Mehidy tries to beat him with a quicker delivery on off stump"
pushes back seeing the length not quite full and tickles it to short fine leg
goes straight on as Rohit presses forward to defend outside off. Good variations from Mehidy
"now he goes wide of the crease for a tossed up offbreak, Rohit drives smoothly through extra cover"
slipping down leg and Dhawan pops it to deep midwicket
"he's careful against the cutter, keeping his bat close to the body and blocking the shortish delivery to point"
punches a fuller delivery on the up to cover
leans forward to present the full face of the bat to a pitched up delivery outside off
"cutter on leg stump, tempting the batsman to close the face, but the ball is too new to grip into this dry pitch and cause problems. Rohit is more than able to work it off his pads to square leg"
"full on off stump, he drives to short cover"
drums it down the ground! That bottom hand power shines through as Rohit all but extends his front-foot defence and yet the ball scurries away over Mustafizur's head
<b>turn</b> for Mehidy as he pushes through a fuller delivery on middle stump and gets it to straighten off the angle from round the wicket
"full on middle, he defends carefully"
the ball drifts into his pads and Dhawan is able to put it away to long-on
lets the length ball turn from outside off and plays with it to square leg
a little bit of an inside edge as Mehidy gets the ball to sneak in through the air with Rohit defending outside the line
"pushes, gently, to mid-on to pinch a single"
"hits him on the pads and goes up in appeal, but this ball - while full - would have gone down leg. Dhawan would actually be miffed he couldn't get runs off it"

Replays indicate a noise as ball passes bat - and it's a beauty too, hitting the deck, cutting in off the seam. Rayudu plays with an angled bat, away from his body and in all likelihood he's nicked it through to the keeper. Yep, confirmation arrives via a spike on Snicko and he's out"
