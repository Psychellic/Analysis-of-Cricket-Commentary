"full and straight to start, no room, no swing, no seam. Rahul defends to mid-on"
"Gambhir with the dive! A fullish delivery slightly wide outside off is pushed away towards cover point. Gambhir dives to his right and stops the ball from going through, but Kings XI are off"
"some swing there! Back of a length on middle and leg, the ball moving back in. Pings off the thigh pad down to fine leg"
"nicely bowled again. Full and moving back in, pushed to mid-on with the angle. Calls for, and makes the single, easily."
"into the gap at cover for two! Full outside off, Finch pushes a drive through cover for a couple. Gambhir again races after it. Not great timing."
"well bowled. Back of a length, moves back in after pitching. Finch, like you do in backyard cricket, intentionally avoids the ball by arching his body. But the ball goes over leg stump."
"hurried for pace? <b>142 kph</b>, back of a length outside off. Rahul wants to pull but is nowhere near the shot. The ball splices to mid-on, doesn't carry"
"that's well played. Back of a length outside off, chopped away down to third man for a run."
"another one that hurries the batsman! This is a batsman brought up in Victoria. A 148.7kph short delivery outside off, Finch this time, looks for the pull through midwicket, but he is too late on the shot. Takes the splice of the bat and lobs to cover. Clearly, harried for pace and Avesh strikes. Some pace and bounce in this surface."
"full, on the pads, nudged away to deep backward square leg for a single."
"more pace, more bounce, skiddy. 143 kph, back of a length outside off, Rahul misses an open-faced dab"
"no one there at fine leg. The first boundary of the night. Full around middle and leg, there may have been some seam movement back in. A thick inside edge flies down to the fine leg fence. The fielder was more towards square leg, flies away."
"flayed away for four through point. Full and wide, the ball is too wide, allows Agarwal to throw his hands at that, sliced away."
"oh yes, that's a much better shot. Good length outside off, Agarwal knows there's pace, there's width and there's an opportunity. All he does is open the bat face and guide the ball to the left of backward point"
"full and swinging in, pushed to mid-off with the full face for a run"
"a very wide slower offcutter is bunted over cover point. Would have been wide had Rahul let that go, but he goes after it and toe-ends the ball over the infield."
"139 kph, a low full toss on leg, worked down to fine leg for a run."
"134 kph, back of a length outside off, Boult's angle brings that back to off. Chopped to the keeper, cramped for room"
"flies for six! A short delivery down leg, plenty of pace on that, but all Rahul needs to do is use that pace. He gets inside the line and helps the errant delivery over fine leg for six. A flat six."
"a slower delivery this time, but still a touch short. Rahul nails his pull to deep square leg, on the bounce."
"gives himself some room and crashes a punchy drive through cover. Not a bad delivery, good length on middle and leg, smashed on the up"
"back of a length outside off, guided away to deep point"
"a good length delivery on middle and leg, punched back towards mid-off"
"yikes, Rahul will be unhappy with the execution. A slower delivery, back of a length and wide outside off. Rahul tries to ramp the ball over short third man, but cannot connect."
"full, on middle and leg, worked away to midwicket"
"mis-timed but still four. A slower delivery around off, Rahul mis-times an attempted lofted drive, the ball skews off the inside half, plonks over mid-on and races away."
"did he misjudge that? He did, but he still took the catch at short fine leg. <strong>Plunkett has his maiden IPL wicket</strong>. An offcutter around off, Rahul tries to scoop the ball over short fine leg, but the ball hits the top third of the bat, more towards the splice. The ball carries low to Avesh at short fine leg, he dives in front and takes a good, low catch."
"right in between the gap at third slip and gully in Test cricket. But no one there in T20s. Full and wide outside off, Nair drives, gets a thick outside edge which flies to Mishra at third man. He fumbles, but no damage done."
"a slower cutter again outside off, carved away to backward point."
"full and wide outside off, driven away towards cover with the full face."
lovely shot. A tad overpitched from Avesh with some width. Nair strides forward and caresses a drive through cover with immaculate timing.
"full again, slightly closer to off stump though. Driven to short cover."
"back of a length outside off, chopped away towards backward point. A good single"
"slightly shorter and wide, but the pace was taken off. Chopped down to backward point,"
"shorter and wide outside off, a flat-batted swat through cover for two. <strong>Kings XI's 50 is up</strong>."
"back of a length outside off, badly timed towards mid-on. A 51-run Powerplay."
"a slower ball on middle and leg, nudged away to deep square leg for a run."
"another cutter, slightly shorter around off, pushed back to the bowler"
"back of a length around off, pushed away towards long-on for a run"
"short and wide outside off, slashed away to the sweeper cover. Too much width there."
"just tapped into the gap between short third man and backward point. It's dug in short, and a tad wide outside off. Nair just bunts that chopped cut into the gap, to third man's right."
"a slower ball on middle, clipped to deep midwicket for one. Decent over from Christian"
"good length on off, the ball stays down a touch, worked to midwicket"
"a shorter, slower delivery on middle. Nair helps that along towards fine leg. Avesh runs to his right and keeps the batsmen down to one, fine effort."
"gone through! 146 kph, Agarwal beaten for pace. A good length delivery, Agarwal anticipates another cutter, but it's quick. He tries a short-arm jab, but the ball isn't even short enough to play that stroke. He is far too late on the shot, the ball clips the thigh pad and then uproots off stump! A timely strike for Daredevils."
"full around off, driven to mid-on for a single. Full face of the bat."
"good length, around off, pushed back to the bowler. Very tidy bowling."
"135 kph, shorter and wider outside off, chopped away to cover."
"back of a length outside off, 130 kph. Yuvraj finds point with a dab"
"a cutter, offcutter outside off, 122 kph. Yuvraj misses an attempted drive, beats the outside edge"
"back of a length on leg, 129 kph, worked to midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, Yuvraj finds short third man. Only because there is a misfield, there is one"
"a short delivery outside off, Nair tries to scoop the ball over short third man but makes no connection. Clever change in length."
"a slower delivery on off, punched to long-on for a run."
"lovely start. Drifts one in from wide of the crease, Nair gets forward and defends back"
"short and sliding down, pulled to deep square leg. Lucky to get away with that"
"crashes this short delivery to deep point. This was short and sliding away, Yuvraj picked the length early and made room to play the stroke"
"width outside off, punched straight to extra cover"
"drifts into the pads, worked with the spin to long on"
"pushed through quicker outside off, punched but Iyer does well to sprint to his right and stop that with a dive. Some confusion with the running but they eventually complete the run"
"floats this full on off, worked across the line towards deep midwicket"
drilled through to deep cover
"steps out but Maxwell shortens his length, worked towards deep midwicket"
"straightens from length on middle, Yuvraj looks to work to the leg side, but gets a leading edge that rolls wide of cover"
"looks to go big over cover, but toe ends this back towards the bowler"
mistimes the reverse sweep to short third man
"turns this gently with the spin towards deep fine leg, lazy effort in the deep. <strong>Should've just been one</strong>"
<strong>beaten by the googly</strong>. Shaped to steer this past the keeper but pulled out
fizzes past Yuvraj's tentative forward push. Don't think he read the googly again. Lovely from Mishra
digs this yorker length ball back towards long off. Looked to biff this up and over
"drifts in a full delivery on the stumps from wide of the crease, eased to long on"
"uppish, but <strong>lands short of short fine</strong>.This was fired in, Yuvraj toe-ended the paddle."
"<strong>clean strike, solid strike.</strong> Uses the pace superbly as he backs away and lofts the length ball through the line over extra cover."
works this low full toss down to long on
"<strong>saved by an inside-edge that flies past Pant</strong>, who went the wrong way. This was a very thin one. Yuvraj is beaten for pace as he shapes to pull from outside off. Didn't miss the off stump by much."
"out to the pull, out to the pace! Yuvraj's struggle is over. This is a skiddy length ball angling way, Yuvraj had already decided he'll fetch the pull from outside off. The length wasn't quite there and so he gets an under-edge that is gleefully accepted by Pant."
"this is a stunning delivery. <strong>Bowled at 145 clicks</strong>, whizzes across and beats Miller's push. Pant collected that over his head."
pushed through the line to mid-off for a quick single. Avesh bowls out and he's had a superb debut with Daredevils
uses the depth of the crease to punch this to sweeper cover
"touch short again, he makes room and punches this into the gap at deep cover"
"leading edge but safe, rolls to long-off. Was looking to work this through midwicket but didn't pick the googly"
"gets down to paddle, may have got bat but it's well stopped, even if unintentionally,  by Pant, who offers his pad. He was moving to his left when the ball thudded into it. Lucky for Mishra"
"full toss that he bunts down to wide long-on, superbly stopped by a slide by Dan Christian"
"powers this sweep behind square, down to the boundary rider. Prithvi Shaw it is"
eased with the spin to sweeper cover
goes back into the crease and defends this skiddy delivery
<b> dropped by Maxwell at cover! </b> What's worse is they concede an overthrow. Miller rocks back and slaps this straight. Both feet were in the air as he went for the catch sideways and it popped out. <strong>Reprieves his old mate</strong>
"top-edges a sweep but safe, down to fine leg"
"flat-bats this to long-off where Iyer slides around to stop this, can't stop the second though"
chops this cut to short third man.
"<B> Prithvi Shaw has put down a sitter at point! </b> Miller is living a charmed life here. Shaped to cut but checked his stroke, this lobbed up. He got his hands on it, juggled and put it down on the second attempt. What's happening?"
eases this down to long off with the spin
"fired down leg, Nair misses the fine paddle, they scamper a leg bye as the ball rolls to short fine leg"
"take that! Fetch that! He's hit that into the top tier over long-on. In his swinging arc, too full from Mishra. Whack. Remember that old quote? <em>If it's in the arc, i'll hit you out of the park</em>"
"short and spinning away, far too wide on the googly. Left alone"
"flatter one on middle and leg, worked with the spin to deep square leg"
"drifting into the pads, this time he's swept him to the left of short fine leg. Too easy for Nair. Gift of a delivery"
driven through the line to wide long-off. Expensive over.
"a slower delivery on middle and leg, and Nair picks out long-on! And it's taken! Juust. Plunkett is having a terrific debut. Nair looked to whip that slower cutter through midwicket but got that too straight. Iyer runs across from his right and pouches the catch after juggling."
"a slower delivery outside off, guided to point for a tight single"
"another cutter, outside off, chopped down to third man for a run."
"a full and quick delivery down leg, Miller is hurried for pace as he misses a flick, struck on the pad."
"a very short, slower delivery around off is dragged down to fine leg, 116 kph."
"a good length delivery, 119 kph, another cutter, chopped into the pad and then point. Another tidy over, just five runs from it."
"a thick outside edge races away through third man! Another cutter, it actually cuts off the pitch. Takes the outside edge and flies to the third man boundary"
"another slower delivery, on middle and leg. Slogged away into the gap in front of square for a couple."
Miller finds Plunkett! And Kings XI are struggling now. It's yet another cutter outside off. Miller brings out all his power and brute force to smash a lofted drive over cover. But that fielder has been pushed back because Miller is very good with that shot. Plunkett gets low and takes an excellent catch.
"115 kph, four leg byes, those are bad runs for Daredevils. A slower ball down leg, Tye slogs and misses. The ball takes the pad and flies away past Pant for four to fine leg"
"a short slower ball. Tye is through his big hoick again, off the body to third man for a leg bye."
"a length delivery on leg, pushed to long-on for a run. Tidy 18th for Delhi"
follows Ashwin as he backs away. A low full toss is bunted down to long-on
"nicely bowled. Goes wide of the crease, full outside off. Tye still can't get bat on ball, misses his third slog."
"finally bat meets ball. A slower cutter around off, heaved away to deep midwicket for one run."
"strays down leg, extra run, extra ball."
"a slower delivery outside off, punched away to deep cover for a couple. Shaw again takes a fraction of a second longer to release, he has to develop a quicker release in time."
"114 kph, a slower bouncer. Ashwin walks across but can't connect. The ball bounces in front of Pant, ricochets off the hand to short fine leg"
"swing and miss. What a debut for Plunkett. So many cutters, finishes with 3 for 17. A slower ball outside off, Tye swings too early."
"starts with a wide. Full and very wide, looking for the tramline but just errs."
"taken. Ashwin picks out backward point. Another wide yorker, Ashwin gets underneath the length but all he successfully does is chip a slice to the fielder. A comfortable reverse-cupped catch."
"think the wide yorker would have been a better option to earn a dot ball. But Boult goes full and straight, Sran misses, struck on the pad, but it's sliding down"
another slower ball. Cutter. <strong>Tye swings and misses again</strong>. The ball clips the pad and then bounces over the leg stump
"full on leg, flicked away wide of long-on for a couple. Maxwell can't prevent two"
"yikes, he isn't even close to the ball. A short slower cutter outside off. Tye is beaten as he swings."
"132 kph, Tye chops on! Wow, that was a struggle from Tye, 3 off 9. Full and wide, Tye unwinds and swings, but all he manages is a thick inside edge which hits middle and leg stump."
"short of length delivery that jags away off the seam from outside off, defended back as he gets onto his toes"
"no feet movement, feels for the length ball outside off, defended back."
"up and away, although he would've had a brief flutter. Lofts this length ball through the line, <strong>just managed to clear Ashwin at mid-off</strong>"
whips this length ball from outside off to wide mid-on
"slides one down leg, excellent stop by Rahul. The ball bounced before him as well."
"nervous little poke to an away-going delivery, <strong>didn't miss the edge by much</strong>"
"big appeal for lbw. Gambhir was on his toes when he was struck. Height was surely in question there, but no. Ashwin thinks otherwise and has <strong>asked for a review.</strong>. Pitch map shows this hit the turf outside leg,  so nothing else matters."
nearly chopped on! Looked to flay this on the up through point but got a thick inside edge that beat the keeper to the boundary
"races away to the boundary like a? ...........<b> TRACER BULLET! </B> Short of length and angling away, Shaw stood tall and slapped that behind point. Woah, delightful timing and placement"
"this time he pulls, doesn't get hold of it as well as he would've liked but will take three as Finch gives it a laboured chase from mid on"
"slants this into the pads, worked to deep fine leg. Gambhir is off the mark"
slashes and gets a thick outside edge that flies over the slip fielder.
"swivel-pull but just about clears wide mid-on. Expensive, expensive over. Shaw didn't get hold of this pull as well as he would've liked."
solid forward defence to a length ball angling away.
dabs this gently into the off side as they scamper a single. <b> An under-arm flick from Agarwal at point and Shaw may have been gone </b>
"knocked him over! Played one shot too many. Shaped to pull but the length wasn't there for the stroke, beat the inside edge and crashed into the off stump. Completely missed the line, made matters tougher by trying to play across the line. He's given them a good start though."
"works this from middle to beat midwicket. Short leg side boundaries makes it tougher to stop once it cross the 30-yard circle. Lovely timing, good wrist work"
"crunching drive, super stop at point by Yuvraj. <strong>Threw himself to his left</strong> to effect a one-handed stop"
works this length ball into the leg side for an easy single
squeezes the drive to mid off for a quick single
slower one down leg. Rolled through to the keeper as Gambhir looked to tickle it fine
"hint of curve back in to hit the pad as Gambhir looks to flick. He was slightly off balance. Big appeal, but no review. Replays confirm this pitched outside leg."
"ah, super strike that! Walloped into the deep backward square leg fence. Too full, too straight and down leg, Maxwell just walloped it away. Bread and butter stroke for him"
"steps out to whack this slower ball into the neighbouring football stadium, but misses. Swung through too early. Head all over the place"
<strong>is there an edge there?</strong> Thought I heard something. Maxwell looks to run this off the bat face wide of the keeper.
"played three shots in one! First looks to pull, then realises this bouncer is on off and tries to ramp, misses. Beaten"
shows the full face of the bat to ease this back
"right behind the line of this length ball as he defends. Off-cutter from Rajpoot, kept just a touch low."
"shapes to pull but this got big on him, umpire thinks way over Gambhir's head. Wide called"
works this off his hip to deep square leg
whups this from outside off to Yuvraj at midwicket
"this went really, really high in the air. Maxwell has ended up mistiming this pull and Tye takes a superbly judged catch at deep square leg. Looked to fetch it from outside off, this was an effort delivery from Rajpoot. Maxwell got this high on the bat."
hops across and whips to deep square
"slower length ball on middle, Gambhir waits, waits and then defends"
"slower length ball across Gambhir, who defends to cover"
"gets a leading edge straight to mid-off. Gambhir was woefully out of form, was failing to hit anything off the middle and has now paid the price. Looked to hop across and work to the leg side but closed the bat face too early. Are Kings XI fighting back?"
gets well forward and defends solidly
"looked to sway out of the way but somehow didn't get his bat away in time, deflects to third man."
"turns this slower delivery from outside off towards midwicket. Oh, dear. Four overthrows, so make that five. Miller throws to the bowler's end, but Tye misses. Finch, backing up, also misses as this squeezes below him"
squirts this to point. Closed the bat face early in trying to nudge this into the leg side.
hit high on the thigh pad as he hops back to defend. Stifled appeal but too high
gets a good stride forward and defends this solidly to the off side
gets on top of the bounce and wrists this short of length delivery to mid on
short-arm jab but the timing is magnificent. Bisects midwicket and mid on. Lovely from Iyer
"cut away past the diving point fielder. Mujeeb does all the hard work in getting to the ball from square third man but can't collect it cleanly and ends up pushing it into the advertising triangles as he tries to pull it back in. For someone that young, you have to say Mujeeb's fielding is quite ordinary."
works this indrifter towards midwicket
"works this skiddy delivery to midwicket. Went across a long way, would've been a dead duck had he missed it"
lunges forward and smothers this
whips this from outside off to deep square leg
"short and spinning down leg, works to deep square leg"
"drifts in, pitches and spins away from middle, defended with soft hands"
"Mujeeb strikes first ball! Kings XI continue to fight. His first ball is a flick out of the front of the hand, it pitches outside off and spins back in with the angle and the direction of release. It finds a massive gap between bat and pad and knocks into off stump. Daredevils are in some trouble."
"flat on middle and leg, worked to midwicket from the back foot."
"another carrom ball-type delivery, on middle and leg, nudged to midwicket"
"four dot balls! flat outside off, punched back to the bowler"
"drifts down leg this time, clipped down to fine leg for one."
"flat and quick outside off, no flight, no room. Iyer goes back and pushes the ball in front of point for one."
"a flat start, on middle, clipped to deep midwicket"
"the carrom ball, full outside off, pushed to cover."
"very quick and full outside off, driven to long-off"
"<b>a massive appeal</b>, no, says umpire CK Nandan. Slow outside off, the ball pitches outside off and spins back in to hit Iyer in front of off. Replays say missing leg."
""
"back to his flatter trajectory, on middle and off, worked to midwicket. The tidy overs are racking up."
inside edge onto the pad. It's flat and quick on off. Christian tries to finds one through square leg.
"Mujeeb thinks he has got bat on it. Iyer thinks he's fine. But the third umpire is called on. Full outside off, christian belts a drive right back at the bowler, who sticks out his right hand. The ball bursts through the fingers and hits the stump at the bowler's end, but Iyer's bat is in."
nudged to midwicket from the back foot
"another dot, quick and straight, finds midwicket again"
"very full outside off, Iyer opens the bat face and carves a ball to deep cover for one"
"just three off the over. Very full, met by a crisp drive from Christian. A misfield from Ashwin lets the ball go through."
"the legbreak, flat and wide, slashed to deep point for a run."
"that's a filthy delivery, drops short outside off. Iyer rocks back and pummels the long-hop of a legbreak to the deep cover fence"
"shortish and wide, carved to backward point"
"a carrom ball outside off, pushed into the gap at midwicket for one."
"the carrom again. Out the front of the hand. Tidy line, just around off, pushed to point"
"too straight and worked into the gap at midwicket. The throw back to Ashwin is good, he takes the bails off in a hurry and he thinks he has Christian. And he does. Christian is short of his crease. Sensational work from Agarwal at long-on. First, to run to his right and pick up with one hand, then releasing so quickly. And then, throwing the ball well despite being off balance. Ashwin does the easier job of taking the bails off, but he did that very quickly too."
"goes short first up, helped along behind square for a couple. Not quite in control."
"a slower ball goes very wrong. Back of the hand outside off, outside the tramline and called"
"full and straight, pushed back to the bowler. That's a better delivery, why vary unnecessarily?"
"called a wide! Was that over the head? A short delivery outside off, a knuckle ball bouncer that is indeed over the head. This is not very good bowling, why vary to a No. 7 when he isn't trying too much."
"back of a length on off, pulled to long-on for a run. Hurried for pace."
"guided past backward point for two. Full and wide, dabbed past point for two."
"much better from Sran. Stick to the basics. Good length on middle and leg, defended back."
strays down leg for the third wide of the over. Sloppy.
"<b>Iyer reviews immediately!</b> Full and wide outside off, Iyer goes after a drive and misses. The bat hits the ground as it passes. The ball misses. Umpire Nanda Kishore has got that one wrong. The match would have been very different without DRS. At least, the right decision made."
"flat on middle and leg, worked to midwicket for a run."
"the carrom ball around off, punched to long-on"
"another dot. Flat around off, pushed to cover."
"flat outside off, Tewatia goes back and punches one to long-off for one."
"a carrom ball, on middle. Tewatia comes down, but is sent back. Tiwary misses at the bowler's end."
"another carrom ball, on middle and off. Punched to long-off."
"overpitched on off, whipped to long-on for a run."
"the slider. Quick down leg, Tewatia misses a flick. Struck on the thigh pad as he misses that."
"the one that moves the other way. Flat and wide, the ball moves away and beats the bat. Lovely bowling."
"a thick inside edge onto the pad. Flat on off, the inside edge takes the ball to square leg."
"hammered for four. A tad too full this time from Mujeeb, Iyer stays balanced as he drills an on-drive past his partner."
"short and wide outside off, carved away through backward point for a couple. Superb batting."
"one bounce to deep midwicket. A slower delivery around off, a muscled swat to deep midwicket."
"a short slower delivery around off, nudged away to deep square leg for a run"
"strays on the pads but it also cramps Tewatia for room. Struck on the pad, one leg bye to short fine leg."

"a shorter delivery outside off, slashed away to backward point. Trying to create some room."
"a shorter, slower delivery outside off. Carved away to the sweeper cover for one."
"smashed for six. Tewatia backs away, makes room and Sran follows him. But what he does badly is bowl it on a full length, right in the slot. And slammed back over his head for six."
"a low full toss down leg, swiped away to deep midwicket"
"a short, slower ball around off, punched to long-on for one. He's biding his time well"
"finds the gap for four. Full outside off, Tewatia feigns one shot, then the other. Eventually, he walks across and sweeps the fast bowler behind square leg for four. When did No. 7 start sweeping fast bowlers for fun?"
"<strong>that's another mistake from Sran</strong>. He's having a shocker. Short and wide outside off, slapped to wide long-off. Finch returns the throw at the bowler's end, at an awkward height. He misses the collection with Iyer well outside his crease. Big error."
"a good yorker to finish. On leg, jammed out for one."
"short and wide outside off, slashed to third man for a run."
"falls short of Finch at long-off. Full outside off, looking to use the bottom hand to lift the ball through midwicket. Chipped to long-off instead. Think Iyer has played this very smartly"
"a slower ball, too wide outside off though. And called."
"full on middle and leg, heaved away to deep midwicket."
"well bowled. A low full toss outside off, guided to Yuvraj at backward point <b>who unnecessarily throws at the bowler's end</b> to concede an overthrow. Poor game awareness from the experienced man. Iyer was well in anyway."
"well bowled, a yorker outside off, jammed away for one."
"edged and gone. A slower ball from Tye, the knuckle ball outside off. Tewatia slogs but all he manages is a thick leading edge, which is easily taken by Rahul. A timely strike because it also gets a new batsman in."
"a length delivery outside off, pulled away to deep midwicket for one. Not quite timed."
"a golden duck for Plunkett. A slower delivery down leg from Sran. Excellent variation, because Plunkett meets the ball much earlier than he intended. As a result, a whip intended for midwicket goes aerially to deep square leg, where Nair takes a comfortable catch."
"a shortish delivery on middle and leg, swatted away to long-on, on the bounce."
he walks right across and connects neatly with the lap scoop but he finds the keeper. It's a slower delivery well outside off. That missed off stump by not much. Iyer forces him to complete the run.
"that was in the slot, right in the slot. Full on off, Iyer cleared his front leg too and slogged to long-on"
"it's in the slot for that shot. Full and wide, Mishra comes down and misses a swing. DOT!"
"good length, flat down leg. Iyer can't connect. The ball hits the pad to fine leg."
"six! NOT OVER YET. It's flat and wide, Iyer stands back and slaps a swat straight back over the bowler's head for six. sensational timing. Delhi are dancing again."
"refuses the single. Flat outside off, powered to long-off. Says no. I'll take this over."
slogged away with bad timing to deep midwicket. A misfield allows two. Struggled for timing. Iyer initially didn't want even one.
"and he gets four. Flat down leg, helped along past short fine leg. He dives in vain. Big play because it's four. FOUR"
taken at long-off <strong>and Kings XI win by four runs</strong>. Gambhir has his head in his hands. Iyer looks up. A flatter trajectory delivery outside off is chipped away to long-off. Finch takes the reverse-cupped catch and Kings XI begin their celebrations.
