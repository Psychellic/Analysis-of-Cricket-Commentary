"<b>appeal for lbw!</b> But the umpire isn't interested. It was full on middle, and Rohit tried to ramp it over short fine leg. He misses, and the ball hits his thigh in front of middle stump, but replays show that Rohit got an edge to it. That saves him."
"full on leg stump, and Dhawan runs down the wicket to drive it straight back. Mistimed to mid off"

"goes short! Rohit spots the length early, and prepares to play the pull, but Ball's too quick, and the batsman is late into that shot"
"<b>in the air!</b> And taken by Buttler. Short once again on off, and Rohit can't resist pulling. The bat turns in his hand, and the sliced shot is comfortably gobbled by the wicketkeeper. <B>Maiden wicket</b>"

"length ball on leg stump, and Dhawan mistimes the pull. It hits his elbow, and flies away to point. Rahul calls for the single nonetheless, but Dhawan's hobbling in pain as he runs across. The fielder at point aims at the non-striker's stumps, but Morgan fumbles while trying to whip the bails off. Morgan, however, somehow manages to dislodge the bails and Dhawan must make his way back. Poor, poor running. Dhawan was slow in running across because of the blow to his elbow, but he would've been safe if he grounded his bat early."

"full outside off, and pushed off the front foot. Straight to Roy at point"
"<b>bowled him!</b> And India in a whole lotta trouble. it was full on off, and Rahul went for a big straight drive over Plunkett's head. But the ball shaped slightly away from Rahul, then went past his bat, and finally clipped the bails on top of middle stump to send the dangerous batsman packing"
