"Hales smashes the ball into the air, it's high but overs Finch at mid-on... <b>oh, taken at the second attempt on the run!</b> Stanlake strikes second ball thanks to an excellent catch over his shoulder by Finch. Hales, playing his 50th T20I, fails in an attempt to assert himself early"

"hits the pitch hard, Stanlake pushing the gun up to 148kph again, Malan tries to pull his first ball and splices short of midwicket"

"fired in full and Malan gets a chunk of bat in it, mid-on cuts it off as they scuttle through"
short of a length and tucked off the hip for one
"slightly short, Roy hangs back and tries to guides to third man - <b>but nicks it to the keeper instead!</b> Richardson strikes now, bit of a freebie as Roy got a bit casual rather than going hard, scraped the toe of the bat through to Carey. England two down early"

"tip and run, but there's a <b>direct hit from mid-off!</b> Malan is short! Brilliant work from Warner, collecting low down and releasing a right-arm rocket in one fluid movement - both feet in the air as he lets go - and Malan just keeps on running! He knew he was in trouble but it still required a lightning pick up and release to catch him short of his ground"
shortish and defended coming across

"length, tapped downs square"
"oh, my word, <b>almost another run-out!</b> Buttler didn't do his partner any favours here, 'Yes... No!' the call as he pushed towards cover and Maxwell had time to line up the throw but missed with Vince well out of his ground"

"short ball, whipped off the hip and into a gap at deep square for a couple"
angled in on the stumps and worked away
"panic at the disco... <b>but Tye drops the ball trying to run out Buttler!</b> Vince's pull picked out midwicket but Buttler had gone racing down,Finch's throw bounced up and Tye looked to have it in his hands but let go <i>just</i> as he was breaking the stumps. Would have been tight, Buttler maybe got his bat back"

"pushed through, quick on the stumps and Buttler can't get it away"
"Billings comes down early but Stoinis sees him and fires the ball full and wide, beats the aggressive swipe"
"short ball, pulled towards mid-on, this is a suicidal run... <b>but Maxwell misses with one-and-a-bit stumps to aim at!</b> Billings had given up on it"

full outside off and Buttler piston-smashes a wristy square drive for one to the sweeper
"Billings goes across to scoop... and loops a catch to the keeper! Or does he? The finger goes up but Billings asks for a <b>review</b>, although he doesn't look totally confident. Did it hit the glove, or even the bat face? No, just came straight off the thigh pad, so the <b>decision is overturned</b>, but it's still a dot ball for Stoinis to finish a tidy allocation"

"full, slower at 117kph and Jordan can only whack one through cover"
"pitched up, slogged down the ground... <b>and Agar snags it on the run!</b> Another excellent catch, Australia have been good in the field again, Buttler falls from the last ball looking for a boundary to finish a luke-warm effort. Seemed like he might have got hold of it, a flat, straight hit but taken smartly racing across to his left"
"good start, short of a length outside off with a hint of swing and Warner is prodding away from his body without any footwork"

"pumped over the leg side! A crunched off the middle of the bat...poor delivery, a low full toss angled in at leg stump, Lynn's bat sweep is immense as he flicks it over mid-on"
"responds with the slower ball, Lynn is through his shot and gets an inside edge into his pads"
"and he gets him! The short ball does the trick in the end, Lynn aiming over the leg side, gets a big top edge which Buttler steadies himself underneath. But he's done significant damage in a small chase"
"a slower ball at the pads, brings an appeal lbw, surely pitched outside leg...they opt against the review"
