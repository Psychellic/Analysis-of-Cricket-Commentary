lines up a good length ball angled into him on off stump and blocks. The angle is actually so acute that Rahul has to yank that front foot back a touch to make contact
waits on the back of a length delivery quite nicely and nudges it off his hips towards mid-on
"good length, outside off, no shot. #Weird"
another leave from the big man as Kulkarni hits a good length while darting the ball across the left-hander
opens the face to steer a pitched up delivery on middle to deep third man
defends a shortish delivery on off stump with ease
"angles in a length ball from wide of the crease, Gayle has a good look at it again as he defends"
"length ball on the stumps, some zip off the pitch, defended back"
"gets some inward movement off the pitch, Gayle is rooted to the crease as he blocks"
"<strong>just eludes Archer at deep square!</strong> He was some way in, this pull wasn't all that well timed. Hung in the air for a long, long time. Jofra was out of position and was running backwards. Had he been right on the ropes, this would've been much easier."
he's walloped this over wide long-on! The Universe Boss has had enough sighters. Unadkat goes short of length and Gayle says thank you. Flat-batted with disdain
bunts it to Shreyas Gopal at short third man
"punched on the up off the frontfoot, straight to extra cover"
stands tall and punches this to mid-off
whips this length ball from outside off to deep square
"slower ball this time, Gayle is squared up and takes his hands off the grip to get a thick edge, Samson dives to his left to stop that. <strong>Excellent glovework</strong>"
"poor ball and punished! This is a full toss too far wide outside off, Gayle simply reaches out to get a thick edge past short third man"
"cutter on a length on leg stump, Gayle is squared up but manages to defend."
"short ball angling in towards the armpit, Rahul tucks this gently to square leg"
"scorching drive, straight to Binny at cover point"
uses the pace to steer this down to square third man
"hustled for pace with a <strong>140.7kph</strong> shot of length delivery, Rahul hops back and tucks to square leg"
"nipbacker off a length on middle, tucked into the leg side again"
"cut away, but this is an excellent stop at cover point"
squeezes this slower delivery towards point for a quick single
"denied width, bunts this straight to cover"
scythes this shortish slower delivery to Binny at deep point
"dug into the pitch, this one is sitting up nicely and Gayle just makes a hint of room and wallops behind point. Super shot"
"poor bowling. Tests him with a short ball but you can't do that when you bowl in the late 120s. Gayle arches back and helps it over to clear third man. Ah, this is so good to watch"
"slower length ball on off, bunted to point where Shreyas misfields and they pick a quick single"
"looks to wallop this across the line, gets a thick inside edge to short fine."
"hits the hard lengths at 144.8kph, Gayle is cramped for room and defends back"
"beaten but Kings XI get four! Through with the pull even before the ball arrived, awkward bounce in front of Samson as he tries to grab on the half-volley and <strong>lets it through his legs</strong>"
"now, that's one way to channel your anger and frustration. <strong>A Barbadian gets the big Jamaican.</strong> Archer runs his fingers over the seam to bowl this length ball that squares Gayle up with the deviation. And because Gayle has a poke, he gets a thin edge and Samson makes no mistake this time. Huge wicket and Archer is pumped."
"but Archer slants into the pads, tucked to fine leg"
"goes full and straight on the stumps, works this to mid-on"
"shortish to begin with, he taps this wide of cover for a quick single"
driven with the spin to sweeper cover
"drops short, Agarwal rocks back and pulls to wide long-on"
"goes straight, and clears the ropes. Didn't get to the pitch but went through and timed the hell out of that"
flayed away but a good stop behind point to keep it to a single. This one was spinning away from the fielder there
"this one kept really, really low. Rahul shapes to pull but is almost done in by the skid, somehow managed to toe-end this."
"driven to sweeper cover, nicely tossed up"
"shortens his length a touch, dabs wide of point"
"too short, Agarwal picks the length early and pulls to deep midwicket where Binny, another Karnataka man, loses his balance while trying to pull it back in. That said, you have to say he did wonderfully well in sprinting towards the ball."
"he's on a roll! Sees the flight, eyes light up as he gets to the pitch and belts this over long-off. Such wonderful timing"
"picks this shortish googly, pulled to deep midwicket"
"skiddy length ball, punched to cover."
"drops short again, pulled all along the ground to deep midwicket"
"drifts a length ball into middle and leg, tucked to deep midwicket"
"gets well forward and turns this gently towards the vacant midwicket region, Sodhi had to run across to stop, by which time they were back for the second quite comfortably"
"huge strike! Looks to go across the line, got down on one knee to slog sweep and ended up getting more elevation than distance. Archer takes an excellent catch at long-on. Was it all the pressure of runs being bottled up at KL Rahul's end? Royals can breathe easy for a bit. Agarwal was in sparkling form."
steps out and tucks this gently towards midwicket
"sharp turn but this pitched on middle and leg, spun back in to hit the pad with Miller looking to work into the leg side"
eased with the spin to long-off
works this past the diving midwicket fielder to get off the mark
"eased with the spin again, down to long-off"
"swept fiercely, down to deep square"
"steps out, Shreyas drops short and Rahul punches this towards deep cover"
"skids one through on a length outside off, punched to long-on"
shifts back in his crease to nudge the shortish delivery on leg stump to deep midwicket and pinches two. That is always his intention having played the ball gently
"<b>deceived by the dip</b>. Rahul thinks he can flick it through midwicket and get more runs, but the ball dips and straightens to secure the leading edge"
slices it through the covers to get off strike
sweeps a length ball on middle to deep square leg
"tosses it up on leg stump, Rahul turns it behind square leg"
"shimmies down the track but Sodhi spots it, pulls his length back and gives only a single to long-on"
punches the back of a length delivery to the right of mid-off
"<b>outstanding shot</b>! There's the skill he has with boundary-hitting. It's his first of the day, but he works it so well, making room outside leg, and even after the bowler follows him with a short ball, trying to cramp him, Rahul doesn't panic and simply lifts it over mid-off because there's no one in the deep"
"a whirl of the wrists sends a length ball against the angle across him to deep midwicket. He's good at hitting, this guy, he's just been waiting for the right time."
<b>slower ball</b> beats Miller. it hits a good length outside off and finds the batsman far too early with his push down the ground
"takes the pace off again while also hitting the deck. Miller is a little more aware of Unadkat's plans now, delaying his bat swing just enough that he can time the pull shot to deep square leg"
flicks a fullish delivery on leg stump to deep midwicket
"quicker delivery on middle stump, Rahul spots it and whips it to deep midwicket"
"<b>hard-hit sweep</b>! He gets down on one knee against a length ball and that bat comes down on it, making sure he wouldn't top edge it. Good technique, and picking of length"
doesn't read the googly though as he plays across the line to a ball picked on leg stump and turning away. The flick shot results in a leading edge
""
"down the track, but Gopal does really well, not only adjusting his length, but also sliding the ball into Rahul. The right-hander now has no choice but to nudge it to long-on"
"another googly, but this time, Miller goes back in his crease and hits with the turn to long-off. <B>That's the time out</b>"
opens up his body as he goes back so he can dispatch a short googly pitching on leg stump away to deep midwicket
"slugs a short ball on leg stump, which also doesn't spin, away to deep midwicket"
"<b>too short, and too good!</b> This is the ball a batsman with a 75 strike-rate dreams about. Half-tracker. With plenty of width. Rahul really should have sent it all the way to Auckland. But he settles for the crowd behind deep square leg"
"good work by Turner at short fine leg, diving to his right at short fine leg. This - another pull from Rahul - looked set for the boundary again after Sodhi strays so very far down leg this time"
<b>flat-bats down the ground</b>. I'm callin it. Miller is setting up for the googly. The legspinners are doling them out generously. This one is short and Miller just thumps it with a free swing of his arms
legbreak pitching outside leg and turning further away. Guess what that's called... That's right. Bowler rattled
"loopy delivery on leg stump, Miller whacks it to the left of long-on"
"<b>scoops it</b>! See, it's like turning on a switch. It doesn't matter if he gets out now so he's prepared to take all the risks in the world. But even then, he picks the right bowler. Unadkat bowls length and across the right-hander, Rahul plants his front leg across, then bends low and finally shovels the ball well over the short boundary behind him. Good stuff"
"yorker on middle and leg, but Rahul's managed to make enough room for himself that he can hammer it to extra cover"
leg-stump full toss and Miller makes it disappear. All the magic tricks are coming out now. Miller yanks his front leg back so he has a free swing of the arms and the flick shot sails over deep square leg
"another low full toss, but this one is slow and in line with the stumps, and the batsman is happy to push it down to long-on"
"<B>oooooover point</b>! These are not easy hits! These need to be timed insanely well. Especially considering this is a near-yorker well outside leg stump, But Rahul leaps away to his left, making tons and tons of room, then works extra hard to get under the ball and lift it all the way. Blistering cricket."
"back of a length on leg stump, Rahul turns it to deep midwicket and makes it 20 off the over. That's 38 in two. Kings XI are on their way."
starts with a low full toss on leg stump which Miller whips to long-on
goes for the reverse sweep but the legbreak is just a little too far outside off for him to make contact. Good stuff from Gopal. He's got excellent smarts for the T20 game
"<b>outside edge</b> as once again Gopal hides the ball from the big-hitter, pitching it outside off, never allowing Rahul to get under it. He still goes for the flashy drive through cover but ends up with a single to short third man"
"flatter delivery, spinning away from the left-hander, Miller crunches it to long-off"
"loops it into the blockhole on middle, Rahul pops it back to the bowler"
<b>beats him</b> with a seam-up yorker outside off. Rahul was trying to slice it past the keeper and get it fine to the third man boundary but no such luck
"slower ball, into the deck, and cramping Rahul. The batsman gets a leading edge that lands just past the pitch, somewhere near mid-on."
"<B>off stump goes for a vacation, but Archer's overstepped</b>! Rahul knows it though. He tells MIller to get over his shock and run off to the other end. So in the end, a super fast length ball that the left-hander plays all across and gets bowled may actually turn out to be useful for the batting team"
<b>picture perfect yorker</b> as a free hit ball and even Rahul can only do enough to protect his stumps
"picks the gap between cover and mid-off and <b>it's with that sublime shot that he gets to his fifty</b>. Sublime because Archer angles the shortish delivery well down leg, responding to the batsman making room for himself. But Rahul, once again, holds his shape and simply extends his back foot defensive while concentrating on picking the gap"
"looks for the yorker, but it ends up a really low full toss, which Rahul knocks down to long-on"
slices it behind point
"<B>beats him</b> outside off with Miller stuck in his crease against a fullish, incoming delivery, trying to cut it through point"
"<b>caught at point</b>! Unadkat screams, he's been vindicated, backing himself to come good against a man who's hit him all over the park, bowling full and just outside off. Rahul tries a calculated slice, hoping he can get it between point and short third man, in which case it would have been a boundary, but only ends up hitting straight at Archer"
"slower ball, targeting off stump, Pooran gets forward and whips it to deep midwicket"
"steps down, making room, but Unadkat does well again, bowling short and angling it into the gut of Pooran, who loses his shape and swings blindly, mis-hitting the ball to deep square leg"
"another slower short ball, which Miller swats to long-on"
"beats him with his lack of pace - it's only 108 kph - and it offers no hitting room. Pooran, even after clearing the front leg, isn't able to get bat to it, playing a flick shot and instead finding runs at third man"
launches it to the extra cover boundary! Minor blip in planning from Unadkat as he goes normal pace and lands it right in the slot for Miller to lash past mid-off's right
mis-hits a near-yorker at 145 kph to mid-off
"doesn't quite land the yorker, but when you're pace is at 145 kph, it is still hard to power away. Pooran clears his front leg and swings it to long-on"
<b>taken at cover</b>. Archer's so good he's getting wickets off full tosses. Pooran tries to drag it from outside off into the leg side but the rapid pace on the ball means it skews off the outside top half of the half and ends up in Rahane's hands
"low full toss on leg stump, Miller taps it to long-on"
"148 kph full toss on middle, Mandeep can only bunt it back to the bowler"
"<b>drags on</b>! Archer comes down from 150 clicks to a mere 111 and it bamboozles Mandeep. Comes out the back of the hand, concentrates on pitching it short - which is because the batsman's mind reads the length instinctively but doesn't always catch the pace  - Mandeep is into the pull way too early and the ball ricochets off his bat into the base of the stumps. <b>Top class bowling from a top class talent. Ed Smith, are you watching?</b> (He and the other England selectors pick their World Cup squad tomorrow)"
"another slower ball, another wicket. Miller tries to cream it over wide long-on, making room and swinging as hard as he can. But since Kulkarni pulls all the pace off it, the batsman can't really get all the timing he wants on it and Buttler picks up an easy catch at long-on"
carves the short ball outside off behind point and keeps it well to the right of third man to find a well contrived boundary
steps down the track and nails the back of a length ball on off stump to the left of mid-off. Buttler does well to stop it going to the boundary with quick movement and a well timed dive
"nails the yorker, angling into Mujeeb's toes and try as he might he can't get any bat to it. They do sneak a leg bye to point though"
"launches it over midwicket. Ashwin picks the slower ball, waits for it to hit the deck and come within his hitting arc and then pulls it with some power"
"<b>scoops it</b>! That's the way to end a T20 innings. And he sure enjoyed it, striding over to his partner and punches his gloves with extra oomph. This shows Ashwin in his best light - he knows the bowler is under pressure having bowled a short ball. He knows he's bound to go for the yorker and so he sets up for the scoop shot, backing himself to get under the ball, and easily does so when it ends up a full toss outside off. Then a little bit of wristwork makes sure it travels all the way"
"slants a length ball across, steered to square third man"
"rooted to the crease, hangs his bat out at a full delivery, <strong>beaten.</strong>"
"wow, Arshdeep seems to have put in some yards of pace. Length ball at 137.7kph - he didn't average more than 130 at the U-19 World Cup last year - defended back"
stands tall and bunts it to mid-off for a quick single
"hustles him with some late inswing, Tripathi is thrown off balance as he looks to nudge this, the ball deflects off the pad to short fine."
"excellent stop by Mandeep at mid-off! Buttler reached out to drive, didn't time it well but it still needed some stopping. <strong>The young man bowls an excellent first over</strong>"
"floated full on the stumps, defended back"
"punched straight to cover, good bowling"
"steps out and wallops this over long-on, into the top tier. Super hit."
"drifts one in from wide of the crease, worked towards deep midwicket"
"works this from outside off towards wide long-on, excellent running"
"shortish on middle and leg, punched down to wide long-on"
"<strong>welcome to the IPL, young man says Buttler.</strong> Sashays down the pitch and whips him over midwicket. That sailed over"
walks across and bunts this to mid-off
"slants one full, Tripathi gets a thick inside edge on the drive to midwicket"
scorcher! Too much width and he reaches out to open the bat face ever-so-slightly to play this delightful square drive.
"stops on him just a touch, Buttler gets a thick inside edge to midwicket"
slower delivery but sprays this too far wide outside off
<strong>beauty!</strong> Beats the edge with one that zips across with Buttler looking to steer behind square.
"driven to cover, straight to Mandeep"
"swung across the line, one bounce to long-on"
"leading edge, rolls to cover."
steps out and squeezes this off a thick inside edge to long-on
"slides this down leg, keeper fumbles and they run a bye too"
"another skiddy delivery, half-pull to long-on"
"slips this down leg, Buttler attempts a fine paddle. Can't get bat, keeper fumbles too, more runs"
driven wide of cover
"huge scalp for the young man, but <strong>credit for it goes entirely to Nicholas Pooran</strong>, who takes an excellent catch! Buttler looks to wallop this length ball across the line, gets a leading edge that swirls in the air for a long, long time. Pooran turned around and ran back and settled himself under the swirler before pouching it safe. Ashwin rips out a roar, we won't see Ashwin v Buttler tonight."
short-arm jab to deep midwicket
"walks across but Arshdeep sprays this further away to negate this, left alone. Wide called"
slower delivery that he bunts to cover for a quick single
leans into the drive and slices it up and over to the square third man boundary. Too much width
"off-cutter which he squeezes past point, aggressive running to come back for the second"
<strong>Shami makes a right royal mess</strong> at short third man! Sliced to him on the bounce and he lets it through to concede a four.
"straightens after drifting in a touch, Samson gets a leading edge that rolls to cover point"
punched down to long-on
"skiddy length ball from wide of the crease, Tripathi right behind the line in defence"
chipped down to Rahul at long-on
works this down to long-on as he jogs the single
pushed into the covers
punches this shortish delivery to long-off
"shortish on middle, pulled to deep midwicket"
whips this to deep square
"delicate little glide past the diving Arshdeep at short third man. Played it really, really late"
too short and he slaps this to deep cover
"gentle dab to short third man again, quick single taken"
works this with the spin to deep midwicket
"lands this on a length outside off, punches to long-on"
"superb execution! Gets outside the line and paddles this fine. Better work from Shami, first to give it chase and then pull the ball back in, all to save a solitary run"
works this down to deep midwicket
works this from outside off towards deep midwicket
"flayed away to deep cover where Mujeeb has hurt himself trying to dive, ends up parrying the ball further away. <strong>Mujeeb is down on the floor, clutching his shoulder.</strong>"
punches this length delivery into the gap at deep cover
"slower length ball outside off, steered to square third man"
"slips one down leg and Samson flicks this fine to beat M Ashwin at fine leg. Shami bowled that at 144.6, all Samson needed really was a deflection"
"dabbed away late to the third man boundary. Played so very late, excellent control. Samson's on top of his game here"
another bunt down to third man
"slants one back in from wide of the crease, defended back"
turns this towards short midwicket for an easy single
"carrom ball, the length is on the shorter side, dabbed straight to short third man"
"floated full on off, gentle dab into the gap between cover and point"
"straighter one, pushed straight to cover"
"draws the edge with this carrom ball on off, rolls wide of short third man"
whips this shortish delivery down to long-on
"good bowling - tossing it up and getting it to dip sharply on the right-hander. So much that Tripathi, and his big backlift, decide to just block it through the covers"
"quicker and shorter to Samson, who reads it all very well and late cuts the ball outside off to short third man."
"bowls slow, which is why even his short balls can't be timed properly. Tripathi is actually into his pull shot too early and ends up mis-hitting to deep midwicket"
"strays on the pads and since it's a length ball as well, Samson gets down low to sweep. Finds deep square leg though"
"top stuff from Ashwin, diving to his right and saving a hard-hit drive down the ground"
"nicely tossed up on off stump, Tripathi smashes it to cover. <b>Only four off the over</b>"
"carrom ball from wide of the crease. But Samson doesn't care for that, sweeping the ball on length and just trusting his timing"
taps it down the ground to long-on
"another carrom ball, angled into the right-hander, Samson though dinks it into the midwicket region gently, knowing full well that with the man back in the crease, he has runs on offer"
"<b>plays all over it</b>. Ashwin has seen Samson sweeping on length regardless of the spin on the ball. So he puts this around off stump - a region that is conducive to the sweep shot - but the length of this ball is a little fuller. And the ball skids through off the pitch, going under the bat and taking down off stump. The subtlest of variations. The greatest of effects."
"another carrom ball, which Rahane nudges towards long-on"
"slices the shortish delivery turning into him to backward point. Kings XI pulling things back. Last two overs, only nine runs, and a big wicket"
"<b>unreal timing</b>. Rahane has no trouble ticking the ball away so long as it has pace on it and Shami provides plenty, right on his pads, and the Royals captain flicks it to the right of deep square leg"
"back of a length and outside off, Rahane dabs it to third man"
yorker goes badly wrong and Tripathi is perfectly poised to take advantage. Holds his shape as the ball lands just in front of his boots and then helps it on its way to the fine leg boundary.
"shortish and outside off, steers it behind point"
hacks a short ball outside off to long-on
"a little bit of width on offer and Rahane makes full use of it, dabbing the ball to third man"
"hammers it back down the pitch, but Mandeep saves his own blushes by diving full length to his right and stopping a few crucial runs"
"short and wide, Tripathi lashes it to deep point"
lifts a length ball on off stump over Mandeep's head and top-class running gets them two
"slower, length ball, and it <B>keeps low</b> too. Rahane tries to flick through midwicket but finds the ball popping up in the air and going way too straight"
slices a length ball on off stump to the sweeper
lifts the length ball outside off over extra cover. Only eight runs off the part-timer. That's a huge plus for Kings XI. <b>That's the timeout</b>
"quicker through the air and angled into leg stump. But he makes every effort to turn the ball and turn it he does. As a result, Tripathi is badly squared up while he defends the ball"
"shortish and outside off, Tripathi sets up for the pull, but it's the long boundary there, and he can only find midwicket"
waits on the back foot and taps the flatter delivery to short third man
"plenty of width to free the arms, but Tripathi can't beat the field, Ashwin's placed a deep extra cover there and the ball finds him perfectly"
"panics against the short ball on middle and leg, going for the pull shot, but it comes to him well after he plays the shot, beating him completely"
walks down and sweeps the length ball on off stump away to deep midwicket
mis-hits a flatter delivery outside off to long-on
comes down the track to lift the length ball on leg stump down to long-on
"<b>stumps him?</b>. Ashwin sees Tripathi haring down the pitch and slides the ball so beautiful wide outside the off stump. The batsman swings in complete desperation, misses it altogether, but replays show he does have the agility to shove his bat inside the crease before Pooran could break the stumps. The wicketkeeper had a huge distance to cover, collecting the ball and breaking the stumps"
"carrom ball, outside off, Tripathi flat-bats it back at the bowler"
"more carroms, Tripathi swings it out to deep midwicket to get his fifty. Mild applause from his team-mates but there's no celebration from him"
"short and wide outside off, Rahane cuts to deep point"
"<b>taken at long-off</b>. The run-rate kept rising. He had to do something about it. He sees a short ball outside off, goes for the lofted drive, but the ball seems to come off the higher part of the bat and so doesn't have the timing to clear the fence"
"mis-hit, catching chance, but it falls short of long-off racing in off the boundary! Ashwin hits the deck with a very fast legbreak and the pitch responds by giving the ball extra fizz, making it bounce awkwardly on Rahane, who skews a pull shot down the ground"
gets down low and pulls the short ball on leg stump to deep square leg
"spears the legbreak well wide of off stump, hoping to keep away from Turner's hitting arc"
"<B>duck on IPL debut</b>! This, strangely enough, is a slow, tossed up legbreak, possibly because Ashwin thinks he can bait the big hitter into a false shot. And bait him he does. The equation makes Turner go for it. The turn on the ball makes the shot go to long-off when he is looking to go dead straight. Miller runs in and takes the catch and Royals are in a mess again"
"shortish and outside off, he cuts to the sweeper"
"the pitch is too slow. New batsmen can't come in and go bang bang. Not even Archer, who goes for a big hit and ends up chopping it back to the bowler"
punches the flatter delivery outside off through the covers
"<b>taken at long-on</b>! Archer biffs a short ball outside off with great power, but these are long boundaries and that's a top fielder. KL Rahul comes in off the boundary and takes it ever so confidently. <b>Royals need 50 off 17 now</b>"
backs away and pulls the short ball on leg stump to deep square leg
"launches the short ball outside off to the square leg boundary, bisecting the two men in the deep. That's brilliant hitting"
"<b>scoops it outta here</b>! He gets inside the line of a short ball angled into him and with that angle he just helps the ball away. Sensible, sensational batting"
goes full now and Binny drills it to deep midwicket
full toss following Rahane's movement outside leg. He can only slice it to point
"takes all the pace off the ball and places it well outside off. Rahane, walking across to sweep it, can only cue-end it back down the pitch"
"steps out of his crease to smear a wide delivery outside off to deep cover. This is good stuff from Arshdeep, not giving up the easy leg-side boundary that batsman crave in this stage of the innings"
"more offcutters and this one is taken by short third man running nearly all the way to the boundary! Brilliant stuff from Arshdeep to trust his slower balls. To line them up well outside off, meaning Rahane's helpless flail into the leg side, takes a clean top edge. And even better catching from Shami, his eyes always on the ball."
"into the crowd again! Binny finds the leg side boundary by being a lot more still in the crease; a lot more calm. Some of that is due to his batting so deep in the crease, waiting for the slightest mistake. And here he gets the room to swing his arms as much as he wants and swing he does over midwicket"
"full and wide outside off, Binny looks for the slap over cover but misses it altogether"
<b>hammers it down the ground</b>. Binnsta! You gangsta! He fools Arshdeep with his back leg going down leg. He makes him bowl outside off. And he's waiting with the perfect shot
"<b>superb stuff</b>! Shami spears a fuller delivery at 140 kph int leg stump. Gopal makes room to launch it over the off side, but it's a mis-hit and it's an easy catch at long-off"
"nice yorker, tailing into leg stump with a mean streak. Binny though is just about able to squeeze it to point"
thumps it down the ground as Shami just misses the yorker length. Binny's plan of staying deep in his crease is working quite nicely. But there's just too many runs to get
"nails the yorker just outside leg stump, which is only because he is following a batsman making room for himself. Binny drills it to long-on and huffs and puffs for a couple"
"slower ball, which Binny lashes to the left of long-off, and Agarwal saves it with a proper sprint and well timed dive. Kings XI bossing this"
"one-handed slash over extra cover and Agarwal won't give this one up either, rushing to his left, diving, putting in everything even though these runs don't matter. <b>Kings XI win</b>!"
