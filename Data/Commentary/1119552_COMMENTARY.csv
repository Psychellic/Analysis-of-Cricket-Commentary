"oof, that's a lovely line to start with, rising from slightly back of a length, 87mph and shaping across Cook, past the edge as he fences off the back foot"
"angled towards the slips, on a length but wide enough for Cook to leave comfortably"
"touch short and straight, 86mph and this doesn't swing at all, Cook nudging the first run of the morning off his hip in time-honoured fashion"
"good pace and carry on a length for Bumrah, sliding across England's other southpaw opener, Jennings leaves alone"
"another line of beauty from Bumrah, landing on leg stump and then prancing away off the seam, Jennings beaten playing inside"
"length ball in the channel, 85mph Jennings gets across this time and shoulders arms"
"round the wicket straight away, good line but Cook isn't tempted"
"oh, nearly does him, another Sharma jaffa! Angled in from round the wicket, curving away seductively, a femme fatale of a ball... but Cook avoids kissing it, this time! Only clocked at 78mph, but a perfect line"
"touch wider, this time Cook shoulders arms coming across"
"touch shorter, Cook gets bat on ball this time, a nervy prod down into theoff side"
"full, 82mph and nibbling away a touch, a foot or so outside off and Cook lets it go"
"fullish length ball, fourth-stump line and Cook presses forward defensively - survives the opening inquisition"
"oh, what has he done?! <b>Jennings plays no stroke and is rapped plumb in front!</b> Did he lose sight of it somehow? I think it only <i>just</i> pitched in line with leg stump, then shot through at knee height and Jennings simply padded up! A complete brain freeze, and Jennings' miserable series continues... Straightening off the pitch, hitting the top of middle stump, Bumrah strikes!"
"fullish outside off, met with a solid push on the front foot, full face of the blade"
"lovely stuff, Burmah's angle really foxes the right-handers, Root hangs back and dabbles indeterminately"
"length in the channel, Root comes across and lets this one go"
"angled in from slightly wide, 87mph and Root taps it down into the covers"
tough too straight and this time Root works his first runs away through midwicket with a nonchalant flick
"Sharma continues to polish that groove outside off, swerving away as Cook steps out and leaves"
steps into line and lets this one go
"pushed in closer to the stumps, 82mph and rising as Cook watches it closely and keeps his powder dry"
"tight lines from Ishant, defended watchfully on off stump"
pitched up and left alone in the channel
"Cook is bent over his bat, watching the ball with fierce concentration, the line is fourth/fifth stump and he leaves again"
"good-length ball around off stump, Root defends down into the leg side"
comes forward and shows this the full face in defence
"speared in, rapping the pads, that's a close shout... but Bruce Oxenford shakes his head! Bumrah likes it, he's nodding his head, and <b>India review</b> - but, oh now, what's this...? Bumrah had overstepped! It's a no-ball, and Root won't need to go through trial by review! How costly will that be? No bat involved on the replay, and it would surely have been tight"
"fired in to the batsman, worked away with the angle for a couple to fine leg"
"slightly back-of-a-length ball in the channel, Root leaves"
lets this one go outside off
defended on the front foot into the covers
"length delivery in the corridor, Cook allows it through"
"ooh, slips in a cheeky yorker, Cook does well to drop his bat on it in time"
"good length, 83mph a foot outside off stump, Cook leaves again"
presses forward and taps defensively into the covers
"pitched up and belted through backward point, Cook sallies forth and slides a drive for four, opening the face and nicely played"
"Ishant drags his length back, in the channel and Cook waves his bat in the air"
"juice in the pitch, this jumps at Root as he tries to come forward, deflected away through backward square leg for one"
"fired down in the channel, 88mph and quite wide as Cook stays back and leaves"
"shaping away on a length, no stroke needed"
"Bumrah brings this one back again, the ball that did for Jennings, but it's leg side as Cook swishes and misses"
"fuller, on the pads again, flicked fine and that's running wide of Pant, four more for Cook"
"touch short, nipping away in the channel, Cook prods it down into the off side"
"full and curving in late, hit on the pads again... and Dharmasena gives this one! Root <b>reviews</b> this time, but he doesn't look hugely confident. For good reason: no bat involved, and that's smacked the front pad bang in line with off stump! Ishant roars, Root's out cheaply, and India have made two big breakthroughs! Lovely delivery, that, proving Ishant doesn't just feast on lefties"
"shouts of 'catch!' as the ball comes back in at YJB, balloons off the pad and clears short leg... not sure any bat involved, though"
"pitched up, 82mph in the channel outside off, Bairstow leaves"
comes across and defends on off
"on the stumps, good length and YJB plays it nearly, pushed through mid-on for a single to get off the mark"
"touch short, 79mph and holding its line outside off, Cook taps it softly down into the gap at point"
"round the wicket, pitched up and shaping away as Cook shoulders arms"
fullish and jabbed away coming forwards
"overpitched, that's a low full toss and Cook doesn't miss out, rhubarbs it down to third man and the ball disappears quickly for another boundary"
"good length, 87mph and aiming for the top of off stump, blocked doughtily from the crease"
"touch short on off, Cook lines it up well and pokes down into the covers, no run there"
"woof, that's a beauty from Bumrah, sucking Cook and then spitting him out the other side... beaten all ends up but, crucially, no bat on it!"
full and tailing in as YJB comes forward and blocks into the covers
"dug in, only 78mph and veering leg side as the batsman ducks"
"swerving in as Bairstow prods with a bit of a gap with bat and pad, thuds into the front leg via the inside edge as the India cordon yelps in excitement"
"Ishant's in-ducker is throwing shapes out there, this arrows into the pads as Bairstow is caught flicking across the line"
"oh my, <b>that's missed everything!</b> Beats Bairstow on the inside, the ball zipping over the top of leg stump as Pant leaps to his left! Snorting ball, just <i>fractionally</i> too short"
"fired into the pitch, 80mph and drifting leg side as YJB gets his equipment out of the way"
"testing line, rising in the channel through to the keeper as Cook comes across"
"full and a touch too straight, 87mph and clipped wide of mid-on, only came off the toe of the bat but they trot through for one"
"full outside off, YJB is on to the front foot, steered through the covers for three"
"loose from Cook, hanging back and wafting at a cut, but the ball is too close and it whizzes over the top edge"
"fired in full, 86mph but Cook is again equal to the attempted yorker"
"short and leaving Cook, he thinks about playing but that line is too wide and he can drop the hands safely"
presses forward to block on off stump
"length ball, veering in and Bairstow gets a tickle on it wide of the keeper for a single"
"angled in and straightening from round the wicket, Cook lets it go"
"length ball, shuffles into line and lets this one through once again"
"full, the tempter, 81mph and Cook pushes forward, gets a thick, low edge that squirts to the right of Rahane at point, does well to grab it on the bounce"
"plugging away in the corridor, Cook is treating Ishant with extreme caution and gets into line to leave once again"
"fullish, close to off stump, pushes it to the left of cover to pick up a quick single"
"ooh, sharp inward movement from back of a length, causes Cook to hop and beats the inside edge of his defensive jab to hit pad, but it was heading down leg and going over the stumps, so no appeal"
"back of a length again, on off stump this time. Jumps up and defends into the mid-on region"
"a bit fuller now, ends up angling it towards leg stump. Clipped away to long leg"
"ooh, confident leave, but it wasn't too far from off stump. A nice length too, but he strides forward and shoulders arms nonetheless, and it carries through at over head height to Pant"
"got him! This is beautiful bowling from Bumrah. He makes it so hard when he gets the occasional one to straighten away from the right-hander - as he's done here. His usual angle is so pronounced, into the batsman, that he almost always has to play at it, especially when it's so close to his off stump. Not so much Bairstow did wrong, defending off the back foot and pretty close to his body, but all he manages is a tickle through to the keeper"
"back of a length, straightens late towards off stump and Cook is a little cramp as he jams his bat down in defence"
"full, down the leg side, clipped to long leg"
"length ball slanting across the batsman, and Stokes is half-forward in defence, gets a thickish edge down to gully"
"fullish on middle stump, defended back to the bowler"
"fullish, angling across to off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"length ball, angling across to the top of off stump, defended towards short extra-cover"
"fullish, angling in towards off stump. Good stride forward to defend into the point region"
"fullish again, in the channel close to off stump. Gets on the front foot to block it back to the bowler"
"ooh, that's such a tight leave! Excellent length, not quite as full as the previous two deliveries, and it's so close to off stump I'd count that as a dangerous leave. Did Cook trust the bounce and leave on length? Maybe"
"a little wider outside off, a touch fuller, and Cook is quickly forward and across to push towards backward point"
"good length, angling in towards off stump, defended to mid-off"
"again, a good length and homing in on the top of off stump. Gets his weight forward and blocks it back to the bowler"
"overpitched, a touch too straight, perhaps on middle stump, and Stokes clips it away crisply to the left of mid-on"
"back of a length, pitching on off stump and slanting a long way across, easily left alone"
"length ball, a bit closer to off stump. Comes forward to defend into the point region"
"length ball angling towards off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"full, a bit of swing, but it's swinging down leg. Stokes comes forward to flick, only manages a leg bye behind square"
"back of a length, a bit of late shape gets the ball to straighten towards middle stump. Goes deep in his crease and clips to midwicket"
"length ball, angling into the fourth-stump channel. Gets forward to defend and it goes towards midwicket off the inside half of the bat"
"fullish, angling in but starts pretty wide - sixth or seventh-stump line - and Stokes leaves it alone"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
shortish on a fifth-stump line. Stands tall to punch into the covers. Didn't quite middle it and it rolls slowly through the outfield
"back of a length, angling into middle stump, defended to midwicket"
"back of a length, fifth-stump channel. Well left by Stokes and the ball carries through at head height to Pant"
"gone, Pandya strikes, and Cook is out in slightly uncharacteristic manner. Isn't short enough to cut, and Cook follows the angle away from him and stabs at it. Ends up edging to third slip, where Kohli takes an excellent catch, falling to his left and catching it with both hands, low, by his toes"
"fullish outside off, a bit of outswing, driven to short cover"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"a bit of outswing again from a fullish length, but starts at least a foot too wide of off stump to make Buttler play"
"back of a length, closer to off stump this time, forcing Buttler to defend. Gets a thickish edge that rolls away past the diving gully fielder"
"back of a length, too straight, tucked off the hip to long leg"
"full, slanting in from wide of the crease. Defended into the covers"
"good length, pitches on off stump and nips away to exaggerate the angle away from the left-hander, who leaves it, forcing Pant into a full-length dive to grab the ball in one glove"
"back of a length, moves in the other direction this time but starts too straight and ends up down the leg side. Excited appeal for caught behind down the leg side, but Snicko confirms there's no bat or thigh pad on it"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"back of a length on middle stump, Stokes is opened up a little as he defends it back to the bowler"
"on the pads, worked away to the right of long leg. Shami hasn't quite found his line yet"
"back of a length, a bit of inward movement towards off stump. Buttler stays slightly leg-side of the ball and defends into the covers"
"full, a bit of width, and even though there's some outswing it's too full to trouble Buttler even though this drive - to thje left of the diving extra-cover fielder - is more about hands than feet. Lovely hands, though"
on the pads now and Buttler flicks it away to the square leg boundary to bring up England's fifty
"length ball angling into off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to mid-on"
"back of a length on middle and off, straightens just a touch, defended to short extra-cover"
"length ball on off stump, defended to mid-off"
"length ball on middle and leg, Stokes lets it come to him and plays it into the square-leg region with a straight bat"
"excellent delivery. Slants across Stokes, brings him half-forward, and straightens in the fifth-stump channel. Good leave from Stokes, and a good take from Pant, who watched it all the way and adjusted to some extra late swing to his right"
"fuller now, a bit closer to off stump, defended to mid-off"
"good length, pitching marginally outside off and continuing with the angle. The last two balls swung back in. Stokes watches it well and leaves it alone"
"wow. Extremely late swing again, after Stokes leaves one that straightens in the fifth-stump corridor. It starts bending away to the keeper's right when it's about two feet from him, and he can't quite collect cleanly with his diving effort"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"good ball, fuller, pitching on off stump and continuing on with that angle, left alone"
"ooh, past the edge now. Excellent length again, and this time he pitches it closer to the batsman, around middle stump, and gets it to nip away slightly to exaggerate the angle across and beat the outside edge as he props forward to defend"
"length ball finishing on middle and off, defended to midwicket"
"past the edge again! The line has been excellent right through this over, and again he forced him to play by pitching it within the stumps. That ball to Jennings, which came back in a long way, must be in the minds of every left-hand batsman who faces Bumrah now, forcing them to play at balls they might otherwise have left. This one nips away slightly and beats the edge again"
"back of a length, a touch wider, left alone"
"back of a length, a bit of inward movement from a fifth-stump line. Buttler leaves, pulling his gloves out of the way"
"some outswing this time. Good length, starts just outside off and starts swinging just about early enough for Buttler to leave without too many second thoughts"
"ooh, <b>did that carry?</b> A bit of outswing, starting very close to off stump, and Buttler decides late to leave it. Hits the bottom of his bat just as he's beginning to lift it over his head, and it dies towards Pant just as he's rising the other way. Has to bring his gloves down in a hurry to adjust, and he can't hold on. It did carry, so it has to count as a <b>drop</b>"
"length ball close to off stump, punched through cover point"
"length ball swings into middle stump, clipped away through square leg"
"what a delivery! This swings away from the left-hander, and is on a fullish length and tight with off stump so he has to play at it. The swing, and the extra bounce, open him up, and send Pant flying to his left to collect it"
"length ball angling in sharply towards middle stump, clipped through backward square leg"
"length ball, pitching on off stump and continuing with the angle away. Left alone"
"back of a length on middle and off, defended back to the bowler"
"appeal for lbw as Stokes plays down the wrong line, looking to defend towards mid-on. Ball beats his outside edge and hits back thigh pad, but it clearly pitched outside leg"
"fuller now, close to off stump, defended to mid-off"
"shuffles out of his crease to get closer to the pitch of this length ball slanting across towards off stump. Defends with soft hands into the leg side, and that will be lunch"
"full, 85mph and swinging away as Buttler leans forward and leaves alone"
"pitched up in the channel again, another outswinger and there's again no stroke"
"shuffle into line, Shami puts the ball on a length outside off, no stroke offered"
"excellent carry from a length, flying through to be taken at head height as Buttler presses forward and lets it go"
"this swings and draws a false stroke from Buttler, playing across the line - <b>but the edge flies through vacant gully</b> and disappears for four down to third man! Streaky"
pitched up and blocked on the front foot
"round the wicket, tossed up and met on the front foot"
"straighter line, Stokes goes back in the crease and taps down to the leg side"
"flighted, slightly wider and tapped away"
"skip down to a quicker delivery and stuns it towards mid-off, no chance of a run, though"
tossed up wide of the stumps and spinning away as Stokes leaves
"there's Ashwin's arm ball, almost a swing delivery with the seam upright and the ball drifting in as Stokes rocks back... and pummels it through mid-on for four! Not sure he quite spotted the variation, but managed to get hold of the shot all right"
"pitched up and driven, Buttler strokes a crisp drive fine of mid-off, Pandy giving chase gamely to prevent four"
"in the channel, holding its line and left alone"
"full and tempting, 86mph and <b>Buttler steers a fat edge to third slip!</b> Kohli grabs a sharp chance to his right and England are five down! That dismissal <i>can</i> go down to batsman error, a pitch-up ball but it swung enough, loose from Buttler as he reached for the drive, India gobble up another"
"banged in short, Moeen flinches underneath the ball"
"fuller, 87mph on the stumps, defended stoutly into the on side"
"excellent length from Shami, 87mph and nibbling in as Moeen pokes from the crease, hit on the back pad but it falls safely"
"starts over the wicket to Stokes, who lets the ball go as it swings away towards the cordon"
"full, 83mph in the channel, Stokes presses out on to the front foot and lets it go"
"angled across outside off, good length but he knows it is leaving him and plays no stroke"
"tighter line but again the shape is towards the slips, Stokes stays back and lets it go"
"Ishant is just a touch short here, line outside off and Stokes can drop into the crease and leave fairly comfortably"
"round the wicket now, pitched up and seaming away as Stokes gets forward and shoulders arms again"
"full and swinging down the leg side as Moeen flicks at it, Pant springs across but can't hold on and they run a bye"
"good length outside off, 86mph and zipping through nicely, left alone"
"pitched up a bit further, a touch wide and Stokes gets across, shoulders arms again"
"hits a length, 87mph and swerving away, no need to play at that"
back of a length and nudged off the hip for a single
"goes round the wicket now, full and shaping away as Moeen steps out and lets it go"
"angled in from round the wicket, Stokes lines this up"
"slightly shorter length, holding its line around off stump, Stokes squares up in defence"
"attacking the stumps, back of a length but curving menacingly as Stokes stays back and blocks"
"shortish, 82mph and Stokes waits for it again, defends to the on side"
gets across on off stump and pushes down into the leg side again
"draws him forward, edged to slip, <b>but taken on the bounce!</b> Stokes actually played it well, soft hands as the ball left him, directed the ball down a few feet in front of Kohli, who snapped it up smartly again"
"late wobble from Shami as the ball zips through outside off, Pant has to follow it closely but does well"
"full, 88mph and swerving away, wide enough for Moeen to leave alone as Pant again has to muddy his knees for the take"
"in the channel, Moeen dabs through gully, stays on top of the ball and opens the face for his first runs"
whipped for four off the pads! Shami's line strays a touch ans Stokes clips it firmly past square leg and into the open acres
"vroom! The outswinger has hooped away from Pant, giving him no chance as the slips backed off, the ball disappears to the third man boundary for byes. Tough gig, keeping"
"full and shaping, Stokes feels for the ball, <b>again finds the edge but lands short of gully!</b> More pursed lips among the India players"
Moeen comes across and lets the ball go
pitched up and left alone in the channel
presses out on to the front foot and gets bat on ball in defence this time
"touch back of a length, 83mph and hitting the label of the bat as Moeen dabs it down"
"ooh, he turns him around here, Moeen closing the face and squirting an edge towards gully... again lands safely"
pushed in with the arm and Moeen tucks it down safely
"full and wide of the stumps, punched to cover coming across"
"in the channel, appreciable away-swing for Shami, Stokes leaves it be"
"lovely bowling, he lands this in a <i>gooooooooooddddd</I> area and then decks it away from Stokes, who prods at it in vain and is beaten"
"full on middle and off, Stokes crashes a drive back down the track - and Shami takes a whack on the bowling hand as he reaches down to stop it in his follow through. Yowch"
"pitched up and swinging back in this time, as Stokes steps forward and punches aggressively to cover"
worked wide of mid-on and Stokes hustles them through for a single to keep the strike
"pitched up and tapped into the covers, early shout of 'No!' from Stokes"
"good line, straightening outside off as Stokes leans out and shoulders arms"
"steps out of his crease early, Ishant hits a length on off stump and Stokes cushions it into a gap for one"
"pushed in a touch too straight, Moeen flicks it away through backward square leg"
"disciplined line and length outside off, Stokes lets it go"
"length ball, 83mph a foot outside off stump, no shot offered"
"oof, superb line from Shami, this kicks and spits past the outside edge as Moeen pushes forward louchely"
on the pads this time and Moeen can tickle one square to scamper off strike
Stokes lets another one go in the channel
"wicked in-ducker from Shami, Stokes is tucked up and thumped on the pad... and up goes Oxenford's finger! Stokes will <b>review</b>, hoping that all the angles don't line up against him, but the odds look slim. Yep, <b>that's hitting middle and leg!</b> Stokes wasn't far enough forward to get outside the line, the ball whistled back in past the inside edge and pinned him like a butterfly on a collector's board"
"slightly back of a length outside off, Curran taps it down towards point and pinches one"
"dug in, sits Moeen back on his haunches"
"good length on middle and off, Curran blocks it stoutly from the crease"
"pitched up, swinging late but driven sweetly back down the pitch by Curran, Ishant collapses like a felled oak to grab the ball in his follow through"
full and this is slapped through the covers for a punchy brace to Curran
"Ishant continues to pitch it up, looking for movement, driven along the carper towards mid-off"
"over the wicket now, angled across, good length delivery and left alone"
"length on off stump, 84mph and punched back down the track"
length ball slanting across and ending up close to off stump but just about far enough for it for Moeen to leave it alone
"follows up with the attempted bouncer, but it ends up well wide of off stump. Moeen has a slash at it, had to reach out a long way, and fails to connect - an edge might have left him looking rather silly"
"back of a length on middle and off, defended back to the bowler"
"ooh, good ball. He's been getting a bit of shape into the left-handers, and this one slants across, lands on a good length on off stump, and just leaves him marginally, off the pitch. The line forced Moeen into a little push at the ball, and the movement beat his edge"
"back of a length, a touch wider, left alone"
"ooh, this time the ball does swing back in, and it lands on a nice length too, but the line starts just wide enough outside off for Moeen to leave it alone. Testing stuff from Shami"
"length ball, pitching on off stump and angling further away, left alone"
"short and wide, and that's an excellent stop from Rahane at cover, dives to his left to stop a full-blooded back-foot slap from Curran"
"fuller length again, pitches just outside off and continues with the angle across. Curran leaves again"
"full, just outside off, driven into the gap to the left of cover. This time Rahane can't quite get to it with his dive"
length ball close to off stump. Comes forward to defend and gets a thickish outside edge that rolls away to the left of fourth slip
"back of a length, straightens a touch towards middle and leg to cramp Curran as he gets on his toes and punches to short cover"
"back of a length, a bit of width, and Moeen welcomes it. Punches it away to the right of backward point. Was playing away from his body there, trusting his hands"
"back of a length on off stump, defended towards mid-off"
"ooh, streaky. England bring up 100. In-between length, angling across to the top of off stump. Doesn't get his back foot across to defend and ends up edging thickly, wide of third slip"
"back of a length, straightens a little in the corridor outside off and Moeen leaves alone"
"there's the bouncer, doesn't rise particularly steeply over leg stump and Moeen has to crouch extremely low to get under it"
"full outside off - Shami was hoping he'd be slow getting forward to drive after being pushed back by the bouncer, and he was right. Moeen ends up slicing it to backward point instead of hitting it through cover as intended, but it's all along the ground"
"short and wide and Curran stands tall and cracks it away to the backward point boundary. Second time he's erred on the short side in his last two overs, Pandya"
"overpitches now, on middle and off, and Curran shows the full face to drive it back down the ground, to the left of mid-off"
"shortish, some width once more. India have sent a man back on the backward point boundary and Curran punches it solidly to his left"
bowls short and wide again - very wide this time - and Curran has to reach out too far to cut. Can't make contact
"length ball, fairly wide of off stump, left alone"
"wide length ball and Curran drives hard, away from his body. Ends up slicing it in the air, too far to the right of deep backward point for the fielder there - Jadeja - to be able to cut it off. What's more, Pandya's overstepped too"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, defended to mid-off"
"ooh, this one nips back nearly as much as the one that dismissed Jennings, but it's much shorter, and Moeen leaves on length, pulling his hip out of the way and letting the ball pass over the stumps"
"back of a length, this one goes with the angle across the left-hander, after pitching on or around off stump. Left alone once more"
"another leave, the length isn't quite full enough to make Moeen play, and the line on this occasion was a touch too wide too"
"better. A little fuller, pitching on off stump and slanting away with that exaggerated angle. Left alone"
"shot! This is good batting from Moeen, he left four balls in a row, and waited for one error in length. Gets it now, as Bumrah drops a little short and ends up offering plenty of width. Gets up on his toes and cuts it away to the point boundary"
"makes the immediate adjustment and beats the bat. Lovely delivery, on a fullish length and pitching on middle and off, forcing Moeen to play. This one nips away slightly and zips past the edge. Moeen was looking to defend this towards mid-on, and his bat came down at an angle"
"starts with the one that goes with the angle. A touch short, and Curran goes back and works it away, off his hip, through square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, the arm ball, swinging into the left-hander. Goes back and works it to deep midwicket"
"fuller length now, another arm ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"back of a length, angling into off and middle, clipped to midwicket"
"another arm ball, going towards leg stump and cramping the batsman for room as he goes back to defend"
"tossed up slower, on off and middle, defended back to the bowler off the front foot"
"back of a length, pitching within the stumps and slanting away. Left alone"
"back of a length, this one pitches on off stump and keeps angling away. Moeen leaves again"
"fuller now, another good leave from Moeen. Pitched on off stump again and Moeen watched it well"
"length ball, this one straightens in a touch but into the pads. Clipped to midwicket"
"lovely bowling. Bowls it much fuller and gets some swing away from the left-hander. Pitches just outside off stump, and by that time it's already moved away from its initial line. Moeen aims a drive towards mid-off and is beaten by a long way"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the on side"
tossed up on off stump. Clipped firmly down the ground and Ashwin stops it with his left hand
"beauty. Dangled up much slower, on off stump, and it dips down shorter than Curran expects as he reaches in front of his body to drive without getting a proper stride in. Aims at mid-off and ends up edging towards backward point"
"short, a bit of width, cut firmly to backward point"
"flatter length ball sliding on towards off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"tossed up slower on leg stump, gets a bit of turn. Curran's bat came down at an angle as he aimed to defend into the on side, and he gets a thick outside edge that rolls into the covers"
"full on off stump, driven back firmly to the bowler"
"digs it in short, gets it up to about stomach height on off stump. Controls the pull nicely down to long leg"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"back of a length, a bit of swing away from the left-hander, towards his off stump. Gets nicely back and across to defend towards mid-on"
"back of a length, a touch too straight, clipped off the hip to the right of midwicket"
"ooh, there's the one that comes into the left-hander. From just back of a length, straightens from around middle and leg, and Moeen does well to watch it and jam his bat down to defend into the covers"
"wow, this is excellent stuff. Having just cramped him with the incoming ball, he gets one to nip away from pretty much the same spot on the pitch. Moeen jabs at it - who wouldn't? - and he's lucky not to get any bat on it"
"back of a length on middle and off, goes back and across and works it into the square-leg region"
"good ball, flatter and quicker and going with the angle towards off stump. Comes forward and defends into the on side"
"tossed up slower now, outside off, inviting the drive away from the body. Moeen leaves it alone"
"there's the swinging arm ball, bowls it full and wide outside off. Goes for the flat-bat drive through cover, ends up inside-edging into the leg side"

"full now, gets some swing away from the left-hander, from a middle-stump line. Gets forward to block into the covers"
"ooh, this is a dangerous spell from Bumrah. Good length, gets this to swing in late and straighten towards middle stump. Gets his front leg out of the way and brings a straight bat down to defend towards mid-off"
"length ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"there's the bouncer, and that's not a particularly well-controlled hook from Moeen. Bumrah's angle gets it up over Moeen's left shoulder, and he top-edges the hook to the left of long leg and it carries all the way"
"back of a length, leaves the batsman from an off-stump line and Moeen plays and misses. This is riveting stuff"

"back of a length, down the leg side again. Curran can't connect with the flick off the hip"
"good length, swings across the stumps and ends up just outside off. Curran stays on the back foot and defends into the covers"
"back of a length, down the leg side again. Curran misses the glance off his hip. I wonder if he sees Curran shuffling across a little and is looking to bowl him around his legs. More likely it's just an error in line"
"nicely flighted outside off, and Moeen - for the third time - leaves it alone"
"shifts his line towards middle stump, and Moeen lets it come on and defends with the turn"

"nice length on off stump, draws Moeen forward to defend into the covers"
"tossed up outside off, driven to short extra-cover. I think this was the arm ball"
"length ball on middle and off, pushed off the back foot towards mid-off and there's a bit of confusion as Curran calls for the single. Moeen didn't want it at first, and Curran hesitated too, before they ended up going for it. A quicker fielder than Ashwin may have closed in on the ball in less time. Curran still had to dive to make his crease, but it was academic since the underarm flick missed the stumps. Brings up the 50 partnership"
"length ball on leg stump, clipped to deep backward square leg"

"back of a length on off stump, punched to mid-off"

"raps the pads, Ashwin goes up for lbw... but Dharmasena shakes his head after deliberating for a while. India <b>review</b>, though it had to be turning quite a lot to hit leg stump firmly enough to overturn the on-field decision.

"tossed up straight, Moeen goes for the slog-sweep... <b>but the top edge is pouched by Bumrah running in at midwicket!</b> There's the partnership-breaker, Moeen falls trying to take on the spinner. Not a great shot, but the ball nearly landed safely, Bumrah had to cover some distance before sliding to hold the catch"
"Ashwin implores for an lbw decision, as Curran sticks out a pad... No shot, so doesn't matter it was outside the line, but don't think it was going to the stumps"

"gottim, <b>trapped by the inswinger!</b> England have no reviews, so Rashid has to accept Bruce Oxenford's decision and walk off, but that looked pretty adjacent... Full and curling in like cigar smoke, thunking the front pad, almost certainly hitting/clipping leg"

"ooh, finds the edge, but it runs away wide of slip. Flight and dip outside off stump and Curran pokes hesitantly at it, not having gotten close enough to the pitch of the ball to play a more decisive shot. Well wide of Rahane diving to his left, though"
"full and flat on leg stump, defended into the on side"
"a bit of flight again, on middle stump, and Curran clears his front leg to swipe this away between midwicket and mid-on. Didn't really middle it, dragged it with the inside half of his bat"

"a bit of swing in towards Broad's pads and he flicks but flicks too early. Pops it up in the air, but into the vacant region wide of mid-on"

"shot! Pandya bangs it in short, and slants it a fair distance outside off. Curran steps across and pulls it to the right of deep square leg"
"arm ball, Broad misses the sweep, and Bruce Oxenford shakes his head when they go up in appeal for lbw. Hit him on the back leg, but impact seemed to be outside off. India, however, have reviewed this... Didn't seem to be any bat on it, and Ultra Edge confirms it. Where's the impact? A couple of inches outside off stump"

"another bouncer, angling in a little further. Ducks and lets it pass over his back"

"short, wide, slices it with an open face, a little uppishly, down to third man"
"gets this to swing in sharply and beat the inside edge as Broad flicks from the crease, but none of Shami's team-mates join him in appeal for lbw. It was clearly headed down leg"
"goes full, possibly some sort of slower ball on middle stump. Goes for the drive, ends up playing early, and scoops it high in the air, but straight back over the bowler, and neither mid-on nor mid-off is close enough to do anything about it"
"shot! That was a good-length ball slanting marginally wide of off stump, and he leans back and slaps it away crisply to beat third man to his left"
"length ball slanting across to off stump. Stays back again, looking to dab behind point. Ends up inside-edging into his feet, and the ball rolls into the off side to get him the single he was looking for"

"fullish, angling into middle stump. Stays leg-side of the ball and pushes towards mid-off with soft hands"
"big appeal for lbw, and Kumar Dharmasena did not hesitate for a moment. I wonder about the height, though. Actually, no. Broad was playing back to a good length ball that came back in sharply, and ended up playing down the wrong line of it. Looked plumb on second viewing"
"starts the over with a bouncer, correctly predicting he would move leg-side to make himself room. Curran ducks hurriedly to evade it"
"shortish, slanting away from off stump. Steps across to try and scoop/pull over backward square leg, but he can't connect"
"slower ball, full, on off stump, and Curran watched it well and maintained his shape to clear his front leg and flat-bat it back over the umpire's head. Such a clean strike"

and Bumrah ends the over with a sharp bouncer over off stump. Not much Curran can do but duck under it
"full outside off, defended to silly point"
"Pant is having a terrible time behind the stumps today. Ends up drifting down leg and Anderson misses the flick but gets a tickle of pad on it. Pant jumps across, unsighted, and the ball nutmegs him, allowing Curran to get back on strike"
"flat length ball on off stump, makes room to flat-bat to long-off. Refuses the single"
"bowled him, and England are bowled out for 246. Clears his front leg to try and launch this over midwicket. Ashwin slows it down just enough, and he ends up swinging too early, and losing middle stump"
"starts with the away-swinger to the left-hander, starting outside off and swinging further away. A relatively straightforward leave"
"a little fuller, but again the over-the-wicket angle combined with the swing takes it well outside off stump, and Dhawan can leave without too much discomfort"
"a little closer to off stump and Dhawan gets his front foot across and thinks of playing at it before pulling his bat inside, away from the line"
and again. This one's a little shorter and curves away wider
"another away-swinger, starts on a fifth-stump line and Dhawan leaves again"
"full, closer to off stump, stabbed to backward point with an open bat face"
"ooh, excellent delivery to start. On the fuller side of a good length, straightens ever so slightly towards off stump. Defended back towards the bowler"
"gets it to straighten again, and strikes back pad as Rahul's bat comes down at an angle in defence - from second slip towards wide mid-on. Bit of an appeal for lbw, but they know it's too high"
"full now, down the leg side, and Rahul misses the flick"
"full again, down the leg side again"
"length ball, fifth-stump channel, left alone"
"yikes. After two down the leg side, he whangs one waaaay wide of off stump, totally losing his action, and forcing Buttler to dive across almost in front of second slip"
"length ball close to off stump, straightens late and Rahul plays it with soft hands, meeting it right under his eye, and the ball rolls away wide of the cordon, all along the ground, off the outside half of his bat"

"a bit fuller, starts shaping away from a fifth-stump line, and Rahul leaves again"
"back of a length, a bit wider, left alone once more"
"fuller now, on middle stump, gets his front pad out of the way and defends towards mid-on"
"full outside off, a bit of outswing, but Rahul is confidently forward, gets his head over the ball, and eases a drive to the left of extra-cover. Didn't look to hit it too hard"
"back of a length close to off stump, straightens just a touch. Dhawan lets it come on and defends into the covers, staying slightly leg-side of the ball"
"ooh, good ball. Fullish outside off, draws Rahul forward to defend, and gets it to nip away off the seam. Rahul defends with soft hands, pulling his bottom hand off his handle, and the ball runs away to the right of the diving fourth slip fielder"
"length ball, this one comes in with the angle towards off stump. Defended into the covers"
"back of a length wide of off stump. Leaves it alone, and now it's Buttler's turn to be undone by late swing. Throws himself to his right and the ball bounces off his gloves and runs away to the third man boundary. Cook gave chase and attempted to pull it back with a slide near the ropes, but couldn't quite manage it"
"ooh, good ball. Gets it to straighten after angling in and pitching on a good length on leg stump. Almost ends up closing his bat face on it too early and missing entirely, but slows his bat-speed just enough to get a leading edge on it. Rolls away into the covers."
full outside off. Gets a good stride out to defend and the ball rolls off the outside half of the bat to the right of backward point
"and Rahul will have nothing to do with it. It's full, it's on a sixth-stump line, and Rahul takes a big stride forward and lifts his bat over his head"
"back of a length, swinging across the stumps, pitching on off stump, and continuing to veer away from the left-hander. Dhawan leaves it alone"
"another outswinger to the left-hander, a little fuller. Dhawan presses forward and deliberately defends a long way inside the line - he had no intention of playing that ball"
"even fuller now, outside off. Dhawan gets a decent stride forward and goes for the drive, but doesn't go too hard at it. Slides off the outside half of the bat wide of fourth slip"
"on the pads now, clipped into the square-leg region. Thinks of running a third but Rahul sends him back"
"another outswinger on a fullish length, pitching just outside off, left alone - from over the wicket, it seems to me like the swing is starting too early, and Dhawan can leave much easier than if Anderson were to go round the wicket and angle it into the left-hander first"
"back of a length now. Pitches a little closer to off stump but again it swings early enough for Dhawan to leave safely, without too much hesitation"
"ooh, that's an area he needs to be careful about. Full outside off and Rahul goes for an angled-bat drive - the shot often gets him out early in his innings. This time he inside-edges it into his front pad and it rolls into the cover region"
"shot. A touch too full outside off, and he gets forward and eases a drive into the cover point region. He let it come to him, and met it under his eyes"
"better length, along a similar line outside off, left alone"
"good ball, gets it to leave the batsman off the pitch, from a good length, but the line is a touch too wide to make Dhawan play"
"back of a length, again he gets it to leave the batsman off the surface, and again it's a little too wide to make Dhawan play"
"and once again, a slightly fuller length but the line is too far outside off stump to interest Dhawan"
"ooh, testing ball to start, the inswinger homing in on the top of off stump. Rahul gets his front pad out of the way and defends into the mid-on region"
"back of a length, another inswinger, starts fairly wide of off stump and finishes in the fourth-stump channel. Good leave - it's possible he trusted the bounce and left on length"
"shot! That's a pretty good length, and Anderson finds some outswing from around off stump. Rahul gets back and across and punches it firmly into the cover point region. Sweet, sweet timing"
"ooh, dangerous. Took a step forward and across and Anderson got this inswinger to come in quite sharply, towards middle stump. Ended up having to play around his front pad to clip that round to deep backward square leg"
"and again, the inswinger attacking middle stump, pretty full. I'm not sure he intended to play that to long leg. Played slightly down the wrong line, looking for a push towards mid-on, and got a thick inside edge"
bit of an appeal for lbw as Anderson starts this outswinger from around leg stump and beats the outside edge of Dhawan's defensive bat. Hit on the back thigh - seemed likely to go over the stumps
"full, close to off stump, defended to mid-off"
"big appeal for lbw, and Broad starts celebrating before appealing. A bit of hesitation from Kumar Dharmasena before he raises his finger. No hesitation from Rahul in reviewing. A good inswinger, but was it a bit high, perhaps? Seemed to hit him slightly above the knee-roll, in line with middle and off stumps, and according to ball-tracking that would have hit a good portion of the top of middle stump. Good decision from Dharmasena. Rahul didn't really get a stride in as he came forward to defend, and the ball swung past his inside edge. Didn't really get his front leg that far in front of the crease. Not the first time he's been out to the incoming ball in this series. England have attacked this weakness relentlessly"
"full, angling into middle stump. Clipped to square leg"
"length ball, a bit of swing in towards middle stump, defended towards mid-on"
"again, good length, homing in on middle stump. Defended towards midwicket"
"good change-up, length ball in the channel outside off. Pujara leaves, while 'playing' a defensive shot inside the line, protecting his stumps should the ball swing in late"
"back of a length, swings away from Dhawan after pitching on leg stump or thereabouts. Hits high on the thigh pad as he's turned around slightly and beaten in defence"
"back of a length, again it swings away from around leg stump. Looks to wait and play with the swing towards point, ends up inside-edging into pad"
"fuller, swings away from around middle and off. Good leave"
"ooh, <b>lucky</b>. A fullish ball just outside off, draws Dhawan forward to push into the covers. Nips back in off the seam and he inside-edges it past leg stump. Looked like he bowled it cross-seam"
"back to back beauties. This one goes in the other direction, off the seam again, and beats the outside edge. Starts on a good length close to off stump and makes Dhawan play"
"back of a length close to off stump, pushed gently into the cover region"
"full, angling in towards off stump, defended towards mid-off"
"length ball, fourth-stump channel. Pujara waits, stays leg-side of the ball, and dabs towards that deepish backward point with an open face"
"good short ball, rising up towards Pujara's left ribcage. Gets on his toes and fends at it, takes the bottom hand to keep the ball down in front of square leg"
"good length, some late movement in to beat the inside edge of Pujara's defensive bat. Didn't really get forward or back, but it hit him high on the back thigh and no one really appealed"
"nice length, angling in towards off stump, defended to mid-on"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"leg-side length ball, flicks off the pads behind square leg"
gets some extra bounce from just short of a good length and hits the high part of the back pad
off the mark with a fuller delivery that angles into the pads and is clipped through square leg
"full, curves in towards middle and leg, and Pujara closes the face to clip it towards short midwicket"
"short of good length around the fourth-stump channel, moves minimally as he defends it into the pitch off the inside part of the bat"
"stays stapled to the crease and gets an edge after the ball straightens, falls short of the cordon. Played that with soft hands to minimise the damage"
"shortish, angling into the front hip. Closes his bat face early while trying to work it square, and the leading edge pops up a short distance into the mid-off region"
"fullish, leaving the batsman off the pitch from a fairly wide line. Good leave from Dhawan - Broad was trying to draw him into a drive away from his body, but it wasn't quite on a drive-able length"
"back of a length, a little closer to off stump. Another good leave"
this time Broad goes full and wide and gets pronounced swing away from the left-hander. Starts a little too wide to draw Dhawan into the drive
"too full, on middle and leg, and Dhawan times this clip brilliantly to beat long leg to his left"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone. Broad's getting it to shape away from the left-hander pretty consistently here, but he isn't making Dhawan play enough just yet"
"good leave. Nice length, straightens late and not too far outside off stump"
"fuller now, Pujara gets forward, lets it swing back in, and defends into the extra-cover region. Played that quite a long way from his body"
"nice length, slants it across to just outside off stump, and gets it to straighten in late. Better stride across this time, defends into the point region"
"ooh, well bowled. Slants it across again, into that fourth-stump channel, but this time it doesn't swing in as much. Pujara watches it closely and leaves it alone"
"a touch shorter, close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"back of a length on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"back of a length, finds some shape away from a fifth-stump line, left alone"
"full now, again on that wide-ish line, Dhawan leaves again. He's been resisting the drive over the last few overs"
"back of a length, angles this in from a little wider on the crease. Starts fairly wide again, though, and Dhawan leaves again"
"lovely length outside off, full but not full enough to drive, and some shape away too. The line's a touch too wide to make Dhawan play, though"
"excellent leave again. Angles this in much closer to off stump, but again Dhawan isn't drawn into playing - he sees the length and trusts the bounce, and probably also judges that the line was still slightly outside off"
"ooh, what happened there? Did Dhawan close his bat face too early? Broad angled this into the stumps, bowled it fuller, and beat Dhawan's flick. There's a big appeal for lbw, and also for a catch at slip as the ball lobbed up to Alastair Cook. Kumar Dharmasena is unmoved, however, and England review. Excellent decision from Dharmasena. The ball nipped away from Dhawan, bounced extra, beat the outside edge as he closed his bat face early, and hit the back thigh pad before popping up to slip. Impact seemed to be outside off too, and the ball was going over the height of the stumps too"
"good length, shaping back in towards off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"a touch shorter and wider than the previous one. Pujara goes into a forward press, waits, and defends into the covers. Curran's lack of pace is giving him plenty of time to adjust, so far"
"back of a length, swings in towards middle and leg, clipped to square leg"
"good ball, this. Bangs it in short, and gets it to rise steeply over off stump. Pujara sways out of the way"
"back of a length, swings towards Pujara's left hip. Misses the flick, the ball hits thigh pad"
"fullish, swinging in towards middle stump. Pujara does well to keep his front pad away from the line as he comes forward to push towards mid-off"
"oooh, beauty! Finally he hits that off-stump line and gets the ball to leave Dhawan off the pitch. Just back of a length, and Dhawan is opened up and beaten on the outside edge"
interesting. Dhawan charges out of his crease. Not sure if the intent was attacking or to get closer to the pitch of the ball to narrow the angle of the movement. Broad bowls a wide length ball and Dhawan leaves it alone
"back of a length, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"full outside off, close enough for Dhawan to get forward and play the checked drive to the right of cover. Again, he waited until the ball came to him - didn't go reaching for it"
"back of a length, wide of off stump, left alone"
"back of a length, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"shortish, slanting into the channel close to off stump. Pujara lifts his bat over his head and leaves it alone"
"back of a length, a touch too straight, tucked away to the right of square leg"
"back of a length outside off, a bit of shape away, Dhawan ignores it"
"a bit fuller, slanting towards leg stump and straightening slightly with extra bounce. Dhawan misses the flick and the ball hits high on his pad"
"back of a length on middle and leg, straightens slightly, tucked off the hip into the backward square leg region"
"fullish outside off, defended to short cover - again he played slightly away from his body"
"round the wicket, good length outside off but Dhawan doesn't need to play"
"bit tighter to the off stump, 84mph and holding its line, again he lets it go"
"pitched up, Dhawan shuffles into line and shoulders arms"
"Broad continues to plug away in the corridor, more watchful stuff from Shikhar"
"full, tempting... <b>and Dhawan takes the bait!</b> All that self-denial, but he can't override those natural instincts to feel bat on ball. Still, it was a super line from Broad, just pushed in towards off and then snaking away, kissing the edge before settling in Buttler's gloves as he went low to his left"
"over the wicket, hits a length aiming for the top of off, Kohli shows it the full face coming forward. Bring. It. On"
"Curran whirs in like an angry sprite, digs the ball in back of a length, Pujara defends on the back foot"
presses forward on off and blocks
"swinging in, nicely played off the pads for a couple through backward square leg"
"pitched up on middle and off, Puj defends coming forwards"
"dragged down a touch, 79mph and there's room for Pujara to free the arms, but he picks out backward point"
"pitched up and now Che Puj does cash in, well forward and the ball is splunked satisfyingly through point for a driven four"
"woof, fetch that! Touch overpitched from Broad but Kohli pounces like a cobra and drills four through cover point to get off the mark"
"shortens his length, this is cushioned neatly down into the off side for one"
"oi vey, that's a bit streaky! Angled bat to a rising ball in the channel, Pujara gets away with a thick top edge over the cordon for four"
"length ball, tight line on off stump, back to blocking"
"fourth-stump line, again Pujara is forward in defence"
"full again and this is tickled back down the ground, not the meatiest connection but he gets a couple more"
"good length, shaping in on off stump, Kohli is quickly forward and blocks into the off side"
"pushed across in the channel, lets this one go"
"length, curling in, 82mph and defended with Kohli again on the move"
"fullish, under the nose as Kohli gets across and lets the ball go in the channel"
"shorter, swinging but down the leg side"
"full on off, Kohli is on the front foot and jams down on it, to complete a maiden over... and remain on 5999 Test runs"
"starts on a good length outside off, Puj watches it through"
"little bit of shape away but it's wide, Pujara gets into line and leaves"
"pitched up, this is met coming forward and dabbed for a single in front of point"
"hits a length and gets it to hold a line, Kohli is forward and lets it go"
"ooh, draws the drive, thick-edged low and wide of the slips, that will run away for four - <b>and takes Kohli past 6000 runs in Tests!</b>"
gets into line and lets the ball go again
"Curran probes away in the channel, no stroke required"
tighter line and Pujara is forward to defend on off stump
"bangs in the bumper, only a lickle 'un, though, and Pujara can pull comfortably for a single"
"pitched up around the line of off stump, pushed towards mid-off"
"good length, 81mph on the stumps, Kohli starts to bring the bat down at an angle before pushing into the off side"
"floated up in the channel, lets this one go"
"short and wide, and dispatched with aplomb by Puj! A chunky cut for four, just what that ball deserved"
drifts into the pads this time and it's worked for a couple through midwicket
"length delivery, 85mph and nipping away sharply, but wide enough for Pujara to ignore"
"slightly closer to off and holding its line, watched closely and left alone"
"pitched up, 81mph and driven without timing to mid-off"
"slightly back of a length, defended coming across on off"
"pitched up, Kohli flashes at the ball, not in control as <b>a thick edge flies behind gully</b> and away for four. Squirted tantalisingly between two men, but he gets away with it"
straighter line and this is worked off the pads for one
"Curran goes round the wicket to Pujara, gets the ball to straighten away from him, wide enough to leave"
"this change of angle has given Pujara something new to think about, he starts to feel for a length ball a foot outside off, again holding its line... but manages to prevent himself committing fully as it zips through"
"pitched up, but that's a half-volley as Pujara steps out, strokes a couple more through the covers"
"full length again, 84mph and punched to mid-off this time"
"pitched up, Kohli is forward and <i>creams</i> a cover drive, superb timing and it blows the substitute fielder a raspberry as it rolls into the rope ahead of his vain dive"
"pushed down the leg side as Kohli comes across, flicks and misses"
"length outside off, he only half plays at this but manages to deflect it down into the crease"
"length ball, 84mph on a fourth-stump line, blocked"
"this comes back in and Kohli is not quite in the right position to play it, maybe some inside edge before it hits high on the back leg"
"pitched up a touch, takes the inside edge and runs away for one on the leg side"
"length ball, 76mph around off stump, diligently tapped away"
"into the pads, England go up in half an appeal for lbw... but it looked a touch high and leg side, Oxenford unmoved"
"full and tailing in, 75mph and worked down into the leg side"
"ooh, that's gone wrong, short and wide outside off, Kohli hangs out the bat but seems to abort the shot at the last minute as Buttler sticks out a paw"
"swing for Jennings, but drifting down the leg side"
pitched up and clipped off the pads for one
"tosses up the googly and Kohli tries to wrist this away to leg, clips the inside edge and loops off the pad... but there's no one at silly point, for what would have been a dolly of a catch"
"flighted, comes forward and punches into the covers, where Anderson misfields... and then there's an overthrow into the bargain, too. Dear me"
"Rashidf lobs up the legbreak outside the line of off, left alone"
reaches out and taps towards mid-off
"another Bosie, played off the back foot this time, worked for one through midwicket"
"nicely flighted, outside off and spinning away as Pujara sticks out his front pad"
pitched up and dead-batted into the off side
drifting in with the arm and worked away to the leg side for a single
Pujara watches this through to the keeper outside off
"pitched up in the corridor, 78mph and into the gloves as Pujara leaves"
touch straighter and blocked form the crease
"drops short and this is punched crisply off the back foot, gets it away through point though Bairstow hunts it down in front of the rope"
"looped up outside off, Kohli gets forward and drives without timing towards mid-off"
"flighted, outside off and turning through, no stroke offered"
tossed up and blocked around the line of off
"Rashid lets go a full toss, which Kohli kindly bunts through the covers to the sweeper for one"
"floated up, a googly outside off and it grubs through at ankle height as Pujara hastily tries to get his bat down on it"
"pushes through another wrong'un, driven square off the back foot for a single <b>that brings up the India 100</b>, to gentle applause around the ground"
"tossed up from over the wicket, Pujara is forward on off stump"
"quicker and straighter, defended coming across"
"flattish delivery, Pujara comes a long way down and tries to kick the ball away"
"flighted, this spins in a touch as Pujara again lunges and diverts the ball a few yards in front of short leg"
"floated up and there's again some turn from the footmarks, the ball looping away to safety off bat and pad as Pujara runs down to try and smother the ball"
"pushed through and this is dealt with more assuredly, blocked on the front foot outside off - and that takes India to <b>lunch</b> just two wickets down"
"back of a length, angling into off and middle. Steps across to clip to midwicket"
"length ball close to off stump, lets it come on, plays with soft hands towards backward point, who's quite deep, and calls loudly for a single and starts running. Pujara sends him back with a loud no. There was a single in that, I think"
"length ball, shifts to a sixth-stump line and gets some gentle outswing. Left alone"
"length ball close to off stump, presses forward and pushes to the left of extra-cover and this time they hurry the single. A riskier single than the one Pujara refused, you'd think, and he has to dive to reach the striker's end. Would have been just in had Jennings' throw hit"
"length ball, fourth-stump line again, defended into the covers"
"back of a length in the corridor, gets some extra bounce and a bit of outswing as well. Pujara leaves alone"
"tossed up nicely outside off, stretches out to clip to midwicket"
"ooh, lovely flight and dip, slightly wider outside off. Stretches out to defend and the ball dips, turns, and bounces to go past the inside edge and hit Kohli's front pad, outside the line of off stump"
"fuller now, clipped to long-on"
"big appeal from behind the stumps as Pujara steps out and drives firmly down the ground, past the diving bowler, and hits the stumps at the other end. Not sure if Moeen got his fingers on it, but Kohli was in anyway"
"back of a length, goes deep in his crease and whips to square leg"
"a touch short outside off, goes deep in his crease and cuts to the left of deep point"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, goes on the back foot to defend towards midwicket"
"short outside off, and Broad gets some extra bounce. Pujara likes to cut but it gets a bit big on him and he ends up top-edging high over second slip. Flashed hard, though, and picks up his second boundary in that manner"
"ooh, beauty. Angles this in towards off stump, gets Pujara halfway forward, and gets it to nip away to beat the edge of his defensive bat"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched firmly to cover point"
"ooh, good leave. That's the incoming ball, and it doesn't end up too far outside off, but Pujara sees it's back of a length, and trusts the bounce"
"shortish, a tiny bit of width, Pujara waits, stays leg-side of the ball, and cuts it away to the left of cover point. This wasn't a rank short ball like the one from Anderson that he square-cut earlier"
"floated up wide of off stump, ends up overpitching slightly - plus Kohli's stride is bigger than most - and he drives it out to the fielder at deep point"
tossed up nicely outside off and Pujara skips out to whip it back to the bowler
"down the track again, and this time he has a little more room to whip from outside off to the fielder at deepish mid-on"
"back of a length, turns in towards off stump, goes deep in his crease and clips to deepish mid-on"
"goes back to a length ball that zips in towards middle stump, and has to bring his bat down hurriedly to clip to square leg"
"tossed up wide outside off, Pujara stretches out and pads it away - he knows it isn't yet turning so much to be threatening the stumps from that wide"
"nice length, fifth-stump line, a bit of outswing. Big stride forward for an almost aggresive-looking leave"
"overpitched, close to off stump, Kohli just shows it the full face and sends it racing back between the umpire and the non-striker. Beautiful timing"
"length ball, fourth-stump line, big stride out to defend into the covers"
"ooh, beaten. Lovely length, brings Kohli forward to defend in the fourth-stump channel, and gets late outswing to beat his outside edge"
"again! Similar channel, similarly past the outside edge of his defensive bat, but this time it seemed like seam rather than swing"
"fuller, a little wider, Kohli gets a big stride out to defend to cover point"
"back of a length, turning in towards middle stump. Goes deep and whips to square leg"
"just a touch short, turns in towards off stump, punched with a straight bat towards mid-on"
"flatter, slightly fuller, but Pujara goes deep in his crease once more to tickle it with the turn behind square leg"
"Just marginally short outside off, and Pujara can stay back and clip it with the turn to deep midwicket"
"oh man! Kohli was beaten twice in the last over, and now he edges one between keeper and slip. Dangled up wide of off stump, Kohli stretches out to defend, and maybe the ball doesn't turn as much as expected. The ball shoots  off his edge quickly, just past Buttler's right glove, and a touch too far to Stokes' left for him to dive and catch it"
"quickish, a touch back of a length, goes back and works it from around leg stump through backward square leg"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, good stride forward to defend into the covers"
"length ball angling in towards leg stump, clipped to the left of long leg. The throw from Rashid goes to the non-striker's end, clearly because that's where Pujara is headed"
"full, angling into off stump, clipped to mid-on"
"length ball, fifth-stump channel, zips through with extra bounce after Kohli leaves"
"full outside off, driven to deep point"
"fullish, close to off stump, gets on the front foot to defend it back towards Broad"
"tossed up outside off, Kohli goes back and across and defends with the turn towards mid-on"
floated up wider and Kohli takes a giant stride out to flat-bat a drive to deep point
"nice loop and dip, not too far outside off. Pujara comes forward and defends into the cover region. Saw some late drift and adjusted to it"
a touch shorter and Pujara goes deep in his crease to punch to mid-on
"shot. Flatter, wider, Pujara watches it well, waits, and late-cuts into the third-man region. Kohli drives Pujara to run a third by the time Stokes can chase back, turn, and throw"
back of a length well outside off. Goes back and a long way across to defend into the covers
"big appeal, and Dharmasena says no. Not much of a front-foot stride as Curran angles this in from wide of the crease, hits a nice length, and possibly also gets some inswing. Back thigh, not sure if there was any bat on it. May have been going over. England don't review"
"back of a length, straightens slightly towards off stump, defended towards mid-on"
"length ball close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"very full, in the blockhole almost, close to off stump. Jabbed out to short extra-cover, and it looks like that caused some jarring in Pujara's hands"
"length ball, angling into the fourth-stump corridor. Presses forward and defends towards short extra"
"overpitched, plenty of width too, and Pujara lets his bat flow through a big arc and finish over his left shoulder as he drives this to the left of extra-cover"
"tossed up wide of off stump, stretches out to smother the spin"
"floats this up even wider, driven out to deep point"
"similar delivery outside off, different batsman. Pujara skips out, gets to the pitch, and clips it through midwicket"
"flatter now, goes back to defend into the on side"
"sees that flight wide of off stump again and takes another massive stride out, but doesn't get close enough to the pitch. Looks to defend, playing for spin, and it goes with the angle and slides past the outside edge"
"fuller now, clipped to mid-on"
"and he gets his man! Slants a good-length ball across, and when Kohli played at it it was at least on a fifth-stump line. Could have left it, perhaps, but the threat of the inswing probably drew him to push at it. A hard-hands jab. Nicks it, and Cook takes a low catch at first slip tumbling to his right"
"back of a length, fairly wide of off stump, steered to deep point"
"fullish, angling in towards off stump, and there's Pujara's fifty. Back-to-back fifties for him. Comes half-forward to defend, and plays slightly outside the line. Thick inside-edge down to long leg"
full outside off. Lets it come and plays with soft hands and an open face to guide it to the left of deep point. Does he really need that fielder on the boundary for the new batsman?
fullish on middle and leg. Shows the full face to defend to mid-on
"good length, pitching within the stumps and slanting away from off. Rahane watches it well, mindful of the possibility of inswing, before deciding to leave it alone"
"back of a length, angling in from wide of the crease. Pujara's weight is on the front foot as he looks to defend, and plays it towards midwicket off the inner half of the bat"
"edged, and it runs away between keeper and first slip. Similar to how Pujara got out off Stokes in the second innings at Trent Bridge. Good length in the corridor, and Pujara hangs his bat out. Tries to check himself, but can't quite pull away, and the edge falls between the diving keeper and Cook at slip"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the on side"
"full outside off, driven to short extra"
"fullish, a bit wider, Pujara leaves it alone"
"fullish, angling into the fourth-stump channel. Gets a good stride forward and defends towards mid-on"
"length ball, swings away from wide outside off stump, left alone"
"length ball close to off stump, presses forward, lets it come, and eases it to deep point with an open face"
"full, angling in towards off stump, presses forward to block it back to the bowler"
"back of a length, angling in towards middle stump, tucked away to long leg"
"full, angling in towards off stump, shows the full face to block to mid-on"
"short outside off, taps it on top of the bounce to play it into the gap to the right of backward point"
"good bouncer, 137kph. Angles it in from wide of the crease, and gets it to climb over Pujara's right shoulder. Watches it and sways out of the way, turning his head as he does so"
"ooh, <b>did that carry</b>? Yup. It did. That's a lovely delivery. Angles into the fourth-stump channel and then straightens away. Rahane feels for it, nicks it, and Root, diving to his right, <b>drops</b> the one-hander at second slip"
"back of a length, straightens towards off stump, defended towards mid-on. He's overstepped a long way here"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"bouncer, angling down leg. Quick, steep bounce too, and Pujara swivels, thinking about the hook, but decides not to play it"
"length ball close to off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"shortish, straightens towards off stump, gets nicely behind it and defends with soft hands, back down the pitch"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump, uses his wrists to work it to midwicket"
"touch straight from Curran, worked away to the leg side"
Pujara gets forward on off stump
"round the wicket, back of a length, 79mph and tucked to the on side"
"angled in on the stumps and nudged away, via the inside edge"
"Curran bends his back, grunting with effort as he hits a length, defended on off stump"
"fuller and swinging in, sliding towards leg stump and Puj nurdles around the corner for one"
overptiched and Rahane responds by leaning out and stroking a languid four through the covers
"better length, angling in and defended down into the off side"
"banged into the pitch, only 79mph, perhaps showing the effects of his dicky knee, Rahane taps it away again"
"length ball, angling in towards the stumps and tucked to leg"
"big inswinger, Rahane trapped in front - and Oxenford gives it! But the call to <b>review</b> comes quickly. Is it a <i>no-ball?</i> Very tight on the line, but Stokes might just have some heel behind when his toes hit the turf... and third umpire Joel Wilson says 'fair delivery!' That was Rahane's best chance, because <b>this delivery is homing in on leg stump</b> - out, stays the call, and in heads Jinks!"
"goes round the wicket, fullish in the channel but wide enough for him to leave well alone"
"fired in from round the wicket, blocked back towards the bowler"
"length on the stumps, Pujara steers this towards mid-on"
"dug in short, rising over the left shoulder as Pujara spins out of the way"
another loopy bumper - called wide on height this time
"slightly back of a length outside off, tapped towards point off the back foot"
"fullish length and swinging, sliding past the pads as Pujara flicks at it... Buttler couldn't quite gather one-handed to his left, but there was no bat involved"
"over the wicket, hits a length around off and Pant defends"
"Stokes trundles in, looking for further dividends, pitch-up ball in the channel but Pujara ignores it"
"full, 79mph outside off stump, no need to play"
"this comes back appreciably at Pujara, who waits and works it with a turn of the wrists through midwicket for one"
"round the wicket, pitched up and turned to the on side from the crease"
"full length, Stokes is swinging this away as Pant comes across and leaves"
"length ball, good shape but wide enough in the channel to ignore once again"
"continues to work away in the corridor, Pant leaves"
"pitched up, quite wide and left alone"
"length ball, straightening a touch outside off, Pujara leaves again"
"length in the channel, no stroke again"
very close to the stumps but Puj watches it closely and plays inside the line
"full and this gets Pujara coming forwards, cushioned into a gap through backward point"
"goes round the wicket to Pant, who covers the line and blocks"
"oof, that's sconed him! Short ball from Stokes, Pujara takes on the pull, <b>and wears a blow right on the forehead!</b> The ball loops away towards point, and they take the single... but he's going to need checking over"
"pitched up from round the wicket, tapped towards cover coming forwards"
"gets a little straighter, worked to mid-on stepping into line"
"full and tempting in the channel, Pant watches this through"
"fullish, shaping back from outside off, steered along the carpet towards point"
pushed in towards the stumps and clipped to mid-on
"full, targeting the front pad, worked away to midwicket where Curran snaffles it up at the second attempt"
"pitched up outside off, Pujara shuffles across and lets it go"
"touch shorter outside off, 82mph and glided away through backward point with an open face"
"length in the channel, holding its line as Pant comes across and leaves"
"slightly shorter, rising to hip height as Pant brings his bat down at an angle and gets a thick edge into his pads"
"back of a length, wide enough to be ignored"
gets a touch too straight and Puj works it off his body for one
"that's the line, draws him forwards, probably could have been left on length but Pant was drawn into a play-and-miss"
pitched up and this is dabbed into the covers in controlled fashion
"shorter, fizzing through a foot or two outside off stump as Pant drops the hand"
"length in the corridor, testing Pant's patience, again he's happy to let it go"
"probing around off stump, defended on the front foot into the covers"
"fullish length, 83mph and tapped towards mid-off"
"hits a length in the channel, this rises sharply but Pujara knows his angles and isn't going to play at those"
"pushed in towards the stumps, blocked to the on side"
"good-length delivery, 84mph and holding its line, played softly through point and they trot the single"
"fired in from round the wicket, Pant nudges it away defensively"
"lovely line, curling away a foot outside off, but Pant gets out and watches it closely before shouldering arms"
"full outside off, 78mph and tailing in, but Pujara is well forward, turns this into a half-volley that is spanked through the covers for four"
"short and straying leg side, Pujara just gets a tickle on it, possibly via the hip and it beats the dive of the fielder on the fine-leg rope"
"weeeeehhhh... that's close! Another sharp inswinger, beats the inside edge and slides into the front pad - but heading down?"
"full outside off, this is tucked into a gap in the covers"
"in the channel, good length but wide enough to let go"
"yeesh, that's a jaffa, <b>draws him out and then nips away past the edge!</b> A curling pearler from Stokes, too good for Pant to get anything on"
"shortish, Pujara drops it down safely by his feet"
"touch short again, blocked from the crease"
"length outside off, gets across and shoulders arms"
"fuller, 84mph, Che Puj comes across and drives through point for one to the sweeper"
"beats the forward push, close once again! Anderson pitches it up and takes the ball away, into the gloves with Pant playing at thin air"
"a bit of wobble does for Buttler this time, the ball escapes him and they pinch a bye"
"round the wicket, pushed in towards off stump and Pant covers the line"
"tossed up on off, big lunge forward to block"
"flighted, spinning on middle and leg, <b>thuds into the pad</b> - up goes the finger! India have no reviews, so he can't contest it, but that looked a good decision, and Hawk-Eye quickly backs it up, suggesting the ball would have straightened to hit plenty of leg stump. Not only will Pant not get off the mark, he'll not be coming back after tea, having notched a 29-ball duck!"
nice flight into those footmarks wide of off stump. Big stretch out from Pandya to get close to the pitch and defend into the off side
a little closer to off stump now and Pandya gets his front leg across and sweeps hard and flat to the square leg boundary
"good ball, gets it to dip onto a lovely length outside off stump and spin back sharply. Pandya doesn't get that much of a stride out, just defends from the crease into the on side"
"length ball close to off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"back of a length, a little wider outside off, left alone"
"length ball close to off stump, a tiny bit of shape away. Defended towards mid-off"
"again, nice and close to off stump. Pujara comes forward to defend into the cover point region. Got on the front foot nice and early and had plenty of time to watch it onto his bat"
"short, a decent amount of width, cut away to the left of deep point"
"fullish, angling into off and middle. Lets it come and uses his wrists to clip to the right of mid-on"
"dangled up outside off, jumps out and drives to deep point"
"tossed up full outside off, big stride out to drive it back to the bowler"
"got him, he's flicked that in the air! Lovely flight again outside off, dip too, and Pandya has been stretching out to get close to the pitch of the ball rather than using his feet. Doesn't get close enough to the pitch this time as he stretches out to try and clip it with the turn, and short midwicket dives to his left and takes a good, sharp catch. Classic offspinner's dismissal"
"nice flight outside off too. A little wider than the one that got Pandya. Big stride out, opens his bat face to push into the cover point region"
"goes back to a length ball spinning in from outside off, punches to short midwicket"
down the track now as Moeen loops another ball into the footmarks. Gets close to the pitch and drives to that sweeper at deep point
"bouncer, rises high over off stump. Pujara sways his upper body out of the way"
"another bouncer, this one slants down the leg side. Pujara ducks, Buttler dives left to collect"
"fullish, angling into off stump. Presses forward, lets it come on, and squeezes it past the right hand of the diving backward point fielder with an open bat face"
"full outside off, driven back firmly to the bowler"
"another bouncer, swinging down the leg side. Ashwin misses the hook and Buttler, moving to his left, fumbles to concede a bye"
"full, angling into middle stump, clipped to deep square leg"
shot. Pujara is so good at reading the length against spin. Marginally short outside off and he's immediately deep in his crease for the late-cut wide of slip
"back of a length outside off, shuffles across and punches it back to Moeen"
"lovely flight outside off, draws Ashwin forward to defend and gets it to dip on him. Doesn't turn, and slides past the outside edge"
"nice flight once more, a bit fuller. Ashwin stretches forward and defends to silly point"
"bowled him, that was a poor choice of shot. The line was too close to off stump for Ashwin to play the reverse-sweep, and he makes an absolute mess of it. Bottom-edges it, and the ball rolls into his stumps to give Moeen his third wicket. That's India's last recognised batsman"
"and he's gone first ball! Typical tail-ender's dismissal, playing down the wrong line. Goes back and across to defend this one that spins in from outside off. Unfortunately for Shami, it spins a little less than he expects, and his bat comes down at an angle, allowing the ball to miss the outside edge and peg back off stump"
"another bouncer, well outside off, though, and Pujara can leave comfortably"
"bouncer, well down the leg side, easy leave again"
"short, only gets up to chest height, pulls it round to long leg. Refuses the single"
"short again, angling across Pujara this time. Looks to get off his toes and uppercut, but can't quite connect. Slightly late on the shot and it rose higher than he expected"
"shortish outside off, Pujara tries to cut and fails to connect"
"back of a length, swings away in the channel and Pujara plays an open-faced glide. One bounce to gully"
"tossed up outside off, stretches out fully and defends to silly point"
"tossed up on off stump and Ishant sweeps hard and flat, straight into the heel of Cook at short leg"
"nice flight and dip outside off, Ishant stretches out again to defend. Hits the inside half of the bat"
"a bit fuller and Ishant sweeps again, connects well and finds the backward square leg boundary"
"back of a length outside off, shuffles across to defend and it keeps a bit low. Jams his bat down hurriedly to keep it out"
"flighted a little wider, stretches forward and across and defends towards short leg, off the inside half of the bat"
"and is that another blow to the helmet? Sharp bouncer, and it straightens as Pujara looks to sway away from the line. This time it hits the back of his helmet"
"short, angling away from off stump. Cut away to the right of third man, just tapped it on top of the bounce"
"full on leg stump and Pujara looks to flick. A bit of outswing, and the ball goes off the outside half of his bat to mid-on"
"short, well down the leg side. Buttler has to dive a long way to his left after Pujara pulls his gloves out of the way"
"short, rises up towards the ribcage. Rides the bounce well and tucks it to deep square leg"
"of what use are all those catchers if you bowl it halfway down the pitch and three feet wide outside off stump, Jimmy? Ishant ignores it"
"a touch shorter than ideal outside off and Pujara waits on it to late-cut. Too close to slip, though"
a bit more flight and Pujara skips out to drive to the left of mid-off. Runs as fast as he can - which isn't very fast - to the other end
"what a shot, Ishant! Down the track now and he gets close enough to the pitch of this flighted ball wide of off stump to free his arms and loft it over mid-off"
"just a touch short, spins in towards leg stump, waits on it and pulls with the turn to long leg"
floated up wide of off. Big stride forward to smother the spin and defend towards silly point
"nicely played. Goes deep in his crease, back and across, to get outside the line and defend this sharply spinning ball which also keeps slightly low"
"full on the pads, clipped to deep backward square leg. Doesn't take the single"
"short now, pulled to deep backward square leg"
"another bouncer, rises well above shoulder height and outside leg stump, and Pujara ignores it"
"another bouncer, angled a little further across and gets up to head height. Hooked, all along the ground, towards deep square leg. Still doesn't take the single"
"Another short ball, gets up over his left shoulder and he swivels round to hook to deep backward square leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, gets back and across and defends into the on side"
"flighted outside off, steps out and defends it back towards the bowler"
"a little flatter, spinning back in towards off stump. Presses forward and defends into the off side"
"ooh, sharp turn. Was just a touch short and pitched well outside off. Jumped back and made room to cut. Was cramped for room and had to hurriedly defend instead"
"a touch short again, much less turn this time. He's quickly deep in his crease to late-cut, into the big gap between slip and backward point"
"again a touch short, goes back and punches into the covers"
flat length ball slanting across to off stump and straightening. Goes deep in his crease and brings his bat down quickly to defend
"back of a length on middle and leg, straightens, goes back and across to whip to deep midwicket. Takes the single. Hmmmm. Ishant has had his issues with Rashid in this series"
"tossed up on off stump, stretches out and sweeps it fine of backward square leg"
"tossed up full outside off, driven firmly to short extra-cover"
"goes for the sweep again and misses. Sneaks under the bat and hits the back thigh. Was the legbreak, and hit him outside the line, so no worries"
"shortish, flat googly wide of off. Looks to cut and ends up chopping it down hard into the turf. Bounces up towards the jumping Stokes at slip"
"another googly, slower and fuller outside off. The line kind of gives it away and Ishant stretches out to defend into the point region"
sharp turn and bounce out of the footmarks as Pujara stretches out to pad it. Ends up hitting him on the chest
"goes for the sweep now as he dangles it wide of off. Misses, and the ball hits his back thigh, outside the line"
"tossed up fairly wide of off, stretches forward and across and defends into the off side"
"down the track now, gets close enough to the pitch to use his wrists and clip it along the ground to short midwicket"
"down the track now, and Pujara shows he can hit over the top. With the spin, over midwicket, and it bounces away for four. A heave rather than a flowing lofted hit, but they all count"
"back of a length now, goes deep in his crease to whip it leg side. On the bounce and into the legs of short leg"
"ooh, that looked more like a medium-pace legcutter than a legbreak. Quick, on off stump, and he goes back and across and jabs into the cover point region"
"tossed up on middle and leg, steps out to clip to long-on"
"flighty low full-toss, driven back to the bowler"
down the track and he gets nowhere near the pitch of this googly. Ends up cramped for room and having to jam his bat down hurriedly to keep it out
"back of a length, legbreak, close to off stump, goes back and across to defend"
"loopy and full on middle and off, Ishant stretches a long way forward, waits for the ball to descend, and blocks into the covers"
"down the track as Moeen flights one wide of off stump. Pushes it to the left of extra-cover, and initially says no, but Ishant says he'll be okay and Pujara lets him have the strike"
"floated across, outside off. Doesn't really turn and he gets a big stride out to defend into the off side"
"tossed up outside off, and Ishant sweeps and sweeps well. Finds the gap between deep backward square leg and deep midwicket. These are vital runs for India"
"back of a length, slanting across the stumps and not spinning back too far. Back and across to defend towards mid-off"
"back of a length, turns in sharply towards middle and leg, tucked to long leg. Pujara doesn't want the single"
"maybe he should have taken that single after all. Takes a big stride forward to defend as Moeen dangles another delivery into the rough, but doesn't get close enough to the pitch to defend safely. Inside-edge into pad, and it pops up for short leg to take it on the second attempt, having first reached overhead to parry the ball up. That's Moeen's fifth wicket - what a spell this has been! Ultra Edge shows a definite tickle as the ball passes the inside edge"
"shortish googly, spins in from outside off. Opens up and hammers a pull down to long-on. No single"
"full legbreak wide of off stump, left alone"
"short legbreak wide of off, left alone. Not sure why he didn't go for the cut"
"tossed up and dips onto a good length outside off. Comes forward, opens his bat face, and plays towards backward point"
sees Pujara shaping to step out and bowls it wiiiide of off stump. Has to quickly drag his back foot back into the crease
"shortish outside off, flat-batted past the diving bowler towards mid-off, and there isn't enough power on the shot to keep Pujara from taking the single and retaining the strike. Hit it hard into the ground, and it ended up losing pace as a result, giving him the time to complete the run"
"tossed up outside off, steps out, gets close to the pitch, and clips to long leg. No single"
"short, turns in towards off stump, pulls to the right of deep midwicket but doesn't run"
"back of a length, spins in sharply from outside off, defended back to the bowler"
"flighted now, not too far outside off, and Pujara sweeps to the left of long leg, far enough to the left of the fielder to pick up two and move to 99"
"loops it into the rough again, wide of off stump, and Pujara stretches out and pads it away. Not much of an lbw appeal, but England review the not-out decision anyway. I don't think it turned enough to hit the stumps. Or did it? Impact outside off, obviously. Wait. the third umpire says 'we're going with shot played'. Interesting. That seemed like deliberate padding with bat deliberately behind pad. But this is how the umpires have interpreted it"
"down the track now to the flighted ball wide of off stump, and he hits it back over the bowler's head. Reached out a long way in front of his body, so didn't really time it. Long-on is back, but it drops down onto the turf, well to the fielder's left, and Pujara completes two to bring up a superb hundred, his 15th overall and second outside Asia. His footwork against spin, always a feature of his play in home conditions, has come to the fore in the first innings of an overseas Test"
"back of a length close to off stump, goes back and across and defends into the off side"
"back of a length, googly, and he goes deep in his crease and works it backward of square. Pujara runs like he's never run before and they complete three runs"
"tossed up full on off stump, flicked to deep square leg"
"short on leg stump, clears his front leg and pulls to deep midwicket"
"tossed up wide of off stump, driven firmly but too close to short extra-cover"
flighted legbreak outside off. Looks for the lap sweep but can't connect
"back of a length fairly wide outside off, doesn't turn that much. Goes back and across and opens his bat face to dab it down into the third man region"
"back of a length, turning in towards off stump, punched back to the bowler"
looks to come down the track and Moeen shortens his length. Defended into the cover region
"down the track and this time he gets exactly where he needs to be for the lofted shot. More a chip than a loft, with the spin and times it beautifully, over midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, skips out of his crease and clips with the turn to deepish long-on. Takes the single, leaves Bumrah just one ball to face"
"back of a length, goes deep in his crease to defend with the spin towards leg gully"
"round the wicket, fullish, looked like a cutter outside off, Puj blocks on the front foot"
"digs it in short, pulled firmly through backward square leg, but he declines the single"
"another short ball, 78mph and he whirls his arms through a pull in front of square, only one on offer to deep midwicket and he's not interested"
"good length, tailing in on the stumps and tucked to the on side"
"over the wicket, slightly wide as it goes across on the angle and Pujara thrashes it on the up through cover, beats the infield and it runs away for four"
"length ball directed down the leg side, Pujara misses out on a flick and that keeps Bumrah on strike for the next over"
"short of a length, 80mph over the top of the stumps, defended stoutly from the crease"
"pitched up outside off, gun-barrel straight and Bumrah leaves it alone"
"chin music, decent short ball from Broad, 87mph and flying over the shoulder as Bumrah swings at it and fails to connect"
"back of a length, defended down softly towards short leg"
good length outside off stump and this one is left alone
"full, 85mph and shaping back in late, Bumrah does well to get bat on it flicking across the line, a thick inside edge runs down to fine leg... but they won't take the run"
comes across and misses with a flick
"short ball, Pujara swivels and swats it away in front of deep square, they'll come back for two - <b>and that puts India into the lead</b>"
"length from round the wicket, top of off stump, Puj defends"
"touch shorter outside off, drops back and runs it down to third man... but he calls 'No!' early"
"over the wicket, sprayed wide of the off stump, looking to deny Pujara a single - but it's called wide"
"fired towards the tramlines again, Pujara swings but can't reach it... and Dharmasena signals for another extra"
"length on the stumps, much straighter and it's guided nonchalantly to fine leg for one, <b>bringing up the India 250</b> in the process"
"goes for the yorker, full and straight but well dug out, it squirts through backward square leg - and they <i>do</i> run now, thinking there might be two, but that's not on. So Bumrah retains the strike!"
"full-length ball, Bumrah pokes at it... and gets a thick edge past his stumps! And now he trots up to the safe end, leaving Root to smile ruefully"
"shortish and swerving down the leg side, flick and a miss from Pujara and Buttler can't get there either... though Curran does well to prevent it reaching the rope at fine leg"
"sliding into the pads, Puj clips it fine but doesn't run"
"length ball, tailing in and whipped away with revolving-door wrists, gets a couple between fine leg and deep square"
"short ball, at the ribs and swatted away on the pull for a single"
"pitched up and met stoutly on the front foot, Bumrah keeps it out"
"lobbed up down the leg side, skids through to the keeper"
"floated up wide of the stumps and Pujara lashes a drive, extra cover gets a hand on it"
"flighted, props forward and defends on off stump"
"Pujara jumps out, not quite to the pitch as he goes over the top... <b>but he clears mid-off running back!</b> Root gives chase but can't prevent it running for four"
"tossed up on off stump, clubbed to extra cover"
"tossed up outside off but Pujara is across early and manufactures a little dab to leg, into a gap and they scuttle the single"
"extra bounce straight away, coming back in menacingly and Che Pu cops a blow on the body as he plays around it"
"full in the channel, driven without timing through mid-off... there's a single on offer but he doesn't want it"
"shot! Spanked over mid-on, clean hitting from Pujara, just leans forward and clips over the infield, bounces away to the rope"
"four more, stroked through the covers! Lovely timing, steps into the drive and laces it past the fielder"
"fullish around the line of off, tapped into the covers"
"dropped down into the off side, they think about the single, but have to turn back"
"pitched up in the channel, from over the wicket, Bumrah watches it through"
"full on off stump, props forward in defence"
"Curran floats it up in the channel again, nothing doing"
"length ball, 78mph but still a touch wide and Bumrah watches it through"
"no real swing as yet, although this straightens a touch a foot outside off, no stroke required"
"straighter, leg-stump line, 78mph and Bumrah blocks into the on side, sees out a maiden"
"slightly back of a length over off stump, Pujara defends"
"angled in with the arm, back of a length and tapped down to the leg side"
"rising from a length, gets across and defends softly"
"in the channel, bit of width and Pujara dabs it off the back foot down to third man... again turns down the run"
"ooh, bit of a yahoo from Pujara, tries to blast a length ball back down the ground but fails to connect"
"gets the single to finish the over, poked square and backward point has to run in as they scamper through"
"Curran slides the ball across the right-hander, who has a dab and misses"
"fuller, met coming forwards and clipped through wide mid-on, Broad is back on the rope and they hustle for two as he comes in to field"
"full and wide, slugged through backward point, but they don't fancy trying for a couple this time"
"back of a length and heading down the leg side, Buttler half-appeals as the ball flies through - but nothing on that"
"on the stumps, blocked down into the leg side"
"pitched up and swinging down the leg side, Pujara misses with a flick... and that will keep Bumrah on strike for England to have another crack"
"rising outside off, Bumrah pokes tentatively at it and fails to connect"
"fuller, pitched up around off, Bumrah gets into line and defends"
"good length, 84mph and blocked as Bumrah props forward on off"
"Broad spears the ball in, more dogged defence from Bumrah"
"there it is, whirring in and slamming the glove, <b>flies to slip at head height!</b> Bumrah walks off wincing in pain, that's rapped him a blow on the bowling hand before looping to Cook for a simple catch - but a very useful knock from the No. 11, who's helped his partner to a hundred and India into the lead"
"round the wicket, pushed on and this doesn't grip particularly, Cook shovels it away to midwicket and trots up to the other end"
"lobbed up outside off, nice revs on the ball and it straightens a touch as Jennings leans out and taps square"
dragged down a touch and defended off the back foot
"flighted, slower and straighter, Jennings leans out around his front pad and blocks"
"tossed up, lots of side spin but the line is wide, there's turn but Jennings can step out and comfortably shoulder arms"
"pushed through closer to the off stump, blocked solidly coming forwards"
"shortish, nipping away with the angle towards the slips, Cook watches it through"
"back of a length, 81mph and shaping across from outside leg stump, defended on the back foot"
"slightly short and wide, fired across the bows but Cook can hang back and leave"
"there's the inswinger, but it's short again and Cook can line it up on the back foot and blocks down into the leg side"
"scooting through down the leg side, flicks at it and misses"
"length ball, this shapes in a fraction and then nips off the pitch, takes the leading edge and runs into the off side for a single"
"lobbed up full on off stump, Cook plants the front foot and blocks"
"flighted, straightening around off stump and tapped away square"
pushed through and blocked playing back
"flatter, the hard new ball slides on as Cook drops deep and shovels to the leg side"
"floated up full outside off, this spins away as Cook presses out and leaves"
"full and flighted, met with a doughty front-foot block - but that three-minute over means India will squeeze one more over in"
"short on the hips and Jennings gets some bat on it, sends the ball skimming fine to get off a pair"
"back of a length, slanted towards the slips but no need to play at it"
"shortish, 87mph and flying through in the corridor once again"
"ooh, that's a nasty, nippy line, climbing and seaming past the outside edge, Jennings staring phlegmatically into the middle distance after pushing down the wrong line"
"full, quite wide and Pant has to throw himself to his left to prevent byes"
"back of a length in the channel, zipping through but Jennings is able to leave once more - and that takes us to <b>stumps</b> in this moreish Test tussle"
"lunges forward, as if he can't wait to get at the ball, and defends to mid-off"
and now he leaps back seeing a shorter delivery and tries to pull it away. Not quite short enough for those shenanigans
"<B>turn</b>, and a fair amount of it, as Ashwin tosses it up higher, lines it wider outside Cook's off stump. The left-hander comes searching for it and is beaten"
"pushes it through on middle and leg, Cook knocks it to square leg"
a big round of applause from Southampton as Cook gets the first runs of the morning with a dink to midwicket. He received a very similar ovation from this crowd the last time his career was hanging by a thread
"rips it <b>past Jennings' edge</b> this time, but there really is no reason the left-hander should be going at balls that wide outside off. Would've been a wide in ODIs..."
"angles the back of a length delivery into Cook, who opens up his body and flicks it to midwicket"
"he's happy to hang back, let the short ball come to him and punch into the covers."
"<b>oooh, that's dangerous</b>. Ishant pitches it right up there and with Cook playing off the back foot, he really needed to get a straight bat down to save himself from the lbw"
opens the face at the last second as he adjust to the slight bit of away movement Ishant gets from the pitch. Touch short to trouble Cook though
short again and Cook is perfectly solid when he needs to play from his crease
the back foot block. Cook's got one of the better ones. And the slowness of the pitch is certainly on show.
<b>slides on straight</b> as he undercuts the ball. Jennings goes back into his crease to read the turn off the pitch and hurries to protect his stumps
loops it up on off stump and draws Jennings forward to block
<b>inside edge</b> onto pad as Jennings defends down the wrong line. The ball keeps drifting in with the angle from around the wicket and he keeps expecting turn
gets out that front dog and smacks a good length ball through the covers. A hint of width allowing Jennings to escape the stranglehold
lunges out to defend outside off
"<b>huge lbw appeal</b> as Ashwin gets an offbreak to pitch on middle and rip sharply past the squared up left-hander. He was far enough back in his crease, basically pleading the ball to hit the bat. But it doesn't. Thankfully for him, it hits high enough to tell the umpire that it would have gone over the stumps"
closes the face of the bat rather deftly to send the back of a length ball to midwicket
whips it past midwicket's left and it screams away towards the crowd willing it along. Southampton roars for Cook again as he does away with a middle-stump half-volley
good length but too far wide of off stump to draw Cook into a shot
better line from Ishant as he targets the top of off stump and Cook manages to keep it out. He's been able to stay on the back foot though. And he looks perfectly comfortable like that.
<b>some lift</b> for the fast bowler as he hits the deck outside off. Cook hoists his bat high over his head to avoid unnecessary problems
"gets the ball up to Cook's chest, but with the pitch having lost some of its pace, Cook has the time to get nice and tall and blunt it with some ease"
quicker delivery - but still full and on off stump - Jennings defends in time
judges the line to be outside off and quickly holsters his weapon
pitches it right up there on off stump and Jennings nearly yorks himself as he comes forward to drive to cover
lobs it up - a tempting delight outside off - but Jennings does well to leave it to the keeper
fires it into the pads - losing patience - and Jennings is able to deflect it away behind square leg. Rare loose ball from Ashwin
<b>legbreak?</b> It certainly hurtles in at Cook's off stump after pitching way outside it. Cook looks up after leaving the ball to do its mischief and Ashwin just turns around and walks away. Do not move when Ashwin is on. Forget about your phone. Hold your trips to the loo. Might even consider being late to respond to the wife. This will be fun.
"fuller delivery on off stump, Jennings lets it come to him and uses soft hands to meet it, which is why the edge slips away past the cordon"
"lovely line from Ishant, the angle from round the wicket working in his favour to land the ball near off stump. Jennings is aware of that little trick though and so the moment it is outside his eyeline, he leaves"
"full on middle and off, Jennings, rooted to the crease, defends. He isn't looking convincing. But he is surviving"
judges the ball to be outside off and leaves again. Good work. Battling work
strays a touch too close to middle and Jennings is able to nudge it through square leg and get off strike
"an easy put-away off the hips - Cook probably dreams of that ball every night, more so now than ever."
a little shuffle across his stumps allows Cook to usher a ball on off stump away to deep square leg
"140 kph, dabs a short and wide delivery away to the third man boundary. That's the gentlest cut shot ever played. Signs of a batsman concentrating solely on being out there, for as long as he can"
"137kph, plants it right up there, near the blockhole at off stump. Jennings pushes to mid-off"
<b>beats him</b> with just the angle. It hits on middle and leg. It's a touch short - a few inches too short to claim the outside edge. Jennings walks away breathing a sigh of relief
pulls his bat inside the line as a good length ball dances away to the keeper outside off
works it off his hips behind square leg
he comes forward to meet a good length ball on off stump. Looks like Cook is slowly getting his eye in.
"plays the angle and indulges in a flick through midwicket, but Ishant is able to get just enough swing away in the air to get the leading edge. Doesn't quite travel in the air though as it comes right back down the pitch"
stays neatly balanced at the crease as he turns a full delivery on middle between midwicket and square leg. Fine shot from an under-fire cricketer
"good length, outside off, Cook directs traffic to the keeper"
slaps an errant short and wide delivery in front of point. Doesn't give it his all though. It's not quite that time yet.
"<b>indecision</b>! But he survives. Ishant's devastating accuracy from round the wicket remains a problem even as the pitch eases out. This ball is on a good length, coming in towards the off stump, so Jennings thinks he needs to play. Then suddenly he realises it's just enough outside that he can leave and in the end he does leave. That's a lot of hassle to go through"
"<b>taken at slip</b>! Rahul has to go through a nervous moment, grabbing at the ball as it evades his first grab. But the <s>second</s> third is solid. Cook walks with his team still trailing. Oh, he was desperate for runs, and this is the worst ball when in that mindset. It's full. It's wide. It's ripe for the drive. The left-hander goes for it and just a hint of nip away off the pitch ensures it's the edge that connects and not the middle"
"<b>nearly bowls him</b>! Bumrah! What are you doing?! This is meant to be a docile pitch. And here you are pitching the ball up and making it behave like a snake. Moeen is forward to block, thinking it will travel a straight line. But instead it ducks in, through bat and pad, and only just lobs over the stumps"
"<b>England lead</b> but the runs come off an entirely unconvincing shot. In fact, he's trying ot leave the ball after committing to play it. Bumrah's angle across the left-hander and the threat of his inswinger is playing on Moeen's mind"
<b>beats him</b> again with a slightly short of a length ball moving across the defending left-hander
"full on off stump, defends"
"keeps out another very full delivery looking for his pads, and if lucky, his stumps. Moeen's in a proper battle."
"back of a length and outside off, he lets it go"
ducks under the short ball on off stump and flashes a grin at the fast bowler toiling away...
"fuller delivery looking for the outside edge, Jennings doesn't oblige"
shoulders arms to a back of a good length ball outside off
"full and outside off, Jennings refrains from playing again"
"that's a good ball. It hits the pitch just a shade outside off and rises sharply, forcing Pant to leap and shove his hands up in the air to grab it. Jennings, meanwhile, has wisely left the brute alone"
"goes for a little drive seeing the ball pitched up. But he's managed not to push too hard at the ball, which helps send the ball to ground before reaching the cordon"
"135 kph, zips through again, making the pitch seem a lot quicker, a lot more dangerous than it actually is. Moeen leaves outside off."
"<b>outside edge</b> and it runs away to the third man boundary, much to the delight of the crowd. Moeen's soft hands win out against a good length ball on middle"
"shortish on middle and leg, Moeen works it to midwicket"
works the short ball from the comfort of his crease to midwicket
he finds relief in the form of a short ball on the pads and flicks it behind square leg
"bouncer from India's mean fast bowler and Moeen wants nothing to do with it. Oooh, the tension's building; building very nicely"
"<b>hits him</b> as he's into the shot a touch too early and the ball both stops in the pitch, and also kicks up to connect with a welt that will soon form on his stomach"
"<b>beats him</b> with a lovely delivery outside off. It's pitched up but Moeen's not ready to move his front foot yet. Just his hands come out to the ball, away from his body, and he's lucky not to nick it"
"<b>taken again</b> and Rahul's wildly confident of it even though the ball comes to him very very low. The umpires come together and throw it up to their friend in the box. <b>The soft signal is out</b>. Ripper of a ball from Ishant, and it's the result of his angle from round the wicket again. He pitches it up on middle. Moeen's feet are planted, growing roots. The hands compensate for that, pushing at the ball, offering the edge up. Rahul is alert at second slip, diving forward and to his right. That's a <b>superb grab</b>. And it's clean too. 'I'm happy that fingers are under the ball,' says third umpire Joel Wilson and away goes Moeen"
"full on off stump, Root drives to mid-off. Kohli, who's standing a little further up at third slip, comes up to share his thoughts to his opposite number"
works away the straight ball through midwicket to get off the mark
"<b>brave leave</b> as Jennings watches a full ball landing on off stump and going off with the angle. And Kohli comes up to the batting crease, about a foot away from  Jennings, to set the field. Phew, that's marking his territory..."
"good length ball on off stump, blocks from the crease. And the umpires aren't liking that Kohli's invading Jennings' space."
stands up tall to punch the short of a length ball to mid-off
"87 mph, back of a length and outside off, Root ignores it"
"he's drawn into playing at a wide one, guiding it behind point"
"<b>cuts him in half</b>! This is unreal bowling from Bumrah. Pace. Perfect accuracy. And a whole load of movement. This one pitches outside off and darts back in, through the gap between Root's bat and both his feet, which are stuck in the crease."
he's looking out for the ball in line with his stumps. That's all Jennings is doing right now. Making himself an obstacle against Ishant and his desire to break the stumps behind the batsman
swivels on the back foot as he pulls the short ball out to long leg
gets his head over the ball and directs it into the vacant spaces at cover. Good work from Root
"full on middle, Jennings thrusts his bat in front of his pad and defends for all he's worth"
lets go of a wide delivery outside off. Good concentration.
"pitches it full on of stump, but with the change in angle, and Ishant never really known for getting the ball back into the left-hander, Jennings can leave a lot easier"
"over the wicket, tossed up and defended coming forwards"
"flighted, a touch too straight and Root works this through midwicket for a couple"
presses out and defends on the front foot
Root comes across and pats the ball down into the off side
"pushed through a little quicker, defended on the back foot"
"tossed up wider, looking for the rough patches and Root goes for the slog-sweep, doesn't quite execute correctly and a thick inside edge bounces away off his front pad. Stalemate"
"pushed across from over the wicket towards off stump, Jennings lines it up in defence"
"now this nips back, good heat as Jennings is beaten on the inside, Bumrah appeals as the ball hits the front leg but it was high, possibly pitching outside, too"
"short and leg side and this is flicked around the corner, just a touch of glove and then off the hip as Pant leaps across but can't get there - four for Jennings"
back of a length and still on the legs as Jennings tucks it down
stays back and taps the ball away to the on side
angled across on a length but the line is wide enough for Jennings to hang deep and leave alone
"tossed up outside the line of off and Root drives with an open face, gets a couple through backward point as slip gives chase"
dragged down a touch and tapped into a gap off the back foot
"floated up from over the wicket, defended softly to the on side"
"flighted, Jennings is down early to sweep, sends it to short fine leg along the carpet"
"round the wicket, pushed through on the stumps and Jennings jabs down in defence"
"tossed up, slows his pace and Jennings gets well forward to smother any turn"
"back of a length in the corridor, Root swishes breezily away from his body but the timing is good and he steers a couple past backward point"
"speared in, 86mph and ducking past Root's forward prod, into the front pad... <i>Huge</i> appeal from India, they're convinced and ask to <b>review</b> Bruce Oxenford's not-out call. Looked high to me, struck him on the flap, but he was on his toes, too... and yes, <b>Hawk-Eye has it going over the top</b>, so DRS not with India there, and they lose the review"

"drifting leg side and although there's some turn it isn't threatening the stumps, allowing Root to clout a sweep firmly through backward square leg for four"

"slightly wider line, comes across and lets it go"
"short of a length, 85mph and stabbed down in front of square for a comfortable single"

"flighted, comes across and defends on off stump"
"tossed up, this spins sharply to hit the front pad... Pant belts out an appeal, but Dharmasena isn't interested and Ashwin cautions against using a review. Root was well forward, playing a short, and it might have been turning too much, anyway"
presses forward on off stump to block
flatter and wide of the stumps as Jennings drops back
"overpitched, 86mph on off and Root pings it straight back down the ground, all timing and it oozes over the rope for four"
"nipping in, this slams Root on the pads again, another impassioned appeal -  but Oxenford is unmoved! India again ponder the review, but it was similar to the Bumrah shout, struck above the knee roll, looked to be heading over"

"pitched up in the channel, Jennings is in his groove now, steps across and leaves"
"soft hands, angled bat, Jennings using the pace and he guides Shami down to third man for another boundary"
"pitched up, this nips in to hit the back pad - given! Jennings looks ruefully to his captain, then decides to <b>review</b>, but I don't think this is going to save him... Yep, that's plumb, <b>Hawk-Eye projecting the ball would have crashed into leg stump!</b> It stayed a touch low, which might encourage England's bowlers when it comes to the fourth innings but will be no consolation for Jennings. What a moment to strike!"
"through him! Neck, crop and every other awesome adjective ever invented. A little loose from Bairstow, only inching forward, trying to drive a proper swing bowler on the up -  while the ball is reversing. It's a tactic fraught with risk and all of it comes to roost as Shami swings a pitched up delivery from well outside off to clatter into Bairstow's stumps. Sensational delivery, seconds after lunch"
<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> with Root moving across his crease and as a result of that he's playing down the wrong line. Bumrah gets the good length ball to nip in off the pitch and smack the knee-roll of the front pad. Would have gone down
<b>beats him</b> by getting a back of a length delivery to straighten away from the angle. Special stuff from Bumrah. India are up for this.
gets right behind the shortish delivery on middle.
flicks it away to long leg. Root needs to focus here. He's got to drag England's line-up kicking and screaming to safety. Or at least until Sam Curran comes on
leaves having judged the line of this shortish delivery to be outside off
"sees off another delivery outside the off stump, this one pitched further up"
guides it away to third man with a solid front foot stride and the gentlest of open faces. Root going strong as India go funky by placing a man at silly mid-on
"stands up tall against a short ball on off stump and slices it away to third man, and there is protection now on that boundary"
squares himself up to bring a straight enough bat down on a delivery heading into his pads. Stokes forces himself to be circumspect and finds short midwicket
"drifts down leg, with Stokes looking for a leg glance. Doesn't connect and it's all down to Pant to dive across and save the byes. Decent work"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> again with Stokes pinned right in front of middle, but it is a bit too high. Might also be an inside edge with Shami getting the ball to go in the direction of the shine - although most of the movement is off the pitch. Stokes, pinned to his crease, trying to defend is a touch too slow"
"full on middle and leg, Stokes works it away to long leg"
"gets sharp bounce off the pitch and Stokes has to yank his bottom hand off as he fends it to midwicket, desperate to make sure the ball doesn't lob up. Bumrah's hitting the deck hard and that whiplash action he has is serving him very well"
"good length on middle, Stokes is right behind it. This is tense stuff. Really tense stuff"
"fullish on middle, Stokes is up for it again"
oh he's setting up really nicely. Watches the full length ball onto the middle of his bat and then practices that impeccable forward defensive again.
this time it's a bit of an inside edge as Stokes is just a touch late coming forward to this length ball on off stump from round the wicket
"minds the late movement Bumrah gets away from the bat and plays as late and as close to his body as he could. Excellent technique from Stokes, even if he's helped a little by the length behind short"
"'Rooooooooooooooooot' goes Southampton, which has been rather quiet lately, as their man whips away an errant ball on leg stump out to the square leg boundary"

"sweet drive from Root, coming forward to the fuller delivery, keeping bat and pad together and playing with the caution necessary against a reversing ball"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
flicks a back of a length delivery to short midwicket
"full on middle, but Root isn't giving way for it to clatter into the stumps. Not without a fight"
"back of a length on off stump, Stokes is solidly behind it"
excellent leave from Stokes as he gets the front foot towards the pitch of a fuller ball outside off and ushers it through to the keeper
another well-judged leave from Stokes as Bumrah goes a little wider outside off
"steps out to meet a fullish delivery that cuts back too far for Stokes to make proper contact with the flick. Muted lbw appeal, because everyone realises he's too far forward"
<b>so close</b> to off stump as Stokes leaves the ball darting back in off the pitch. Bumrah's in proper rhythm. And Stokes is very much up for it
"soft hands, late decision to defend and the result is that the good length ball on a fourth stump line bounces away to the slips"
the short ball on off stump slinks away to cover after thudding into the middle of Root's bat
"<b>beats him</b> with a rippah! Root strides forward to meet a  fuller delivery only a shade outside off. He thinks it's drivable. But Shami's given it everything it needs to reverse - the seam coming out bolt upright - and reverse it does, away from the England captain"
"back of a length on off stump, slices it to point"
works it away off his hips to long leg.
"full and outside off, the ball meaning to come into the left-hander. Stokes strides forward and across to protect the stumps and then leaves"
waits on the shortish delivery - from over the wicket this time - and steers it towards point
"nails the flick, but also finds midwicket. Bumrah pitches it right up there to enable the shot"
"they're going for the reverse-swing lbw or bowled against Root, bowling almost a yorker length. But the batsman's been good enough so far, working to midwicket"
"the front foot goes out, but Root realises the ball is swinging into him, so he checks it's progress and then presents the straight bat"
allows the short ball to come to him before deflecting away to point.
"<b>snorther</b> and Rahane, running in from midwicket, thinks there's an edge. Insane ball, by the way. On off stump. Straightens away from the angle. Kicks up off the pitch. Zips past Stokes, somewhere near the splice, as he tries to make contact with it. Hmmm. We'll need another look at that. <b>Ultra-Edge says there's nothing</b> and Bumrah also suggested he couldn't hear anything"
"full on off stump, defends"
"full on off stump, Root drives very well down the ground"
"full and outside off, Root lets it go and then practices the flat-batted slap through cover, momentarily pretending it's a one-day game and he's not England's captain fighting to secure a lead"
creeps forward to a good length ball on off stump and blunts it
"slips down leg, Root has no chance of connecting with his flick, and Pant does well to stop it running away to the boundary"
"plenty of swing into the right-hander, but that works in Root's favour as he concentrates on playing late and with the movement. Single to long leg"
"very good leave from Stokes. Ishant is coming over the wicket to the left-hander. He wouln't be doing that if he wasn't worried that going round will get him a third warning for running on the pitch and therefore taking out of the attack. And he doesn't have the inswinger to the left-hander. So the moment the ball pitches on off stump, it will only go away to the slips with that angle."
""
"<b>drifts away past the edge</b> as Ashwin targets a line outside off, pulling Root across with him. The batsman's playing for turn, but it doesn't quite happen"
"a touch short, which allows Root to rock back, open up his body and flick it behind square leg"
"put away in style as Stokes rocks back against the short ball and whacks it through midwicket, with a mostly straight bat. Power from the left-hander"
"quicker delivery - probably not meant to turn - Root covers it and blocks, from the safety of his crease"
"good length ball on off stump, Root hangs back, opens the face and glides it to third man"
"thinks about playing, when the fuller delivery outside off is there only to take the edge. Stokes eventually realises the threat and yanks the bat away."
"he comes down the pitch, at the bowler, but then has to leave the ball which is heading away to the slip cordon"
"ushers the ball away to the keeper again. So now, will Ishant find a new way to attack a left-hander?"
"pings off the edge, but by playing close to the body and using soft hands, Stokes will earn these runs to third man."
"walks out to the fast bowler, and then gently works it off his pads to midwicket"
"<b>superb bowling</b>! Root really has little chance here. Because at first the full delivery is coming into him. He's covered that movement. But then as it hits the pitch, it changes its mind and darts away to the keeper's gloves. Somebody check if Pant's smuggled a magnet on his person"
"tosses it up on off stump, Stokes smothers it well"
"wanders back, allows the good length ball to come right under his eyes and then dinks it to short fine leg"
"quicker delivery on off stump, Stokes is alive to the variation"

basically digs out a yorker in line with the stumps
meets the ball right under his eyes as he blocks a good length ball outside off
"<b>too good, just too good</b>! Ishant has discovered the ability to hit these areas over and over, and get late movement. Root is well set, and yet, even he is unable to deal with a fuller delivery angled in and roaring away after pitching"
full and sliding down leg. Root isn't able to connect with the flick
"he's a long way across on off stump, but that bat is able to come down quick enough to meet the ball on off stump. That is a near-perfect lbw delivery..."

"length, 80mph, Stokes comes across on off defends"
"that's torpedoed Stokes, <b>knocked off his feet in front of the stumps!</b> Does Oxenford think it pitched in line...? No!

"angled across, Stokes is crouched and waiting to defned on off stump"
"lovely time, caressed back down the ground! Touch too full from Ishant this time and Stokes rifles the ball for four"
"length ball, curving away as Stokes steps out, left alone"
"tapped to the leg side, Stokes calls him through... <b>and there's a direct hit at the striker's end!</b> Has Root been run out here?! He doesn't look happy, but he waits for the third umpire, <b>who confirms the dismissal!</b> That's a shoddy way to go, though well played Mohammed Shami, who was quick to move from mid-on and fired in a direct hit! Looks like Root hesitated and Shami picked the right end to throw to. England's captain stalks from the field, and India have dragged the game back their way once again"

"shortish on off stump, Stokes is resolute."

"goes back, tempted into doing so by the flatter trajectory, and seems to be beaten outside off. But Kohli wants <b>a review</b>. Good length, spinning in.

<b>caught behind</b>! Just the start Shastri would have wanted in his big booming voice. And Shami provides it on a platter. A tasty little delivery outside off. Too tasty for Broad to leave alone. Goes flashing at it and only succeeds in giving Pant a simple catch
tosses it up outside leg - looking for the rough. Curran lets it go. Pant collects it with his knees.
no shot again with Ashwin concentrating on hitting the footmarks outside leg
"quick and full on middle, Curran keeps it out"
shuffles back to flick it off his legs to deep midwicket
covers his stumps - doesn't matter if he's squared up and is unsure - but defends the offbreak from round the wicket
"lunges outside off, looking for a flighted delivery outside off. It's the one that comes into the left-hander though and Ashwin's not allowed it venture so far that the batsman can reach it with his stride. Good bowling, and he <b>beats the outside edge</b> for his trouble"
"leans into a beautiful cover drive, Curran originally not keen on a single, but having seen his senior halfway down, he agrees to go through."
"short ball, outside off, Anderson drops his wrists"
digs it in again and Anderson goes searching for it outside off. Lucky not to nick off.
"gets inside the line as he helps a bouncer, rearing up at his arm pits, away to the long leg."
even Curran's nervous about the Shami short ball. HIs feet aren't moving even though this is pitched right up there outside off. All that that means his cover drive ends up a dink off the inside edge to deep square leg.
"clips it away, and rather smartly at that, to deep square leg and turns the single down. Shami saves the fuller one for the last ball of the over but Anderson's up for it"
creams it down the ground! Lovely work from Curran. He picks the half-volley early and drums it between the non-striker and the stumps. Can't get prettier than that
goes wide of the crease to pitch into the footmarks outside leg. Curran defends gamely
reaches out to the pitch of the ball outside leg and then plants the straight bat down on it
"waits for the shorter, quicker delivery, all the way back in his crease and then meets it in front of the stumps"
banks on the turn as he opens the face to send a ball pitching outside leg over to cover
"tosses it up outside off, from round the wicket, Anderson ignores it even though it is turning into him"
flat-bats a short ball from outside off to long-off and this time he <i>doesn't</i> take the single. He's learning. Every ball.
"stands up tall and glides it away to deep point. Again, he doesn't quite feel ready to take the run on offer"
swivels on his back foot to send a short ball on off stump away to deep midwicket. This is just a net now for Curran. At least until the fourth or fifth ball of the over...
shifts back to defend a good length ball to the right of cover and now he's happy to trot across.
<b>inside edge</b> and that's all England need really. Anderson certainly does not look convincing against this heat-seeking fuller ball. Shami's so good at toppling stumps. But this time he's denied
"that straight bat of Anderson denies India again. The fuller ball on middle and leg is deflected to short leg, with great determination"
"<b>run-out</b> to end the innings. Curran tries to pinch two after he's beaten by a skidder from Ashwin. The left-hander plays a mistimed pull and pays for his greed. Ishant, the birthday boy, with the throw. Right over the stumps. Sharp enough to beat Curran's dive"
"starts round the wicket with a good length ball, targeting the top of off. Dhawan brings down a straight bat to intervene"
<b>big appeal for lbw with Dhawan not playing a shot</b>! But umpire Dharmasena shakes his head and HawkEye reveals it won't be hitting the stumps. Hasn't come in far enough.
a much better leave from the left-hander with the ball a considerable way outside the off stump
back of a length and skirting by in the corridor. Dhawan isn't tempted
keeps testing the left-hander's patience and Dhawan holds it quite well. Another leave alone outside off
"sucker ball - the one designed for a one-day player, nice and juicy and drivable and wide. Dhawan though knows the responsibility on his shoulders and won't be so easily lulled"
"gets firmly behind a good length ball, tailing into his off stump. That's been his weakness in this series and it'll be severely tested, especially now"
"<B>beats him</b> with the wobbly-seam delivery, pitching on a good length in line with off stump and darting past the outside edge"
"<B>extra bounce now</b> and it pleases Broad very very much. Expresses it, in as many words, to Rahul as well. Worth a chirp after a ball like that - pitching on a length and surging away past the edge"
"back of a length and angled into the right-hander, who stands tall behind it and punches to cover"
"fullish and outside off, Rahul's more mindful of the danger and hoists the bat high over his head. Broad's hitting the deck. Properly hitting the deck."
"now for the other one, into the right-hander. But the length behind short helps Rahul make up his mind to leave it"
"keeps flirting with Dhawan's outside edge, outside off, but he doesn't find Anderson's advances very compelling."
"another very disciplined leave from India's opener, having judged the ball to be too wide to threaten his stumps"
"<b>outside edge</b> as Anderson spears in a fuller delivery at the top of off stump. Dhawan is forced to play and the fact the he does so late, and with the bat face point down, helps the ball goes down before scuttling past the two-man strong slip cordon"
"good length, at 134 kph, but Dhawan reads the line early and since it's nowhere near his stumps, he doesn't care for it"
"<b>lbw appeal again</b> as Dhawan falls over a bit with his flick shot. The inswingers - they have to be the reason Anderson's plying the left-hander with easy sighters outside off. The plan doesn't quite come off with this ball though, heading down leg"
"full and wide, Dhawan's back to ignoring the ball"
"<b>keeps low</b>! There's precious little a batsman can do when ball like that arrives. Rahul walks away after being thoroughly defeated by a good length ball, that under normal circumstances, he would have middled somewhere near his knees. But here, on this dry old pitch, it zoots through at ankle-height, takes a bottom edge, and tramples his stumps"
"137 kph, and that pace shows how pumped up Broad is. As does the bounce he creates, hitting just outside off stump. Pujara leaves well"
"angles into the right-hander and Pujara carefully nudges it away to midwicket, head over the ball, perfectly balanced at the crease"
"<b>outside edge</b> as the fast bowler hits the pitch at a delightfully full length. That's where you target a new batsman, even one who's scored a century in the first innings. Pujara is quite reluctant to come forward. But he compensates by playing with soft hands and finding a single through point"
half-volley on middle and Dhawan picks it away to the deep midwicket boundary. That's good batting. Be aware of the loose ball and punish it to the fullest
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"plays inside the line, with soft hands, which means the <b>outside edge</b> scurries away past the two slips and a gully"
"<b>raps him on the pads</b> and Anderson certainly thinks he has his man. England are in conversation. Root's desperate to get some information. And since he doesn't get anything, he doesn't go for the review. Superb ball from Anderson - it's pitched up, it's angling into the left-hander. Dhawan is not quick enough on the flick and is hit high on his front pad. Might have gone down. HawkEye says umpire's call"
"good length, outside off, lets it go. Dhawan's putting those moments he was in trouble behind him well enough."
"<b>unplayable</B>! Dhawan now knows Anderson's attacking him with pitched-up inswingers. So he's careful to play inside the line, which he really needs to with Anderson's angle round the wicket. He still has other tricks up his sleeve though - like a wobbly seam that hits the pitch and then darts away past the edge"
"full and outside off, Dhawan strides confidently forward to ease it through the covers. There again, he's put the jaffa behind him and gets his runs. Good signs"
waits on the back of a length ball to come to him and then deflects it through midwicket. Clearly that length is much more comfortable for a batsman on this pitch
firm front-foot defence from Pujara to keep out a ball looking for the top of off
ventures forward to a ball right under his nose and then flicks it to mid-on.
"shortish and at Pujara's body again. He dinks it to mid-on, looking for a single, but it's not there. Pressure. Pressure!"
"that's where Pujara wants it. Short and wide. When he's set, he'll crack em for fours. Now, he'll let em go"
"<b>beauty!</b>. Again there's not much a batsman can do. Pujara is set up to play the angle of the fuller delivery coming into him, his hands holding the bat as softly as possible. But Broad makes it hit the pitch and dart away past the edge. Snarl away. This is riveting stuff. Good on Pujara really to not follow the ball"
"full on middle, works it away through midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, Dhawan lets it go. He's judged em well so far"
"<b>so close</b> again! This is pitched up near off stump, forcing Dhawan to play. But the magic in Anderson's fingers makes sure the ball changes direction after pitching and hares past the outside edge"
"bat close to body, open face to pierce the gab past the slip cordon. Three runs for Dhawan as he battles against the might of England's highest wicket-taker"
gets back and across to plonk a dead bat down on a shortish delivery outside off
"lovely back foot block from Pujara, standing up tall and protecting his stumps like a warrior"
<b>given lbw and Anderson roars</b>. Pujara walks down to have a chat with his partner and then goes for a reivew. Its unlikely he'll be pleased with the result though. Peach of a ball though - pitched up to draw the batsman forward and then curling back in off the pitch. Pujara's hit on the back thigh and ball-tracking says it would be clipping the stumps. One of India's biggest hopes for pulling this off goes back to the pavilion. The other one will be walking down the stairs soon
"<B>there's sound as ball passes bat</b> and everyone behind the stumps go up for caught-behind, but Broad just can't hear it. He's done most of his work already - hitting the deck with a lovely ball, a shade outside off, and kicking up to go past the gloves of the batsman. Dhawan's in a fight. In a big ole fight"
<b>beats him again</b> with a shortish delivery that squares up the left-hander. Dhawan's trying his best. He has to play the angle into him from round the wicket. The line is on off stump to. He can't just leave - at best he could do so on length. But it's hard to make that call
"full on of stump, defends"
neat little flick off his toes as Dhawan turns a ball on off stump away to mid-on
"good length ball on and around off stump, he steers it with an open-faced block to third man"
"good length on off stump, Kohli blocks and takes the bottom hand off immediately"
"full and swerving in, Dhawn is falling to the off side but manages to get a good chunk of bat on ball, clouted through midwicket and it runs away to the rope"
"good length and straightening, Dhawan comes across to cover the line"
"gone - <b>thick-edged to gully!</b> Anderson has another! India's gilded batting line-up is well and truly rattled now! Searching line and this has swung enough to square up Dhawan, pushing forward as a healthy edge flew low to Stokes... Anderson's celebration is such that he looks like he might just explode!"

"bangs this in short, calmly nudged away off the ribs for a couple down to fine leg"
tossed up outside off and pushed through a gap at cover
Kohli uses the feet and whips the ball away through midwicket
"spinning in, struck on the knee roll, England go up... Dharmasena shakes his head straight away but England <b>review!</b> This could be tight, but the angles are probably on Kohli's side here; and Joel Wilson thinks he has seen a bit of inside edge involved here, too. <b>So the not-out decision stands</b>... Joe Root is unhappy, England think the spike on Snicko was bat hitting the pad, but no matter, Kohli will continue. How big will that moment be?"

"round the wicket, pitched up in the channel, left alone"
"skids one into the pads, Oxenford gives it... but Rahane <b>reviews</b> immediately! Was it in line with off stump? It looks close, but the on-field decision could be crucial. The no-ball is tight, but Curran has something behind the line. Beat the bat on the outside, struck him on the back pad... Here we go then: <b>outside the line!</b> So the decision is flipped, Rahane is reprieved"

the ball gets caught behind bat and pad as he gets as far forward as he could to smother the turn outside off

"quick feet take him back, and just a shade across on off stump, to keep Moeen's good length ball out"
"shortish on off stump, defends with soft hands towards midwicket"
"standing outside his crease, presumably to negate the movement and also avoid lbws. Certainly helps on this occasion as he defends a fuller delivery on off stump"

"ventures forward having spotted a nice, juicy, drivable delivery outside off. But then checks his shot, the bat face closing a touch as he finds mid-off."

meets the ball where it pitches and defends stoutly
"waits on the loopy delivery to arrive, bends the back knee, opens the face of the bat and scythes it behind point. Terrific shot. One he trots out in limited-overs cricket. And with that bent back knee, and no movement of his front foot, it's all his own too"
"full on off stump, and Kohli's darting out to meet it"
"nice drift outside off from Moeen, and the batsman gets across to block"
"a quicker, straighter delivery, which Kohli negotiates with the help of those supple wrists, sending it to short leg"
has half a shot at a good length ball outside off before his better senses return to him and he leaves it well alone
"<b>inside edge? caught behind?</b>, Broad's certain, but Oxenford shakes his head. England think about a review, and Buttler shakes his head, and his call stands. Good call too. Replays indicate this good length ball, although cutting back in off the pitch to beat Rahane's forward prod, deflects off his back thigh"
"good length, outside off, ignores it"
"teaser outside off - there for the drive, and so for the nick to slip too - Rahane lets it go wisely"
pulls his length back but keeps probing away outside off. Rahane lets it go
drifting a touch too straight - the set up for the lbw or bowled doesn't quite work out as Rahane is able to give it just enough direction to the long leg boundary
waits on the good length ball to come to him - he'd originally pressed forward and then responded to the length - and tucks it past short leg
"<b>huge lbw shout</b> as Kohli is rapped on the pads, in front of middle. Umpire Dharmasena probably thinking it's turning too much. What will Wilson think? Ball-tracking says the impact is outside off and Kohli survives a shooter from Moeen that turns more than enough to probably hit the sticks. Meanwhile, <b>England have lost both reviews</b>. That was ridiculously close. Keeps low. Beats Kohli. Does everything but hit him where England want it to hit him"
"loopy delivery outside off, Kohli whips it back at the bowler"
shifts back and across to work a shortish delivery away through square leg
"rocks back, judging the length to perfection, and slicing the offspinner to deep point. He's getting his eye in."
"tosses it up outside off, defends"
"shortish and outside off, lets it go"
"a hint of shape away from the bat, off the pitch mostly, and Kohli, having moved back and across, ignores it"
"<b>keeps low again</b>, but Kohli is able to bring down a straight bat and bail himself out of trouble"
sweet strike through the covers. And all it takes is a little forward press and a perfectly straight blade. He's switched on. He's keeping the good ones out and going after those that are in his wheelhouse. This is Kohli in one-day chase mode
steps forward and blocks a good length ball outside off
reads the line of this length ball to be outside off and so ushers it across to the keeper
"hammers the wide half-volley against the turn to the sweeper - Moeen usually has one, just to keep him comfortable about not leaking runs."

"flighted delivery a shade outside off, Rahane deals with it well, bat and pad together"
"presses forward confidently with no silly point and defends outside off. The catchers are at slip, and two at short leg"
"<b>inside edge</b> as Moeen does well to pull the batsman forward and across, but gets the ball to dip before he can reach the pitch of it."
"gorgeous drive down the ground, but Broad is able to save himself some blushes by sticking his left hand down and deflecting the ball to mid-off"
"another rock-solid shot from the India captain, meeting the fuller delivery on off stump with a straight bat. Then he informs Rahane that the ball is moving in through the air"
"good length, outside off, Kohli plants the front leg and shoves his bat skyward"
flays it to cover again. England will probe the fuller length outside off and if they can't get the ball to move in the air Kohli will love this line of attack
nudges it off middle stump to mid-on
meets the back of a length delivery right under his eyes and sends it towards cover point
goes for the sweep and weathers an lbw appeal. He won't be too nervous by it because his front foot had taken him well outside off.

ignores the loopy delivery outside off.

"gets some drift into the right-hander. Kohli pushes forward to block, bat and pad together"
<B>big shot for lbw</b> as Rashid sneaks in the googly. Big stride from Kohli though and the impact is somewhere near middle stump. Long way to go from there.

gentle deflection off the open face of Rahane's bat as he slices a well flighted delivery past the right of slip
skips back in his crease to work a good length ball from outside off to short leg
nudges a length ball outside off behind short leg
"strong stride, bat in front of pad, head over the ball. Good technique from Rahane. He's not fazed by the silly point and short leg"
"dangles it wider outside off, and natural variation - the ball that doesn't turn - makes Rahane work extra hard as he goes back to dab it past the right of slip"
meets the ball where it pitches to blunt it just outside off
presses forward outside off to push into the covers
"flatter, quicker legbreak on middle, and Rahane is able to pick it away through midwicket"
hangs back in his crease to play the shortish delivery with the turn to point
that's the long hop; it's always around the corner from Rashid and Kohli belts it away to the midwicket boundary to bring up the <b>fifty partnership</b>
"good length ball outside off, no shot"
"tosses it up outside off, Rahane smothers it"
confident stride to blunt the flighted delivery outside off
"a touch short, which allows Rahane to step back and flick between the short legs"

quicker and flatter from Moeen and Rahane is able to flick it to short leg
"<b>beats him again</b> with a beautiful offbreak, drifting away, which makes Rahane lunge across, and then spinning back in off the rough to strike his body. Bounce, turn, trouble. England have a gem in Moeen."
"full and outside off, Kohli lets it go"
"strong front foot from Kohli, taking him to the pitch of the ball on off stump and then that straight bat is more than handy"
pushes to mid-off

"full on off stump, defends"
"shifts back to whip the googly, with the turn, towards midwicket"
"<b>explodes out of the rough</B> as Rahane moves across to defend. Only the ball surges up on him, perhaps taking a bit of the inside edge and bouncing way over leg slip and into safety. Kohli thinks there's a single, but he's sent back, rightly"
eases it to cover
"shortish on off stump, Kohli clears the front leg and flicks it to deep midwicket"

reads the googly as he shuffles back and flicks a good length ball to deep midwicket

spears the very full delivery outside off away to the sweeper
"tossed up outside off, Rahane keeps it out"
"googly, turning into the right-hander. Rahane gets nicely forward and blocks with an open face, inside the line of the ball, suggesting he picked the variation"

"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"firm drive, with an open face from Kohli as the bowler gets the fuller delivery to shape into the right-hander. <b>Andersin is getting reverse</b>"
full and tailing into the right-hander again. Rahane defends firmly
squares him up with movement off the pitch. Rahane compensates for that with soft hands and finds a single at deep third man
"<b>plenty of curl</b> into Rahane, who ever so calmly works it to deep square leg. Excellent cricket."
"<b>leading edge</b> as Anderson makes the ball move away, against the angle. Kohli is playing that angle, preparing to flick to midwicket and is probably thankful he's using soft hands and the ball hasn't lobbed up"

"on the stumps, straightening a fraction as the batsman presses out"

a delicate little glide to third man as Rahane enjoys staying on the back foot to deal with a short ball
thuds into the middle of the bat as Pandya gets up on his toes to defend
"<b>caught at second slip</b>? England are certainly celebrating, and wildly. That usually means the soft signal's out and, yep, it is. Vicious ball from Stokes, hitting the deck and kicking up on the unsuspecting  Pandya. He's squared up. He's pushing at the ball because he knows he's in the wrong position and he's panicking about it. The outside edge off the very shoulder of the bat flies low to Joe Root, who dives to his right and takes a very fine catch. England are breaking through that door after getting their toe in"
"good length from round the wicket, outside off, Pant leaves it"
wide again from Stokes and Pant's happy to ignore it again

sharp angle into the right-hander and Rahane puts the fuller ball away behind square leg
good length on off stump is answered with sturdy defence

stands up tall against the flatter delivery outside off and punches it back where it came
"a neat roll of the wrists brings up <b>Rahane's fifty</b>. Earnest applause all around the ground, not least from India's dressing room. Moeen might even have enjoyed that considering he bowled this one short and helped the batsman out in his search for runs through midwicket"
"nudges it through midwicket and pinches a second run as well, despite a direct hit. Pant's come out in fifth gear"
reads the line to be outside off and then promtply goes back into his shell

scoops the very full delivery using an open face to the left of first slip. Lots of hands on heads from England.
"taken at deep cover! Pant knew his best way to survive, and possibly to help India get closer to the target, is swinging his bat around. But this time, having taken the trip down the wicket again, he's lashed this, inside out, straight to the fielder. England are closing in."
"eases it back to the offspinner, having taken the stride forward to smother the turn outside off"

this pitched up delivery is driven sweetly to deep cover
"<b>huge lbw appeal and umpire Dharmasena says yes</b>. Rahane's gone for the review though. There is a great deal of turn here. Will it be too much? Rahane is very deep in his crease. And this ball rips in out of the rough, far too quickly for even a set batsman to deal with. He goes for the flick. He's beaten and HawkEye beams three reds. India's final hope walks back to the pavilion. England three away from a series win."

works it off his hips to long leg
keeps out a back of a length delivery that skates away after pitching
"he's back behind the shortish delivery on off stump again. Earn my wicket, says the birthday boy"
"probes a fuller length outside off, Ishant lets it go"
"appeal for lbw and umpire Oxenford sends him on his bike. Ishant's shuffle across the off stump took him a little too far to connect with this length ball speared into middle and leg. And considering he's deep in his crease, this might just have crashed into the stumps"
"creams a full toss away to the point boundary. India only need about 15 more of that. On, on, Shami!"
steers a tossed up delivery outside off to sweeper cover
"good length on off stump, Shami blocks, mostly off the outside edge. What? They all count!"

"goes high, handsome, touches a star or two and then plops back on the turf in front of Anderson who runs across to his left from long-on"
"taken at long-on. Moeen will not be denied at Southampton. He averages something like 12 here and these will certainly help. Shami runs at the offspinner, aiming to launch him straight over his head. Gets too much height, not enough distance and an early party begins in the stands. Well, maybe not that early..."
"steps out to loft Moeen over the infield and out to deep midwicket. Gorgeous strike, even if it wouldn't matter much in the context of, well, everything"
defends a full delivery on off stump
"knows he can't get to the pitch of this flighted delivery outside off, jagging in off the rough and striking Ashwin on the glove. Somehow the batsman turns it past short leg's right"
backs away to slice a short one down to deep third man
"carves it to the point boundary, the width on this ball enabling Ashwin to capitalise"
gets back in line with a shortish delivery outside off. England are giving Ashwin singles all around the park but he's not keen on them

stays leg side of this short ball and slices it to deep third man.

"tapped down towards point, Ashwin calls for a tight single and has to stretch for the line as the throw is fired in by Curran... <b>Needed a direct hit</b>, but Ashwin might have injured himself in the process of making that run!"
"fullish, off-stump line from round the wicket, Ashwin prods at it and gets and inside edge on to his pad"
"pitched up and driven in the air, flying over backward point, where Anderson sticks up his left paw and manages to tip the ball up... <b>but can't hold the rebound!</b> That would have been a superb catch"
"slower ball, flat-batted towards mid-off backing away"
"speared into the pads, stays low as Ashwin plays across the line and misses... <b>Up goes Oxenford's finger!</b> It may or may not have been clipping leg stump [edit: it was <i>missing</i>] but India have no reviews left, and that's the game for England! Fitting that Curran, the man who resurrected England in the first innings, takes the wicket that seals the series after a brilliant contest here in Southampton"
