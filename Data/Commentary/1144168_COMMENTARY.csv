Kusal Perera, the man who defied South Africa in the most epic manner not too long ago, is taken out by a ball measured at 145 kph on the speedgun. And yet it seems as if his undoing is because he is too early into the shot. The ball - back of a length on leg stump - seems to stick in the pitch and the left-hander, looking to flick it over midwicket, only ends up top-edging towards point where Miller runs in, dives forward and takes a splendid catch"
"143 kph, makes him hop with a shortish delivery outside off and Mendis, carefully as he could, dabs it to point"
"148kph, pitches it up and his pace - and South Africa's ploy of bowling short with the new ball - has Mendis stuck in the crease. He tries to work the ball into the leg side, but ends up spooning a leading edge to point"
"good length ball on off stump, Mendis waits on it a little better, meets it under his eyes and guides it to third man"
"126kph, gets behind a fuller delivery on leg stump and turns it to midwicket"
"bangs it in short and outside off at 142 kph, Fernando looks to upper cut it, but he doesn't connect"
"<b>extra bounce</b> off a good length as Mendis yanks his bottom hand off after knocking the ball, on middle stump, to midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, safely defends"
lines up the short of a length delivery outside off very nicely and then taps it on top of the bounce to third man
opens the face and guides the good length ball outside off to third man. Oshada has looked the part this innings. Sensible shots. Good composure. Gorgeous technique.
nudges the shortish delivery off the pads through midwicket
turns the face and guides the ball to point
"lifts it over mid-off. Splendid shot-making! It's pitched up. It's the kind other batsman would only defend. But Mendis extends his hands, using a straight bat, and beating Andile Phehlukwayo"
extra pace here - the ball banged into the deck and rising above the cutting blade of Kusal Mendis
"superb bowling. At 142 kph, even the slightest bit of movement can be dangerous. So Nortje pitches it on middle stump and squares Mendis up as he blocks"
"gets behind the short of a length ball outside off and punches it, quite firmly, to cover point"
chops it down on the practice pitches and it leaps over the point fielder and rushes away to deep third man. It looks a tight second run with Tahir doing wonderfully well but de Kock couldn't collect at the strikers end
"<b>that is all class</b>! The straight drive out of the Sachin Tendulkar highlight reel! From the confident front-foot stride, the high elbow, all the way to treating a perfectly good length ball with regal disdain."
nudges a length ball on middle and leg through midwicket
"hangs back, waiting until the last second to turn the bat face and beat the point fielder. Excellent batting, made possible by him being switched on enough to judge the length of the short ball early"
turns the back of a length delivery out to deep square leg
<b>bouncer</b> but it's too high. Booo! It looks far too awesome to be punished like that. Hitting the deck. Rising above the batsman's shoulder as he sways out of its way outside off
"tries another bouncer, but this time he's waiting, rocking back and hooking the ball to the long leg boundary. Handy top edge but hey, he's racing"
nudges the fuller delivery on middle to deep square leg
slower ball on off stump but Mendis reads it so well and defends it with no fuss
"lets the short ball outside off come to him, showing no fear that it's 143 kph, and calmly runs it down to deep third man"
whips a 144 kph length ball on leg stump to deep square leg. Looks a bit hurried on this occasion
"141 kph, short, mean and angled at the body, but again, Oshada is boss-like, getting up on his tippy-toes and defending it whilst barely batting an eyelid"
opens the face as he steers the back of a length delivery behind point
flicks the ball straying on leg stump away to deep midwicket
"pitched up on middle stump at 141 kph, but Oshada defends it stout-heartedly"
"starts with a full toss - though largely that's because Mendis is so far forward, looming over the ball outside off and flicking it smartly straight of midwicket"
"bowls it quicker and flatter, but the length is still full. That's what brings Oshada forward, with a closed face of the bat. Somehow he's able ot play against the turn and find a single to deep square leg"
"lunges forward outside off, conscious to reach the pitch of the legbreak, and drives with the turn to long-off"
"another shot against the turn, but Oshada isn't able to beat square leg. Tahir is really getting the ball to dip here"
"tosses it up outside off, Oshada defends for once"
"<b>that's the flipper</b> and he bowls it dead straight. Plus it keeps low too. Oshada is right in front of all three sticks but then his bat comes down to save the day. Ooooh, this is fun, but we need to break for drinks"
"hits the deck on off stump at 144 kph, but the sound off that bat as Mendis meets it with his defence is far more striking"
"142kph, gets inside the line of a shortish delivery on middle and leg and clips it to deep square leg"
loads up the pull shot as Nortje goes short again. Hits it in front of square but there's protection in the deep
"full on middle, Mendis gets forward and defends with poise"
"<b>bouncer has him hopping</b>. This is at 147 and it is climbing straight up to his head, even as he gets up off his toes. Mendis is committed to fending it away and if there'd been a short leg, he might have been gone"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"fuller delivery outside off, he gets forward to defend"
width on offer and he leans forward and flays it through the covers. Mendis wants two but Oshada isn't so certain and so they decide to be safe and not sorry
"goes back, and by virtue of that, spots the googly. The good length ball spins into him and Mendis is able to flick it to square leg"
"another googly, which Oshada turns to midwicket"
tosses it up outside off - possibly another wrong 'un - and Oshada hits with the turn to midwicket
"full and outside off, Mendis is to the pitch of it and taps it to long-on"
stays back to the shortish delivery and taps it to point
eases it to point
"shortish on off stump, Mendis blunts it well"
waits on the short ball on off stump and tucks it away to long leg
slips down leg as Oshada tries to flick it
"looks for the yorker, but Oshada is wise to his tricks, turns the straight ball to midwicket"
"bouncer outside off, but he's able to drag it, and keep it down, to find a single at long leg"
"lays into the sweep, taking a length ball outside off and hammering it to the left of short fine leg, but Phehlukwayo puts in the dive and saves the boundary"
whips the fuller delivery on middle to midwicket
"<b>confusion, run-out chance, direct hit!</b> Great work from Nortje at short third man! Mendis is the man running to the danger end but Oshada is never convinced. Worse. He's taken a couple of steps down the track and then just stops. That means Mends has run halfway down the pitch. Then he stops. Seeing Mendis has run halfway down the pitch Oshada accepts the single but by that time the damage is done. Nortje picks the ball up, throws the stumps at the strikers end down and Sri Lanka lose a big one. Mendis actually threw his bat away in pure frustration at that horrible turn of events (Oh and before I forget, the ball was shortish and outside off, Oshada played a deft little dab)"
"back of a length and outside off, steers it to point"
full on off stump but de Silva is happy to stay deep in his crease and block
"<b>doesn't pick the googly</b>. It's a tossed up ball outside off, de Silva lunges forward to block, but he's way outside the line of the ball as it turns the wrong way. Inside edge would have been caught at short leg"
"<strong>a huge appeal for lbw and given by Shaun George!</strong> Oshada sends it upstairs immediately though. Length ball on the stumps and angling on to the pads, Oshada misses the flick and is hit on the pads. The front foot is fine. The ball pitched outside off, the impact is in front of middle and leg but it would have gone on to just clip the top of the leg stump. The umpire's call it is and that was out. Sri Lanka are five down now"
"welcomed with a short one angling across, Thisara sways away and lets it go"
"a touch fuller on middle and leg, Thisara makes some room and drives it towards mid-off"
"short of length outside off, goes back and looks to upper-cut it, misses"

"flatter and quicker on the stumps, defended again"
"fuller around off, pushed towards mid-on"
"length around off, left alone by the batsman"
"too full outside off, Thisara jams his bat at it and digs it out towards cover"
"length around off, stays behind the line and defends"
"a back-of-the-hand slower one gone wrong, length ball down the leg side, helped along to the fine leg boundary"
"a bouncer this time, Dhananjaya ducks under easily"
"length ball on the pads, goes for the flick but misses, off the pads to de Kock"
"length around off, comes forward and blocks"
"length outside off, gets behind it and defends it towards cover"
"a googly around off, pitching on a length and spinning away, Thisara pushes at it and gets beaten"

"length around off, comes forward and pushes it towards mid-off"
"length around off, comes forward to defend, an inside edge towards short fine leg, a bit of hesitation but all safe in the end"

"falls on his back in trying to get away from the this bouncer, was again trying to give himself some room but Rabada follows him"
"fuller on the stumps, flicked towards short midwicket"
"a googly from outside off, comes forward and defends"
"flighted outside off, comes forward and drives it through extra cover for four, all along the ground"

"googly but down the leg side, needs to be bowled again"
"another googly, length ball on the stumps, stays back back and plays it towards square leg"
"length around off, defended from the crease"
"length outside off, fifth stump line, Dhananjaya pokes at it and gets beaten"
"a soft dismissal, chipped to short midwicket, it was fuller on the stumps, Dhananjaya plays a half shot, fails to keep it down and du Plessis accepts a dolly"
"fuller on the stumps, almost a yorker, Dananjaya stays leg side of the ball and gets his bat down to steer it towards covers"
"short of length around off, stays back and pushes at it, uppish but away from any fielder, a single to mid-off"
"short of length outside off, Dananjaya manages to stay away from it"
"short of length again, this time following the batsman who was looking to back away but the ball keeps angling in, manages to defend it on the off side though"
"fuller outside off, clears his front leg and smashes it through covers, past the diving short extra cover for four"

"fuller around off, drilled past the bowler but a brilliant sliding effort by Hendricks at long-off prevents the boundary"
"smashed over midwicket, a huge hit for a six, flighted around off, and Perera gives it his all"
<b>gone this time!</b>. Flighted again but it's a googly this time. Perera looks to go over long-off but ends up slicing it towards deep extra cover where Miller settles under it. It's finishing soon
"full and outside off, he drives to deep point"
"<b>traps him lbw</b>! Tahir's sprinted all the way to point. Didn't even bother to look at the umpire. His finger's up though. And this is special. This is Tahir's trademark. The quicker delivery. The googly. Pitching on off stump. Cutting back into the batsman - a batsman who thinks this will be a leg break and so he can go back and cut. 'Well, boo!' says the ball as it cuts in and strikes low on the back pad in front of the sticks"
"tossed up ball on middle, defends"
"fuller delivery on middle, he defends it"
carves the pitched-up delivery on off stump at 142 kph to mid-off
goes for the ramp against a bouncer angled across him. Doesn't connect. De Kock collects it and immediately asks deep third man to come finer
clears the front leg against the slower ball - on a length outside off - and pulls to midwicket
"taken by midwicket running to his right! It is quick. It is short. It cramps the left-hander and even though he tries to make room, he mistimes the shot, a pull that comes off with the bat still turning in his hands. That means he gets no power behind the ball and South Africa are all set to ride out into the sunset"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
googly - pitching on middle and turning in. The right hander tries to flick but only manages an inside edge
"tossed up outside off, he goes for the big hit, long-off is lurking, but it falls short of him"
full and turning into the right-hander again. He gets forward to block
"huge swing over the leg side the moment he sees the ball tossed up, but the legbreak beats him handsomely. Good work from Miller behind the stumps though. Smart take, quick to break the stumps"
"pushes it through on off stump, Vishwa is able to keep it out"
"wraps up with a googly, which Vishwa taps into the covers"
"full and on off stump, Vishwa, as he did in Durban, somehow gets bat to it and moves off strike. Looks squared up. Doesn't fancy getting in line with the quick delivery. But yet there's the outside edge to the rescue"
"backs away and swats the short ball outside off straight to the substitute fielder Dale Steyn at cover point. Yep, Dale Steyn's a substitute fielder. And also, South Africa have won, despite putting up only 250 on the board"
