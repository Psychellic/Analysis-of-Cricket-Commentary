"<B>chipped in the air, straight to short cover!</B> West Indies pick up where they left off in the second match, a full length from Willey, a hint of inswing, and Hope pressed forward tentatively, head nowhere near over the ball, off the bat sticker and into the hands of Alex Hales!"
"outside off, jabbed to backward point to get off the mark"
"shaping into the left-hander's pads, and clipped to mid-on"
"open face, pushed to point, half forward on a good length"
"back of a length, arrow-straight, and poked out to cover"
"lovely line, drawing a solid defence, Can't argue with that as a first over"
"flogged on the up, through the covers"
"back of a length, dabbed to the off side"
"bashed firmly into the covers, a good sprawling dive from Morgan to intercept the drive"
"good lift on a full length, jabbed down into the crease, and they gallop the quick single"
"slower ball, on the leg stump, and that's superb running, forcing the second to square leg by pushing the first one hard"
"lifter on leg stump, can't get this one away on the angle. Blotted down into the crease"
"ambitious from Campbell, down on one knee and attempted the flip over the shoulder, much as he attempted against Broad in the Test series. Then as now, doesn't come off!"
"more conventional, leaning onto the front foot, attempted clip to leg"
"back of a length on a wide line, a firm pull to mid-on"
"<B>spannered to mid-off!</B> That's a limp drive, but Willey suckered him brilliantly with the slower ball! Hetmyer climbs into a drive, but the ball is a mere 114kph, and never reaches him. Jordan sets himself for the simplest of offerings, and this innings has a familiar feel already"
"back of a length, hint of shape away from the left-hander, dabbed down into the crease"
"outside off, enough width to free the arms, and biffed with a <strong>singular lack of decorum over extra cover!</strong> That'll do"
"zipping through sharply, into the pads as Campbell attempts to whisk one off the hip"
"same leg-side line but shorter this time, and <B>Campbell makes no mistake</B>, anchored on the back foot and bruising the ball through backward square"
"slower ball, outside off, glided to short third man"
"wrong line once more from Jordan, leg-sided, and too short. Swatted through square leg, and Jordan has already gone for more runs in four balls than his entire spell on Friday"
"advancing with intent, but can't free the arms as a battering drive dribbles to mid-off"
sliding past the leg stump
"slower ball, and that's well bowled, dying on the batsman as he jabs limply outside off"
"<B>a h-u-u-u-u-u-ge wipe through the line, and Denly steadies himself well in the covers!</B> That's a dirty dismissal ... played the shot on length, but neglected to factor in the outswing, a steepling leading edge, and West Indies are in bother again"
"back of a length, tight line, defended into the off side"
"<B>edged, gone and Willey has four!</B> That's brilliant bowling, befitting of a Test match, line, length, nip off the pitch, kissing the splice and Bairstow stoops low to gather behind the stumps!"
"solidly forward, full face of the bat, pressed to short cover"
"full face, and defended into the off side"
"firmly blocked, back down the line... stunning over"
"full length, tapped to cover, another sharp single"
skitters through very low outside off... ricochets off Bairstow's knee
tapped to mid-on
"probing on the full length, pushed to cover"
"rising up on the toes, pushed to the off side"
"guided into the off side, very straight bat. That ends a very productive Powerplay for England"
"looped onto a full length outside the left-hander's off stump, clipped to mid-on"
"solid length outside off, and bursts through the hands of short cover to gift the single"
"straightens a touch on middle and leg, tidy lines"
clipped off the pads to midwicket for the single
"well bowled, very full and straight, and solidly blocked"
driven with a full face to mid-off
"sharp from the outset, jagging back on an off-stump line and fenced to the leg side"
"clipped in the air and <B>dropped by Root at mid-on!</B> He was sprawling forward, got his hands to the offering, but down it goes..."
"up on the toes, poked to the off side"
"stabbed down into the crease, Holder loses sight of the ball as Wood suckers him with the slower ball, but he's hustled through by his alert partner"
"on the back foot, dabbed to the off side, Holder wasn't keen on the single that time"
"cracked firmly into the covers as Wood aims for a fuller length, but the sweeper tidies up. That's a fine and unlucky over"
"back of a length, waiting on the back foot and clipped to long-on"
"looking for the big wind-up, but can't get hold of the length in the end, whisked into the covers"
"flicked round the corner, on the back foot"
"<B>here we go!</B> In the slot this time, Holder frees his levers, and pounds a lofted flog over long-off!"
"tossed up again, another big slog through the line, but he's <B>not got hold of this one!</B> Jordan is underneath it, which means this won't be dropped ... England strike again!"
"tossed up onto the toes, flicked to the leg side, and another tremendously burgled over from Denly"
"firmly drilled to long-off, a rolled-wristed drive. Very classical"
"guided down to third man with an open face... 147kph from Wood that time, which isn't slow"
"<strong>short and fierce!</strong> Superb bouncer, targeting the lid and zipping past a hurried pull"
"slower ball, swung lustily out to deep midwicket and <B>Jordan's there, of course he's there!</B> Galloping round to his right, gobbling the firm chance in both hands, and there goes West Indies' last hope of a defendable total. Excellent bowling from Wood, rolled his fingers and suckered the batsman supremely"
"full and straight, solid defence"
"very full again, and a very full face of the bat to defend"
"full length, solid block"
"<B>absolutely battered from outside off!</B> Clean over wide long-on, and <strong>out of the ground!</strong>"
"<B>comprehensively googled!</B> Opened up like a can of worms, plucks out the off stump with the one that rips back into the right-hander. Short and sweet, that is quality wrist-spin from a bowler at the top of his game"
"sliding onto the pads, tucked behind square for the single"
leaning forward to defend back down the track
"curls away from the right-hander, as Brathwaite stretches forward to defend"
"full length, outside off, prodded to cover"
"<B>edged and that's an extraordinary pluck from Bairstow!</B> Zipping fiercely off the edge as Brathwaite opened the face, and Jonny just stuck out a mitt, seemingly beaten for pace and lift, but the ball stuck, and Windies continue to slide!"
"<B>have some of that!</B> That's the way to do it! Leaning back, clearing the front dog, bludgeoning through the line, and clean over the covers!"
"short and sharp, unsurprisingly! Cottrell retreats to leg to have a wipe, but misses..."
"<B>there it is!</B> It comes out as a full toss, but the end result is the same! Out comes the off stump, with Sheldon closer to the square leg umpire than the timbers!"
"round the wicket, very full and straight, flashed into the off side"
"back of a length, flicked from outside off to midwicket"
"full length, legbreak, stabbed back to the bowler"
"full toss, and <B>pongo-ed over the bowler's head!</B> That's gone many a mile. Big man, big levers!"
an inside-out wipe over extra cover! Three men converge but that gathers pace as it pitches and skitters to the rope!
"<B>Bairstow reckons he's got his man!</B> Beats another big wipe, off come the bails, England are already leaving the field ... the foot is bent, on the line, but is there a stud over the line? It's touch and go ... <B>it's not out!</B> Bairstow is livid!"
"<B>beautiful googly!</B> That is just outstanding bowling! Pitches on a perfect length, just outside leg, and clips the top of off! Think of Ashley Giles to Damien Martyn in the 2005 Ashes, then stick it in a mirror..."
"pitched up, swinging a touch, Hales brings the bat down late and clips to midwicket"
"fullish, Hales is forward, tip and run down the ground to mid-off"
pitched up and clipped off the toes down to deep backward square leg
"full on off but there's no swing and <b>Hales dispatches a drive through cover</b>, first four of the innings"
"length ball, slapped over midwicket, dismissive hoick for four more!"
"chipped down the ground, <b>sails all the way over long-on!</b> Not a bad ball from Cottrell, 137kph/85mph on leg stump but Hales just hits cleanly through the line. Moving on, moving on"
"round the wicket, tossed up on off stump and tapped away"
leans out and taps into the covers
"floated a tad straighter and <b>YJB smears it over mid-on</b>, bouncing away for his first boundary"
"drags his length back, defended on off"
"touch wide and Bairstow rocks back to cut, slapped for a single"
"flattish delivery and met with a big lunge on to the front foot, blocked into the covers"
"back of a length, YJB goes back on off stump and pulls through square leg"
"shortish, Hales looks to tee off over the leg side, big old swing and a miss"
"pitched up and driven, well stopped on the dive by Cottrell at mid-off, but they sneak the single"
"short ball, swung away on the pull, just one to deep square"
"fired in full, Hales drops his bat on it and Holder fields in his follow through"
"short of a length, 128kph/80mph and <b>Hales swats a pull behind square</b>, using the angle as the ball comes into him, beats the man set back on the rope"
pushed through on the stumps as YJB backs away and has a hack
"bit of turn this time, Bairstow mistimes a cut into the ground"
"dobbed on off, defended coming across"
"tight lines, bit more flight and YJB taps it down on the leg side"
"flat outside off, another dot as Bairstow can't get away his cut"
"pushed through and again he drops back, can't time the cut shot and picks out point, 'no run' the early call - <b>and that's a maiden for Fabian Allen</b>"
"shortish and pulled, off the inside edge and it runs to the fielder on the ring"
"full and straight and flicked off leg stump, straight to short fine leg"
"hoicked leg side, could be going for six... No, <b>brilliantly taken on the rope by John Campbell!</b> Toe-ended by Hales and he couldn't quite clear deep backward square leg"
"tucked off the pads, risky single to midwicket and he has to dive for his ground... thought the throw misses"
short of a length on the stumps and tapped down
"touch leg side, 125kph/78mph and Bairstow nudges it off his hip"
"dragged down and hauled over midwicket, <b>meaty blow from Bairstow and it skips away!</b>"
chopped back down the track
"slapped through the off side, <b>beats the desperate dive of mid-off and bounces away! </b>England are more than halfway to their target"
fired in and worked off the pads
"clipped back down the track, no run as Allen gives chase"
pushed through and swatted towards backward point
"<b>dropped!</b> Short and pulled, hard and flat to Hetmyer at deep square leg, <b>who almost took it in the gob running in!</b> Pretty straightforward chance, but butchered. He's not had a good few days in the field, this lad"
"length ball, sliding into the pads as Holder goes up for lbw... must have been a scrap of bat involved"
fired full down the leg side
"dug in, the ball sits up to be <b>slotted over the rope at deep backward square leg!</b> Smoked into the grass banks for six"
"back of a length, tapped down into the leg side"
"full of a length, 134kph/83mph and Bairstow flicks it fine for one"
"on the stumps, blocked calmly back towards mid-on"
"flat and wide of the stumps, YJB shows a deft touch as he opens up and guides it behind point for four - <b>brings up the England 50</b>, two-thirds of the way there now"
pushed through on off stump and defended
"dropped into the off side, early call of 'No!'"
"floated up, YJB saunters out, <b>dumps it over long-on!</b> Mind the windows! They were scrambling for cover up on the balcony, there"
"darted, straighter line, worked off the pads"
punched through mid-on coming down
"flights the legbreak, grips and turns - <b>hits the top of off!</b> Stump out of the ground! Bairstow is beaten playing back and West Indies have their second wicket, with England needing a mere 12 to win. Woot!"
"googly from Bishoo, goes back to pull and fails to lay bat on ball"
pushed through and tapped into the off side
"flighted, another wrong'un and Morgan blocks on leg stump"
"floated up around off, pushed into the covers"
"quicker delivery, the legbreak turning just a touch as Morgan goes back and is beaten... <b>A wicket-maiden for Bishoo</b>, keeping things, er, interesting"
lobbed up and worked off the pads
floated up and clipped to mid-on without any power
"darted in on the stumps, Root happy to defend"
"this spins a touch, hits the front pad and Campbell asks the question... Root is thinking about a run but is then sent back, <b>could be tight at the batsman's end</b>, but the underarm shy is off target"
tossed up on the stumps and tapped down the ground to long-on
"oh, <b>this beats everything!</b> Round the wicket and angled in, turns sharply and misses the top of off! Campbell has his head in his hands, so close to a wicket on debut"
"flighted, on middle and leg, nudged down the ground"
"tosses up the googly, Morgan steps out and <b>chips down the ground for six!</b> Only just clears the rope, but that's all it has to do"
"floated up on leg stump and Morgan sweeps it hard and flat for four, <b>meaning England win by eight wickets!</b>"
