"sharp pace, but swinging down the leg side. England are off the mark as Roy attempts a flick but can't time it"
"141kph, shaping into the right-hander, but on a leg-stump line once more, and Roy tucks a clip to short midwicket"
"shorter, wider, <B>chopped fiercely past point!</B> That's how Roy likes to roll, emphatic forearms, powered through the ball, and the fielder has no chance!"
"squared up a touch on a leg-stump line once more, angling in from middle-and-leg, and Roy topples forward in an emphatic block"
"<B>jeepers, that's a tight leave!</B> Bending inexorably towards the top of off, Roy holds his bat inside the line and it was length more than anything that was the deciding factor"
"<B>solid and emphatic once more!</B> It's been a fine over, but it's cost nine already, as Roy leans on a fuller length, full face through the line, and whistling through the covers."
"<B>so close!</B> Was Roy tempted by the gap at second slip? An open-faced steer, or an attempt at least ... but he <I>just</I> avoids snicking through to the keeper"
"shuffling to the crease, with that dramatic javelin jab of the arm, and swinging into a front-foot block"
"half-forward once more, as Bairstow tucks his bat behind the line and defends to cover"
"<B>nibble, nibble!</B> Bairstow is lured forward by the wide approach on the crease, playing for the one angled in, but beaten by one that nips away!"
"solidly forward, head over the ball, and blocked urgently to cover"
"this is a fine over from Bumrah, tight and threatening with every ball on a full length, angled in. Blocked"
fenced down to third man off a controlled outside edge. They jog the single to spoil the maiden over. But it's been a lively start at both ends of the pitch
"<B>struck dead in front of the stumps, but a big inside edge!</B> Crikey, that would have been stone-dead, but Shami knew"
"<B>slashed, inside edge, four runs!</B> Bairstow living dangerously, flinging his bottom hand through the line and so nearly taking his off stump with it! But there's no-one to cut it off at fine leg"
fenced firmly into the covers
"wider line, left alone with a flourish outside off"
flogged firmly into the covers! Half-stopped as mid-off ran round to intercept
"<B>this one scuttles!</B> Intriguing signs, as the ball keeps low outside off and Bairstow is flat-footed on a wafty drive"
"poked firmly into the gap in the covers, Roy takes his chance to play Bumrah from the other end ..."
"right behind the line of the ball, pushed with solid hands out to point"
firm in defence once again
"wider on the crease and fires in the yorker! But Bairstow is equal to it, punching it with bottom hand up to mid-off"
"slightly mis-directed this time, on the pads, and Bairstow needs no second invitation, clipping with the angle towards the short boundary. Pant made good ground but the ball dribbled out of his reach"
"fenced to the leg side, solid in defence once more"
"<B>sizzler outside off, and Dhoni is beaten as well as the batsman!</B> Wicked late wobble from an impeccable seam position, and England pinch the bye"
"clipped off the toes once more, as England keep the runs ticking in the face of a threatening new-ball burst"
"<B>another slashed inside-edge!</B> Bairstow has got that shot down to a tee! Once again, a cramped drive, with the bottom elbow losing shape on impact, and the stumps nearly wearing the deflection!"
"more robust in defence this time, leaning forward to block into the covers"
clipped off the toes to short midwicket
"<strong>hard-handed once again from Bairstow!</strong> He's by a distance the least settled of England's openers, but he's finding a way nonetheless. A thick outside-edge this time as third man sweeps around"
"striding onto the front foot, firmly clumped up to long-off for the single"
"leg-stump line, YJB stretches forward and nudges to the leg side"
"<B>flogged by Bairstow!</B> Drifting onto the legs, he opens his stance a fraction and batters a lofted drive over long-on! One bounce, just inside the rope"
"beaten by a big turner outside off! Off come the bails, to lots of excitement but his back foot is well anchored"
"fenced out through point, a long chase as they sprint back for two"
striding forward on a middle-stump line and blocked.
"firm lines from Roy once more, meeting the angle into the bat with a perfectly posed drive to mid-off"
"<strong>extra nip on the back foot! </strong>Roy wears this on the glove, but Bairstow is alert, stealing the single to point as the fielder swoops in"
"sliding into the legs, a slightly wafty one-handed wallop across the line as Bairstow fails to line up a pull"
"width from Bumrah, Bairstow meets it at the top of the bounce with a cross-batted chop into the gap at point. Another useful single to the cause"
"<B>edged, but soft hands!</B> Hits the bat hard from wide on the crease, but slip gathers on the second bounce"
"flicked to the leg side, another over negotiated"
"slides back and across, creating room for a punch to the off side"
"fired in on a leg-stump line, Roy stretches those dodgy hamstrings to defend on the front foot"
"dancing feet, looking for the cut through point, not quite timed"
nudged into the off side with dancing feet
"<B>crashed with power through the covers!</B> Waiting on the back foot, ready to pounce, and with a nugget of width he was ready to unleash those forearms"
"<B>contemptuous!</B> Slower through the air from Chahal, a long way outside off too. But Roy read it from the hand, waited on one knee, and pounded it with glee through midwicket! This is a very promising sign for England..."
"firm block on the back foot, down to mid-on"
"high elbow, firm in defence once more"
"Bairstow throws his hands through the line once again, a touch too tight to the body for the drive"
clipped off the toes to the leg side
"back of a length, angled into the off stump, blocked with intent into the covers"
"<B>maiden for Bumrah!</B> That angle into the right-hander pays dividends once again, but England still going well against the other bowlers..."
"<B>a violent smear!</B> Outside off, and Roy takes the view that it ain't hitting the stumps so it can be dispatched anywhere. No contact this time, but the intent is plain ..."
"fuller length, shaping back into the right-hander, a good riposte, as Roy drives off an inside edge to midwicket"
"well bowled again from Shami, dragging the length back a touch, attacking the top of off, and drawing a respectful, head-bowed block"
solid in defence once more. Ten dots in a row now as the pressure is cranked up a touch
"angled defence into the off side, a single at last"
"solid defence on the off stump, to end the Powerplay with another tight over"
"outside off, swished with an open face down to third man"
"back of a length outside off, pushed back down to the bowler"
flipped off the pads to the leg side
"<B>short and sharp</B>, good change-up and Roy is beaten on the pull as Dhoni gathers in front of his face"
"<strong>big appeal from India, but the umpire signals a wide!</strong> Roy was using his feet, attempting a slashing pull, the ball past close to the gloves, and <B>yes, a review would have dismissed him!</B>"
<B>launched over long-off!</B> Does Roy believe his luck is in? He certainly plays this one with the freedom of the reprieved! A majestic clobber high into the stands!
"<B>chancy but safe!</B> Roy throws the hands once more, doesn't connect properly this time, but cover can't swing round to intercept ... gosh ... what a sliding doors moment!"
pushed with an open stance into the covers
"Roy rocks back, climbing into a cut, but point is well placed to cut it off"
"a bottom-handed flog, along the ground to long-off"
"on the back foot, meeting the legbreak with a tentative closed-batted dab"
"<strong>drift and spin, and Bairstow is beaten!</strong> Caught in two minds on the back foot ... misses the edge and the stumps by a whisker!"
"<B>absolutely pounded, and so close to holing out to Bumrah!</B> Any more elevation and it would have been straight down his throat at deep midwicket. Instead it skipped one bounce off the turf, thudding into his upturned palms"
"a round-house pull through the leg side, timing and placement as England keep the runs pumping"
"<B>that is majestic!</B> Planting the front foot, flinging the hands through the line, and dumping the ball with the straightest of swings for a one-bounce four over long-on!"
"banged into the pitch, down the leg side, a slight deflection prevents the wide"
"slower ball, ghosting into the pads as Bairstow tucks a shot to midwicket"
"angled into the pads, clipped with poise through square leg"
"angling forward, closing the face on impact, another good over, so no need to up the ante at the end of it"
<strong>reverse sweep!</strong> Pinged through backward point to put the pressure on Chahal right from the start of the over ...
"<B>crashed out to short cover!</B> Excitement for the crowd, but that was a bump ball"
"<B>formidable and punishing!</B> Bairstow seizes on the length, pirouetting through his bended knee and battering a slog sweep high over cow corner!"
"leans back for a fierce cut into the covers. Intercepted again, but every shot right now is a furious one ..."
"googly into the pads, Bairstow can't fence it away as it deflects to the leg side"
"head over the ball, solid block to dot up another run-laden over"
"a cautiously blocked sighter off the back foot, making space on the leg side, but exercising caution"
<B>that is a stunning straight blow!</B> One sighter is ample as Roy saunters to the pitch of the ball and lambasts a flat drive over the bowler's head!
"dancing at the crease again, cut hard into the covers"
"<strong>full toss, and crashed with stiff forearms over wide long-on!</strong> Pick your spot, and cash in!"
"a delicate dab, down on one knee, deflected so fine for a long chase through backward square. A good slide cuts off the boundary"
eased with lots of bottom hand to mid-on
"opens the face, and guides a checked drive into space in the covers. Gasps from the crowd, but fell well short ..."
"leaning back for an ungainly wipe, misses out"
"<B>there's a man back on the rope, but Bairstow has got too much on this one!</B> Spring-loaded forearms once again, picking the ball up from a full, leg-stump line, and KL Rahul flings himself backward at long-on to no avail!"
eased into the leg side for a measured single
"wide line, cracked with power into the covers, as Roy bends his knee into a stretched smear-drive"
"<B>launched once again!</B> England are now officially on the rampage! Another ball in the slot, another contemptuous club over long on! The ante has been upped, the game has been raised ... the World Cup survival fight is ON!"
fuller one driven straight past the bowler
eased down to long-on from a full length on leg stump
"crashed through the offside again, but didn't have the timing on it, so long-off is able to run to his left and clean up"
clipped comfortably off his pads to long-on to raise a fine <b>fifty</b> on comeback. What a difference Jason Roy has made today
"<b>that is just thumped. THUMPED</b>. Dances down the track, gets to the pitch and lifts this over the sight screen. Shredded"
"down the track again, but Kuldeep has managed to get this to dip a bit so Roy ends up defending it back with a straight bat"
"stayed in his crease to guide this fine, but not fine enough so short third man fields it"
"quicker one, skids through and stabbed out towards cover"
some drift in that and Bairstow unable to whip this off his pads. Three dots in a row!
"googly, and he's not read it at all, goes back to slash it but it goes flat and spins back in to hit him on the pads. Easily going down leg, despite the excitable (and understandable) appeal"
"fuller this time, driven firmly to cover"
"<b>slam!</b> five dot balls and Bairstow rocks back to smear this over wide long-on. No fielder there, and it just clears the rope. An over that was looking like it could hand back some control to India has ended up costing six runs - that's been England's batting today"
"wanted to club that into one of the canals in Birmingham, but didn't get hold of it, one bounce to deep midwicket"
goes back and across to flick this off his hips almost to deep midwicket from the back foot
"slows it up, and Roy is a mite early into the drive, ends up toe-ending it back to the bowler. Bump ball, so even though Kuldeep tot into a tangle with Bairstow while going for it, wouldn't have mattered if he caught it"
goes back and tucks this to short fine
"<b>that one's outta here!</b> Slog sweep from the Steve Waugh manual, going down on one knee and well forward, read the length and the turn and just sent it over the boundary"
clipped to deep square that time for a couple
"down the track, giving himself room and slashes this over cover. There is protection in the deep, but it's in the gap enough to net two"
"length outside off, Roy was a touch early into his punch. Some balls seem to hold up when pitched on a length. Goes safely though into the cover region"
"fuller, driven crisply, but straight to cover"
"ooh swing and a miss to one that kept low. Fuller length outside off, cross-seam, and Roy's big drive connects with air"
"gets hold of that one, back of a length outside off and slashed through point, but there is a man in the deep"
"slower ball fools Bairstow! But his checked off-drive falls safely. That spooned up in the air over mid-off, but well short of long-off"
"<b>clears long-on again!</b> The luck is firmly with Bairstow in this game. Down the track, didn't get hold of it exactly, but got enough meat to go over long-on"
"good length turning into him, he turns it off the back foot with soft hands to deep square"
"good length on off, spinning into him, stands tall and punch to long-on"
"he's still tossing it up, and Roy clears his front leg out to smear this with power straight down the ground. Not off the middle of the bat though, so long-off has time to come around"
"<b>inside edged onto boot</b>. Minor victory for the bowler. Went for a booming drive that rolled off inside edge and boot into the offside. For a moment, Bairstow thought that might have gone on the stumps, but the inside edge has been his friend today too"
"googly, plays it off the back foot, read it off the pitch and jabbed it towards gully"
"swing and a miss! Slower ball, on a length outside off and keeps low again"
"digs it in short - they've not really explored that option, India's quicks, today - but Roy is equal to it, pulls it powerfully to deep square"
"length ball, nipping into him a bit, uses the angle to turn it to deep square"
"slower bouncer outside off, waits for it and doesn't go too hard on the pull, keeps it down to deep square"
"slower ball off-cutter again, coming into his pads, stabbed past mid-on. Hung in the air for a bit, but safe"
"fuller on off stump, clipped to mid-off and they get a quick single. Direct hit from Chahal there but the batsman was in"
"<b>Jadeja pulls off a blinder at long-on</b> Roy is in disbelief, but he'll have to go I think. This was a bit of a top-spinner, Roy got to the pitch to cart it down the ground but didn't get the elevation. It still looked like a one bounce four until Jadeja came sprinting to his left, dived full length and plucked the ball inches from the ground. He's a wonder in the field is Jadeja, and it's needed that moment of outlandish brilliance to break this opening stand."
"fuller, driven gently to long-on to get off the mark"
"nice length, gets Bairstow stretching forward to smother it in defence"
"nice drift from Kuldeep across Bairstow, but he comes forward again and smothers it in defence"
"googly, and he plays it off the back foot, guiding it to short third man for a quick single"
goes deep in his crease to clip this off his pads to short fine leg
"angling into Root, who stays in his crease and glides this down to third man"
"back of a length, stays in his crease and punches, there's a fumble by the cover fielder, and allows a single"
"<b>run out chance</b> but safe. A touch too full and clipped off his pads to deep square leg. The fielder is quick on his feet and rifles in a throw to the non-striker's end, forcing Bairstow to dive. The throw wasn't the best, so he's safe"
steered to third man
"yorker goes wrong, full toss on the pads, flicked to fine leg"
"<b>half-deliberate outside edge goes for four</b>. He was looking to open the face and play it fine, but not <em>that </em>fine too. Just about eludes a diving Dhoni's right glove, in fact I think it brushed it, on the way to the boundary"
"length ball outside off, holds its line after pitching, pushed to cover"
<b>brilliance from Bairstow</b>. Toying with the field now. Saw the ball flighted and full and pulled out the reverse sweep. No short third man and too fine for the man on the boundary. Perfectly executed
comes on the front foot to nudge this towards square leg
"spinning into him from outside off, he goes back and plays with the turn to flick this to midwicket. The fielder dives but can't stop cleanly"
"good length, forward defensive, rare shot"
"nicely tossed up, Bairstow stays in his crease and drills this to long-off"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off, a slightly tentative push takes the inside edge and bounces down, trickles past off stump"
he's figured out that slowing up the pace works better has Hardik and he's bowling at that speed. This one is guided past backward point
"fuller on the stumps, Root gets behind the line to defend"
"fuller and still very straight, normal pace, uses his wrists to turn this into the leg-side"
"bouncer to Biairstow on 99! Pacy one surprised him a bit, went over his left shoulder. Misses out on the hook. Kohli teases a review but he's not going for one. And replays confirm there was no edge anyway"
"<b>first World Cup hundred for Bairstow</b>. Back of a length and pulled to deep square for the single that will get him there. He had some stuff to say before this game, and even started off tentatively here, but he's backed up his words with deeds. Been irresistible for the second two thirds of his innings."
"fuller, comes forward and pats it in defence"
"didn't read that, normal legspinner spinning into him, goes off the pad"
"<b>that's just outrageous</b>. Most people have different sweep shots. He has different reverse sweeps. He had hit one very fine earlier. Now that the fielder is fine, he smashes one square. Leaves the fielders standing"
"googly, he follows it with his hands to try and dab it to third man but misses"
stroked to cover
"<b>another reverse sweep!</b> This is just mastery and disdain. Picks out yet another gap, past backward point this time. Whew"
"Back of a length, nipping into him, goes back and tucks to fine leg"
"length ball on the stumps, flat-batted to mid-on"
"too short, sat up, slower ball, and he waits for it and smears it to deep midwicket"
"good length outside off, dabbed to third man"
"fuller outside off, had a thrash at it without moving his feet, rolls to backward point off the under-edge"
"slower bouncer outside off, such lack of pace it dies on Dhoni too and drops in front of him. He tried to cut it but was too early into the shot"
"bowls this on middle and leg line though, and his tucked to deep square leg"
"length ball on middle and leg again, Root goes inside the line and clips it fine enough to get two"
"a mite shorter, he goes deep in his crease to pull, but doesn't get hold of it, only travels to square leg"
"quicker and flatter, thuds into the pads, defeats his flick"
"gives it more air, and Root stretches his front foot forward to clip this to mid-on"
"keeping to that restrictive line - I guess the slip is there for the surprise googly - but he hasn't bowled any wrong uns this over. Middle and leg, cramping him up, and he whips to short fine leg"
"bangs it into the pitch outside off but at slower pace, Bairstow has to manufacture pace on it, pulls it from outside off to deep square"
"<b>beauty</b>. There's a half appeal, but that went off the pad to Dhoni perhaps. Yes, off the pad, seamed in and snuck through between bat and pad and went to Dhoni. No lbw because too high"
flicked off his toes through midwicket
"another slower bouncer outside off, but gets this to rise till the shoulder. Root adjusts to tap it down to third man"
"he's going to bowl short outside off, without pace, to Bairstow. Has three fielders on the legside boundary too. Bowls it again and Bairstow mis-times his hoick into the legside"
"back of a length coming into him, flicked off his pads to deep square"
drifts on the legs to start though and is easily turned to square leg
"oooh, almost fell in the trap. Bowled it on the leg stump and got Bairstow to go inside and sweep, but short fine is in place"
"another one full and down leg side, but misses his line a bit so it'll be a wide. Excitement from the crowd because the bails were dislodged, but off dhoni's pads"
"big shout, not given. Bairstow was clearing his front foot to slog sweep, dont' think he got an inside edge, but that might have been missing leg"
"pushed through quicker, glided to short third man"
"quicker again on the stumps, stabbed out to extra cover"
patted back to the bowler
"back of a length, finds the spot in the pitch from which there isn't much bounce. On off stump, Root defends from the crease"
"fuller, he's walking forward and across and clips this off his toes to mid-on's right. Wayward throw means there is no danger in the quick single"
"fuller on the fourth stump, cover-driven but not timed, and straight to cover. Took his top hand off the bat too while driving."
"<b>caught at deep point!</b> Shami will feel he has earned this wicket even though it's come off a very tame shot. This one was dug into that length area outside off again, didn't rise a whole lot, he was looking to thrash it through the offside but ends up slashing to the man stationed perfectly. End of a great innings"
"dug in short, well directed and Morgan clambers down out of the way"
"teasing line, rising from a length outside off, Morgan allows this one through"
"over the wicket, sliding across the right-hander, who goes back as the ball skips through to Dhoni"
"flighted, straightening on middle and leg, worked away defensively"
"tossed up, Root leans on it and taps in front of extra cover for a quick single"
"gives this some air, Morgan goes for the reverse-sweep early, not the fullest connection and short third man cuts it off"
"doesn't pick the wrong'un, <b>nearly cuts him in half going back!</b> Tried to cut but the ball zipped back at him aggressively, just manages to keep it away from the timbers"
"tossed up and touched behind square on the leg side, just another single to finish a good over"
"round the wicket to Morgan, comes across on off and defends"
"full, 143kph/89mph outside off, gets him flirting with the drive and beats the outside edge"
"fullish, driven back down the ground without timing"
"short ball, <b>Morgan sends a spiralling top edge on the hook - taken!</b> Bounced out again, not a great look for the England captain, although he's a man who lives by the sword. Pushed across the batsman by Shami, got too big on him, never in control of the shot and Jadhav did really well running around from fine leg to take the catch diving forwards!"
"fired in full on off stump, Root blocks steadfastly"
"over the wicket, good length on off stump, tapped into the covers - <b>wicket maiden for Shami</b>, a brilliant intervention from him here"
"nearly a mix-up, but Root gets back at the non-striker's end! Tucked into the leg side and Root thought a single was on before being sent back by his partner"
comes forward and strokes this through mid-off
"floated up from over the wicket, Root punches down the ground with an open face"
"drifting straighter with his line, worked to the on side"
"bit of grip now, <b>clips the outside edge but dies in front of slip</b>, runs away for a single"
floated up on the stumps and Root goes back to nudge one behind square on the leg side
"tight lines from Shami, who's on one at the moment"
"fullish, not far from sneaking under the bat as Root drops it in defence"
"short ball, Root takes it on confidently and swings one away through square leg"
"pitched up around off stump, Stokes pushes it along the carpet to mid-off"
"slower ball, kicking up as Stokes stays in the crease and steers towards point"
"short ball, 134kph/83mph and Stokes is happy enough to swat it into the ground"
"length ball on middle and leg, stabbed towards midwicket from the crease"
"angled across, 133kph/82mph and tapped to extra cover coming on to the front footq"
"on the stumps, Stokes chops down on it and Root calls him through as the ball rolls behind square"
length ball sliding in and whipped off the legs for one
"pitched up a fraction, Stokes guides one more off the pads through backward square"
"fired in straight, Root tucks to the leg side"
"over the wicket, tossed up and cramped on leg stump as he tries to sweep"
pushed through and tapped to the leg side
"flighted, outside off and Stokes reverses the hands, <b>breaks the boundary drought with a slap past short third  man!</b> Chahal holds his face, frustrated at seeing that one get away"
"could be a tight second... but Stokes charges back in time! Came down the pitch menacingly, looking to cosh through mid-on but got a thickish inside edge square for a couple"
straightening on the pads and skimmed fine for a couple more
"floated up full, defended towards midwicket"
"pitched up on middle stump, Root flicks but finds midwicket"
"lovely timing from Root, clips this off his toes in front of the man in the deep on the leg side and they hare back for two"
"short ball, rolls the wrists on a smooth pull for one to the sweeper"
"full and straight and glanced through backward square, just the one on offer"
goes back and across and dabs this to third man
"short of a length, spits up off the deck and Stokes thrusts the hands a\t it, punched through point"
"dragged down the leg side, Stokes has a hoick on one knee but misses out"
"tossed up straight, Stokes goes leg side, <b>bullocked up over square and bouncing beyond the man running around!</b> Shami was behind square and couldn't get there, though Chahal looked like he wanted to see more than a forlorn outstretched arm"
"flighted, Stokes sweeps this hard and flat straight to deep backward square this time"
lobbed up and worked off the pads
"oh boy, that's OUTRAGEOUS! <b>Reverse slog-sweep over deep point!</b> Stokes turns himself completely around and scoops this high into the crowd with a murderous mow of the hands!"
"flatter delivery, punched down the ground"
"Root now gets funky, gets away a cheeky full-face dink over Dhoni, short third man cuts it off though"
"pitched up, Root squeezes it down into the off side behind square"
"pushed across the left-hander, Stokes makes a bit of room to slice a couple through backward point"
skips down and <b>humped over extra cover!</b> Not right out of the middle but he clears the inner ring and Pandya has to run a long way round in the deep
"whirring in on a length, Root opts for defence on off stump"
"dug in short, good height around off stump but Root controls his pull for one to deep square leg"
"short ball again, Stokes rocks back and skims one more down to fine leg"
"no one out there, though! <b>Pongo over the leg side and it goes all the way!</b> Just a skip and a clip off the legs but launched a full 91 metres, well beyond the rope"
pushed through as Stokes comes down and whips away to deep midwicket
"slapped off the back foot, <b>misfield gives Root four!</b> Pandya was sliding across to cut it off at deep extra cove but somehow ended up missing the ball. Just Root's second boundary"
tossed up and poked into the covers
pushed through and tapped down into the infield
"full on the stumps, Root swings across the line and sends this uppishly towards deep square leg for one - Chahal completes his <a href=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=conceded;team=6;template=results;trophy=12;type=bowling;view=innings target=_blank>most-expensive spell </a>in ODIs"
pitched up and clipped into a gap on the leg side
pitched up and poked back into the off side
"short ball, 142kph/88mph and Stokes is dancing across to try and ramp the ball, ends up aiming a roundhouse swipe towards fine leg but doesn't connect!"
"driven to mid-off, Root was looking for one but has to scurry back"
"dug in short, this time Stokes manages to get it away on the pull"
"full and wide, Root goes back and angles the bat for a single to third man"
"low full toss on middle and leg stump, Root hoicks it for one"
"another full toss, <b>slotted off the pads between two men in the deep!</b> Poor ball and Stokes carts it into the gap for four"
swung for one to deep square leg
"bit of width, Root goes back and dabs the ball late, <b>terrific diving stop from Rishabh Pant at short third man</b> - that was heading for four, otherwise!"
"short ball, pulled hard and again Pant throws himself on the edge of the ring to limit the damage!"
"pitched up outside off, Stokes attempts some funkydory reverse-kerjiggering once more.. and fails to connect"
"full and scooped leg side... <b>but brilliantly caught by Pandya running around at fine leg!</b> So Root's attempt to up the ante ends his stay, though it's probably acceptable collateral damage for England. Third wicket of a good display from Shami"
pitched up and drilled into the covers for one
"full on middle and leg, 141kph/88mph and Buttler flicks it straight to midwicket, Stokes was halfway down when the run was refused.... <b>but Bumrah misses with a throw to the non-striker's end!'</b> Would have been long gone"
"short ball, Buttler sees it early - <b>KABOOM! Six over deep midwicket!</b> He's absolutely <i>smashed </i>that, sends his second ball into the crowd!"
"slings down a full bunger, Buttler times this off his toes, should get a couple to deep midwicket... but a misfield from Kohil, of all people, means they can come back for three!"
"shortish, slower ball, I think, Stokes' bottom hand comes off the bat as he carves through extra cover - needs a diving stop out on the rope, prevents a third this time; <b>fifty up for Stokes</b>, third in a row at this World Cup"
"shortish outside off, coming in from a wide angle, Buttler waits and runs it behind point"
"bottom-handed whip through the leg side, Stokes connects well and gets it in front of the deep midwicket sweeper"
"superb ball from Bumrah, dipping slower delivery on off, can't get under it"
"dug in short as Stokes went across and tried to premeditate, can't connect with a wild swing - and he won't get the wide he wants, either"
pitched up and squeezed into the off side
"<b>canny stuff once again</b>, full and quick outside off, 143kph/88mph and Buttler is late on a drive, beaten - just four off the over from Bumrah"
"full toss, Stokes toe-ends a club down the ground, <b>beats the man running across at long-on</b> - that'll be four!"
"pitched up on middle and off, Stokes helicopters this away through wide long-on for a couple more"
"full, 141kph/88mph and drilled down the ground, just a single - <b>that's the England 300 on the board</b>"
"pace off, but he's missed his mark, sliding leg side and Buttler heaves it away behind square on the leg side!"
"another full bunger, <b>c-r-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-n-c-h-e-d over long-off!</b> Didn't look like he'd timed it but the ball sails just over the rope!"
"got him, <b>juggles the caught and bowled!</b> Nervous moment for Shami, as a dolly return catch almost squirted from his grasp - but he's removed the ever-dangerous Buttler! Went to his strength, short and fast and Buttler's pull came off the splice, went straight up"
"fired in full and straight, clipped off the pads as he overbalances a touch"
"slower ball, wide of off stump and Stokes hangs back to guide it for a single"
"dug in short, 143kph/89mph and Woakes flaps at a pull, top-edged down towards fine leg... but it doesn't carry"
"full on off, Stokes bottom-hands a whip firmly but straight to midwicket"
"banged in at 90mph, <b>top-edged again but this will fly for four!</b> Got a chunk of bat on it and the ball went between the two men back, only the third boundary Bumrah has conceded today"
"fired in full, Woakes doesn't know much about it but digs the ball out for one"
"hammers the short ball, <b>this time the loopy pull will go to hand!</b> Shami gets his five-for, using the bumper well, Woakes just swinging blindly and sends it to deep square leg running in"
"round the wicket, goes full but this becomes a half-volley that <b>Stokes brutalises through cow for four!</b> Dealt with"
"six this time,<b> swung over deep backward square leg!</b> poor bowling from Shami, dots it on a length and Stokes just picks it up by the shoulders and dumps it over the rope!"
"smeared wide of long-off! Leaning back as Shami misses the blockhole again, <b>Kohli is beaten running along the boundary</b>, doesn't even bother to put in the dive"
pitched up and slugged without timing to deep extra cover
"full length, driven down the ground to long-on and Stokes says 'No, thanks, I'll keep the strike'"
"pinpoint yorker to start with, excellent bowling and Stokes can only drop his bat on it and shake his head"
"full and clipped off the pads, out towards deep backward square leg... <b>Stokes slips at the non-striker's end</b>, no chance to push for the second run"
"full outside off, big ole breezy yahoo from Plunkett, fails to connect but Stokes is sprinting down to run the bye as Dhoni shies and misses"
"scooped off the stumps - <b>but straight to fine leg!</b> There was a man back and Stokes picked him out, having wracked his brains for any method of getting Bumrah away! <b>The front foot is tight on the line</b> but I think that's <i>just</i> about okay... Yep, Stokes was lingering on the boundary rope but he's told to be on his way"
"brilliant once again from Bumrah, fired in full and there's another swing and a miss"
"finishes it off, yorkers to order and Plunkett can only manage to squirt it a few yards into the off side for one - <b>immaculate figures from Bumrah</b>, whose last five overs went for just 26"
"good carry, on a length and shaping away outside off, lets it go through"
"back of a length outside off, has a waft at it, under-edges it and drops it down on the pitch"
"brings it straighter, on the fourth stump line and fuller, Rahul comes on the front foot to drive gently to cover"
"good length on off, and jagging across a bit, thuds into the bat as Rahul defends getting behind it"
"another back of length outside off, and he under-edges an attempted square drive"
"closer to off stump on a length, punched to extra cover. <b>maiden to start</b>"
"<b>that's just outrageous</b>. Very first ball, it's a half volley outside off alright but he seems to gently push it only. and it races to the long-off boundary"
goes back to length now and Rohit defends with a straight bat
"back of a length outside off again, punched to cover"
"<b>dropped by Root at second slip</b>. Easy, easy chance what have you done Root! Shaping away from Rohit, who goes for the big drive, gets a healthy edge - very straight to Root. In and out."
and there's the sprinkling of insult to add to injury. Archer goes too full again and Rohit just opens the face of his bat to stroke this through point
"better line, kissing the fourth stump and getting good carry from a length, Rohit lets it go"
"good length outside off, lets it go"
"back of a length on off again, punched to cover off the back foot"
"<b>caught and bowled!</b> Woakes brought the line closer, Rahul was moving inside the line to flick this, too early into it and gets a leading edge. it's dying on Woakes but he gets down low and snaffles it, diving forward and to his right! Rahul's not had a memorable match, wonder if his injury was hampering him when trying to play that shot? Anyway, he's gone."
"length ball outside off, he goes forward to meet it with bat and pad close together and punches to point"
"fuller, clipped to mid-on"
"full and close to off stump, driven to cover. <b>second maiden for Woakes</b>"
"short of a length, tapped back to the bowler off the back foot"
"ah, he's hit that spot outside off on a length from which balls die. Gets it to nip in and Rohit has to get his bat down in a hurry to ensure it doesn't hit pad first"
"back of a length outside off, punched to point"
"<b>beauty</b>. But good on Rohit to play inside the line and with bat close to body. Beautiful channel from Archer, angling in one degree and moving away just that much"
"fuller, punch-driven, but can't beat the off-side ring"
"dug it in short and Rohit wanted to pull, but that's 146 kph and sometimes those are too quick for even Rohit to pull. Gets a glove down to fine leg"
"fuller outside off, patted towards cover"
"straighter, clipped off the pads to midwicket"
"very full outside off, punched with an angled bat towards point"
nipping into him and he was looking to flick it away but it hits him on the pad. Going down comfortably though
"seemed to stop on Rohit a bit off a length outside off, and he had to check his drive. Trickles to mid-off"
"<b>run out chance almost</b> Rohit patted it towards short mid-on and set off, but Woakes swooped on it like an eagle on his follow through and under-armed it back to the stumps. Rohit had to scramble back. <b>Three maidens in a row!</b>"
<b>snorter</b> What an absolute ripper. Bouncer that's homing in on the throat and Kohli has to sway his head out of the way at the last moment
"<b>edge goes wide of second slip!</b> A tentative jab by Kohli, who was coming on the front foot, but Archer had bowled it on a length and moved it away."
<b>creamed</b> - Kohli's saying he's not going to give this over to Archer entirely. Leans into the cover drive and sends it Rolls Royce like to the cover boundary. Unfazed by the last two balls
"length ball, tapped back to the bowler's left"
"good length, on the fourth stump, punched towards point"
"good length and on a tight line again, Kohli is happy to defend into the offside"
"fuller, <b>first runs off Woakes</b>. Thick inside edge off a forward prod that goes to square leg"
"full outside off, Kohli moves across to clip to mid-on"
"Full outside off again, Kohli goes across and gets nice timing on his flick, but a wide mid-on slides to his right and fields"
"length ball outside off, and Woakes almost ran into that deep silly mid-off fielder in picking it up on his follow through. Almost, no damage done."
"under-edge! Shorter outside off, Kohli saw the chance to crash this off the back foot but gets an under edge that bounces psat off stump"
"he gets the placement right that time, walks across to another full delivery to clip to deep midwicket"
"full, tight on off stump, gets behind it and blocks it back to the bowler"
"pulls the length a bit back but keeps the line on off, Rohit taps it gently to mid-on"
"takes the quick single that time. Could do it because he played it with very soft hands, same ball, same line, length on off, but good calling and running"
"sticks to the tight length outside off to Kohli also, and he taps it back. 150 kph"
"digs it in short and climbing into the body, Kohli swivels to pull but doesn't get hold of it properly, pulls it down to fine leg"
"<b>pacy bouncer</b>. Climbing outside off, Rohit throws a full-blooded pull at it but doesn't connect. Goes over his shoulder"
<b>imperious</b>. He's treated Woakes like a net bowler there. Walks down the track and drives him over extra cover.
"goes fuller that time, but Kohli stays in his crease and clips to mid-on"
"length outside off, jabs it towards point. looking for a single, rightly sent back"
"very full outside off, Kohli was in position early having gone across and flicks it off his pads to deep square leg"
"walks down the track too, but Woakes pulls his length back and Rohit can only nurdle it into the leg-side"
"fuller on off, steered to point"
"back of a length outside off has worked for Archer, so he sticks to it, on the fourth stump line. Defended into the offside"
"back of a length again, gets this to nip back in, Kohli stabs it into the offside from his crease"
<b>swing and a miss</b> Moved across and wanted to smash that into oblivious but the pull shot connects only with air. Archer shortened his length there a bit
"back to length bowling around off, and back to tapping it back to the bowler"
"oh this is good bowling. Gets this to rear up from back of a length and Kohli can only awkwardly dab it down to third man, nearly off shoulder height"
"good length outside off, defended."
"back of a length outside off, sits up a bit and he can punch this through extra cover"
"fuller on the stumps, defended back to the bowler"
"full outside off, fluently stroked through cover but there is protection in the deep"
"given room outside off now, still keeping it full, square drives it with feet static"
airy waft outside off and he's lucky he doesn't snick it through. Plunkett got this to nibble off the seam a bit
"back of a length and well outside off, Rohit is getting impatient. Aims another big drive but can't connect"
"back of a length, stump to stump to start, worked off his pads to deep midwicket"
"back of a length, nipping in, 145kph, jabbed back to the bowler"
"<b>there's the pull shot</b>. Not all that short, but Rohit created the length by going back and heaved it to the wide long-on boundary"
"goes fuller and in the channel, Rohit steers to backward point with bat close to his pad"
"ooooh, too close to cut, but he tried it anyway. Doesn't connect and the ball whistles past off stump. <b>in fact he seemed to have got a faint tickle on it but it landed in front of the keeper</b>."
"and he nails another pull. Short ball climbing onto him, swivels and pulls it from leg-stump to fine leg. The fielder is very fine and the ball will beat him"
"has him feeling outside off for that! You dont normally see Kohli follow the ball with his hands only but that's what he did here, to a length ball outside off"
and beaten again! cross-seamer that bounces higher than expected and Kohli is trying to nurdle it to third man but it goes over his bat
this time Kohli decides to take his typical big stride out to meet the ball and runs it to third man off a thick outside edge
"fuller on off, stops a bit but Rohit waits on it and strokes it gently through cover"
"yorker on the fourth stump, dug back out to the bowler"
"very full on off, gets the front foot moving to drive through cover"
moves across again to flick this from outside off to fine leg
"digs it in short and quick, but Kohli is onto it, pulls it to deep midwicket from in front of his face, almost standing face to face with the bowler. Bairstow keeps them to two, sprinting around"
"back of a length and nipping in, Kohli wanted to flick off his pads but doesn't connect. Isn't too happy about missing out"
back o fa length but hits the spot at which the ball isn't bouncing much - even though this was 146 kph - and Kohli jabs it from the crease towards point
"<b>regal</b> Cracking sound off the bat, driven on the up, giving himself some room and it screams through extra cover and to the boundary"
"length ball on the stumps, jabs it back past the bowler"
"outside edge goes to third man. Flayed at it with feet static, takes the outside edge"
punches this back of a length ball to extra cover
"fuller, pushed to mid-off and takes off for a quick single"
"back of a length, scrambled seam that holds on the pitch, Rohit wants to pull but has completed the shot before the ball goes past"
this one goes through at quicker pace and Rohit misses with the cut.
"takes a step down the track but the bowler bangs it in and Rohit is late on the pull, gets pinged on the back of the helmet"
"length ball outside off, Kohli walks across and slaps it to deep square. Bairstow runs to his right to save this one"
"fuller length outside off, Kohli meets it with the full face of the bat, to push to cover"
"length ball, tucked from off stump towards midwicket"
"back of a length on the fourth stump, stays in his crease and glides it off an open bat face to third man"
"clipped off his pads, but nice work by Root at midwicket to dive to his right and stop the ball, cutting down any thoughts of a single"
another length ball dying on Kohli he ends up defending it. Swishes angrily at the air after that
"nicely stroked past a diving backward point, to his right. Raises the fifty-run stand, but it's come at a fairly plodding rate"
"<b>sumptuous</b> once again by Kohli. Didn't have to move his feet, but his balance was perfect, and he unleashes another drive through cover, bisecting the in-field and placing it well enough so that the man at sweeper cover can't get to it"
"short ball, climbing on him, defended back"
"fuller outside off, driven again but not off the middle. Archer at mid-off tumbles to his right to save"
"<b>there's the Rohit we know!</b>. Short ball, pulled off his hips in front of square, two bounces into the midwicket boundary"
guided to point
"dug this in short but it's pacy. Kohli wants to pull it, but gets it off the bottom half of the bat to midwicket"
"cracked off the backfoot, but a diving stop by backward point keeps them to one"
too close to cut and too quick too perhaps at 147 kph. Rohit doesn't connect
"back of a length outside off, dabbed to third man"
"back of a length on leg stump, 147 kph again. Kohli can't connect with the pull"
"another back of length ball but this time outside off, well placed by Kohli just past the backward point fielder. Third man has to run to his right to collect"
"tosses up a loopy, lazy legbreak outside off, patted towards point"
"gives this some air, turning a touch as Rohit clouts one through the covers"
"flighted, a touch wide and Kohli throws the hands, mistimes a mow into the off side"
"tighter to off stump, presses forward to defend"
"pushed through out the front of the hand, Kohli drops back and whips into the leg side"
"legbreak on middle and leg stump, tickeld down the ground"
shortish and tucked down behind square on the off side
"angling in with the arm, Kohli punches breezily down the ground"
"length ball on the stumps, defended"
"138kph/86mph on off stump, sliced, one hand off the bat - <b>but just manages to clear the infield!</b> Stokes is frustrated, but signs that Rohit is unhappy with the way England have tied him down"
"lovely timing from his partner by contrast, <b>whistled away into a gap in front of deep midwicket!</b> Hands, eyes and bat all synching up to perfection for Kohli"
"beautiful shot once again, timed on the up through the covers, well stopped out on the boundary - <b>half-century up for Kohli</b>, who's got that look in his eye"
"now Rohit finds the middle of the bat, <b>lofted over cover and away!</b> Too full outside off from Rashid and he's pinged for the rope"
floated up and defended
"spinning on leg stump, hits the pad and rolls back past the stumps"
"gives this some air, Rohit comes down and drives one in to out"
"flighted, steps on to the front foot and strokes down the ground to long-off"
"pushed through, slightly wide and Rohit clatters a cut past the dive of point, Vince left in the dirt and that'll scoot to the fence, too"
dropped into the covers for a quick single
"short of a length, coming back in and Rohit thick-edges down into his front pad"
"fuller, 142kph/88mph on middle and off, flicked to midwicket"
"<b>belted through cover!</b> Full and wide, invitingly slottable and that's what Rohit does, latching on to skelp four"
"on the stumps, tucked away for one"
"length ball, going on with the arm, Kohli dabs into a gap at midwicket, thinks about two... <b>India bring up their 100</b>, skipping along nicely now"
punched down the ground with a bottom-handed flick
"flights the legbreak, Rohit attempts to paddle... <b>Ooh, where's that gone??</b> The ball lobs up behind the batsman, not far from the stumps in the end"
tucked into the leg side
Kohli uses the feet and taps for one
"floated full on off, defended softly"
"full and flighted on off stump, <b>another creamy lofted cover drive from Rohit!</b> That's a princely hit and quite a way to bring up fifty, too"
"full on the stumps and clipped for a single to deep square leg - <b>that's the 100-run stand, too</b>"
"shortish, Rohit is back in the crease and glides it fine for a couple"
"pitched up, worked off the pads again"
"nippy bouncer from Stokes, over the shoulder as Kohli swivels and thinks better of pulling"
banged in at 142kph/88mph and worked off the body to leg
"good length around the line of off, Rohit bows his head over a forward block"
"<b>brutal striking...</b> Full and wide and laced disdainfully in front of the cover sweeper, who had barely moved before he had to give up the chase"
floated up and worked off the pads behind square
"tossed up on the stumps, driven down the ground"
"slows up his pace, letting the legbreak turn as Kohli goes back and punches square off the back foot"
<b>bowling Rashy!</b> Beautiful drift and dip before the ball spins sharply past the outside edge... Only takes one good ball
"floated up on off, cut firmly through point for one into the deep"
"short ball, heading leg side and Rohit gingers up the front knee as he whips a pull away through backward square"
"width now, 139kph/86mph and <i>flayed </i>through point! There was a man out there but he barely moved"
"fuller and <b>guided to the deep backward point boundary!</b> Three in a Ro... Sitting back and just steering it behind the sweeper, superb timing again"
"cross-seam, pitched up and mistimed on the up, bounces short of mid-off"
"tighter from Stokes, played back down the track"
"back of a length, wide of the stumps and angled down to third man - now that's an over to make England fans shift uneasily in their seats"
"lobbed up on the stumps, swept and swept hard! <b>Four more through square leg</b>, taken on the full and rammed home"
"pushed through, shorter length and tucked to long-on"
"flat legbreak outside off, Kohli drops back to cut"
"tossed up and spinning away, too far for the umpire's liking"
straighter line and tapped towards extra cover
"better length from Rashid, straightening on middle and leg, Rohit blocks"
"tossed up full outside off, throws the hands but slaps straight to backward point"
"starts with a legcutter, gripping a touch outside off as Kohli dabs at it and misses"
good length and poked towards backward point
"slower ball, leg side and flicked to fine leg for one"
"in the channel, Rohit drops back and angles one more behind point"
"short ball, 148kph/92mph and Kohli rides it well, cross-batted dab to third man"
"pitched up and driven, the crowd erupts in expectation... but that's just one to the cover sweeper"
"oh, that's gone wrong... flung down very wide, another for the underused extras column"
"back of a length, 132kph/82mph and lofted up over cover, bounces out to the sweeper"
"[rubs eyes] oh Virat... <b>Steers a length ball to backward point!</b> YES, YOU READ THAT RIGHT! Another fifty but no cigar for Kohli, who has given England an opening just when things were beginning to get itchy! Eager to get bat on ball, maybe skidded through a touch, and Vince swallowed a fat outside edge"
"tapped into the covers, and what are you thinking Rishabh...? Has to turn and fling himself for his ground after setting off instinctively!"
"<b>strangled lbw appeal</b>, maybe too high - they scamper through this time, as the ball loops towards backward point"
"defended on the stumps, <b>AND PANT HAS GONE WALKABOUT AGAIN!</b> Backing up a long way and then realising there was <i>absolutely no run on</i>, but the throw was off target"
shortish and glided for a calm single this time
"good length around off stump, defended"
comes across and shows this a straight bat
"touch short, tries to whip this to leg and gets an inside edge on to his pads"
"good length, around off stump and Rohit again plays watchfully into the covers"
"slower ball, worked into a gap for one"
"good length on off stump, 142kph/88mph and met coming forwards by Pant, who closes the face and whips past the dive of midwicket for his first runs"
back of a length and turned off the hip
"tight lines from Plunkett, met coming across and steered to backward point"
"shortish, 131kph/81mph and Rohit drops back to angle this down to third man"
"possibly a cutter, Pant leans out and defends into the covers"
"short of a length, jagging off the surface as Pant heaves at it and fails to connect"
"another cutter into the surface, down the leg side, though"
"nagging away, 128kph/79mp[h on middle and off, Pant works it to midwicket"
"short and wide, neatly swiped off the back foot by Rohit, runs away to deep backward point"
"on the attack again, <b>launches a cutter over mid-on!</b> Half a step and then hits through the line, up and over the infield for back-to-back boundaries"
"fullish on the stumps, straight-driven for one as mid-on comes across"
"hurled down at 143kph/89mph, Wood on his knees in his follow-through as Pant crabs forward to defend"
full and fast and clipped off the pads through square leg for one
"dug in short at 88mph, Rohit calmly swivels on a pull to deep backward square"
"short ball, Rohit miscues into the leg side... <b>but it lands safely!</b> Pitch wedge rather than the driver there, but he got away with it"
on the body and turned to midwicket
"short ball, rising up around the armpit, Pant swats a pull for a couple"
drilled in front of the cover sweeper! <b>Lovely timing coming forwards</b> and Woakes fails to cut it off despite a full-length dive
"short of a length, rocks back and dabs this behind point"
"length on the stumps, Rohit loses his shape but gets a thickish inside edge"
"dug in, sure enough, mistimed on the pull for one dribbling towards midwicket"
"good line, just outside off and played late with an open face for a single to third man"
"short of a length, pulled away through square"
"banged in at 141kph/88mph and Pant hops on one leg to pull at the last minute, a blur of limbs for one to fine leg"
"short again, over the stumps and paddled down into the midwicket area, no chance of a second"
"fired across the bows, Pant plays it late again, slightly outside-edgey but the ball runs wide of Buttler... just one as third man comes across, to end an over of singles"
"good length, but slightly off pace around the off stump. Pant defends"
"practically sweeps the good length ball outside off to deep square leg. Originally thinking about a pull, maybe, but then with the pace taken off again, he decides to get even lower and sweep"
works the full ball on the pads to midwicket
<b>another century</b>! And it comes off a neat little chop behind point. There's really not enough room for the full blooded shot. So he checks himself. Which he's done all innings considering this is a two-paced pitch. Good gritty innings from India's outstanding opener.
"short and outside off, slashes it over to deep third man"
pulls the bouncer on middle away to deep square leg
"<b>the bat's gone flying to the keeper!</b> He was looking to swat this over deep square, but doesn't connect, because the bat's flown out of his hand and over his head. Landed in front of Buttler"
"another big swing outside off, no connection. Bat stays in hand though"
"<b>nails it this time!</b> Short ball and he picks out the short boundary at square leg, pulls with power and precision"
"rinse, repeat - but there is a fielder square now, so he gets only a single"
"swipes a full toss down to square leg, tried to hit it too hard and ended up not timing it. Once bounce to the fielder"
"<b>clears mid-off</b>. He wasn't intending to go there, this is a pull shot over extra cover that goes for four. Was late on it, bounces up till his shoulder but he swipes it so hard that even with that kind of contact, he's standing almost parallel to the batsman - it carries over the in-field"
"<b>he's taken the big one first ball back</b> What a return! Slower ball, off-cutter that he rolled fingers over. Rohit wanted to send it over cow corner, ends up edging behind."
"<b>cracked</b> through the offside first ball. Short and outside off, he plays a horizontal bat slap through cover. Bairstow does excellently to tumble, slide and save the boundary, thrown in with some fancy footwork too"
"<b>reverse sweep, top edge, and safe!</b> everything happened in that ball. Chuck those self-help books and watch Pant for insouciant confidence. Tries a reverse sweep off a length ball, it takes the top edge, bashes into his body and lobs up near point. Three fielders, including keeper and bowler, converging. But safe"
punched back to the bowler off the back foot
"Pandya stays deep in his crease as is his wont, and horizontal-bat-slaps this to mid-off"
"fuller outside off, and superb timing on that, just stroked through extra cover. Some running for the man in the deep to do"
"swing and a miss - there's going to be one an over with Pant. Length ball angling across, targetting cow corner, connects with air"
"nibbling around the offstump line and guided to third man, who's standing very fine"
"<b>big shout for lbw</b> but they won't review. Wood was interested, but I think too high. Comes in with the angle and catches Pandya on the crease, hits his pad flap. Morgan consults Buttler who advises against the review"
goes well back and swats this to mid-on
"length all on leg stump, and Pant was walking across to cart this over square leg. Doesn't connect, and wears it on the thigh pad"
<b>smack</b> that goes... over wide mid-on. Too full and a full extension of the arms to send this to the wide long-on boundary
"length ball wide of off, but Pandya has moved across and smeared this with power - straight to extra cover though"
"<b>stunning</b>. He was moving across, Woakes tried for the leg-stump yorker, doesn't quite pull it off, Pandya goes very deep and unleashes a full-blooded on-drive, holds his shape beautifully and it goes over mid-on"
and that's the bottom hand power of Pandya on show. Not that short but he goes deeper and slaps this through extra cover. No chance for the fielder who is very square
<b>outrageous!</b> There are two fielders on the legside in the V - long-on and deep midwicket. And he's bisected them. Too full from Woakes and with Hardik going so deep in his crease he can lift this off a half-volley and into the gap
"walks further across and twirls this to deep square, but splendid work by the man who's quite wide and dives to save the boundary"
<b>bullet straight drive</b> but Root sprints very fast from long-on to slide and save
"<b>stunning take by Woakes!</b> He's been carted for runs in the past over, but he pulls off a ripper on the square leg boundary, running and diving to his left, perfectly timed to snatch the ball inches from the turf. Pant was looking for his favourite walk-across-hoick to square leg and seemed to have nailed it. Until Woakes flew past."
"slower ball on a length, walks across and swipes it down past the keeper very fine, but fine leg is also fine so can get around in time"
goes for the wide one outside off and it's ruled <i>just</i> too wide. So he'll have to rebowl that
"poor bowling and he's punished, but <b>Bairstow hares from deep square leg to his left and dives to save the boundary</b>. Too short, sat up and Hardik swatted it into the legside. Outstanding work by Bairstow."
"another short ball, this time up to the chest and Hardik places his pull shot well to get another two, between square leg and fine leg"
"fuller outside off, pushed to mid-off from deep in his crease but he's quick to take off and get the single"
"length ball outside off, he's just let this go. Wise perhaps, keeps Pandya on strike for the next over"
"cleverly bowled, slower ball and fuller, wide of off, Pandya is already standing well across so it cramps him for room and he ends up pushing it back to the bowler"
"another slower one and fuller outside off, smeared through extra cover"
"full on the fifth stump, Dhoni lashes it through cover"
"length ball outside off, he's bowling it slower - that's the pace to go, ask Pandya to generate all the power. He flat bats it through extra cover again"
"<b>just past Rashid at backward point</b>. This would have been another Superman catch, he was flying to his left. Full toss outside off, and Pandya lashed this hard, gets a boundary"
"well wide of off again, but Pandya is standing across, so it's like a length ball on the fifth stump, chops it past cover"
"flat and on the stumps, punched to long-on. Stokes is there so they wisely decide against the second"
"too short and Dhoni rocks back to pull this, but cannot go past short fine leg"
"bowling a good restrictive line is Rashid, pitches on leg and spins across, Dhoni can only tuck it to short fine"
flat and on leg stump again - this is good bowling at this stage - and Hardik can only push at it to long-on
"sharply spinning from leg across Dhoni, who goes right back and whips this to long-on"
"fuller on the pads, and driven to long-on again. Successful over from Rashid, kept the runs to singles only"
"has an almighty thwack at it, but without timing. Only 120 kph, Pandya can only hit it to long-off"
"<b>high, very high and lands just inside the boundary</b>. Got waaay more height than distance but it lands a foot inside long-off boundary and rolls over. Full swing of the bat, got the toe end"
"surprises him with a short one outside off at normal pace and Dhoni is late on it, the ball thuds into the end of his bat and rolls back towards the bowler"
"keeps it full and tight, no room for Dhoni to free his arms and he clips it to long-on"
"excellent by Woakes, another one with the pace taken completely off, length outside off, and Pandya thrashes it again with a horizontal bat but only trickles to long-off"
"back of a length outside off, another slower one. Dhoni can't read the change in pace, slashes at it, connects with air"
"slower ball on the fourth stump, Pandya was backing away and ends up throwing his bat at it, the ball rolls back to Archer"
"length ball outside off, pace taken off again, and he can only steer to short third man"
"goes for the quicker yorker, but misses so Dhoni is able to push-drive the ball through cover"
"back to length ball with the pace taken off, and Dhoni slashes it to short third man. They take the single - England let them, they won't risk overthrows"
"and that is another good surprise ball, bouncer into the body tucks him up, he moves across and paddles it but short fine is in place. This was also slow, 118 kph"
"and Archer, the man who can deliver 150kph off an ambling run-up, finishes the over with another 120 kph trundler that Pandya can only jab towards long-off"
"yorker on the seventh stump, wants to thwack it with a huge bat swing. But it's too far from him and he can't connect cleanly. Trickles back to the bowler"
"length ball on off, goes aerial now, lifts this over mid-off with a straight drive. But no power on it. England have been BRILLIANT at denying Pandya pace on the ball. Brilliant"
"<b>bang!</b> This was at normal pace, banged in too short, Dhoni rocks back and slams it into the midwicket boundary. India will need many more of those though"
and loses his line to go very far down leg. He'll have to rebowl that
"pace off again, length outside off, and Dhoni waits for it and batters it towards cover"
"<b>caught by Vince at long-on</b> and that should be the game? Pandya was frustrated into mis-timing that due to England's plans against him. This was on a length and around the fifth stump, he was moving across and didn't have the room to free his arms but aimed a big swipe anyway. Takes the top edge and swirls to long-on. That popping noise you hear is the sound of several countries' hopes being burst"
"slower ball, length outside off, beaten by the lack of pace as he tries to heave across the line"
"short of a length and into his body, swivels and keeps his pull along the ground to deep square leg"
"back of a length, normal pace nipping into Jadhav, who tickles it down to fine leg"
"too short and sat up asking to be hit, Dhoni pulls this to the fine leg boundary"
"again back of a length angling into him, goes to pull but gets a glove down to fine leg"
another ball climbing into his chest and swivelled down to fine leg
another one climbing into his chest and swivelled down to fine leg
"length ball outside off and nipping away, squirted into the offside"
"length ball on the stumps again, and it's just a single, turned to square leg."
"and there's another one, turned off his pads into the leg side"
"slower ball, strays on the pads, he tries to sweep it hard but doesn't connect and it only goes to short fine leg"
"moving across but Archers sees that and bowls a short one well outside off that ends up cramping him, so he can only dab it to third man"
"full on off, driven to the man at sweeper cover"
"climbs on him and takes the glove while he's trying to hook it, goes to fine leg. Painful blow, hit on the right thumb."
short ball into his body again but Jadhav swivels to pull - doesn't get timing on it and can only send it to deep square leg
"too short and pulled away, but once again it is to a fielder in the deep"
"backing away, but he follows him with the short ball, slashed down to third man"
short down legside and he'll have to rebowl that
"down the track, big swing but the ball sneaks through under his bat, past leg stump"
"digs this in short again, pulled to deep square leg"
"banged in on a hard length and Dhoni misses the pull again, the ball goes past off stump"
"<b>misfield by Stokes at deep midwicket</b> - and he can't believe it. Fuller and quicker, Dhoni clears his leg and smears it into the legside. Stokes has it covered but it suddenly slips through"
slashed to deep point
"yorker on the fifth stump, twirled to deep midwicket"
"waits for  it, slower ball, length on off, pushed to point"
"finishes with a quick bouncer, too quick for Jadhav who is late into the pull. Ball sails over his shoulder"
"<b>smashed</b> and India's first six of the innings comes in the last over. Normal pace, banged in short and Dhoni corks it out over deep square leg"
"fuller on off, smeared to deep midwicket. <b>He refuses the single!</b>"
"another one right out of the screws, nails the pull but this time the placement is not as good, Stokes collects on the bounce at the midwicket boundary. <strong>This time Dhoni takes the single.</strong>"
backs away and slashes this over point. Another one banged in short and a well-executed shot. Maybe Dhoni shouldn't have refused that single eh?
he responds with a quick bouncer on the stumps and Jadhav has not backed away enough to cart that into the offside. Takes the end of his bat and bounces back to the bowler
"backing away again, Woakes follows him with a yorker that is flicked to deep midwicket and <b>India's unbeaten run in the 2019 World Cup is over</b>. England are back on track, back in the top four."
