"good length outside off, punched through cover"
"length ball outside off, pushed to point"
"pitches it further up and finds some movement in the air, beats Karunaratne's attempted drive"
"too full and fairly wide, stroked nicely going down on his knees to drive, but can't beat cover"
"length on the fourth stump line, nudged to midwicket"
"back of a length in the channel, patted down in defence"
starts off with a back of length ball outside off that is defended on the back foot
"gets it to nip away on a length, the batsman tried to drive with feet static, gets an inside edge onto pad"
"nicely cut off the back foot. Back of a length, he didn't have too much room outside off but those powerful forearms come into play as he cuts it through point"
"strays on the pads, flicked to fine leg"
"length ball, but straying down leg, he tried to get inside the line and hoick it, but doesn't time it too well. Runs down to fine leg"
"length ball in the channel, cuts it to point"
"full outside off, too full, and he stands up tall to punch it straight back past the bowler"
"<b>straight to point</b>. Short, wide and he could have slapped this anywhere. He didn't really move his feet  and stretched to reach for it, ends up slashing it straight to Fabian Allen at point."
"<b>got 'im first ball!</b> Hint of movement away from the batsman, KJP is new to the crease but decides to go for the big booming drive first up to this full one. No feet moving - just like Dimuth - and he's only managed to get an audible snick through to the keeper."
"goes for the full ball on off, a touch too full perhaps. Mendis stays still and plays it late, with a gentle push to the bowler's left to get off the mark"
"<b>beaten</b>. What is with the Sri Lanka top order being trigger happy without moving feet? This one was slanted across him on a full length, and he went for the drive, ends up missing it."
"length ball outside off, tapped to point"
"back of a length outside off, punched to point"
"length ball angling into him, plays with an angled bat to push this to mid-on"
"quick single taken from an inside edge to short fine leg. Nipping back in a tad on a fuller length, he was trying to stand tall and punch through cover, but it takes the edge"
"<b>dropped by Pollard at first slip</b>. Straightforward chance. Straightened off the seam outside off, and took the shoulder of the bat with some extra bounce. Went at a comfortable height to Pollard's left and he clanged it."
"fuller outside off, driven to mid-off"
tries too much and strays down leg. He'll have to re-bowl that
"<b>rapped him on the wrist</b>. Bit of extra bounce again, took off from a length outside off and he was looking to just defend it, but it moves in and bounces more than he bargained for, so gets a hard knock on his right wrist and forewarm. Painful blow."
"length ball on a tight line on off, defended carefully into the offside on the back foot"
"<b>edged to the third man boundary</b>. It's the first four of the innings. Length outside off, and he slashed it very hard. Safe shot in the circumstances because third man was very square"
"good comeback by Cottrell, yorker tailing into middle stump, he keeps it out"
"fuller on off, stroked to point"
"full toss on off, punched to mid-off"
"fuller on the stumps, driven back but straight to the bowler"
"length outside off, squirted to point"
"length ball angling into him, he moves across and short-arm sweeps it to deep midwicket"
"angling into him again, and turned off his pads to fine-leg's left. Not the best bowling, giving the batsman scoring options on the legside, where he has a lot of gaps. It's an offside packed field"
"still not getting his line right is Holder, another one that's quite straight. this one is punched to mid-on though and no runs"
corrects his line now to outside off. Batsman tried to slap it through the offside but it trickles back to the bowler off the toe end
"good length coming into him but outside off, punched back to the bowler"
"fuller outside off, leans into the extra cover drive and times it well into the gap"
angling across him but too far outside off and it's a wide
"full on off, driven powerfully but can't beat point"
"dug it in short, on the stumps, but it doesn't rise much. Mendis shifts weight back, swivels and pulls it to the midwicket fence. Fully in control of the shot throughout"
"fuller outside off, driven to mid-off"
"poor ball, digs it in short again - this is not the pitch to do that - and Mendis gleefully accepts the gift by pulling this hard and true to the square leg boundary"
goes back to the fuller length and keeps it on a sixth stump line. Left alone
"length on off, punched to mid-off"
"fuller on off, tried to drive through extra cover but it comes off the inside half of the bat. Pops up in the air for a bit but safe, and goes to mid-off"
"<b>lovely shot</b>. Too short again, that has not worked for West Indies. Sits up on off and Avishka moves across and pulls it in front of square powerfully"
"fuller on the pads, clipped to short fine leg"
"leading edge travels over the bowler's head and has to be pulled in from near the long-off boundary. this was not short enough to pull but he stayed back to whack over midwicket, didn't get hold of it"
"too full, on the pads again and flicked to fine leg"
"length outside off, pushed to mid-off"
"good length on a tight line outside off again. Tried to move across and whip it on the onside, but doesn't get hold of it"
"fuller outside off, stays still and steers it to third man"
"length ball, a bit straighter, clipped to midwicket"
"fuller on off, punched past the bowler. Mid-off has to go to his right to collect"
"fuller on off, tapped to cover"
"too full and straying down leg once again is Holder, is punished for it this time. He just had to get some bat on it and he did. Beats short fine leg"
"length outside off, cuts it between cover and point"
good length outside off. That line has been most productive for Holder. Pushes the batsman on the back foot with extra bounce and he can only tap it to the bowler's right
"strays down leg again, but the batsman was moving across. Clips his pad on the way to the keeper. Holder is mildly interested in a possible caught behind. Good take from Hope, who dived to his left to gather it"
"length outside off, cut to point"
too far down leg again and that'll be a wide
"length outside off, left alone"
"fullish, on off stump, poked into the covers and they take one"
West Indies' discipline issues have carried over into this game. This is down the legside as well.
"short and into the body, a swivel pull from Mendis goes straight to the fine leg fielder, and they take one"
"more legside issues. That's the fifth wide of the innings, and we're barely through the Powerplay"
"full, almost yorker length, on off stump. Pushed to cover"
"length ball, outside off stump, swinging in slightly. Avishka stays rooted to the crease and fends this away to third man"
full and on middle stump. Defended to midwicket
"length ball on the pads, clipped square on the legside, and fine leg has to run in to keep that to one"
"shortish to begin with, turning away from off stump. Mendis gets back, gets low and pulls that well in front of square, into a gap around midwicket. Easy two."
"fired in on about middle stump. <b>They appeal this</b> after it hits Mendis on the pad, but it's probably sliding down leg."
"sightly shorter again, and Mendis goes back once more to shovel this into a gap behind square leg"
"floated up around off, pushed into a gap near cover for a single"
"floated up again, defended more or less down the pitch by Avishka"
a loopy one outside off stump to finish the over. Driven to deep cover with the spin.
"length on off stump, driven to mid off"
"slightly fuller and wider of off stump, defended to cover this time"
"tighter in, length on about a middle stump line. Fended away to the cover region. Avishka thinks about a run but decides against"
"legside again, but not so far down leg that it's a wide. Actually hits the back of Avishka's pads, which takes some of the pace off. They run two."
"slightly shorter and on the stumps, Avishka tries to heave this to the midwicket boundary, but can't get a great connection. It floats up well in front of square on the legside. The deep square leg runs around to clean this up."
"nice delicate touch, I think. It's shortish and outside off stump. Avishka opens the face at the last moment and runs it at pace very fine, all the way to the third man boundary."
"floated up on off stump, turning away. Defended back to the bowler"
"short and outside off stump. Mendis goes back and cuts it, but doesn't get a lot of power behind it. Straight to point."
"tossed up again, and the batsman takes a big stride out to drive this to long off"
"very slow through the air, pitched up on off, and Avishka waits for it to push this square of the long off fielder. They call quickly for two and get a couple"
"fired in a little faster on the stumps, Avishka hits this back to the bowler"
"flatter again, but more on the pads, Avishka gets this down to long off"
"full, pitched just outside off stump. Avishka drives this past the bowler, but can't beat mid off"
"Joseph keeps getting it on to the pads, and this one is turned unfussily towards deep square leg for a single"
"full and on the stumps, prodded to midwicket"
"full on the stumps, clipped off the toes to deep midwicket"
"full, well outside off stump, Avishka opens the face a bit again and gets it to third man"
"length ball, wide of the stumps, Mendis square drives, but can't beat point with a nicely struck shot"
"flatter and shorter, not a lot of turn, Avishka goes back and crunches this out to deep cover"
floated up on off stump. Mendis prods it back to the bowler.
"that's the first sweep of the day, I think. Full and on the stumps. Mendis gets down and over the top of the bounce. Gets it to deep square leg."
"flatter and shorter, pushed to midwicket."
"full and on the stumps, driven to long on"
"floated up outside off stump, and oh my, that was a little risky. Mendis gets this square of cover, who runs around and collects nicely as the batsmen set off for a single. But he can't get an accurate throw in, which would have challenged Avishka's dive at the striker's end. Hope has way too much work to do to try and gather that throw."
"length ball outside off, opens the face and fends this to point"
"it's not that short, but that's a lovely shot from Mendis. This is slightly wide of off stump and back of a length. Mendis, though, is waiting for it, and gets over the ball nicely to pull it for four, way in front of square."
"fullish on the stumps, Mendis defends this towards mid on, but calls his partner through smartly and they get a single with ease"
"back of a length on the stumps, turned towards  midwicket for one"
"full on the stumps, Mendis gets over the top of it and turns it straight to midwicket"
"floated up wide of off stump, Mendis opens the face and runs it to third man"
"floated up, almost yorker length. Dug out and driven just square of mid on, and they can scamper through"
"tossed up, just on off stump. Avishka makes room and pushes this square on the offside for one"
"first one that's really turned for Allen. Bit short, so Mendis goes back, but it spins away and stays a bit low. In the end all Mendis can do is throw his bat out and get some wood on it."
"tossed up on the toes, and it's on-driven with excellent timing by Mendis, who beats mid on, as well as the legside sweeper coming around."
"flatter and shorter, Mendis goes back and defends this"
"floated up outside off, Mendis takes a stride out and carves this gently behind point for a couple. A little turn again."
drifts into the pads with a length delivery again. Tucked to deep square leg without much fuss.

"full and on the stumps, driven straight of short midwicket, and gets a single down to long on."

"floated up, pitching on off, turning into middle. Pushed to mid on"
"tossed up again, wider of off this time. Just defended."
"into the pads this time, and Avishka turns that nicely square of the wicket on the legside, and completes a mature fifty. Just a gentle raise of the bat. Back to back fifties, after having hit one on Saturday also."
"floated up on the stumps, driven to long on"
"tossed up well wide of off, driven straight to cover"
"makes an error in length, and Mendis, one of the best against spin in this team, doesn't miss out. He goes back, makes a bit of room and places this nicely behind point, the ball gathering speed down the slope and into the boundary"
"Fuller length on the stumps, pushed to mid-on"
"not that short, but he created the room by going back and whipping it to the deep square leg fence. <b>Raises his own half-century</b>. It's also the 100-run partnership. These two have revived Sri Lanka after those early strikes"
"fuller on off, comes on the front foot and drives straight past the stumps. Mid-off has to run back and clean up"
"fuller on the stumps, patted back to the bowler"
"missed out there. Length ball down legside, if he had got bat on the hard sweep he was going for, it would have been four. He doesn't connect. It's a wide though, so they get that extra run"
"length ball on the pads, turned off his pads to deep square leg"
"length outside off, patted gently to long-on"
"tossed up full outside off, clipped to long-on off the front foot"

"fuller on the stumps, pushed to midwicket"
"good length on the stumps, nudged to square leg"
"length outside off, patted down the track"
"<b>bowler gets into a tangle with the non-striker</b>. Length ball that the batsman came on the front foot to clip, went to the bowler's right and Chase dived to save it, got caught up with the non-striker. No harm or injury done."
"length outside off, coming into him, jabbed back to the bowler"
"too short, pulled off the front foot in front of square. There is a sweeper back there"
"back of a length outside off, gets it to bounce a bit, but he plays it close to his body, opening the face of the bat to run it past point"
"fuller, flicked past short fine leg"
short again but in the fifth stump channel. Tries to pull it but doesn't get the timing quite right. Can't beat midwicket
"back of a length, moves across and punches to mid-on"
"tossed up on a length on off, turning into him, plays it to midwicket"
"spots some room outside off and goes back to cut, but ends up chopping it on the ground near him"
goes deep in his crease this time and flicks a length ball off his pads to square leg
"fuller on the stumps, punched to long-on"
pushed to long-on for a comfortable single
"fuller outside off, uses his wrists to flick to long-on again"
gives himself room and slashes this through cover to find the fence. Superb timing and execution. Disdainful of the bowler almost
tapped to long-on
<b>upper cuts for four</b>. This is superb batting. Dug this one in short outside off and he uses the bounce and pace to lift this over where slips would have been and very fine. In complete control of that shot
"length ball, too straight, turned off his pads to deep midwicket"
"yorker on middle and off, digs it out to the bowler's right"
"another yorker, on off, tailed in late a bit. The batsman was trying to flick it off his toes but ends up getting an inside edge that rolls off toe towards silly point. They steal a single with no one close in"
"floated up on a length on the stumps, he makes room and carves it through cover"
"tossed up outside off, he dances down the track and connects well with a cover drive but can't beat the man inside the circle"

"<b>glorious</b>. Tossed up on off, and he comes down the track, gets to the pitch and drives it powerfully over etra cover"
"length ball on off, he makes room to slash it, but can't beat short third man"
and he finds the cover fence once again with some sparkling footwork and strokeplay. Down the track and lifts this over the in-field with great timing and placement.
"tries the yorker again, but ends up on leg stumps, clipped off his toes to deep midwicket"
"back of a length banged in hard, comes in a bit but is easily steered to a squarish third man"
"fuller on off, flicked to mid-on"
"quick bouncer - if you're going to bang it in short that's the only way to do it on this pitch. Outside off and took off, flew over the batsman's head and shoulders"
"perhaps trying for something extra, strays down legside and it'll be a wide"
"length ball outside off, heaves across the line to deep midwicket. Fernando is slow while turning around for the second and has to scramble and dive. A better throw might have had him in trouble but he's just about made it."
"length ball, but on the pads, tucked to fine leg"
"floated up on off, he makes room and slaps it through point"
"quicker on, hurried on to him a tad, slaps it to cover"
"down the track again, punches with the full face of the bat to long-off"
hint of room and he goes back and across to slash it but can't beat the in-field
down the track and he goes inside out. Doesn't time it as well but enough to clear the in-field and have it not carry to the man at deep cover
"fuller on leg stump, he sweeps it very fine. Got only a tickle on it so they'll get a couple"
"length ball on off, he moves across and whips it to deep midwicket"
"again too short and going down leg, he easily swats it away past short fine leg to collect another boundary"
"fuller this time, on the stumps, goes to whip it, gets a thickish inside edge that goes backward of square"
"fuller and very straight again, he's able to come on the front foot and work this to deep square leg"
"low full toss, carved it away by opening the bat face but Allen at point moves quickly to his left to pounce on it"
fuller but strays on the pads once again and is tickled behind square. Played softly enough that they can come back for three.
"looped up on middle stump and turning into the batsman, who glances it to short fine leg"
"given some air outside off, he moves across and clips it but Chase goes to his right and fields"
"fuller on the stumps, swept to short fine leg. They take the quick single. There is a direct hit but I think the non-striker is safe. And replays confirm that he's well in."
"fuller outside off, quicker one, tapped back to the bowler"
"tossed up outside off, he gets down to sweep it to deep square leg"
"tossed up but down leg, swept to fine leg"
"length on the stumps, defended back down the pitch"
"floated up wide of the off stump, Mendis steps out and check-drives it to long on for an easy single"
length on the stumps. Legcutter maybe. Avishka just wants to have a look at what he's doing and defends
"fuller, and on the pads. Avishka unambitiously pushes it to short midwicket"
"slightly quicker this one, and tight into the stumps. Avishka pushes it straight of cover and gets one."
"shorter, on the legside again. Mendis has been turning those around the corner all day. Does so again."
"flat and full, Mendis is struck on the pad trying to turn this to leg I think, but that's hit him outside the line"
"down the track and Mendis lofts this one into the legside, into the gap behind midwicket. Easy two"
"full and wide of off stump, pushed straight of point, and the batsmen trot through"
"floated up on the stumps, driven unfussily to long on"
"waited beautifully for that one. This is shortish, turning in slightly from wide of off stump. Mendis gets on the back foot and takes it almost out of the keepers hands, gets it fine of short third man for a couple"
"tighter into the stumps this time, and Mendis cuts it straight to point"
pushed to the left of midwicket. Mendis has set off for a single and is about a third down the pitch before being turned back. Safe in the end.
"offcutter, well wide of off stump. Avishka pushes it through the covers for one."
"not that short, but Mendis picks the offcutter, and hacks that one over the legside. The legside sweeper has work to do to get across to deep midwicket and they take a couple easily."
"offcutter again I think, and wide of the stumps. Mendis opens the face and tries to run it fine, but it's straight to third man"
"fuller, and again Mendis tries to beat short third man but can't. It's a front-foot no ball though, so there's a free hit coming up now."
oh dear. Very slow ball from Pollard. Mendis' eyes light up and he nearly swings himself off his feet trying t hit this full ball over long on. Misses completely.
"He's been trying to do this all over. This is full and slow again, and finally Mendis gets it fine of short third man, and there's a chase. The batsmen run well to get three. Mendis is into the 90s."
"flatter, and on the stumps. Knocked down to long on for one."
"flat on the off stump, driven to long off by Avishka"
"slower, floated up. Driven to long on again."
"flatter and on the stumps, Avishka pushes this square of long on, and they can take two"
"full and straight, the long on fielder gets another little work out."
"this is slower, and a touch shorter, spinning into the pads. Mendis slides back and turns this to square leg for one."
"full and on off stump, pushed to cover"
"shortish, sliding across the batsman, Avishka opens the face and runs it to third man"
"gets it to short third man and they have to scamper for one. If it had been a direct hit, Mendis might have been in trouble. He dives to make his ground"
"shortish, on the stumps, Mendis clips this into the legside for one"
clipped straight to midwicket
on the hips from Cottrell. How many times have we seen these batsmen milk this line today? Turned to square leg for one.
"full and on the stumps, flicked off the toes to deep square"
full and wide of off stump. Mendis is slightly quick on the shot and can't get it past short cover
"slower ball, but it's a full toss. Mendis swats that down to long on"
"length ball on the stumps, Avishka flicks and it's far enough to the right of square leg for the batsmen to run through"
length ball outside off stump. Mendis drives that down to long on once more. Been a productive area for him
slower ball on the stumps. Avishka waits for it and defends it to midwicket
"slower ball I think, length outside off stump. Mendis pokes it into the offside but can't find a gap"
"length just outside off. Mendis hits towards mid on this time, but again can't beat the field."
"<b>He gets there!</b> Fullish outside off. He reaches out and drives it past cover and there's a bit of a yelp of joy. Hugs Avishka and there's just a cursory raise of the bat. It's his first ODI hundred since March 2017. And the first century from No.4 since 2017 as well. He's badly needed a big score, Mendis."
"fullish, outside off, pushed to the left of mid off"
"shortish, on the pads, swatted around the corner for a single"
"floated up leg stump delivery, clipped gently to leg for a single"
"on the pads, and clipped happily to leg again. Fernando not in a massive hurry to get to another hundred, it seems."
"shortish outside off, clubbed straight to mid off"
"fullish and on the stumps, hit in the air to long on, where the fielder runs around to his right and collects on the third or fourth bounce"
doing it in singles. This is length on off stump. Worked to long on.
"shortish wide of off stump. Clubbed with a horizontal bat towards long on. In the air again, but falls well short"
"</b>nicely done Avishka</b>. Gets to his second ODI hundred with a single in the direction of the covers. Gets his helmet off, does a skip and a fist pump and salutes the dressing room and the crowd. Both his centuries have come against West Indies, the first having come against them in the World Cup last year."
that's legside-ish as well. Gets it fine of fine leg for a couple
"more on the middle stump line this time, and Avishka turns it to midwicket"
"tries to get fancy now, Mendis. It's fuller and outside off stump, but Mendis tries to shuffle across and scoop it over his shoulder. Collects nothing but fresh air though."
"tries it again, and this time connects. Moves across again, and is in a good enough position to middle it. There's no fielder in sight as it skips away to the rope."
"that's terrific batting. Fine leg went finer after that previous shot. This time Mendis doesn't shuffle to off. He stays rooted and whips it through square leg, and the fielder that now has gone finer has no chance to cut that off."
"fuller ball, Mendis squeezes this to the left of mid off for a single"
""
"Mendis really looking to put the pedal to the floor now. Pollard is bowling length on the stumps, and the batsman backs away to blast that over mid off for four"
"shovels this aerially over midwicket now, but there's not so much power in that shot. Just a single"
"Avishka gets into the swing of things. Fuller, just outside off stump, A nice clean swing through the line, and no fielder is going to cut that off as it goes for four behind the bowler"
more runs. Backing away and making space to launch another ball high over mid off for another boundary. These two are having fun.
"that's maybe the best-hit shot of the whole over. Backs away again. Once more Pollard is bowling length. Avishka hits it with the wind, back over Pollard's head again, and that lands maybe 10 metres short of the boundary before skating away"
"full, on leg stump, glances it and Alzarri Joseph does well to stop it at short fine leg. Can't stop two though."
"West Indies are falling to pieces! Comical bit of mis-fielding by Ambris at fine-leg. The batsman went down to scoop it over fine leg once again, but didn't get enough on it. Ambris had the misfortune of seeing it drop short of him and bounce over him."
"and the partnership is finally broken, but only because both men are looking to get a boundary every ball almost. Cleared his front leg and wanted to swing this over cow corner, only ends up with a leading edge that goes straight up, high in the air. Hope calls for it, comes up to the stumps and catches it safely in his gloves. End of a fine, fine innings."
"fuller on middle and leg, whipped off his toes between long-on and deep midwicket"
"back of a length trying to tuck him up, fended towards deep midwicket. <b>Almost a run out</b> as Fernando turned back for two even as Thisara was yelling no. Not a good throw to the keeper though who had to come forward a long way to collect. Tried to back flick it on the stumps but missed."
"fuller on the stumps, pushed to long-on"
bangs it in short and it zooms over Thisara's head as he ducks under.
was giving himself room but Holder follows him with a low full toss. He manages to whip it to deep midwicket from close to his body
"short outside off, he gets up on his toes and slashes it over point. Superb execution and he gets a boundary"
"slower ball wide yorker, he stretches out and gets his bat horizontal to steer it to third man"
"slower ball, ends up as a full toss and he's <b>whacked it nonchalantly to deep square leg</b>. Hits it into the wind too, and the ball fairly flies away."
"clears his front leg, and clubs this to long-on. Magnificent running by Thisara who was going to the danger end and called for two. Both men make it safely"
"yorker length on the stumps, gets an inside edge while trying to swing it over midwicket and gets a single to fine leg. But <b>Holder has over-stepped</b> so it's a no-ball"
"<b>takes full toll of the free hit</b>. Not the best ball, half volley on leg stump and he flicks it off his toes to the vacant backward square leg area. Holder's got his hands on his hips, but he's got only himself to blame for the no-ball and the free hit ball."
"<b>Keemo Paul drops a dolly at long-off</b>. West Indies have had a forgettable day in the field. this was fuller on leg, and the bat turned in his hands as he tried to clear his leg to deposit it outside the boundary. Went straight to Keemo, who juggled and dropped it"
"<b>Keemo catches it safely this time</b>. Was giving himself room, and Joseph banged it in short and followed the batsman. Avishka still got it in his hitting area, and swatted it to deep midwicket. Keemo Paul on the boundary there and holds it over his head with both hands. Superb innings from Avishka."
"length ball on the pads, flicked to fine leg"
"back of a length on off, tucked to backward square leg"
"short ball on the stumps, he stays still and pulls from in front of his face to deep midwicket"
"<b>castled</b> with a beauty. Pacy yorker that's coming into him, Mathews was trying to flick it from off stump through midwicket, gets a faint inside edge and the ball clatters into the stumps"
"<b>super shot</b>. Floated up outside off on a full length, he punches on the up through extra cover. Such magnificent timing on that, it runs all the way to the boundary. Long-off was running to his right but the ball beats him"
"length ball, punched to cover"
"slower ball, floated up outside off and Dhananjaya almost casually smacks it over the bowler. Didn't time it perfeclty but there is no long-off and once he went over mid-off it was a  boundary"
"Thisara charges back for the third. This was a length ball outside off that was cut through point. No fielder there and the ball was not going to reach the fence, Thisara spotted that and hared back"
"fuller outside off, he was giving himself room, stretches out and guides it through backward point"
"fuller outside off, stroked to extra cover"
"<b>carved through slip</b>. there are no slips of course at this stage, but that's where the ball went. Full toss outside off, and he was making room, ends up slicing it a bit. Fine enough to get the boundary"
backing away again but the bowler follows him that time and he can only punch this to cover
"good bowling. yorker on the fifth stump, jams it towards silly mid-off. No one close in so they get a quick single"
Joseph is the only one who has bowled short effectively - at times at least - for West Indies. Another one banged in at pace and Thisara can't do much about that except let it sail past
"another short ball. That's probably the length and line to bowl to Thisara, push him on the back foot with balls that rise up at pace. He can't connect again"
follows the batsman who is backing away with a back of length ball into the body. Thisara manages to bunt it towards point
"goes for the yorker, but ends up as a low full toss on leg stump, flicked away to long-on's left"
"back of a length outside off, he goes for the pull. Doesn't time it at all, but that lack of timing also means it falls well short of the deep midwicket fielder who's charging in"
"slashed fine for a boundary. Was giving himself room, Cottrell bowled it back of a length on off and Dhananjaya got a thick edge that went to the fence"
"<b>knocked him over</b> and Cottrell does his salute for the third time today. This was a 'you miss, I hit' kind of ball. Length on leg stump, with Dhananjaya backing away again to go over cover. Doesn't connect and the ball cannons into leg stump"
"good ball first up, back of a length and close to the body, he sways out of the way"
"<b>that's beaten the keeper</b>. Good ball again, short and into the batsman, who moved inside the line and tried to pull it. Got a bit of glove - or bat - on it and it was enough to send it over Shai Hope, who tried to leap up to gather but couldn't quite get there"
"backing away a long way but Joseph follows him with a yorker. Tries to flick it, doesn't time it but it loops up and falls well short of deep square leg"

"slower ball, ends up as a full toss on the stumps. Hasaranga makes room and slaps to the man on the cover boundary"
"they're bowling to Thisara as if he's taking guard three stumps outside leg - which is where he's hitting the ball from because he's trying to make room every ball. He gets bat on this, swat-pulls it to long-on"

"yorker on leg stump, heaved to long-on off the bottom half of the bat"
"length ball stump to stump, comes forward and opens the face to steer to cover"
"<b>cleans him up</b>. Muted celebration from Cottrell. Thisara's entertaining cameo is over. He backed away again, but unlike Joseph, Cottrell kept it full on the stumps. Thisara missed, and the bowler hit."
"length ball angling across him, the batsman has a poke at it and misses"
"good length on the stumps, patted to the bowler's right, who fields it on his follow through"
"good length on the stumps again, driven back without timing. Cottrell fields to his left on his follow through"
"slower ball, floated up and ends up as a full toss outside off. Hasaranga waits for it and calmly drives it through backward point by opening the bat face and giving himself room"
"wide yorker, he gets bat on it and sends it through point. Two fielders after it, one from backward point and one from deep cover, and they get in a tangle. And the batsmen take two."
"fuller and straight, he goes over the top of the bowler's head. Doesn't time it well though. Falls safe"
"<b>just clears mid-off</b>. Makes room and flat-bats it over the bowler. Not timed and Pollard's running backwards after it, but can't quite reach it."
"<b>terrific effort from Holder at long-on but the ball goes to the boundary</b>. Great shot too. He connects with the swat down the ground. Holder's not at a straight long-on, but makes good ground, dives and gets a hand to the ball, but can't stop it"
"smashes this over extra cover, and Pollard at long-off has to run around a long way to cut it off before the boundary"
"<b>just clears the man at point</b>. Full outside off, makes room and tries to drive, gets a thick edge that flies in the air. The man at point leaps but can't get more than a ghost of a finger-tip to the ball."
"<b>Fabian Allen shells an easy catch at deep square leg</b>. This has been a poor day in the field for West Indies.. Would have been five for Cottrell. This was flicked off his toes, but off the end of the bat and went up high. Allen seemed to have it covered, but ends up letting it go through his hands. Is the wind a factor in these drops?"

misses the sweep but it rolls off his pad to short fine leg
"length ball, flicked to midwicket"
"moves way across to try and scoop this over the keeper but misses it. They sneak through for a bye. Hope flicks to the stumps, but doesn't connect.

"fuller outside off, clipped to mid-on"

"fuller on the stumps, turned to midwicket"
"length ball on leg stump, hint of movement across the right-hander, who jams his bat down in time. Ball takes the outer half to mid-off"
<b>great timing</b>. Length ball on leg stump clipped away effortlessly through midwicket. Hardly any flourish but it still goes all the way with sheer timing
"<b>gorgeous</b>. Back of a length outside off, he stands tall, goes on tip toes and punches through cover. They probably thought it's going to the boundary but it's into the wind and Hasaranga slides and saves. The batsman ran only two"

"short ball outside off stump, pulled away to the legside sweeper"
"<strong>sensational fielding, and a run out breaks the partnership.</strong> I think this one is on Shai Hope. He clips this one square of midwicket and he thought he had beaten Angelo Mathews, but Mathews leaps to his right and cuts that one off. Hope has called Ambris through for a single, but seeing suddenly that Mathews has the ball in hand, he changes his mind. Only, Ambris is two thirds down the pitch now. Hope scampers back to the striker's end, and Ambris is nowhere as the throw comes in from Mathews, and the bowler Udana takes the bails off. Hope might even had made it had he committed to the run."

"shorter and flatter, Hope pulls this away viciously, but short midwicket gets a hand to it and keeps it to one - the ball eventually fielded by long on, after taking that deflection. <b>That's another SHai Hope fifty though.</b> He's PROLIFIC in Asia."

"straighter and flatter, struck aerially to long off, but drops very well short of the fielder down there"
"<strong>Mathews has made the prize breakthrough</strong>. This is fullish, just outside off stump and angled in to Hope, who tries to lift this over the legside. The ball seems to stop on him a little bit though, and Hope is through the shot early. He gets a toe-end to the ball, which just floats up to the man at short midwicket.

"<b>bowled him with a googly first ball</b>. Sri Lanka are shutting the door on West Indies now.

Mathews, at square leg, has a little bit of time as it hangs in the air, but a lot of ground to make up as well.

This was tossed up on the stumps, Allen made room and connected well with the lofted on-drive, but there was a fielder right there and he hit it straight to him. He didn't have much option, other than trying to hit out."
