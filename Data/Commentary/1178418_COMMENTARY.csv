"moved across  a long way looking for the paddle scoop but good bowling by Unadkat who fires it in quick and full at the batsman and Karthik can't connect. Rinku was rushing down from the other end but is sent back. The throw is a bit awry from the keeper, which allows him to scramble back"

Full ball and he shows his extraordinary timing, and sending it zipping through the air and over the boundary. Pick him for the World Cup already, England! Just do it."
