"this nips back, Imam plays late and is rapped above the knee roll - <b>given!</b> Was that high? He's going to <b>review</b>, but it only needs to be clipping, remember.

Looks like it; but hang on, Snicko says <b>it also grazed the glove!</b> Yes, it looks like he got a touch on it before deflecting off the hip through to Bairstow, who was again easily convinced.

"good length outside off, defended to cover"
"he's well across the crease, angles this away through backward point"
"this one leaps again! Short of a length at off stump, crunches into the bottom hand which Salahuddin whips off the bat and it loops into the leg side"
"there's the intent! Down the pitch and hammers a drive along the ground towards mid-off, Broad dives and gets a hand to it but it's hit with such power it still runs away"

"full outside off, worked to midwicket"

"full at off stump, flicked with bottom hand to midwicket"
worked from full at off stump into the leg side
"full, wide outside off, he drives on the up to cover...don't think Sarfraz is going to block it"
"short of a length outside off, nips back a touch and Sarfraz is a little cramped for room as he plays with a horizontal bat towards point"
"a lovely straight drive, so straight in fact that it smashes into the stumps so denies him a boundary"
"nips back from short of a length, takes the bottom hand off the bat as he nurdles to the leg side"
"full at off stump, pushed to mid-off"
"full outside off, left alone"

pitched up and tapped down into the off side
"short ball, climbing up outside off stump as Sarfraz gets across and defends softly"
"touch short, 83mph and crisply struck on the back foot, sends it to backward point"
"pinned him, <b>smack on the knee roll in front of off!</b> Bruce Oxenford didn't have to think too long about that, and there won't be a review... Woakes knocks over Sarfraz, 92 runs short of his hundred. Decent ball, that, jagging in, would have crashed into middle and leg"

"back of a length, 78mph on middle and defended down to the on side"

"lets this go early again, Shadab takes it on the full but whips to midwicket"
gets across and clips the ball down to mid-on
"very full, drifting in with the arm, Salahuddin settles over it in defence"
"angled across, Shadab taps it down towards point"
"rising in the channel, Shadab flirts outside off - <b>nicked straight to slip!</b> Curran leaps for joy, a birthday gift for the new boy! Good bowling in the channel, could probably have been left but it slid on with the arm, took the edge and Cook pouched it safely"
pitched up and chopped into the off side
"coming back in on a length, defended"
"fired in straighter from over the wicket, 77mph and turned to the leg side"

tossed up on the stumps and turned to the on side
"pushed through, Salahuddin drops back in the crease and chops a single"
presses out to tap into the covers
"ooh, how'd that get through...? Beats Ashraf on the inside edge, YJB can't grasp it either and they steal the bye"
"floated up on leg stump, tapped back to the on side"
pushed through and worked away with the spin to the leg side
"on the stumps, tucked back down the track"
"good length on middle and leg, Salahuddin defends"
"leg side, there's a sound as the ball passes by, Bairstow then loses hold the ball as he goes low to his left... but that was off the pad, I think"

"oh dear, Usman...! Goes for the big shot, but instead <b>lumps it straight to mid-on!</b> Salahuddin departs, he finally snapped and Pakistan are properly falling down now"

pushed through flatter and Hasan defends
"tossed up and Hasan again sweeps hard at it, there's a thud from short leg... Where has Jennings taken this blow? Oof, that's bounced up and smacked him right on the badge of the helmet. He looks a bit shaken, a slight cut on the bridge of his nose"
comes forward and taps a single through mid-on
shuffles into line and lets this one go in the channel
"digs in the bouncer, Hasan makes himself small and ducks underneath"
"length, on the stumps, Hasan has a big yahoo and is hit on the back leg... Bruce Oxenford shakes his head but England <b>review</b>, there's a feeling he didn't hit it. Which is vindicated, but then Hawk-Eye shows it missing leg stump by a distance, so that review is lost"
"short ball, Hasan backs away and slaps towards mid-off, came off the toe"
"good pace, 88mph and sliding in as Hasan walks across and nurdles the single"
"round the wicket, dug in but the pitch absorbs most of the pace and Amir can ride the bounce comfortably"
"tossed up and Hasan has another hoick at him, goes h-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-g-h into the leg side... but lands safe, with a couple of men converging!"

gets into line and tucks to the leg side
"tossed up, spinning away outside off, again Amir lets it go"
pushed through and Amir defends coming forwards
"pushed through quicker and chopped into the ground, Bess comes across to field"
"edged, <b>that's a super grab at slip!</b> Hasan is snuffed out, Broad has the wicket, Cook swooping to his left to take the catch. That ball was travelling, extra bounce from a length for Broad and Hasan could only fence at it like the tailender he is"
"short and rising towards the ribs, Abbas nudges it behind short leg"
comes across and defends to the off side
lets this one go outside off
good length and blocked coming across on off stump

"arrowed in from round the wicket, Amir glances through backward square leg"
"ooh, superb line, that's straightened past the bat with Abbas deep in the crease"
"short of a length, Broad's legcutter and it takes the shoulder of the bat, steered to third slip - <b>that's job done for England!</b> Root grabs it in front of his face, the crowd gurgles in delight, and England have won by an innings and 55 runs"
