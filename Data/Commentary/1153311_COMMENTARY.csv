"pitched that one up, and perhaps he was surprised by this yorker outside off. Late in getting the bat down and ball goes through to the keeper."
"back of a length and coming back in again, takes the inside edge of his bat and flies down to the fine leg boundary. Lucky for the batsman"
past the outside edge with big spin again
ooh that went with the angle. Takes a thick inside edge and rolls away off his hurried jab
"went for an almost premeditated sweep, but it goes once bounce to short fine leg"
"beaten again, spinning past the bat off a good length"
stays back to that one and pushes it towards point staying beside the line of the ball
"stays back again, but the ball grips and spins past the attempted push"
"good length, on off and drawing him forward. Guided to gully"
"sharp spin, gets some drift that makes it pitch on leg and spinning past the outside edge. He manages to get some bat on it, and soft hands ensure the edge bounces and goes to slip"

paddled to short fine leg
"premeditated sweep, went down on one knee and waited for the spinning leg-break to come to him and hit it aerial but safe towards fine leg"
"<b>beaten on the sweep</b> Bishoo gets the ball to dip and turn, wasn't quite the length for the sweep, and the batsman is lucky it doesn't do any damage"
"a touch full, and he cleared his front leg to heave that one over midwicket for four"
comes forward and steers it to point off an open face
"holds this back a bit, allowing it to pitch and turn past the batsman. He stays inside the line"
"tossed up on the stumps, defended off the front foot."
dances down the track to get to the pitch of the ball and defend it
"stays in his crease and negotiates this safely, watching the ball and the spin like a hawk before defending into the off side"
drifts down leg and he's able to easily tuck it away behind square
"loop, dip and turn. The batsman stayed back to that, should have come forward. Beaten"
"<b>dropped</b> Similar ball and he gets the edge. The ball flies to Shai Hope at chest high, and he clutches at it, and sees the ball pop out. Big moment"
comes forward and clips this to square leg
comes down the track again and tucks it to wide long-on
"nicely tossed up on the stump, just as nicely defended with a nice big stride out front"
"down the track, and gets to the pitch of the ball to clip it to deep midwicket"

"slightly back of a length, spinning across the batsman who hangs back and pushes it towards point"
"stays back again to this length ball on off, cuts it to point"
"fuller, again outside off, pushed to cover point"
"<b>beauty!</b> perfect leggie's dismissal. Looped up and dips, the batsman's stretched forward but can't get to the pitch of the ball, which grips the surface and turns just enough to go off the shoulder of the bat and into the keeper's gloves. Mehidy's resistance ends but it's been a good hand"
"nicely tossed up again, but he presents a full face to defend it"
"pitches on off and turning away, he lets it go through"
"tossed up on off, could have been the googly. Defended from the crease"
"tossed up again, but too full, driven back and the bowler tumbles to his left to field"

"back of a length, he stays in his crease and pushes it to mid-off"
"tossed up and drawing him forward, but he defends solidly"
"similar ball, same result. Defended off the front foot"
"spins past the bat again. He stays back in his crease for that, and it goes past"
pushed to point.
"nice, teasing legbreak on a fullish length outside off. Mahmudullah ignores the bait"
"ooh, quicker and closer to off stump - straightens just enough to miss off stump, in fact, after the ball sneaks under Mahmudullah's attempted sweep"
"shorter, goes on the back foot to punch to deep point"
"ooh, nice flight from Bishoo. Reaches in front of his body for the checked drive, and pops it uppishly past the right shoulder of silly point"
"fuller and straighter, pushed down the ground towards mid-on"
"down the track and that's a super hit. Jumped away from the line of this leg-stump delivery to loft this back over the bowler's head, high and handsome"
"flat, speared in towards middle stump. Goes back and across to nurdle through square leg"
"full, angling into the pads, clipped gently to the left of backward square leg"
down the track and Warrican shortens his length a little. Stretches out to block it back to the bowler
"sharp turn there. Flat, on a good length just outside off. Goes on the back foot - playing the trajectory rather than the length, and does well not to follow the ball away from his body"
"and again, turn and bounce, past the outside edge as he jabs at this in defence"
"slower, flighted, on middle stump. Stretches out to defend and it rolls off the inside edge into the short fine leg region - didn't turn as much as Nayeem expected"
down the track and he isn't quite to the pitch of it. Stretches out to defend it back where it came from
not short enough to cut. Makes a lot of room and it stays a little low. Just about manages to chop it down and keep it out of his stumps

"flighted legbreak outside off stump, left alone"
"flighted again, fuller this time, drives to the man at extra-cover without quite timing it"
"googly, spins in from a good length fairly wide of off stump. Nayeem keeps it out with a flat-batted half-drive/half-forward defensive"
"full outside off, clipped with the turn to long-on"
a long way down the track but he's not quite to the pitch of the ball. Long final stride to defend with the turn to midwicket
"stays on the back foot and is cramped by this one, which rips in sharply from outside off. Jams it down into the leg side"
"more flight now, stretches out to block it back towards Chase"
"dips onto a nice length close to off stump, defended towards short leg off the inside half of the bat"
"down the pitch, possibly gets too close to the pitch to drive it off the meat of the bat. Squeezes it back to the bowler off the bottom of the bat"
flat legbreak pitching on off and middle. Makes a lot of room to slap it to deep point and move the lead to 200
"gone, classic legspinner's dismissal. Flighted nicely outside off, inviting the drive. Doesn't get a proper stride out to the ball, and he isn't quite close enough to the pitch of the ball. Sharp turn to get the edge, and Hope takes a straightforward catch at slip, at around knee height"
floats this across into a fifth-stump line. Taijul looks for the push into the point region and gets a thick outside edge that rolls behind square - didn't turn as much as he expected it to
"Mahmudullah pays the price for premeditation here. Fourth wicket for Bishoo. Shaped to sweep even before the bowler released, and Bishoo shortened his length accordingly, while also flattening his trajectory. Mahmudullah ends up playing a half-hearted attempted lap-sweep, and only manages a top-edge that balloons to slip"
"bam, Mustafizur begins with a meaty slog-sweep against a length ball outside off. Hits it with the turn, and it bounces down to the right of the man at deep midwicket"
"now Taijul goes for the big sweep from outside off. Hits the inside half of his bat and he ends up dragging it squarer than he intended. I think it hit the square-leg fielder somewhere on his body, causing the cameraperson to lose track of the ball. Yikes, straight into Ambris's chest"
"tight off-stump line, defended off the front foot back to the bowler"
"<b>dropped</b>. Slows it up and Mustafizur goes for the big leg-side slog. Top-edges it high towards the backtracking backward point fielder, Brathwaite, who puts down the two-hander"
"full outside off, driven to extra-cover"
"length ball close to off stump, Taijul goes for the reverse-pull/sweep and fails to connect"
"and that is that. West Indies will need 204 to win. Steps out and gets nowhere near the pitch of the ball. Goes through with the big heave nonetheless, and the ball grabs the outside half of his bat and ends up in long-on's grateful hands"
"tossed up full outside off, driven to short extra-cover"
"length ball sliding on with the angle towards off stump. Presses forward, watches it, and defends with soft hands"
"a bit fuller, good stretch out to block it back towards the bowler"
nice length just outside off. Brathwaite defends with soft hands towards point
"good length once more, the line just outside off. A bit more bounce and Brathwaite gets on the front foot, lets it come to him, and defends close to his body towards point"
"straighter now, on middle stump, worked away through backward square leg from the crease"
sharp turn from outside off as Brathwaite comes forward to defend. Beats the outside edge and goes towards leg gully off the outside of his front pad
"goes back and across to defend this one pitching outside off, and the ball spins past leg stump"
action replay of the previous ball - Nayeem may want to shift his line wider
"and again, rips past leg stump. Brathwaite doesn't offer a shot this time"
"fullish on middle and leg, stays back to clip watchfully into the leg side"
"down the track now, gets close to the pitch and clips it wide of mid-on"
"floated up slow and wide of off stump, drives with a lot of bottom hand to mid-off"
"a touch shorter, slides into the pads, clipped into the fine-leg region"
"full on middle stump, whipped to deep square leg"
"and he strikes immediately. Throws away his wicket and gifts Shakib his 200th in Tests. Down the track to a teasingly flighted ball wide of off stump, and slogs, looking for turn and looking to go over mid-on. It doesn't turn, however, and it slips past the outside edge to offer Mushfiqur the simplest of stumpings"
"nice flight, dips onto a good length and slides on with the angle. Defended back towards the bowler"
another armer. Gets on the front foot and defends it back to the bowler. Pushed a little hard at this one
flat offbreak on an off-stump line. Goes back and across to defend
"straighter now, tucked away with the turn to long leg"
"again on leg stump, goes back to work it to the left of backward square leg"
"flighted and full on middle stump, whipped down the ground to long-on"
nice quick feet to get close to the pitch of this flighted off-stump ball. Clipped to midwicket
"tossed up again, straighter in line, clipped to the left of square leg"
"flat, a touch short outside off. Rocks back and slaps it to cover point"
"fullish, close to off stump, defended into the off side"
"a touch too full to trouble Brathwaite, angling into off stump from wide of the crease. Blocked back down the pitch"
drifts down leg and Brathwaite gets on the front foot to nudge into the backward square leg region
"big appeal, and it's given! Hope stretched forward to defend but it was flat and the length was just perfect, outside off, which meant he didn't get close enough to the pitch of it. Tries to tuck his bat behind his pad and leave it, but the ball doesn't turn as much as expected, and it bounces a touch more to brush his glove through to the keeper"
"inviting flight wide of off stump. Reaches out with his hands to drive without getting a stride in, and pops it in the air, but out of reach of short cover"
"gone! Taijul strikes first ball with the deadliest of arm balls. Not much Brathwaite could have done about that, though he could have played forward rather than gone back to it. The trajectory was flat, however, and it just skidded through quickly before Brathwaite could bring his bat down to keep it out. Hits him on the back pad, and the umpire has no hesitation in giving him out. They're checking if Taijul overstepped, however... He's fine, just about. Landed on his toe with his heel in the air, juuuust behind the line"
"length ball just outside off, uses his reach to defend towards silly point"
"flat, back of a length, sharp turn and bounce from leg to off. Goes back and gets on top of it to keep it down"
"back of a length again, this one rips away even more sharply, from an off-stump line, and Chase can't get his bat anywhere near it"
"Taijul is on fire here! Another arm ball, another batsman playing back, another ball skidding through and striking back pad. Chase has reviewed this, but it looked out on first glance. The line began straighter than the Brathwaite delivery, and it struck him in front of middle and leg. Hitting a good chunk of leg stump, says ball-tracking"
"keeps it flatter and drags it down a bit short, Hetmyer flat-bats it to long-on"
"floats it up just around off, he defends by coming forward"
"slightly short and Hetmyer has decided that attack is the best form of defence - just like in the first innings. Rocks back and hits it over the bowler's head with a horizontal bat. Mahmudullah ran in from long-on and dived, but couldn't stop the boundary"
<b>cracking shot</b> Picked it up beautifully and smashed it straight back past the bowler
"<b>bye bye ball</b> Hetmyer has more than doubled West Indies score in three balls. Tossed up and he launches into it, lifts it high and handsome over long-on"
"stays back and punches this through cover. They get two easily, and Hetmyer wants the third but is sent back from almost halfway down the pitch."
"clipped to long-on, coming forward. Hetmyer has scored 18 runs - West Indies had only 11 with four wickets down!"
"nice length, defended into the off side"
"stays back in his crease, and ensures he can punch this to deep cover, taking advantage of hte slightly short length"
half step forward and turns it from off stump to short fine leg
"gets this to drift, it ends up on leg stump and Hetmyer defends solidly"
"drags this down too short, and Hetmyer goes for a full blooded pull, but straight to the deep midwicket. He's not happy, he reckons that should have gone for six"
"<b>third umpire called on for a potential run out chance</b> But Hetmyer is safe. Ambris had tucked this to square leg, and called him through. Good fielding but Hetmyer made it."
drifts too far down leg and spinning further away. Left alone by the batsman
"too full, and he plays it with the turn to nudge it to midwicket"
"slightly short and room outside off, which allows him to stroke it down to deep point with a horizontal bat"
"quicker and flatter, he was almost caught on the crease but brings his bat down in time to defend"
steps down the track to get to the pitch of the ball and tap it to long-on
"good length ball, spinning across the batsman from leg stump, he stays back and tucks it to short fine leg"
"slanted across the batsman from round the wicket, but ends up too full and he slaps it down to long-off"
"full ball on the stumps, defended with a straight bat"
"<b>outside edge goes past first slip</b> lucky for Hetmyer. He stayed back to that and tried to close the face of the bat, but the ball spun more than he expected. He was left with bat hanging, and the ball whizzed off the outside edge, but well clear of the slip"
""
"<b>nicely played</b> goes deep in his crease to this length ball on off, and cuts it with the turn. Great timing and it flies to the point boundary"
""
"goes across and down on one knee to sweep. Doesn't connect well, it takes the glove and goes to short fine"
"<b>caught at long-off</b> stepped down the track and gave himself some room. Got to the pitch of the ball and struck it well, but picked out the man at long-off perfectly. He had just been pushed back from mid-off. Brief but entertaining knock from Hetmyer ends"
"good length and turning sharply into the batsman. So sharply in fact that it ends up on his pads, and he flicks it to square leg"
comes down the track - he's been doing that a lot to spinners - and taps it to long-on
"<b>just short</b> went for the sweep, and the ball went off the back of the bat. Looped up and landed near the batsman. Backward short leg had a moment of hesitation before putting in the dive, but it just eluded him"
goes well back in his crease to play it with the turn into midwicket
"fuller ball, he comes forward and drives it nicely through cover"
"fuller on the stumps, and he connects with the sweep, but straight to square leg. Played the sweep almost standing up"
"<b>lovely ball</b> loops on the stumps, draws him forward, dips and turns past the bat. Nothing much the batsman can do about that"
gets him forward again but this is a bit fuller and he manages to defend it.
"full and on the stumps again, defended off the front foot"
"changes his line a tad to outside off, the batsman is drawn forward again, and the ball spins and takes a thickish outside edge. But soft hands, so it bounces well before reaching slip"
"nicely tossed up, he comes forward but doesn't get to the pitch. Ends up tapping it to mid-on"

"similar ball, he comes forward and turns it round the corner, but cant get past the man close in"
"tossed up outside off, he comes forward to push it to long-off"
plays with soft hands to gully
"waited and played it late, almost too late, eventually opened the face of the bat to run it down to third man"
"given some air, outside off. He went for the big drive but only inside-edged it to his toe"
"<b>big appeal for lbw, given immediately and he reviews</b> squared him up with the turn, it pitched on middle and leg and was spinning across him. Might be missing off, or umpire's call. Ultra Edge confirms no bat, so it's down to ball tracking. And it's hitting off stump flush - three reds. Taijul has his third. West Indies are sinking at a pace that will give the Titanic a complex"

"tossed up outside off, he comes down the track and gets to the pitch of the ball to stroke it through cover"
"down the track again, and patted to long-on"
"good length, spinning away, but he comes forward to defend it solidly"
stays in his crease and cuts this to point
"tossed up on off, pushed into cover off the front foot for a single"
"nice loop, drifting across the batsman and turning back into him. Maybe a touch too full, which allows him to dab it down into the leg side with relative ease"
"very full, and driven off the front foot but the bowler dives across his left to field"
"<b>beats everyone</b> drifted across the batsman, and turned back in through the gap. Went agonisingly close to off stump, and even beat Mushfiqur to go for four byes"
"drifted down leg, and he had moved across to flick it. Misses it but Mushfiqur, standing up to the stumps, can't block it either. Four more byes"
"a little fuller, drawing the drive, but it rolls off the inside edge to leg slip"

"drifts down the pads, and is tucked to square leg for a single"
"down the track and beaten, by the turn, but it hits his pad and rolls forward. If it had sneaked through the bat-pad gap, a stumping was on"

comes forward and steers it down to third man off the front foot
"full on the stumps, clipped to mid-on"
"<b>bowled through the gate</b> gets it to drift again, across the left-hander, which tempts him into the big drive. But the ball breaks inwards, and through the big gap to clip the stumps. It was a matter of time before this happened."
"down the track to this flighted ball wide of off stump, gets nice and close to the pitch of it and extends his arms through a sweetly timed drive to find the cover boundary"

"back of a length close to off stump, defended to short extra"
"flat length ball angling in towards middle stump and straightening. Defended back towards the bowler. A little more round-arm, this delivery"
"wow, that's square turn. Pitches outside off and beats Roach's attempted push by a couple of feet, easily"
"big appeal for lbw as this straightens on or just outside off stump as Roach presses forward to defend. Not given, and Bangladesh have reviewed... Came forward with bat and pad together and the ball didn't turn as much as expected. Actually, this may have straightened from middle stump rather than off as I initially assumed - looks close, this. Definitely pad first, and the bat jams into the pad. If ball-tracking is in his favour, this could be five for Taijul. It is. It's hitting middle stump three-fourths of the way up"
"in the blockhole on middle and off, jabbed back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the on side off the back foot"

"flatter now, not as full, slanting into middle stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"tossed up once more, on off stump, and again he gets his front leg out of the way to heave over the leg side. Doesn't quite middle it on this occasion, and the man at a deepish straight midwicket can run to his right and stop it"

"bam. Full on off stump and Warrican gives it a proper slog, creating swinging room by moving his front leg out of the way. Gets just enough bat on it for it to bounce a few times and roll to the long-on boundary"

"ooh, mishit, and that's a superb catch from Shakib at midwicket! A bit of flight on middle stump, but Warrican doesn't quite judge the length. Dips shorter than expected as he stretches out to whip it into the leg side. Bottom hand comes off the handle, and the top-edge balloons over the infield, and Shakib, turning around and running towards the boundary, judges the ball's descent perfectly. Mehidy has ended this stand at 63, and Bangladesh only need one wicket now"
"flat length ball on the pads, clipped to square leg"
"down the track to the flighted ball on off stump, drives it nicely between the non-striker and the stumps at the other end. Could have run two, but chooses not to, unsurprisingly"

"got him, has he? Yes, says Richard Illingworth, and Sunil Ambris gestures immediately for a review - but West Indies have none left! Taijul has six, and Bangladesh have gone 1-0 up in the series. Flat, on a good length outside off, and sharp turn and bounce - we haven't seen that in a while. Stretches out to defend, and has that brushed his glove through to the keeper? It hasn't, according to Ultra Edge, but there's nothing Ambris can do about that"
