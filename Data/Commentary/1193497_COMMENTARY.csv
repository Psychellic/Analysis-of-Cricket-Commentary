"uppish but wide of short midwicket as <strong>Rahmat raises fifty</strong>. Well, well, forget the fifty, there may be a wicket here. West Indies have appealed for a run out. Ikram grounded his bat at the striker's end, but dragged his bat out and walked, seemingly to congratulate Rahmat Shah for his fifty. Maybe he believed the ball was dead? It wasn't, and even though he didn't mean to steal a second run, he has to walk back. Well within the rules, West Indies have nothing to be ashamed about for appealing. Ikram will learn, for now he will be fuming at having given West Indies some leeway as this partnership threatened."
