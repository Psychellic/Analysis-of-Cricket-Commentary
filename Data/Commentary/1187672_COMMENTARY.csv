"round the wicket that habitual angle to the left-hander, slightly too straight into the hip and off the mark"
"attacking the top of off, angling in, Latham closes the face, caught in a Warner-esque second mind, and a fat edge down through third man"
"too straight, <B>sumptuous timing!</B> Can't get much out of the pitch if you pitch it there. Clipped off the toes with aplomb"
"squeezing the angles, inside-edged through the leg side as Latham jabs the bat down late"
"zoinks, that's gone a bit! Big late inswing, past the off stump, and giving Pope a chance to show off with a very competent dive down the leg side"
"another composed take, more conventional this time for Pope, as Latham leaves alone outside off"
"hitting the seam straight away, again from round the wicket, as Archer focuses on areas over wheels. So to speak. Inside-edged into the thigh pad"
"probing away, just back of a length and left alone"
"flipped off the toes, down to backward square leg"
"dabbed down into the pitch, back of a length once more"

"shoulders arms outside off stump, too wide to tempt that time"
nurdled off the pads to the leg side
"<B>leading edge!</B> That one popped on Latham as he closed the face, but didn't go to hand, on the off side"
decent bounce once more as Archer settles into a rhythm
"fuller length, speared in on middle and leg and nudged to the on side"
"propping onto the front foot, and dabbed back down the track"
"fenced away, tight lines from Archer, but no real alarm for either batsman yet"
"<B>jabbed into the cordon ...</B> but all along the ground to third slip. Very wide on the crease from Broad, and a full probing length to the left-hander"
pulls the length back a touch and left alone to a chorus of oohs from the cordon
"<B>big nip off the seam!</B> Keeps a touch low and jeepers, that's close to the top of off! A good leave in the end!"
"squared up on a fuller length, a touch of a leading edge, but they rush through for the single"
"crunched off the back foot, half-stopped at point, that was firmly struck as the ball sat up and begged outside off"
"wide on the crease once more, making an angle back into the left-hander, full length asking questions on the front foot as gully gathers"
"leaning forward, head over the ball, squeezed out to point"
squeezed off an inside edge into the thigh pad and out to the cordon
"good lift off the seam, but still no real threat as Latham leaves alone"
"<strong>jabbed down through the gap to third man! </strong> That was an edge, but a very soft one, head over the ball, blade angled down, riding the extra bounce and snaffling the boundary"
"better line and length, attacking the top of off and drawing a respectful block"
"very full this time, looping into the toe of the bat and tapped back to mid-off"
"not quite a half-volley length, but Raval is driving at this one, and it's not quite timed. Broad will like that"
"fuller, into the toes, Raval thinks better of the booming leg-glance and opts for the straightest of straight blocks"
"sizes up the length ball outside off, and leaves alone. Just the beginnings of two minds for Raval in this over"
solidly steered to point from right under the nose
"on the toes, flicked firmly to square leg"
"<strong>edged and gone!</strong> You have to say that was coming in this over... something snapped in Raval's mind as Broad started to turn the screw on that round-the-wicket line. A firm-handed drive, no foot movement, and straight into Joe Root's breadbasket at first slip. England have their breakthrough, and a hard-earned one"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
nudged to the on-side as Archer targets the full length

tucked to the leg side

"leg-sided, riding into the hip, jabbed to the on side"
half forward on the off stump as Woakes aims fuller once more
"head over the ball, solid in defence"

"outside off, through to the keeper, pushed across the right-hander"
"back of a length, Williamson pulls his bat out of harm's way"
"through to the keeper once again, dangled outside off and Williamson is almost sort-of maybe drawn into a push"
"fuller length, tighter line, better leave"
"drawn forward, head over the ball, and that's a tremendous compact wallop of a drive. Clean through mid-off from right under the nose"
"clipped off the toes, calmly worked to midwicket ... and <B>one becomes five</B> as Crawley's off-balance shy fizzes w-a-a-a-y wide of the stumps! Welcome to Test cricket new boy!"
"dabbed to the off side. In the compact batting sense, not the down-with-the-kids dance-move sense"
"<strong>beaten by the low bounce!</strong> Williamson holds his line on off stump, and the ball zings through to the keeper"
"worked to the leg side, closing the face on impact"
"on the toes, clipped to the on side, midwicket gathers"
nudged to the off side
"too tight to the hips and flicked insouciantly behind square. Curran tried to make that ball talk too much, and ended up pushing it right into freebies-ville"
"<strong>that's a sweet strike too!</strong> Even better than the last one, relying on balance, timing and placement, clipped in front of square as Curran strays to the legs again"
"rising onto the toes, and worked to the on side"
the leg side is proving profitable in this over as Curran strains for movement that isn't quite happening. Another measured flick to midwicket
"full length, attacking the stumps, Williamson closes the face on impact and takes the single to square leg"

"wicket-to-wicket, solid areas from Woakes as Williamson presses forward on off stump"
"banged into the deck, just back of a length, nudged to cover"
"nip and bounce, down the leg side, a hint of a noise but think that was hip or similar"
"leaning forward to defend, no lateral movement on show whatsoever now..."
"<B>edged and gone!</B> Wow, spoke too soon, as that one did <I>just</I> enough off the seam to kiss the edge as Williamson got squared up ... and a fat edge flew straight off the splice to Root for his second catch of the morning. Good areas from Woakes, and they snag the Big Fish!"

"beaten outside off stump, and that's a beauty, a touch of away movement on a perfect neither-nor length"

"<B>wicket to wicket does the trick!</B> Taylor is <strong>reviewing</strong>, but he's doing so reluctantly, and at the last split-second! Over the wicket from Broad, thumping the front pad as Taylor wafted across the line... hang on, there's a spike on RTS ... though it's out of synch... and it's going to be <strong>overturned for an inside-edge!</strong> Wow ...

"a floaty length from Archer, drawing the firm drive as Curran tumbles and half-stops at wide mid-off. The 100 is up"
"a flashing cut, tight to the body and gathered at point"
"<B>flashed through backward point!</B> That's good intent from Taylor, cashing in on the slightest width, he'll need to be mindful of the extra bounce if he's in that mood though ..."
"<B>crunched again!</B> Too short, too wide, that's even more in the slot for the scything blade, and sizzling past backward point"
"out comes the short-arm pull, as Taylor momentarily looks like Robin Smith in his followthrough, a belligerent front-foot flog to England's quickest quick. Lively stuff!"
"superb batting, driven with placement, closing the face on impact and whisking the ball to the edge of the rope at long-on. Archer brings out a timely boot to haul it in"
"too full, too wide, <strong>you don't get away with those! </strong> A fierce flowing square drive takes the run-rate over 3 for the first time today"

"better line and length from round the wicket, Latham lets the ball reach him and works it to point"
"<B>extra bounce outside off, and down it goes!</B> It's Stokes as well, England's best pair of hands. Archer got one to explode outside off, drawing a reflexive prod, but second slip can't cling on, diving to his left! 140kph that time..."

"solid and compact, a vertical bat to see off the length ball on off stump"
"<strong>misjudgement!</strong> He's known where his off stump is, he's been so sure of it, but this time, Broad's angle back into the leftie scrambles his geometry. A sure-set leave-alone outside off, except it wasn't... it was right on the top of off stump itself!"

"full length, outside off, blocked into the off side"

"<strong>huge appeal as Broad goes round the wicket!</strong> Were there two noises as the ball shaped into the pads? There were, a big inside-edge"
angled into the leg-side with a hop across the crease. Broad is just about making things happen at the moment
"<strong>yeehar, here comes Southee!</strong>, leaning back on a wild pull over midwicket, the ball thumps the sponge, inches inside the rope. A bit of a top-edge, but a useful sighter for New Zealand's tonker-in-chief"

"full length, whipped to the leg side"
"dabbed out to point, <strong>Santner is slow to respond to the call, </strong>and has to fling himself for the crease as the shy comes in. He was gone for all money if it hit"
"<B>a genuine edge, but clean through the gap</B> Only one slip and a gully, and that was straight down the throat of the non-existent third"
<B>violent lifter!</B> Pope can't claw that one down! Extraordinarily steep splice-threatening bounce
"<B>and again!</B> Santner drops his hands on this one though, and Pope gets hold of it too. Some intent in that over from Archer"
"<strong>gloved through to the keeper!</strong> England keep chipping away, and this is a sharp lifter on a good length from Woakes, the tight line denies Southee the chance to get out of harm's way, and that's Ollie Pope's maiden catch as a Test wicketkeeper, which is notable"
"closes the face on the full length, turned to midwicket"
"short once more, Santner ducks. This pitch is looking spicy all of a sudden"
"rolls the fingers on a cutter outside off, fuller length and almost lures a poked edge to the keeper"

"back of a length, flogged out through square leg with a round-house hoick. He keeps the strike"
"round the wicket, sharp lift into the splice"
"on the hips, and <B>flipped clean over the rope at fine leg!</B> That's the benefit of Archer's extra pace, but he middled it too, up up and away!"
"retreating to square leg a touch on that stroke, perhaps anticipating some retribution."
"<B>short again, hooked again!</B> Another supremely middled stroke, and it's <strong>clobbered the security guard clean on the head!</strong> He's fine ... but blimey, that's a proper blow to the bonce! The ricochet flew into a woman behind him and knocked her sunglasses off. Carnage!"
"banged in short again, but this time Santner ducks"
defended on the back foot
<B>thumping drive!</B> New Zealand's caution has gone to the four winds. Now it's all about runs and quickly! Powered through mid-off

"back of a length, poked back whence it came"
"pulled, top-edged, Woakes is the man on the square leg boundary, and <strong>Archer has the breakthrough!</strong> It's been hard work for England, but their toil is nearly over... maybe"
"full toss, on the legs,<strong> chipped to Sibley at midwicket</strong>, and that's the end of that! It's an easy game. A flurry of wickets and they all sprint from the field. Well, the openers do at any rate."
"solid areas outside off stump, no stroke offered"
"a bit of swing, and Burns was horribly over-balanced as the ball tailed into his pads! Laid bat on ball in the end, but that could have been awkward"
"a more confident thump through the line, gathered at mid-off"
"up on the toes, riding the bounce and pushed out to the off side"
"fired across the left-hander, no stroke that time"

"full length, a hint of swing and seam towards the cordon. No stroke offered"
firmly into line to defend
"hard-handed stab into the covers, kneeling on impact as he reaches for the length"
"<B>kerplunk!</B> Sibley ducks, sways, looks for a way out, but gets pinned <B>absolutely flush on the badge</b>, as full-frontal as Devon Malcolm's 'you guys are history' moment in 1994... out comes the physio for the mandatory concussion test. It wasn't especially short, but he simply lost it as the ball didn't get up enough for him to avoid it"
"<strong>lovely late swing!</strong> Bending back into Burns' pads, who watches well to block the ball back up the pitch. Sibley proves his wits are still about him by diving for his crease to avoid the run-out"
"<B>smoked through the covers!</B> That's a tremendous strike, down on one knee, presenting the full face, and whistling it to the rope"

"<B>ping, next batsman please!</B> That's a huge scalp, just back of a length from Woakes, and that seam movement comes to play too, kicking off the deck, kissing the edge, and fizzing to Root at a solitary wide slip. Both openers gone, and just the beginnings of bother for New Zealand!"
