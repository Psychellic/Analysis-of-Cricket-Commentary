"<strong>Perfect start for CSK and Chahar</strong>! Back of a length and angling away outside off from over the stumps, Dhawan chases  it with a cut but is rooted to the crease as he throws his hands at the ball. He only ends up dragging it back onto the stumps via a thick inside edge. Chahar pumps his fist and celebrates. Dhawan bags a first-ball duck"
"nice and full, angling in at off, then swinging away slightly, Williamson covers up in defence"
"pitched up and swinging away outside off, Williamson presses forward and taps it quietly to cover"
"Chahar goes wide of the crease, but this full ball holds its line outside off, Williamson leans into it and caresses a cover drive. There were four in the ring on the off side but Williamson still found the gap. That's how good he is"
"inswinger from Chahar, too full and finishes on the pads of Williamson. This leg-stump half-volley is delightfully flicked away behind square"
"another attempted inswinger that finishes on the pads, flicked away again, this time fine on the leg side past the left of Dhoni for three successive boundaries"
"back of a length and slanting away outside off, punched away to deep third man"

"back of a length and shaping away outside off, Williamson allows the ball to come on and then rides it out to deep third man for one more"
"similar length and outside off, Goswami stays leg-side of the ball and jabs with an open face to deep third man"
"this is <strong>regal from Kane Williamson</strong>. Just short of a good length and outside off, he leans back and cuts it away between square point and backward point"
"<b>Has Dhoni missed a run-out chance?</b> He leaps, collects the throw from Harbhajan, has enough time to deflect it onto the stumps. Instead, he tries a slam dunk and lets off Goswami. This was full and straying into the pads, picked off through square leg. They take on Harbhajan, Dhoni, and get away. Had Dhoni nailed it, Goswami would have been out"
Goswami helps one to third man and gets off strike
"slower ball outside off, 118.9ks, not sure if that was a knuckle ball. Williamson delays his push to cover"
"back of a length and <strong>climbs over middle stump</strong>. Goswami backs away outside leg, has a mighty whoosh, and collects fresh air"
"Goswami skips away outside leg, gets the full length he was looking for. He manufactures width and belts it away to the cover boundary"
"Goswami flits around the crease, Ngidi bowls a slower cutter on leg stump, dabbed to the leg side"
"another slower ball outside off, 116.7ks, Williamson spots the change-up and runs it down to third man"
"Pace on the ball now. Ngidi dives forward, pockets a  low return catch, and lets out a big roar. Goswami continues to back away outside leg, Ngidi follows him and hits a hard length. Goswami is cramped and pulls weakly. He ends up flapping a low catch to Ngidi"
"back of a length and zips away in the corridor, Pandey hangs his bat out and is beaten on the outside edge by this near 140kph dart"
"full and homing in on middle, tucked away through square leg for a couple of runs"
<strong>Williamson has been strangled down the leg side</strong>. He throws his head back in despair. Thakur sets off on a celebratory sprint. Thakur now hits a back of a length and angles it down the leg side.Williamson looks to pull but can only tickle it behind for a straightforward catch. Gloved to Dhoni. What an unfortunate way to go. Big scalp for CSK

"good length on middle, and he leans back to pull it over the infield. Man at deep midwicket though"
"outside off this time, and Yusuf makes that extra room to cut it square. Can't get that perfect timing off his bat. Straight to cover point, and the batsman looks disappointed"
"low full toss on middle, and Pandey hits this straight to the only infielder on the leg side. Watson there, and he has a shy at the non-striker's stumps. Misses!"
"good length on off, and this time Pandey punches it off his back foot. Goes past the non-striker, and to the man at long on"
"fourth-stump line, and rising onto Yusuf. Punched off the back foot to point on this occasion. Tight delivery"
"slower ball, but awry line. Going down the leg side, and Yusuf actually gloves it. Doesn't go to Dhoni straight though. On the bounce to the keeper"
"almost a perfect yorker on off stump. Yusuf jams it off the front foot, and sends it back to Chahar"
"short! On the fourth-stump line outside off, but Yusuf chooses not to engage with it. Lets it go over his shoulder and through to MSD"
"short again! And this time the square-leg umpire spreads his arms wide. Tried the slower ball, but it loops over Yusuf's head. Remember, he's a tall man"
"back of the hand again, but this length ball outside off can't be put away. Spotted it early, and tried to pull it towards cow corner, but the shot comes off the bat's toe end. Yusuf looks at his blade to see the damage..."
"full just outside off, and that's been driven off the front foot past cover. They walk across for the run"
"quicker delivery, on middle and angling down the leg. Whipped off his pads to deep backward square"
"<b>leading edge back to Jadeja!</b> Good length on middle, and looking to work it towards midwicket. He's through his shot too early, and the leading edge comes towards Yusuf, the non striker. But Jadeja scoots behind Yusuf and holds on to the offering. That's No. 5!"
"pacey! Drills this straight on middle stump, and Brathwaite defends it back to the bowler"
"<b>chance of a run out!</b> But MSD misses. Full on off, and tapped towards the leg side. But the ball's barely gone ten feet away and Carlos runs down the wicket. Yusuf tells him to race back - with MSD chasing behind it - but the direct-hit never came!"
"good length on off, and fended off the back foot. Sees the over out"
"full outside off, and the batsman goes poking at it. Glanced down to third man"

"back of a length on off, and Brathwaite walks inside the line of the delivery and flicks it to the square-leg fielder"
"full outside off, and Brathwaite takes a big stride forward to meet the ball on the full. Driven to mid off. <b>Sunrisers' run-rate still under six</b>"
"short just outside off, and the ball zips just past Yusuf's face! Nice line from Shardul"
"angling into his pads, and clipped off his toes to the midwicket boundary. The man in the deep tries to cut the boundary, but that's a futile attempt. Off the bat's sweet spot this time."
"full on middle, and he goes right across his stumps to try and sweep it square. Connects well, but only to short fine leg"
"full on off, and turning into his pads. Nudged off the front foot to the vacant mid-wicket region. Jaddu goes chasing again"
"full on off, and comfortably driven off the front foot. Mid off cuts it off"
"full on middle and leg, and Pathan can't get bat to ball. Hits his pad as he attempts a leg-side flick"
<b>stopped by Raina!</b> The drive to mid off has been stopped by a diving effort
"ends his spell with a boundary, but what a terrific spell this has been nonetheless. Length ball outside off, that he backs away and cuts past short third man. No stopping that once it beats the infielder"
"full on leg, and he misses the flick down the leg side. Hits the outside of his pad, and oes to short fine leg. Brathwaite wants the run, but Yusuf sends him back"
"back of a length on middle, but going down the leg side. A soft appeal from the bowler - for caught behind - but no reaction from the umpire"
"slower ball, and full on off. Brathwaite spots it, and waits for eternity, before whipping it to deep backward square"
"back of a length on middle, and muscled off his hips to deep midwicket. Jadeja pulls out of his throw last ball"
"yorker on off, and it's been dug away to backward point"
"slower ball outside off, and the cut's been slapped away! Enough room for the big man to finally free his arms, and that's been drilled to the sweeper cover boundary"
"<b>what a catch! Tumbling forward while completing it!</b> The stadium is on fayahhh! It was full outside off, and Yusuf's drive comes off the bat's bottom half. Low catch on offer from Bravo, and he dives forward on his follow through, holds on to the catch, and then spectacularly does a somersault to regain control. My oh my!"
"good length just outside off, but jagging into his body. Opens his bat's face and chops it down to short third man"
"length ball on off, and defended off the back foot. Bhuvi carefully ensures the ball doesn't bounce back onto his stumps"
"full on off, and pushed with the bat's open face. Goes down to third man"
"he didn't have a clue! Proper pace. Good length just outside off and zipping straight through to Dhoni. Brathwaite did try to glance it fine, but his bat was nowhere near the ball"
"length ball outside off, and opens the bat's face once again. Trickles down to third man"
"good length just outside off, and pushed with soft hands to cover point. They scamper across in a flash"
"outta control! Slower ball, full on leg stump, and bouncing down the leg side. Bhuvi's happy to let this one go"
"down the leg side again! Bravo appeals for the caught-behind, but the umpire's not interested. Calls it a wide again."
"slower ball, full on middle stump. Worked off his toes to deep backward square for a single"
"back of a length outside off, and that's been cut to Bhajji at point. Almost forgot he was in the field..."
"low full toss on off, and driven to the bowler. Mistimed, really"
"slow offcutter outside off, and jagging inwards. Big swing of the bat from Bhuvi, but he can't connect at all. Great disguise from Bravo"
"short on off, and that's been well pulled! It's sliding across the ground, but Jadeja's a beast in the deep. Covers a lot of ground in a flash, and his quick pick-up-and-throw ensures it's only a single"
"ends his spell with a yorker. Aimed at leg stump, and squeezed back towards the non-striker"
"Remember the name, part 2? Full on leg stump, and he gets his front leg out of the way, and thumps it into the midwicket boundary. The crowd's come aliiive!"
"and that's two in two. Can Brathwaite repeat his Kolkata performance? Length ball on off, and comfortable for the big man. Winds up, and then smashes this pull over wide long on."
"too cheeky, and Shardul gets away with a wide. It was full, but wide outside off, and Brathwaite tried to paddle it. Misses, but the umpire chooses to give the bowler the benefit of the doubt"
"second yorker in a row, and this time the off-stump line forces Brathwaite to stop skipping around. Mistimes his drive to cover"
"tries to lift this inside out over cover, but can't get the timing he's looking for. Goes to mid off on the bounce"
"yorker, but way too wide outside off. No movement from Brathwaite, and umpire Erasmus calls it how it is"
"full, but outside off again. Tries for the big shot, and slices it over the infield. Bhajji cleans up at sweeper cover, but his throw is flat. Chance of a run out? Nope. Dhoni misses his flick, but Brathwaite's big strides would've saved him anyway"
"slower ball, and short outside off. Bhuvi tries to pull, but it's too wide for him to drag it square. Takes the bat's toe end, and goes down the ground instead"
"length ball on middle, and going down the leg side. He tries to paddle it over short fine leg, but can't connect"
"back of a length on off, but angling right into the batsman's chest. Checks his cut, and glances it to third man for a comfortable run"
"big swing of the bat, but the ball goes straight to Dhoni. Length ball on off, but the ball takes some extra bounce after pitching. Bhuvi misses. Again"
"outside off, and Bhuvi's done playing around. Wild swing, and sliced over cover. Falls juuust short of the man in the deep"
"length ball outside off, and it's the slower one to end the over. Opens his bat's face and pokes at it gently. Trickles it down to third man. <b>Final over coming up</b>"
"yorker wide outside off.  Brathwaite slogs, but the shot comes off his toe end. Mid off intercepts"
"full and wide outside off. Shaping away from the batsman too, and he's forced to reach at it. Can't connect, but the umpire calls it as extras"
"attempted ramp, that's been played in an ugly manner to deep midwicket. Low full toss on middle, and he had shuffled across to the off side. Can't play it fine enough, but still allows them to take the second"
"juicy full toss outside off, and that's in his arc! Gets his front leg out of the way, and deposits this in the stands beyond long on"
"full, but wide outside off. This time Brathwaite expected the line, and carves it over cover! Properly muscled over cover"
"length ball on leg stump, and that's a wild, wild one! Brathwaite tries to pull it fine over short fine leg, but misses"
"<b>straight into the sightscreen!</b> Brathwaite thinks the inning's over, and walking back into the pavillion, but he's asked to wait! One ball to go. It was a length ball, and wide outside off. Allows Brathwaite to open his chest and flat-bat it over the bowler's head"
"<b>Dhoni finally hits the stumps!</b> Off the innings' final ball, heh. Shardul goes short on middle, and Brathwaite misses the pull. They're off for a bye, but Dhoni finally finds his aim. <b>Sunrisers end on 139 for 7</b>"
"<strong>gem of a ball from Bhuvneshwar first up.</strong> Full, angling in, then swings away outside off. Watson plays inside the line and is beaten"
"big inswinger from Bhuvneshwar, full again, zips back in, Watson is rooted to the crease as he is pinned on the back pad. <strong>Replays suggest an inside edge</strong>. Height also a factor"
"Bhuvneshwar drags his length back on off, Watson stands tall and punchily plays it back to the bowler"
"dug in shorter on off, jabbed back to Bhuvneshwar"
"another gem of a ball from Bhuvneshwar. This finds the outside edge of Watson. Good length, angling in towards off stump, and swings away sharply, the opener hangs his bat out and nicks off"

"short and wide outside off, Raina loves width, he reaches out for the ball and carves it away through the gap at point"
"full and wide outside off, Raina reaches out for the ball again. This time he scoops a drive in the air to the left of Williamson at short cover"

"full and angled down leg, Raina misses a flick, leg-side wide"

Raina backs away to this off-stump yorker and carves it to the right of backward point. Excellent diving save from Sunrisers' gun fielder Pandey
"full-toss outside off, Raina eases in to it and drives to the right of Pandey for four"
"<strong>Kaul floors Raina's leg stump</strong>. Raina jumps across off, exposes his leg and middle stumps, and can't meet with a flick. Perhaps, he was expecting the short ball, especially with leg-gully in place. This was full, however, and Raina gave Kaul a free path to access it"
"<strong>Cracking delivery from Kaul.</strong>. My ball of the tournament. This was the big dipper from Kaul, a la Malinga, swings away so very late. Opens up Rayudu, beats him on the outside edge, and hits off and middle. He sends Rayudu back for a first-ball duck and pumps his fist animatedly. Look at Williamson, he's pumped too. This defence is <i>on</i>"

Another googly, good length, breaks back in from outside off, Dhoni does not read the variation either, reaches out for a drive and misses. Rashid hits middle stump. Dhoni goes and with it CSK's hopes?"

"wide of the crease, back of a length and slanting in, impact in line but Bravo may have managed an inside edge"

"full, and wide outside off. Tried the wrong'un, but doesn't jag back so much. Driven with the bat's open face to cover point this time"
"full just outside off, and he misses the drive! Did the keeper drop it? Extra bounce forces the batsman to miss the drive. Replays show no edge"
"the googly! But manages to tuck it towards short fine leg for a single. It landed on off, and came back in sharply"
"full on off, and turning into his pads. Tries to whip it towards midwicket, but misses the shot. Hits his front leg, but it would've gone down leg"
"tries to play inside out over cover, but takes the bat's inside edge. These batsmen are having a rough time facing Rashid. It landed wide outside off, and enticed Bravo to drive. Comes in, and finds the bat's inside edge"

"<b>straight to first slip!</b> Half tracker on off, really, but Bravo goes chasing after it. Tries to cut, but it's the legbreak from Rashid this time. Turned a lot, and took some extra bounce too, and Bravo has edged it to <i>Gabbar</i>"
"full on middle, and turning towards the leg side. Nudges it off his pads to the backward square region"
"full on off, but spinning away from Jadeja this time. Pushed off the front foot to the cove region. Plays it rather safely"
"length ball outside off, and going straight through. Faf stands tall and slaps it past the point region to the fielder in the deep"
"appeal for lbw, but turned down! Inside edge, I think. Length ball on middle, and turning into Jadeja. Hits his front leg, and impact's in front of leg stump, but the edge saves him"
"starts off with the slower ball. Length ball, but back of a hand. Faf comes down the wicket, adjusts his shot, and then tucks it to the fielder at square leg"
"accurate! Pitches on off, and keeps it tight. Too close to Jadeja's body to play it anyway. Chooses to fend it off the back foot"
"<b>another caught and bowled!</b> The slower ball does it again. Back of a length on middle, but he's through his front-foot defense too early. Tries to check his straight drive, but still can't do enough. Hits the top half of the bat and lobs straight into Sandeep's hands. Replays suggest that was the knuckleball"
"good length, just outside off, and he pushes at it with soft hands. Played in the gap in front of cover, and Chahar gets off the mark"

"knuckle ball outside off, and Faf chooses to chop it down to backward point. Early call for the run, and he'll keep strike"
"full just outside off, and that's been muscled away to deep point. The ball went squarer than he would've wanted"

"full on middle, and angling into his pads. Pushed down the ground - off the front foot - to long on"
"full on off, but turning away from the right hander. Knocks it past the non-striker to the vacant mid-on region. Shakib goes running behind it"
"back of a length on leg, and angling further in. Faf makes room on the leg side, and drags a shot to the region between deep midwicket and long on. Two men converging, but Pandey fluffs the sliding attempt. Hits his hands and rolls into the boundary"
"<b>drilled over long on!</b> Tossed up on off, and Faf takes a big stride forward, before thumping it over the non-striker's head. The crowd erupts, and time for the <b>time out</b>"

"slower ball, dips at off, 116ks, Faf leading-edges it to the covers"
"<b>Is that a clean catch from Brathwaite</b>? He does not claim the catch. The soft signal from umpire Erasmus is out. They go to the TV umpire now. He dives forward, Brathwaite stretches his hands out, and wraps his fingers around it. Or did that bounce into the turf and into the hands. The close-ups are quite blurry. No conclusive evidence. TV umpire Ravi does not have conclusive evidence to overturn the soft signal. Chahar has to go. This was full and outside off, dragged off the bottom of the bat to long-on. Excellent effort from that man Carlos Brathwaite"
"quicker googly from Rashid, zips back in and pins the front pad below the knee-roll. The finger goes up. <b>Faf asks for a review</b>. No inside edge but this seems to be heading down the leg side. The tracker suggests it's going down leg"

"googly, inside-edged to short fine leg"

"full on a fourth-stump line, defended back to the bowler"
"<strong>ripping legbreak, beats the outside edge</strong>. Good length, angling in, then bursts away past the hanging bat"
"on off stunmp, and he tries to lift it over the bowler's head. Timed well, but it's in the air! Lucky for him, it drops short of Brathwaite at long on"
"knuckle ball outside off, and Harbhajan can't even connect with the drive. The ball angled away slightly after pitching, and that, perhaps, put the batsman off. Through to Goswami"
"full on leg, and Harbhajan attempts to flick it towards the leg side. Hits his front leg, though, and that's enough for CSK to take a single"
"low full toss outside off, and that's been slapped to cover. The shot was good enough to beat the infielder, but KW's diving effort stops the boundary"
"yorker, and just outside off. Harbhajan tries to open his bat's face, to run it down fine, but misses completely! That's zero off seven balls for Harbhajan"
"back of a length outside off, and Harbhajan pulls it to the fielder at deep midwicket. Kaul's happy to concede a single off the final ball. That means <b>Bhajji's back on strike</b>"
"slower ball, but full outside off. Big wind up from Harbhajan, but he mistimes a leg-side slog. The ball goes past Faf to long on. Importantly, gets off strike."
"overpitched outside off, and that's been drilled over cover! Manages to get his bat under this delivery, and powerfully lifts it over the infield"
"full on leg, and that's been deposited into cow corner! <b>Fifty for Faf!</b> It pitched just ahead of his front leg, and Faf's enjoying the extra pace. Gets his front leg out of the way, and swings his bat thoroughly"
"slower ball, on a good length. It pitches on off, and Faf tries to pull it square. He's deceived by the pace, and the ball comes off Faf's bottom edge. That takes the ball finer than he would've like, but Faf won't mind. Gone for four"
"full on off, and that's been creamed through the cover region. Looks like four, except Rashid's tumbling effort stops that at wide long off. Recovers quickly, and throws it in flat at the bowler's end. Brathwaite collects, and then brings the stumps down with his right hand. Harbhajan's nowhere near!"
"full outside off, and Faf connects with the square drive! Carves it past cover point, and the man in the deep can't cut it off either! Classic CSK. <B>Twenty-three runs needed off 12</b>"
"low full toss outside off, and he's edged it between the keeper and a fine short third man. It was a yorker just outside off, but Thakur manages to find some bat on it. He'll take it. CSK'll take it"
"<b>Lucky, lucky, lucky!</b> What some like to call the French cut. Length ball on off, and angling into Shardul. He tried to punch it straight, but the ball came in, took the inside edge, and went past the keeper's left for four more"
"full just outside off, and muscled over the bowler's head. Dhawan's at long off. One run to the total, but importantly Faf's on strike"
"full outside off, but the ball shapes further away. Goes beyond the tramlines, and umpire Erasmus says extras"
"knuckle ball just outside off, and Faf manages to push it towards cover. Just a single on offer this time. <B>CSK need 12 off eight balls</b>"
"full on off, and he bunts it down the ground to long off. They're going for a suicidal second, but Faf manages to complete the run! What a sprint from Faf."
"full on middle, and he's smashed a straight drive over the bowler's head! Would you believe it. The apparent villain of CSK's bowling effort has turned on the heat and how! <b>CSK need six off the final over</b>"
"<b>Straight drive over the bowler's head, and Faf du Plessis has taken CSK into the IPL final!</b> Seventh time in their history. The Wankhede's gone ballistic. It was full on off, and Faf went for the big one. Proper follow through of the bat and the ball lands just beyond the boundary line."
