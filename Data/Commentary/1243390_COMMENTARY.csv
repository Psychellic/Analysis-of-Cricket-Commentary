"starts off with a short ball, rolls his fingers across it, Pant could be run out here. Yes, he's gone. He dishes out a full-length dive, but it caught on the third. Curran calmly collects the throw and takes the bails off. Pant ran so far across on the second and that works against him on the third. Cutter outside off, leans back, forces through the gap square on the off side - to the right of sweeper. Buttler didn't gather the throw cleanly, so that fumble coaxed Pant into seeking a third. Replays indicate that there was a little hesitation from Kohli on the third"
"on a length and outside off, uses his feet and punches a single down the ground"

Iyer was threatening to jump across off, then ends up backing away outside leg. Wood bangs it so very short and shifts his lines wider. Iyer loses his shape and holes out. Kohli shakes his head. Another great outing for Wood"
Kohli swivels on the back foot and pulls with control to deep midwicket as Wood goes short and outside off once again
"back of a length, starts outside off and seams away further. Pandya has a flat-footed swish and misses"

"Wood reverts to the shorter length, the line is outside off. Kohli backs away and scythes it away to the right of deep third man"

"back of a length and outside off, punched through the line to extra cover"
"another inswiger, <strong>Thakur belts out a loud appeal for lbw</strong>. Umpire Sharma shakes his head. Kohli calls for a review of the on-field not-out decision. Was this heading past leg stump as well? Bends in to beat the inside edge and hit the front pad below the knee-roll. No bat involved, but this is missing leg stump once again. Good call from Sharma"
