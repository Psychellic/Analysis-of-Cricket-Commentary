short and sliding in at leg stump. Short-arm pull straight to deep midwicket

<b>don't stick out your hand Lasith!</b> Gill has picked the offcutter which is on a length outside off and spanked it on the up past the bowler's left. Long-off not even close
deft. Inswinging yorker at the toes. A shuffle and late bat down at it to clip it past short fine
yorker with late swing in at leg stump. Flicked through midwicket

"slower ball, short and wide outside off. Mistimed cut straight to short third"

slower short ball outside off. The revs mean this ball grips and goes over Russell's attempted cut

"length just outside off, pushed to point's left with an open face"

"length outside off, driven on the rise to mid-off"
short and into the body. A muffled pull to long-on's right
looks like a slower ball and looks like DK has picked it perfectly. Short and wide outside off. Waits on it and pulls off the front foot to bisect deep square and deep midwicket
<b>delicious!</b> What lovely timing. The old Ponting launch over midwicket from just short of a length. Regular paced delivery and his swing is perfect under this

<b>no-ball!</b> Low full toss outside off and a mistimed drive to long-off. Everything went to plan there but his landing
"short of a length at leg stump, backs away and hurriedly swipes at it. Gets it off the inside half. Good result? No, deep square must retrieve this from the boundary padding to his left"
"<b>two-handed forehand over extra cover.</b> Length ball wide outside off, he's got this front leg in the air and he wallops this, flat over the extra cover boundary"
<b>on his backside!</b> Bumrah with a sensational response. Bouncer follows him down leg side and he has to do superbly to get his face out of the way. Ends up on the floor as he attempts it
short of a length and into his body as he's hurried on the pull again. Single stolen pitch side
<b>and now Russell.</b> Overpitched ball on leg stump. Gets the front leg out of the way and slogs it over deep midwicket. Boring.
<b>how'd he do that?</b> Is possibly what Malinga is thinking as he looks for his captain on the field. There's a deep extra cover and a wide long-off. Russell bisects them with a drive
"<b>under-edge bounces over the keeper!</b>  Obviously he meant that. Length ball wide outside off, stays still and throws the hands at it. It bounces into the turf and clears the keeper"
"<b>on the bounce to long-off</b> and they won't run. That is a dangerous length from Malinga and he gets way with it. Length outside off, hammered on the up"
"yorker outside off, chopped to deep point"
"<b>and Russell makes it 232!</b> The highest score of the season. Also his highest of the season. Length outside off. Lots of room. Poor bowling. Russell drills it over long-off, flat"
