closes the face as he plays with the angle but the sharp turn results in a leading edge that pops into the off side
"gives the bowler the charge, swings big and connects with thin air. And Sarfraz whips the bails off in the blink of an eye. All Denly can do is turn around and watch the stumps being broken. Full marks to the bowler for flighting it up just enough to pull the batsman out of his crease and then undoing him with dip and drift and turn. He's getting some sharp spin here tonight"

"has he been caught here? That's a brilliant catch. But the umpires are not sure. They refer this upstairs. Soft signal is not out. Anwar Ali at long-on dives forward and takes it inches away from the ground, hence the uncertainty. And seems like he's taken it clean. That's a beautiful catch.
