"full on middle, Head backs away and lifts the ball over mid-off"
"yorker on middle, drilled down to mid-on"

"nice and full outside off, Head looks to launch it downtown. Does not time it well enough, scoops the ball over Azhar at mid-off"
"high short ball outside off, Head has a crack at it with the pull. Skies over midwicket. Sharjeel at deep midwicket runs across to his right, puts in the dive, but the ball eludes his reach. Long-on runs to his left and mops it up"

"full and wide outside off, 145.6ks, Maxwell, having backed away, can't put bat on ball"

"Head puts Hasan in the stands beyond midwicket. Length ball outside off, another slower one, drops down to one knee and smites a slog-sweep"
"Juggles and takes it on the third attempt. Azhar has a wry smile. Head walks back for 128, acknowledging the applause at his home ground. Full and angling away outside off, Head eyes a leg-side slog, ends up skying an overhead catch to long-off. Azhar hangs onto it.... just"

"full cutter outside off, Faulkner swings way too early and misses"
"slower bouncer outside off, Faulkner has a swat at it and top-edges it away to the right of deep square leg. Hafeez moves to his right, is lazy to bend down as he looks to scoop it back into the field of play. Instead, escorts the ball to the boundary"
"wide yorker outside off, Faulkner can't jam it out. He calls his partner through for a bye. Handscomb makes it even as Rizwan connects with the direct hit at the striker's end"
"slower short ball on the leg stump, Handscomb does not get enough power behind the pull. He can't manufacture his own pace. Holes out to Hafeez at deep square leg running across to his left. Wahab finishes with a wicket. He has done fairly well today even as his colleagues crashed and burned"
"yorker on off, Starc can only squeeze it through cover"
"full and outside off, Faulkner lays into it, smearing a drive wide of sweeper"

"another wide. Starc slants this a long way down the leg side. Sharjeel swivels to try and pull, but no way is he meeting that"
"short, rising over off stump. Not too much room to free his arms through the pull, so he plays a short-arm checked pull into the gap to the right of square leg"
"this one isn't short enough to pull, hits him on the stomach as he attempts the shot anyway"
"lovely. Fullish, swinging away on a sixth-stump line, inviting the drive away from the body. Sharjeel plays and misses again. Needs a bigger stride forward to drive those"
"length ball in the corridor, a bit of away-swerve. Azhar leaves it alone"
"ooh, this one swings even further, from slightly wider outside off. Azhar pokes at it, playing a half-hearted back-foot punch, and misses by a long way"
"length ball close to off stump, nicely done. Plays a soft-hands push towards mid-off and calls his partner through for a single"
"short and wide, was there for the cut, but he is maybe slightly late on it and the ball rises over his top edge"
"far more controlled this time, chops the ball down to point. This one didn't bounce as much, and the line was a little closer to the batsman"
"this one isn't quite short enough to cut, and it comes back in late to sneak past the inside edge"
"full-toss, and that must hurt. Fast, at the batsman, and swinging in late. Looks to flick it hurriedly and only manages an inside-edge onto the inside of his left thigh"
"low full-toss on off stump, jams his bat down to block to mid-on"
"another full-toss, low, but this one is way outside off stump. Azhar reaches out, meets it with a horizontal bat, and stabs it to the right of the diving Maxwell at backward point"
"gone! Full, swinging in, and it's so hard to drag your front leg away from those. He's forced to play across it, misses it by a long way, and he doesn't bother reviewing. I'd like to see ball-tracking anyway - seemed like there was just a bit of a chance it may have swung down the leg side. Nope. Hitting the middle of leg stump, it says"

"back of a length, a bit of swing towards middle stump to cramp Sharjeel. Defended back towards the bowler"

"full on off stump, jabbed to mid-on"

"and again, shortish ball cramping Sharjeel for room. Ends up hitting him on the body as he tries to tuck it into the leg side"

"full on off stump, driven back straight and Cummins asks for a run-out. He thinks he's got a hand on it to deflect the ball into the stumps. Was Babar inside his crease? Let's see what the replays say. Looks like there was the tiniest touch of the fingertip... but Babar has stretched back and made his ground comfortably."

"length ball on middle stump, slogged away, on the bounce, to deep midwicket"
"back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face to stab it down to third man"
"full on off stump, and that's <b>dropped</b>. Long-on was back, Akmal decided to take him on, and didn't get as much pace onto the bat as he'd have liked. Scooped it up, and Handscomb, running to his left and reaching overhead, got both hands to the ball but couldn't hold on"
"on the pads, clipped away through square leg"
"full, angling down leg. Rizwan can't connect with the flick"
"fullish, angling into off stump, driven firmly, beats cover diving to his right, but can't beat Warner, running to his left from mid-on"
"short, angling into the body, and that's excellent, swivelled to pull it from just in front of his chest, finds the gap between deep midwicket and long leg"
"ooh, what a follow-up. Back of a length, angling into off stump, straightening late. Opens up Akmal and beats his outside edge as he looks to defend, feet rooted to the spot"
"fullish on off stump, and that's a safe shot now that mid-on and midwicket are in the circle. Doesn't really middle this slog, but gets it safely over the gap between the two fielders"
"shot! That's a length ball angling into off stump, nothing too wrong with it, considering the movement he's getting. Brings his bottom hand into play and whips it wristily over the gap to mid-on's left"
"length ball on off stump, punched back to the bowler, who sees Akmal out of his crease and fires a throw that narrowly misses off stump"

"short outside off, looks like another slower ball. Akmal waits this time before dabbing it down to third man"
"bouncer, difficult one for Rizwan to negotiate, he has to hook from over his right shoulder. Top-edges and it loops over the keeper and lands in the gap to the right of long leg"
"short outside off, and that's timed too well for Rizwan's liking. Goes for the slash, ends up slicing under the ball, and does it carry to Starc diving forward from third man? He himself isn't sure. They're checking upstairs now... Soft signal is out. Looks like he's taken it cleanly. Yup, out, and is that it for Pakistan?"
"length ball slanting away from off stump. Amir looks for the drive through cover, doesn't get forward quickly enough and he's comfortably beaten"

"back of a length on middle stump, defended to cover"
"back of a length outside off, punched off the back foot to sweeper cover"

"slower length ball on middle and off. Looks to make room to slap through the off side, can't get it past cover"
"now he middles one. Fullish on middle stump, makes himself room again and lifts it over extra-cover"
"full on leg stump, driven with a lot of effort but straight to mid-on"
"shortish now, looks like another slower ball. Amir clears his front leg early, but then spots the change-up and holds his shape, and that allows him to time his swat over midwicket as sweetly as possible"
"slower ball, full and wide, and Akmal smacks it over mid-off. Picked his spot, and got exactly the delivery he needed. Cleared his front leg to make himself extra swinging room"
"yorker on off stump, jabbed away to backward point and he wants a single. He's nearly halfway down the pitch before Amir sends him back. Makes his ground safely enough in the end"

"full-toss outside off, Wahab slices it over cover point, and Zampa, running in from the boundary and diving forward, gets both hands to it and <b>spills it</b>."
"what is happening here? Full toss on off stump, looks to push towards mid-on and gets a leading edge that loops over short cover, to his left. Starc is furious"
"full outside off, Wahab has a big swing at it, and misses"

"dangled up slow outside off, Wahab is too early into his slog-sweep, can't connect"
"this time it's too full for the slog-sweep, bottom-edges it to short fine leg"
"down the track comes Hasan, and Pakistan are eight down. Slowed it down, the tailender was through his slog well before it arrived, and then it spun away and offered Wade a simple stumping"
"and that is that. Yorker on middle stump, Wahab makes room to try and drive that through the covers, and he misses. The bails light up, to signal a 57-run win for Australia. Shoaib Malik, who retired hurt after being hit on the forearm, won't come out to resume his innings"
