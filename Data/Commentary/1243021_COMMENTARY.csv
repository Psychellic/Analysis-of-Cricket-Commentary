"full on middle at 96 kph, punched back to Nawaz."

Nawaz flights this up on a fullish length on middle at 94 kph, but not nearly full enough to go for a slog, it spins sharply to produce a leading skied edge over extra cover. Babar backpedals from the ring to take a simple catch five yards outside the circle."

"<strong>slower ball offcutter and Hasan gets his revenge!</strong> Just as Hasan Ali released all the pressure with a trio of boundaries, he bounces back with a gem. van Biljon was getting carried away and instead of giving it a front foot defense that it deserved, tried to whip this through midwicket but is beaten by a big gap between bat and pad as the cutter deviates back to pierce leg stump."
"starts way too short on fifth stump, Malan smashes him through wide long-on to the rope."
"short and wide, slaps this to the cover sweeper."
"<strong>another wicket falls playing against the turn! South Africa not learning their lessons. </strong> Zahid flights this up full on fourth stump, may have been a googly with the extra air. But Klaasen goes to sweep first ball and the extra bounce produces a chance. Short fine leg is perfectly positioned for the top edge. He shuffles left and takes a sliding catch."
<strong>Two in two! Has to be! Topspinner traps him on the crease. Given not out! But after 12 seconds of discussion they go for the review!</strong> I thought live this was out. He was hit very deep in the crease in front of middle and leg. Replays show no bat on it and <b>ball-tracking indeed shows three reds ripping out leg stump.</b> Malan got in trouble playing back when he should've been on the front foot for the length this was bowled. Not sure why there was so much reluctance initially to use the review. That was stone dead!
Yuck! Short ball flighted a foot and a half down leg side. Wide called.
"now a googly lands short on fourth stump and spins sharply away, misses a cut."
another full ball on the stumps and pinged on the pads below the knee roll in front of leg! Phehlukwayo pays the price for going onto the back foot like Malan instead of striding forward. <strong>But he calls for the review! </strong>Only thing that may save him is if this was pitching outside leg. And sure enough <strong>this one is pitching marginally but clearly outside the line of leg stump. </strong>So Phehlukwayo is spared by the third umpire.
"good length ball on fifth stump, spins in and defended to midwicket."
"wretched shot for the situation. Phehlukwayo slog sweeps to deep midwicket. This was flighted full but on about eighth stump. Phehlukwayo had to reach out a very long way to drag this back to the leg side and tries to muscle this over the man at cow corner but doesn't get the elevation and a simple catch is taken six yards in at head height. Considering the carnage of the last over by Zahid, that is not going to be something Phehlukwayo will be rushing to share on his Instagram stories."

"good length ball on off, prods this with soft hands into the off side."
"googly lands full on fifth stump, prods forward and pushes this into the covers."

good length ball on sixth stump spins in sharply and is defended on the back foot to cover.
"back of a length, flogged firmly out to the cover sweeper and they trot the single"
"plants the front dog, and belted high into the night sky! Doesn't get hold of it properly, but that's bissected two men in the deep. Excellent gap-finding in the end"
"into the toes, flicked to the on-side, more calm gap-finding"
"<B>honk!</B> That's a slo-mo splatting from Pretorius. Opening his stance, winding into a monstrous yahoo across the line, gentle turn from Zahid, and time almost stood still as the bat and ball passed one another like ships in the night, before the middle stump was thumped three-quarters of the way up. Whoops"
"cuffed through backward point, and that'll help the cause. A bit outside-edgy, but safe enough, leaning into the width, and getting plenty bat on it"

"fenced down to third men, Afridi tumbles well to intercept"

"swing on a full length, slower ball too. Fortuin is beaten all ends up but that was doing too much as it slammed the pads and flicked away from extras"

"outside off, jabbed to third man for another single"
"<B>flat-batted through long-on!</B> That's a crunching swing from Miller, hitting the back-of-a-length delivery at the top of the bounce, baseball-style. Excellent thwacking"

Fortuin returns the compliment
"carved firmly out to deep cover, powerful swipe but there's a sweeper in place"
"<B>clothed to long-on and Fortuin is lucky to survive!</B> An aggressive smack but he was cramped on the bat-swing, and Shaheen chooses to back-pedal and save the four, rather than attack the catch"
"<B>145kph comet from Hasan!</B> Good luck keeping that out! Fortuin is not so fortuinate this time, a pearling inswinging yorker crashes into middle right at the base of the stumps. And that's exposed the folly of South Africa's earlier batting. You can't legislate for those ..."
"clipped down to fine leg. Threatening length once more, getting off strike is the best thing he could have done there"
"round the wicket, cracked hard from the full length out to deep point"
another single to keep the strike moving
"banged in short, Miller hits down on his pull, dragging it from shoulder height outside off, in front of square"

"<B>kapowed for four through point!</B> Outstanding power and authority on the square drive, down on one knee, clobbered fiercely over the ropes!"
"<strong>loose on the legs, and the runs are cascading!</strong> Shaheen missed his yorker, Miller had only to connect on his clip, and that's whistled to the rope too!"

"short and whistling from Afridi, eludes a wipe across the line"
"nudged to third man, trying to get the single, but the ring is well set"
"<B>top-edged through fine leg!</B> Every little helps, short from Shaheen and Sipamla was never in control, but the ball looped away safe, can't set a field for those!"
"thumps the pads on a full length, big appeal but shaping past the stumps, Miller scampers back on strike as the deflection flies out to point. Pakistan are <B>reviewing</B> but this looked optimistic... indeed it was"
"very well bowled, yorker length, Miller can only inside-edge onto his own pads, and there's no run there either"
"inswinging full-toss, attempted yorker, flicked to the man at backward square but Sipamla is on auto-run and that's an easy single to keep the strike"

"short, launched, not timed ... <B>dropped by Babar onto the rope!</B> Oh dear, that was a simple take at long-on, hands high above the head, and it's wriggled through his fingers, onto the boundary sponge to gift another six!"
"fuller length, right up to the toes, Miller doesn't connect this time, and declines the single. He wants the big finish!"
"<B>full toss, and six to finish in style!</B> Miller's absolutely nailed his brief, 25 off the final over, as Ashraf lets slip a thigh-high full bunger, and that's belted dismissively on the up over deep square leg! Have some of that!"

"<strong>Yikes! You can drive a double-decker through that bat-pad gap!</strong> Beautiful flight from Shamsi landing this on a fullish length on fourth stump, the length encourages a drive but it spins sharply back past the bat to clatter into middle stump.

"<strong>oh dear. For as good as Rizwan has been this series, that was a positively dreadful sweep shot, and now an even worse decision to ask for a review. As plumb as it gets. </strong> It was a very full delivery on middle, practically a full toss as he tries to sweep a yorker length ball pitched too full for the sweep shot from Shamsi. He plays late and over the top of this, struck on the bottom of the pad just above the boot tongue in front of middle stump. Ball-tracking shows it was ripping out leg stump with a full red. <strong>Pakistan lose a review. </strong>"

darts this flat down the leg side. Wide called.
"charges Fortuin and is fortunate this lands in no man's land!

"too full, too straight, too tricksy off the pitch, and <strong>Talat has wafted all around it!</strong> Played for the spin, this one zipped through, walloping the off stump and leaving a bigger dent in Pakistan's chase. It might be Babar or bust at this rate ..."

"tight wicket-to-wicket line, just back of a length and holding up in the turf. Cautious prod to defend the timbers"
"shorter, and this time Babar can free his arms with a whip to leg, but the sweeper limits the damage. That's a very useful over to tighten the requirement. The hundred is up, South Africa were 93 for 7 at this stage, but Miller was only getting started..."
"<strong>clattered through backward point!</strong> Pretorius's first ball back skids into another wafty cut, and immediately he's under pressure"

"too short once more, Babar doesn't quite time his pull but with long-on set deep, he seizes his chance to sprint back for two"
"<B>bowled him!</B> Perfection from Pretorius, so full and crucially it tails in late, cramping Babar as he plays across the line and finds the ball is always ahead of his bat! A priceless strike at a crucial juncture. A decent return to form for Babar, but has he left too much for his team-mates?"

"another waft at a back-of-a-length wide ball, a fumble from the keeper denies another dot"
"<strong>slower ball, piled through the line, and clears the leg of long-on!</strong> Phehlukwayo over-thought that one, ended up dobbing it into the slot, and once the pace was picked, that was curtains!"
"wide and full, he reverts to that outside-off approach and claws his over back with another priceless dot"
"huge wipe, high into the night sky ... who wants it? No-one, it lands safe in the covers, but wait ... <B>this looks like a run-out!</B> A bit of ball-watching all round ... but no, the return to the keeper is fractionally too late from Klaasen. Gosh. And breathe!"
"too wide, outside the tramlines as Faheem cocks his wrists and lets it go"
"decent finish, shape back into the left-hander on a full length, snicks the inside edge, on the bounce through to the keeper. Lots of dots means only ten from the over, despite that six"

"shuffling at the crease, opening the face on a full length, poked out to backward point"
"<B>slogged straight to long-on!</B> Fortuin snags a priceless wicket with the final ball of his spell, sliding across the left-hander, forcing him to over-reach in his bid for a power-hit, and he can't connect properly! Straight down the throat, as this chase see-saws once more!"
"wide of off stump, and eludes a helicopter wipe of the wrists"
"exceptional bowling! <B>Oh, that's harsh!</B> No stroke offered as Pretorius finds the perfect tram-line cutter, but it's called wide"
"cracked out to deep point, again aiming wide, forcing the batsman to reach for it, and he does so effectively enough"
"slower ball, and battered through the line towards long-on, gathered on the bounce and it's just another single. Hasan had rather higher ambitions for that one"
