"short, cramps him with the ball coming in, short-armed to mid-on - tidy opening over from Mahmood"
"<b>bowled 'im through the gate!</b> Moeen finds his line from round the wicket straight away, and he topples Zaman with his first ball! Nicely flighted but this didn't turn, as the batsman was expecting, simply scuttled on with the arm and into the top of middle stump. Good night!"
"over the wicket, tossed up and clipped through mid-on for his first international run"

"shortish length and worked away through the leg side, just a single, decent start from Jordan"
"full and fast, up in the blockhole and Azam can only bunt to mid-on"
"<b>castled!</b> Curran goes straight through Pakistan's captain and talisman! Perfect length, Azam a little flat-footed as he aimed a wafty drive, and the ball hit the seam before coming back and properly jiggering his stumps! *Powerplay wicket klaxon* England have a second for the night"
"pitched up, skidding on to the pads, tucked towards short fine leg"
"short, pulled from outside off, single to deep square leg"
"bangs in the bumper wide of off stump, Haider bottom-edges a pull through to the keeper"

"length, 84mph/136kph and heading leg side as Hafeez swings to leg... there was a sound, umpire Michael Burns says 'not out', but no wide signalled. Flicked the pad"

"drops short, Haider goes back on his stumps and flicks through backward square leg"
"bit of flight, this spins away as Haider reaches out and dabs for one"
"flat outside off, cut hard behind point and it looks to be rolling to the boundary marker... until Gregory throws himself full length to pull the ball in! <del>Top work in the deep, I think</del> Still four because his knee was touching the rope (although it requires multiple replays to confirm)"
tossed up and slapped down the ground to long-on
"googly, tucked off the stumps through midwicket"
driven hard but he picks out mid-off
"clubbed leg side, the long part of the ground again... <b>clears the leaping Sam Billings at deep midwicket!</b> Did Billings misjudge it? He seemed a long way in, the ball went yards over his head in the end, bouncing away for four"
shortish and angled to third man playing back
"short and swung away behind square on the leg side, Banton does well to cut it off but they hare back for two"
"bouncer, 80mph/129kph and climbing through wide of the stumps... Hafeez wanted the extra there"

"ooh err, loses his line here, wide of the cut strip and spinning further past Bairstow for a couple"

"floats this up full down the leg side, spins through past the stumps as he attempts another slog-sweep"
"<b>hoicked over midwicket on the sweep</b>, this is going to skip away between two fielders set back leg side... <b>Half-century for Hafeez</b>, fourth in his <a href=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/41434.html?class=3;orderby=start;orderbyad=reverse;template=results;type=batting;view=innings>last five T20I innings</a> for Pakistan"

"<b>bowled full pint!</b> Off stump is flattened by a fizzing yorker, and Haider's fun on debut is over! Jordan hits the target with one that tails back in at pace with Haider looking to clear the front leg... Still, he's announced himself to the world in fine style, has Haider Ali"
"fired in full straight again, squeezed out behind point... England <b>review</b> for lbw, but that's hit the middle of the bat! Quickly turned down by Alex Wharf, the TV umpire, and England lose one of their two reviews"
speared wide of the stumps at 86mph/138kph and Hafeez can't lay bat on it
"full toss, 82mph/132kph and mistimed into the midwicket area... was it above waist height? Not deemed so by the on-field umpires, but looked close to me"
"another full toss, swung behind square on the leg side, Rashid has to run around"
"that's a high full toss, flung raggedly down the leg side, YJB does well to prevent it running for four"
"slower ball, full outside off and Shadab slogs without timing to long-on"
"<b>just clears mid-off</b>, tonking the slower ball down the ground for a welcome boundary!"
"short ball, pulled behind square"
"back of a length again, maybe pace off and Shadab misses with a back-foot carve"
"<b>gets this away over backward point!</b> On his toes and opening up to play this late behind square, gets it through the infield and will pick up four!"
"<b>heaves a full toss into the stands!</b> Deliverooed for six, a standing wallop as Curran misses his length"
"full and quick on off stump, dug out for one"
"full toss, 82mph, this time Shadab can only scoop one back over the bowler's head"
"goes full and wide, jams down for one through gully"
"slower ball, Shadab swings like big bad Benny Goodman but only manages a bottom edge into the leg side"
"length ball, paddled away through square leg from outside off - 11 off the over but could have been worse for Curran after that start"
"pitched up and dragged into the leg side, they'll only get one"
"pitched up and following Shadab as he steps to leg, clipped out to deep midwicket"
"hacked over the leg side, between deep midwicket and deep backward square for two"

"<b>swiped over backward square leg!</b> Shadab gets his second boundary with a funky flip, bottom handing this between two men back on the rope"
"full length, 87mph/139kph and he chips this into a gap at wide long-on"
"attempted yorker, slightly too full... <b>caressed for six!</b> Jordan only just missed his mark there, but Hafeez took it on the full and whispered it back down the ground, all the way!"
"<b>dropped!</b> Hammered through the off side, Morgan can't quite reel it in... Flings himself to his right at extra cover, got one hand to the ball, <b>couldn't cling on!</b>"
"full outside off, Shadab goes across his stumps and misses with a cheeky ramp"
"<b>bunted to mid-off!</b> Jordan gets another, Shadab picking out Curran for a simple catch... didn't quite land the yorker but it does the job, couldn't get under the ball"
"<b>dropped!</b> Imad slogs a slower delivery straight up, looks to be a simple catch coming in from long-on,<b> but Curran shells it this time!</b> Into the hands and out again"
"heaved through the leg side, they'll get a couple to Curran at wide long-on this time"
"pitched up, 84mph/136kph in the slot and pounded down the ground to long-on"
"over the wicket to the lefty, sprayed wide of the tramlines"
"fired across the bows again, Imad carves a top edge down to third man"
"goes for the blockhole again, Hafeez swats a full toss down the ground and comes back as long-on runs around"
"length outside off, cutter from Mahmood, Hafeez sets himself but can't get it past the man at cover"
"angled across on a length, 84mph/136kph and Imad whacks it along the ground to the cover sweeper"
"<b>dropped?</b> Think it went straight through Mahmood in his follow through, the ball squeezes past mid-off but long-on comes around... so Hafeez equals his highest T20I score and England will need 191 to win the game and the series"
"tight line, bit of swing back into the right-hander, tucked off the hip to midwicket to get off the mark"
"shaping across Bairstow's bows, left alone with a flourish as it climbs through to Sarfaraz"
"yeehaw! Fuller length, outside off, Bairstow plants the front foot and has a monster munch outside off, but catches only thin air"
"<B>snorter!</B> Outswing, outswing, inswing ... timber! An exceptional yorker, Bairstow blinks in bafflement as he trudges off with his stumps rattled. He hardly saw that, but he heard it alright! Shaheen is gleeful, and Pakistan are in the game!"
a flat-footed waft as Shaheen dangles a back-of-a-length ball outside off. No contact. A big opportunity for Malan ...
"on the back foot, flashed down to third man with an open face, and finds enough of a gap to pick up a couple"
"advancing to the pitch, but gets too close to the pitch, and squeezes his drive into the covers"
"standing firm in the crease this time, trying to open the face into the covers"
"round the wicket once more, and <B>flogged with intent, clean through the covers!</B> He reached that on the full, and timed the pants off it"
"<B>reverse sweep, and he's nailed it!</B> No messing around from Banton here, picking his stroke early and battering it hard through backward point"
"galloping to the pitch again, Imad sees him coming and fires it in flatter. Blocked in a hurry"
"<B>another reverse sweep, but so close to the fielder this time!</B> Inches short of the man at backward point, who made the ground but pulled out at the last second as he yorked himself. Precious runs for England"
"hustled on the back foot, defended into the off side as Malan is squared up in defence"
"a flat-footed slap, and <B>Malan gets away with a leading edge!</B> Cramped for room on the carve as Shaheen follows him into the body, at 89mph, and the shot plops in no-man's land at backward point"
"beaten off the pitch, perfect seam, hitting the deck outside off and nibbling past the outside edge"
"back of a length, cracked hard but not timed back to the bowler"
"flogged once again, back down the pitch, England just putting bat through ball at the moment, with no real plan against some sharp pace"
"<B>whistles through to the keeper!</B> Proper fast bowling this, hitting the deck and leaping past the splice. Lively effort!"
"<B>pounded with oodles of lovely bottom hand!</B> Banton is sized up his options, and reckons Imad must go! Right to the pitch and tonked through wide long-on!"
"another skip to the pitch, another fast, flat response, scuffed to the on-side"
"biffed off a good length, but straight to square leg. A precious dot"
"<B>that's not a dot!</B> Tossed up wider, outside off, and Malan rifles his drive, on the up and clean through extra cover. Shot"
"Imad comes round the wicket, and ... <B>that's a fine catch on the edge of the rope!</B> It's the shorter leg-side boundary, Malan was cramped on the slog-sweep but rightly felt the shot was on, and a few more inches would have sufficed! Instead it's a well-timed leap, and another precious breakthrough!"
"on the back foot, shovelled to the on-side, 'only one!' is the yakka from Sarfaraz behind the stumps. Lots of hustle from Pakistan in the field"
"<b>c-r-u-n-c-h-e-d</b> through the covers! A stride to the pitch, and a lovely crispy drive into the gap. Like a firm young carrot..."
"thumped in short, energetic from Rauf as Banton claws a pull around the corner, and into the gap at backward square"
"very full, thumps the pad as Banton sets off for a single, and Morgan gets into a tangle with Rauf as he turns back for a quick single. All very innocent, and on we go"
"banged in short, but it doesn't get up, and Banton lays his pull in the line of the ball, and the pace does the rest, through backward square"
"squeezed from a full length, down into the pitch, Banton digging out the attempted yorker with every part of his stance"
"flipped through fine leg, and it's an no-ball for the full-toss as well... <B>free hit coming up!</B>"
"a stand-and-deliver tonk to the on-side, but can't quite pick the gap. Still, Banton is on one again"
"on the back foot, boshed into the covers without much timing. 85mph first-up ..."
"Banton gallops across his crease, looking to flip the ball over his shoulder, but doesn't make contact this time"
"flicked up and over midwicket, and Morgan spots the opportunity for two early. Good running to keep England ticking"
"battered off a good length, hard through midwicket, baseball style. Plugs five feet short of the fielder... and another <B>free hit coming up!</b>"
"panned on the up, over long-off. Wahab just about gets away with that one"
"on the back foot, open face through third man"
"fractionally off-line and a little too short, Banton eases it off the hips through fine leg and rattles into the 40s"
"back of a length, turning into the left-hander, who wafts a defensive slap out to cover"
"biffed off the back foot, climbing into the width, hitting with the spin out to deep cover, and cut off in the deep with a tumble"
"another slap into the covers, but can't find the gap"
"a cuffed pull, not timed, and picked up at long-on"
fired down the leg side to ruin an otherwise tidy over
"<B>and that's properly ruined it!</B> Legbreak, tossed into Morgan's arc, and out comes that familiar contemptuous slam, up and over midwicket!"
"<B>run out!</B> A terrible mix-up! Morgan wanted the run, Banton turned it down late. The skipper is utterly stranded and Pakistan are cockahoop! They needed that! A slap into the covers, Babar gathered quickly and spooked the non-striker. Oops"
"into the toes, clipped to midwicket, to bring the formless Moeen into the firing line..."
"pushed across the left-hander, a slapped drive down to third man to get off the mark"
"on the hips, whipped to the on-side without much timing"
"fuller length, angled across Moeen who hops back to prod a block out to point"
"<B>so full and thuds the pad!</B> Oh my, that is excruciatingly close, and Pakistan review! It was coming in with the arm, had to be hitting on or around off stump... I reckon it'll be at least umpire's call on line... maybe even smashing off. <B>Smashing it is!</B> A fine review to end a fine innings. Banton can't atone for running out his captain, and now Pakistan are right in the hunt!"
poked into the covers... England have the challenge their lower-middle order has been waiting for...
nudged off the legs to the on side
"pressed into the covers, another single as Billings finds his range"
prodded to the on-side once more
"twirled onto an excellent length outside off, firmly blocked back to the bowler"
"eased out to point off the back foot, this is a very placid over for Pakistan, as they tighten the noose on this mid-innings"
"flapped off the back foot, and <B>finds the gap!</B> A fraction too short from Shadab, Billings' heart was in his mouth for a moment as deep midwicket lurked, but he nailed it well enough"
"opens the face on the back foot, to third man. Moeen content to nurdle for the moment as he tries to rediscover his touch"
"jabbed off the back foot, down into the gully. Sharp pace from Wahab to keep the new batsmen hopping"
"whipped with more of a flourish from Moeen, but the same upshot, a single to deep square leg"
flinched back to the bowler as Wahab hits the deck just back of a length again
"too short and leg-sided, and <B>excellent from Billings</B>, picking off the pull with a roll of the wrists behind square. Valuable runs in tight times for England"
"crashed firmly into the covers, climbing into the width, and a misfield allows a tight single to be completed without any fuss"
"premeditated from Billings, Imad sees him coming and fires it wider, drilled into the covers"
"<strong>two-step and launched!</strong> High and handsome, right underneath the stroke, and high into the stands at wide long-on!"
"on the back foot, clattered out to deep cover"
"round the wicket, and <B>Sarfaraz misses a slow-motion stumping!</B> Extraordinary moment, Moeen charged, missed a quick ball, gave up on getting back to the crease, but Safaraz took an age to gather and couldn't break the stumps!"
eased down to long-off
"flashed with intent to long-on. A life for England in that over, will it be the moment to liven up Moeen?"
"advancing to the pitch, can't get the ball away"
"another charge, fenced out to cover for another single"
"right under the drive, high out to deep extra cover, an in-form Moeen would have smoked that into the stands. This version is just glad to have another ball to find his range..."
"fired out wider as Moeen shimmies at the crease, cut to deep point"
"attempted reverse sweep, very wide line, 'very well bowled Shadab' says Sarfaraz, and who are we to argue"
"<B>this time he nails the reverse!</B> Shadab took Sarfaraz's praise a touch too literally, and tried the same ball again. This time Moeen was waiting with a slot through backward point!"
"advancing to the pitch, can't quite get there"
"reverse sweep again, and Sarfaraz is flummoxed by the flurry of limbs, and lets the ball through his gloves"
"pumped into the covers, lots of bottom hand"
"very wide of off stump, but gets away with it"
"wide yorker, that's a lovely ball at this stage, Billings can only toe-end it back to the bowler"
"wide again, but a full toss this time. Flogged hard into the covers"
"<B>pounded off a good length!</B> Moeen swings through the line, hard over long-on. Right in his arc that time..."
"<B>here comes Moeen!</B> Lifted with disdain, high and hard over extra cover, guiding the stroke with a subtle late adjustment of the wrists. When he nails it, my word ... it is nailed"
"flapped off the fuller length through backward point, one hand coming off the stroke as he does so"
"zipping through to the keeper, scuttling a touch as Billings can't connect"
"a baseball slap around the corner, no timing but plenty of placement as fine leg has to make ground to gather"
"banged in short, and that's an excellent bouncer, Billings stays motionless, hoping for the wide, but that zipped through to the keeper. Shaheen claws his third over back well"
"slower yorker, that's an excellent ball, tailing into Moeen's toes and demanding that he gave up his aggressive intent to save his timbers. 68mph there..."
"much quicker, and a wild swipe <B>steeples to third man!</B> Billings had no say over the destiny of that ball, a keen mow to hack out the full length, and a well-judged take. The needle moves once more, as Lewis Gregory enters for a big test of his mettle"
"left-arm round, right into Moeen's ribs, but that's a cunning slower ball, as Moeen tucks up in defence, only to flick his pull behind square"
"pushed onto the back foot, 87mph, and Gregory hops back and across to block"
"back of a length again, angled into the right-hander, tucked into the covers to get Moeen back on strike"
"opens the face for a glide to third man, if he'd timed it any better he'd have holed out, instead it plugs ten feet short for a single"
"<B>panned clean into the stands!</B> Out comes the googly, picked like a freshly scrumped apple! High over the bowler's head!"
"<B>back to back sixes!</B> Another plant of the front foot, another swing of the blade, battered out over wide long-off!"
"wider line, Moeen yawns into a cut, but can't make contact... a precious dot!"
"<B>dragged down and smoked over midwicket!</B> Moeen advanced, Shadab responded, and responded with a long-hop! This is Moeen, back at the party!"
"faster and flatter, chipped to the on-side for the single"
"full length, whipped on the up to midwicket. That was the over England needed!"
"back of a length, clubbed with a resounding echo of bat, but timed too well as deep midwicket gathers"
"slower ball, well disguised, Moeen scuffs his clip high in the air, but safe at midwicket, and that's a 25-ball fifty! Tidy..."
"full toss, not quite high enough to be a no-ball, but high enough for Gregory to cloth his wipe through the line. High on the splice and gathered at mid-on"
drilled hard along the turf to long-off. It's been a good response so far this over...
"<B>wide full toss and that's the boundary!</B> Well timed from Gregory, just oodles of bottom-handed power, belting the cross-seamer over wide mid-on. And Rauf is a very cross seamer after that..."
"slower ball,  a cutter in the slot, <strong>picked by Gregory who slams his drive clean over the umpire's head!</strong> A big finish to the over, and suddenly England scent a chance"
"full length, wide line, <B>flashed through third man with a calculated edge!</B> England keep on coming..."
"slower-ball legcutter, Moeen has a wipe and misses, Sarfaraz fumbles but they can't take the single"
"yorker, but just a fraction too wide, and <strong>Moeen's response is exquisite!</strong> Opens the face, those wrists to the fore, and times the stroke beautifully through backward point"
"length delivery, crunched over short cover, but short of long-off... he's timing them well now..."
"<B>bowled him!</B> Gregory gives himself room for an unsubtle thwack through the line, but he can't pick the legcutter. He's through the shot too soon, and back goes his middle stump. Still, a lively hand in the circumstances..."
"tight line, a genuine edge, and Sarfaraz parries a certain four! Scoops a non-catch to third man, as Jordan settles for the single. Thus ends a fine spell from Shaheen. The end of an tough series for him, ever-present in all contests for Pakistan, Tests as well"
fired down the leg side! That's very handy for England...
"very full length, poked to the off side, and though Jordan is quick, Wahab is every bit as rapid! A rapid gather in his followthrough, a turn and shy, and he nails the stumps with the batsman two inches short! A huge wicket. Moeen is back on strike, but Jordan can clear the ropes when he needs to..."
"round the wicket, slower ball, Moeen settles for a dabbed single into the gap on the off side"
"flashed down to third man, solid contact on the wider line"
"zippy length, through to the keeper, Moeen was shuffling and shimmying at the crease, so he just fired it out wide and took the dot"
"round the wicket, Moeen is cramped on the pull and Wahab snaffles the top-edge in his followthrough! A sharp bouncer ends a superb innings. Is it enough to keep England in the hunt though? England need to get busy off this final ball of the over!"
"round the wicket, Curran attempts a back-flick over the keeper but can't connect. What a game-turning over that was! England need 17 off the final over... or 16 for the Super Over!"
"<strong>a swing and a miss!</strong> Right in the arc for the mow, but misses out. England sprint the single and a direct hit would have been curtains for Curran"
"yorker, excellent length, chiselled back over the bowler's head but mopped up by long-off"
"swinging into the toes, battered to the leg side. They rush back for two, but the challenge is getting dicey now..."
dinked off the face of the bat as Rashid hops across his crease... England need two sixes now...
"back of a length, and <B>launched over the covers!</B> Curran has monstered that, high and hard! Well well ... it's still on!"
"that's the length! A wide yorker, and Curran can't connect!"
