"nice line to launch the innings, fading into the left-hander and ghosting past the edge"
"touch wider this time, back of a length, he watches it go by"
"first runs. They're off the pad. Starc goes fuller this time, probably looking to shape this away from a middle stump line, but that goes down leg with his angle and past Tamim's flick for a tickle off the pads"
"full, a shade wide outside off, he puts in a nervous stride and gets this down to third man off the outside half of the bat"
"ooooh yes. Ambitious from Sarkar first up. Pushes away from the body and looks to drive this length ball on the up, but it nips back sharply from outside off and flies over his off stump via the big gap"
"beats him on the inside edge once more. This is a yorker, just outside off stump. Sarkar tries to jam this to third man, but there's no feet from him again"
"a shout for lbw, turned down. Tamim prods at this length ball with half a stride, and he's struck on the flap outside off. Going over"
"nice. Back of a length, off stump, and cutting away sharply as Tamim looks to poke at this off the back foot. Well beaten"
"full and straightening at leg stump, beats him for pace on the flick, ball dribbles away behind square off the pad"
"length, off stump, slight slant away from the left-hander who is behind this to defend off the back foot"
"good length, off stump, soft-handed forward block into the off side"
"good length, angled across off stump, goes back to this and leaves his off stump exposed as he defends away from the body"
"full, aimed for off stump. Tamim is late on this with a half-stride, digs it into the pitch as he looks to drive with a full face"
"good length, in the channel. Tamim's most confident stride of the day comes out this time, but he can't time this drive well enough to beat mid-off"
"back of a length at middle, gets on his toes and drops this into the leg side with a closed face"
"a big stare from the big fast bowler. He's hit Tamim on the glove with a bouncer. The batsman is late on this, but he's got his bat up awkwardly even as he's trying to get inside the line. Thankfully for him, this doesn't lob up to the slips"

"back of a length in the corridor, nervous poke into the off side off the back foot"
"good length, angled away from Sarkar, who opens the face to stab this down to third man to get off the mark"
"<b>enough</b>, says Tamim. Down the track before Hazlewood lets this go, and sufficiently leg side of this length ball to hammer a flat-batted zinger on the up past his partner"
"back of a length at middle, gets behind it and drops it into the leg side"
"full at off stump, forward defence with a slightly open face, straight to point"
"back of a length and at the hips, Sarkar waits and whips this past square leg. Some momentum for the batting team at last"
"144kph, good length, tailing inwards, but Tamim defends comfortably on the back foot"
"full at middle stump, Tamim goes for the drive with hard hands. Skews it off the inside half, but gets it wide of Cummins at mid-on who gives chase, puts in a slide...and awkwardly stops short of the boundary. Dry outfield? For now."
"short and wide from Starc, Tamim won't take the bait"
"back of a length at off stump, defended off the back foot to point"
"full, straight, middle stump. Tamim watches it closely and flicks nicely to find square leg"
goes after the wide one this time. It's short and he is behind it quickly to cut this into the floor and over point
"oh loud shout. Hazlewood strikes Sarkar plumb in front of middle stump on the back leg, but Nigel Llong says not out. Good call, that pitched outside. It was an aimless poke from Sarkar, across the line, he doesn't look comfortable"
"well, this was coming. Length ball, pushes across the batsman in the corridor. No feet from him again, a lazy feel for the ball and he gets a healthy edge through to Wade, who has to tumble to his left slightly"
"back of a length, angled away from off stump, defended off the back foot"
"full outside off stump, decent stride in but the timing on this cover drive has let it down. Toe-ends it wide of mid-off"
"length at off stump, drops it into the offside off the back foot"
"<b>mistimed pull lands safely.</b> This one is a tad short and angling away from Tamim who takes it on and gets it high on the bat. It clears mid-on but keeps him just about interested to his left, only to disappoint him in the end"
"good length, leg stump, flicked to long leg's right, back for the second"
"back of a length on the hips, glanced straight to long leg this time"

"back of a length outside off stump, pushed into the off side with soft hands"

"full at middle stump, puts in the stride, covers the angle, and uses his wrists to push this between square leg and mid-on"
"yum. Gets this bouncer to climb from a leg stump line and fly past the batsman's left shoulder. He's lucky that was too fast for him, the edge wasn't far away"

"back of a length at off stump, back foot defence onto his front boot"
"good length, middle stump, pushed on the up to short midwicket"
"<b>mistimes another pull</b> and gets away once more. This one is back of a length and he gets under it. It takes a glove and lobs gently in front of and to the right of Wade, whose dive can't beat gravity"

"walks across his stumps to disturb the bowler's line, but he pushes it even further wide and gets this length ball to fizz past the outside edge"
"back of a length, pitches outside leg, smashes into the thigh guard. Cummins is getting help off the pitch, but the proper line has been elusive"
"soft. But once again, it's the pace off the pitch that beats Kayes. This is back of a length and a but wide outside off stump, but too quick for him to get on the back foot. Looks to clobber it on the up, but offers a simple catch to cover point"
"gets it to climb from back of a length, just outside off stump, Rahim arches backwards to let it go"
"good length, corridor, thick outside edge down to third man as he plays slightly inside the line"

"good bouncer, nicely directed at an off stump line, but Tamim has been there long enough to get under this and let it go"

"back of a length, well wide of the marker outside off"

"full, drifted in at off stump, gets to the pitch and pushes this to long-on"

"good length, pitches outside off and turns away a touch, nothing too difficult for Tamim who pokes this to point"
"good length, off stump, forward block"
"nice juicy full toss, this becomes, after Tamim goes down the track. But he's got the timing woefully wrong. Bat turns, Smith doesn't have to move at short midwicket to field this"
"good length, fired flat at off stump. Tamim steps out and isn't to the pitch this time. Gets his body behind it quickly and pushes it back down the pitch. 'I like him running,' screams Wade"
"back of a length in the corridor, open face to run it to third man"
"bouncer, too slow. Tamim is up quickly to get behind this and nails the pull shot, along the floor, straight to deep square leg"

"stays deep in the crease, pulls this length ball from off stump, but can't beat Warner's dive at square leg"
"full at leg stump, clipped straight to short midwicket"
"walks across the stumps to try and paddle this from outside leg. It doesn't look like he got bat on that, but Wade wasn't close. This runs fine and the fielder has to run a long way to his right to cut it off, with a slide"
"good length at off stump, goes deep in the crease, drops it into the off side with soft hands"
"angling into the pads, a squeezed inside-edge down into the pitch"

"that is vast! Three strides down the pitch, like a Happy Gilmore tee-shot, and met with a thrilling, open-faced, lofted flog over the covers!"
"more fierce intent, as Tamim advances again, reminiscent of his battering of India in Trinidad a decade ago, as he hauls a pull through mid-on!"

"flicked to leg, decent momentum building here"

"hello, massive! Tamim comes charging, he's got the measure of Head's length now, and this goes miles back into the stands at long off!"
dabbed to the off side
"Head needs beheading, is Tamim's attitude, but his massive wipe over the covers doesn't connect this time, and falls just short of the sweeper"
"Massive appeal, and up goes the finger! An instant <B>review</B> though from Shakib ... He was a long way forward, but it's given as umpire's call on impact, and the decision stays out!"

"outside off, angled bat through third man"

"tight line on off stump, squirted to backward point where Maxwell dives over the ball to gift a single"

"doesn't matter if that was out last ball, he's gifted him a wicket next ball. This is pushed through quick, back of a length and keeps a tad low. Mahmudullah makes room and looks to slap this through the off side, is only successful in chopping it onto the leg stump"
"short and angled wide of off stump, dabs it to third man"
"good length, speared in at off stump, but the teenager gets nicely behind this to defend off the front foot"

"back of a length at middle stump, whipped off the back foot to deep midwicket"

"goes for the sweep, this time it's too full outside off. Beats him"
"oh no, that's an unfortunate end to a good innings. It's that trademark one-legged whip again, but this time he closes the face too early. Wasn't a particularly menacing ball from Starc, short and at leg stump. The top edge carried neatly to long leg"
"there it is, the yorker. But slightly wide of off stump. It had gone past the outside edge of both bat and off stump before Mortaza knew what was happening"
"ta-dah! Full, fast, straight, and it's that sweet sound of the stumps being disturbed that Mortaza has probably grown up loving. But he's the batsman today"
"thanks for coming. Rubel appears to be shuddering before Starc releases the ball. Exposes the stumps and is met, predictably, by a full straight ball. Ambitious opening of the face brings him no result"
"<b>how on earth?!</b> This yorker swings in viciously and has no answer from the batsman. Miraculously, it bisects the inside edge and the off stump and sneaks through to Wade"

"backs away, watches it swing in from outside off stump from a length, shows all the stumps and leaves the most brave leave ever left"
"<b>loud cheers</b> as he gets bat on this and squeezes it past point. Don't be fooled, he didn't know much about this either. Backed away, stretched out and threw his bat at out at this and backward point got a bad bounce"
"aaaaaaaand done. Starc has 4 off 9 balls. This is slightly short of being overpitched, but it tails away from Mehedi a touch. He wants to thump it on the up through the off side, but that's too quick"
"nice line to launch the innings, fading into the left hander and ghosting past the edge"

"tickled off the pads to get the innings up and away, and the ball slowed up so perfectly inside the rope that they were able to run and run for four"
