"hint of movement back into leg from the good length area on middle, punched to midwicket"
"full ball on off stump, comes back in a touch again, Amla turns it across the line to square leg"
"walks across the stumps to flick the half volley on middle and off into the midwicket boundary. Brave, I have to say. Superb timing"
"this one is a touch short and angling down leg, Amla misses a tickle down leg side as the ball thuds into his thigh pad"
"inviting the drive, Amla uses a straight bat to hit it to mid off"
"on the shorter side, and punished. Fine leg was in, and the ball has been helped past Dinda there. Easy pickings. Can't err in length to Amla, he picks them really early."
gets forward and angles it down to Irfan at third man to get off the mark
"short, and Amla looks to punch that past cover but gets a thick inside edge that's stopped superbly by Dhoni diving to his left. He was going towards his right, but quickly had to change direction to effect that one-handed half-stop"
gets on top of the bounce and pulls it down to Thisara at deep fine leg
"length ball that shapes away towards off stump, eased to point"
"steps out to slap that over cover, but couldn't get underneath that one. Ball whizzes past the outside edge"
"crunched on the up, but straight to point"
"nips one away from off stump, Amla is behind the line of the ball as he pats it back down the pitch"
"whipped across the line, it was just a gentle push but the ball kept gathering momentum, Irfan does well to pull it back in at deep midwicket"
"looks to get across to pick it over short fine, but got inside the line a little too much, umpire still calls it a wide"
"punched off the backfoot, but straight to point"
"whipped into the fine leg boundary. Length ball on middle, he looked to work it a lot square, but got a thick inside edge that beat the fielder in the deep"
"short outside off, he looks to sway inside the line and play the upper cut, but misses"
"hit on the up, but can't pick the gap, firm strike to Thisara at mid-off"
"angles a length ball into middle from wide of the crease, Vijay drops it into the off side with soft hands and scampers through for a single"
"cuts and misses. Sees the batsman walk across and follows him with a length ball outside off, Amla was cramped for room in the end"
"pulled, but just short of Chahar at midwicket. The ball hit him on the shin as he looked to get his body behind the line. That must hurt, but excellent commitment from the Rajasthan pacer. Can't prevent the single though"
"imperious! How good does he look when he gets on top of the bounce to play the pull? Swivels back, gets into position early and then pulled it in front of square, one bounce into the ropes. Delightful"
"opens his wrists at the last moment to ease that short ball behind point. Irfan runs a good 20 yards to his right at third man before diving to his wrong side to pull that back in, great commitment"
"crunchng cover drive, but can't pierce a packed off side ring. Straight to Ravi Ash at cover point"
"whipped from middle towards midwicket, it was a risky single, Ashwin did well to get to the ball quickly but fired a throw at the wrong end, Amla was comfortably in at the non-striker's end"
"length ball on middle, he wrists it towards deep square"
"short and sliding down leg, Amla looks to help it over short fine, but was way too early into the stroke and missed it as a result"
"forced through the off side, but straight to a leaping Rahane at point. Went to him on the bounce"
"beaten for pace on that bouncer, but umpire reckons it was too high. Amla was surely hustled for pace as he looked to fetch the hook from outside off"
"slower and fuller on leg stump, Amla gets misses a flick over midwicket, the ball deflects off the pad towards Rahane at point"
"length ball, and punished. He's deposited that over wide long-on. Was waiting for that ball, or at least that's the feeling one got. And when the ball arrived, he simply swing through the line. Didn't entirely get it off the middle, but the ball still flew 82 metres. Super hit"
"too straight, and put away. All Vijay needed to do was get a faint tickle to beat short fine, and he did."
uses the pace to run it down to third man
"slower delivery angling into middle from wide of the crease, tucked to midwicket"
"he's clobbered that past the diving mid-on fielder. Length ball outside off, Vijay swivels into position and flat-bats that"
"slow leg-cutter on off, Vijay opens the bat face to ease it behind point"
that's a special stroke. And only special batsmen can make it look as easy as Amla did. He simply planted his foot forward and then went through with the lofted hit over cover. Brings his bottom hand into play to get the elevation as the ball sails over
"struck hard, but straight to mid-off this time."
leans forward and crunches a half-volley to deep point
walks across the stumps and flicks across the line towards long-on
"looks to drive, but the ball shapes back in late from middle to roll back down the pitch off an inside edge. Wonder if it was a cross-seam delivery from Irfan"
"another slower one, this time he gets to the pitch of the ball and caresses it to sweeper cover"
"slower and fuller on off stump, bunted to long-off"
"swing and a miss. Vijay looks to slap that over cover, but the length ball didn't bounce as high as he expected, Dhoni collects it on the bounce"
"starts off with a nicely tossed up delivery outside off, Amla plays the reverse paddle past short fine. Hint of width and it was enough"
gets a good stride forward and turns it with the spin to short midwicket
"this one stops on him as Amla looks to whip it over the infield, he can only hit it straight to midwicket. Amla is distraught, Ashwin is delighted. There's the breakthrough Pune needed. Soft dismissal. He went back deep into the crease to play the short ball, may have been better off perhaps trying to pull. End of Amla's maiden IPL stint"
driven crisply to deep point with an open face of the bat
drops it into the off side towards short cover with soft hands for a quick run
makes a bit of room and cuts it to deep point
"slider on middle, he rocks back and plays a half-pull past midwicket"
"short and skids through on off stump, bottom-edges an attempted pull towards the vacant midwicket region"
"another one bites the dust. This one spins away sharply from outside off, Saha is caught in two minds, isn't sure whether to cut or steer it away. In the end, looks to angle his bat to get it past short third man, but ends up hitting it a touch fine as Ashwin takes a smart catch at slip."
"this one is a touch short, he goes back into the crease and angles it down to short third man to get off the mark"
"drifting into middle from wide of the crease, Vijay stretches forward to smother the spin"
gets to the pitch of the ball and flicks the in-drifter towards long on
"appeal for lbw, Ashwin thought that hit him dead straight on middle off the attempted sweep. Vijay got a bit of bottom edge on that towards short fine leg. Would have been plumb otherwise"
"sharp turn back into middle from wide outside off, he bunts it to the man running in from point"
"gets to the pitch of the ball and eases it into the gap at sweeper cover, they were chancing a second run, the throw was accurate but loopy, so it gave the Vijay enough time to stretch back in"
"too short, and punished. Street smart from Gurkeerat. Makes some room and uses the pace to steer the short ball past a diving short third man fielder"
pats it to short cover for a quick single
"generous flight on off stump, Vijay gets a good stride forward and he steers it to sweeper cover"
"superb stop at cover to prevent the single, it was struck well by Vijay"
"in his striking arc, Vijay looks to go over cover, can't get enough power behind it as he just manages to clear the infield"
makes a bit of room and drives it inside-out to long-off
"touch short as it skids on from outside off, Vijay makes room to steer it past point"
"wrong-un this time, he picks it off the hand and whips it behind square for an easy single"
gets to the pitch of the ball and pushes it past the bowler to long-on
"slides a length ball into the pads, flicked to deep backward square"
"tests the pace by dropping it short on middle, Gurkeerat is hustled for pace as he looks to pull, ball lobs off the flap of the pad to Dhoni who runs to his left to stop that"
makes a bit of room and bunts it down to Irfan at third man
"looks to scoop, but the ball was a touch full on off stump, Vijay somehow manages to get underneath the delivery to play it to fine leg"
"uses the pace of the bowler to help it into the fine leg boundary. Short, angling in and all Gurkeerat had to do was get inside the line and lend direction to it. He's batting well here"
too early into the cut shot. Both feet were off the ground as he looked to slap that over point
swung across the line to deep midwicket
"short ball, this one turns sharply and fizzes across, Gurkeerat mistimes a pull to wide long on"
"this is bowled beautifully. Drifts in to middle and spins away, Vijay isn't sure whether to play forward or back as his feet is stuck to the crease, gets a thick inside edge onto the pad"
forced off the backfoot to sweeper cover
"gets underneath the flight and pummels that into the midwicket boundary. Too full on middle, Vijay got his left leg out of the way and whiplashed that into the boundary. Lot of bottom hand in that stroke"
"he's struck that delightfully. Bowled it flatter and fuller on middle, Vijay got down on one knee and slog swept it across the line, but got enough on it to clear the second tier. Boy, he picked the bone out of that one or what"
"full toss on the pads, flicked into the gap at deep midwicket"
"gets across the stumps and turns it towards the vacant midwicket region, the boundary rider had a lot of ground to cover. Gurkeerat called for two straightaway and made it easily"
leans into the drive and eases it to sweeper cover
"closes the bat face early, gets a leading edge that rolls past cover"
gets forward and flicks it wide of long-on
calls two two two immediately as he gets forward to bring his steely wrists into play to pick the gap between deep midwicket and long-on. Half-century for the KXIP skipper
"drifting into middle and leg, tucked past midwicket"
"swung across the line, one bounce to Thisara at long-on"
"looks to get across to tickle it fine, but is hit high on the thigh pad"
"too full, can't get underneath the delivery as he squeezes it to long on"
"he's muscled that into the grandstand at long-on. Too short outside off, it was sitting up nicely for Vijay to rock back and hammer that where he wanted"
"short, skiddy delivery outside off, he makes room to go over cover, but misses"
"slider on off from round the stumps, eased to short third man"
"carrom ball on middle, ends up dragging it a touch short, Vijay punches that on the up between deep cover and long-off"
"drifter on leg stump, he gets to the pitch of the ball and flicks it to long on"
"swing and a miss. Vijay looked to slog sweep over cow corner, but the head fell apart as he missed the line of that straight one completely as the middle stump was knocked back. Good knock by the skipper."
works it across the line towards Thisara running in from deep midwicket
"carrom ball on middle, punched back down the pitch, some nifty footwork from Ashwin prevents the single"
"length ball on off stump, whipped across the line to midwicket"
"clobbered over long-on. Too predictable with his length there. It was full on middle, Gurkeerat cleared his front leg, set himself for the biff over long on and simply went through with the stroke"
chipped back down the pitch for an easy single
driven back past Irfan's outstretched hands for an easy single to long-off
"clean strike, inside-out over extra cover. Outstanding. He had to make some minor adjustments. He initially looked to go over long-off, but in the end just opened the bat face slightly as he swung through the line. Didn't try to hit it too hard, perhaps that did the trick"
worked towards long-on to keep strike
"you beauty! Sashays down the pitch, gets to the pitch of the ball and then lofts i cleanly over the bowler's head. Hits it straight as a dye. The length was too full on that occasion"
"delightful timing and placement. He bowls this too short on off stump, Gurkeerat makes a bit of room and then opens the face of the bat to steer it to the left of point. Races away to a 50 off just 29 balls. He stayed put inside his crease and then made the late adjustment"
"the party is over this time. This one was short and spinning into middle, Gurkeerat shaped to pull over midwicket, but ended up dragging it just a touch as the deep square leg fielder made it look easy. It was in the air for a while, but Chahar, running in from the boundary, judged it well."
"swept across the line, bisects deep square and deep midwicket. Down on one knee as he makes contact. Wasn't afraid to hit it in the air. Super timing"
"the slider has done the trick as Ashwin has his 100th IPL wicket. This one was bowled at 106 kph from around the stumps, the ball pitches outside off and drift back in to beat Miller's across-the-line punch. Umpire took no less than two seconds to send Miller back. He was plumb. <B> These are Ashwin's best figures this season. </b> Miller's miserable season is over."
"nearly got a leading edge back to the bowler, looked to work it across the line to midwicket"
"full toss on the pads from around the stumps, whipped to deep midwicket"
"full outside off, Axar has to reach out for that to squeeze it back past the bowler to get off the mark"
"looks to carve that behind point, but misses the yorker length delivery angling away"
"too full and bang! He picks his spot and hits it right there. It was powefully drilled over the infield, deep midwicket had no chance. Took the front foot out of the way to generate maximum power on the swing. If you're going to be bowling from around the stumps, you need to look to go full outside off."
"pulls and misses. This time, there was appreciable bounce on middle, Behardien was late on the stroke"
"slower and fuller outside off, he looks to clear long-off, but ends up hitting it flat and straight to the boundary rider. The slowness of the delivery did the trick. Rahane doesn't miss dollies like those in the deep."
"has he hit it over the ropes? No, nearly. But that's enough for RPS to sneak a wicket. This was a full toss and right into Axar's swinging arc, he makes good connection and nearly sees the ball soar over until Chahar, lurking round the corner at deep midwicket, gets around to take the ball, and then just lobs it casually to Tiwary, who was moving to his left from long-on, just as he realises that he was going over. Superb presence of mind"
"poor ball, and that has been punished this time. This one was a slower one, but a half-volley which Dhawan swatted away over long-off. Made a bit of room and swung through to get the elevation"
flat hit to long-off this time
"yorker on middle, he makes room and stabs it back past the bowler to long-off"
makes a bit of room and carves it over the infield towards deep cover
backs away and chips a full ball on middle between long-on and long-off
"length ball on off, dabbed down to third man to get off the mark"
"there's a slip in place, but he sprays a length ball on the pads, whipped to deep square leg"
"this one pitches at length and holds its line on off stump, patted back to the bowler"
"full ball on off stump, Rahane stays inside the crease as he defends it with soft hands"
"poor ball, this one was drifting down leg and Rahane tickled it fine into the boundary. All the good work undone by that delivery"
"punched, but straight to Vijay at mid-off"
width and he's crunched that straight to extra cove
"pulled in front of square, but can't beat Amla at midwicket"
"sprays it short and well outside off, Khawaja chases that one but can't reach out. Easy decision by the umpire"
"that's an excellent pick up shot off his hip! Uses his wrists to hit it in the air as the bal sails over the square leg boundary. Not all that bad a delivery, a touch ahead of the good length area on middle, but Khawaja ensured there was a free flowing swing to get the elevation"
"lofted over the infield, didn't time it all that well, mid-off runs back to stop it"
"looks to go straighter, but gets a thick inside edge to midwicket"
"hops back and then wrists the length ball past short fine leg. Easily done, you need to have strong wrists and superb timing to fetch the ball from middle and off."
whipped wide of mid-on for an easy single
"back of length delivery outside off, bunted to short cover"
"again, there's no one behind square on the leg side and Rahane has picked the gap. Sandeep wanted him back, the captain said no. This one was bowled at length on middle and Rahane just shuffled across to whip that between square leg and short fine leg"
gets onto the backfoot and chops a length ball as looks ot play it to the off side
"drifting into middle and leg, flicked to deep square. The man went back to the ropes after that flick shot earlier in the over"
steps out and flicks the incoming delivery to deep backward square
"floats a length ball across the batsman, whipped to Amla at deep midwicket"
uses the pace of the bowler to run it down to third man
"looks to tickle it fine, but the extra bounce means the ball thuds into the thigh pad as they sneak a run off the deflection"
"looks to sway inside the line and help it over third man, but is late on the shot"
"top shot. Stays inside the crease and then opens the face of the bat before flaying that over backward point, one bounce into the boundary."
"driven on the up, but straight to cover"
leans forward and eases a length ball outside off to point
"steps out to flick, Sandeep follows him to tuck him up, Khawaja gets a thin inside edge onto the pad"
"flicked uppishly, but no damage done as the square leg fielder is at the ropes"
"they've strangled him down leg, lucky break but KXIP will take it any which way. Rahane walks across to flick the incoming delivery, but doesn't get as much bat as he would have liked, Saha dives to his left to collect a regulation catch."
"swinging into middle, turned to midwicket"
"width and crunched, but can't get it through a packed off side field. Straight to Behardien at extra cover"
eases the incomign length ball from around the stumps to short third man for a quick single
hops back and whips that short ball to midwicket
"slower delivery on middle, pushed to mid-off, Bailey wanted the single, but Khawaja wasn't interested"
"lucky break! Looks to play a flat-batted pull, but the ball got big on him and hit the top half of the bat as it turned in his hand, just short of Vijay at mid-on"
"advances down the track and lofts him through the line over extra cover, couple of bounces into the rope"
steps out and whips him over mid-on when he could have so easily repeated the previous shot. Good wrist work and timing to get the elevation this time
"pushed through quicker on middle, worked past square leg"
"eased with the spin to point, hint of grip and turn there"
"swung across the line, toe-ends it to Amla at midwicket"
"looks to flay that behind point, gets a thick edge on the bounce to short third man"
"slows it down nicely, but lands it a touch short outside off, Khawaja whips it across the line to midwicket"
"loop, drift, turn, bounce and a smart stumping. Bailey is totally deceived in flight as he looks to drive, and ends up dragging the backfoot outside the crease briefly. Enough time for Saha to collect the ball cleanly and effect a regulation stumping."
"doesn't get to the pitch of the ball but drives it wide of the bowler, to long-off"
"touch short outside off, eased to backward point, there are two fielders there to stop the cut shot"
"quicker one on off stump, makes a bit of room and punches it to deep cover"
"in the air, but slapped wide of point, Behardien mops that up running to his right from cover point"
"drifting into middle and leg, worked wide of square leg"
lunges forward and defends the tossed up delivery to point. Excellent start
"walks into the shot as he moves across to loft that across the line to long-on, didn't get hold of it fortunately, else would have been straight down the throat of the  man in the deep"
"cuts, but straight to point"
"crunched on the up, but can't find the gap, mid-off runs to his right to stop that"
"slower bouncer on middle, Khawaja has to force the pace and power to pull that down to fine leg, looked like he tried to hit it too hard"
"he was eyeing cow corner for a while now, and has ensured he's picked the gap. Crime to bowl short at 110 clicks, Tiwary gets back and across before smashing the pull between deep midwicket and long on"
dabs it with the angle to Axar at point
"overpitched, driven well but straight to cover. Pressure building"
worked cross the line towards midwicket
"extra bounce from the length area on middle, Tiwary looks to whip it away but the ball gets big on him, he jabs it to the off side in the end"
"that's a result of the pressure that has steadily been building. Tiwary backs away to muscle a pull over midwicket, but ends up playing it too early and misses as a result"
"another swing, another misses. Abbott sees the batman give him the charge and then rolls the slow offcutter outside off, Tiwary's biff over midwicket can only connect with the humid Vizag air"
"short and wide outside off, he's smeared that into the gap at deep point"
"lucky to get away with that overpitched delivery, right in the zone for the lofted hit, Khawaja picks the cover fielder. He's disappointed"
"this time he picks the gap he wanted. All along the ground too. Sweet timing! This was full and a touch wider, he lent forward and timed it sweetly on the up"
"appeal for lbw as he looks to flick, the ball clearly pitched outside leg as he missed the flick shot"
"looks to walk across to flick the leg cutter into the vacant square leg region, misses. Easy call for the umpire"
"looks to go downtown, but ends up dragging it down to long-on"
"short on middle, he waits and waits before bunting the ball into the gap towards midwicket, the boundary rider had some considerable distance to cover"
"backs away to go over cover, drags it wide of the bowler to long-on off the inside edge"
he's biffed that over deepmidwicket. Almost as if he'd decided even before the bowler delivered that he'd hit it there. Got down on one knee and fetched the slog sweep from outside off
"the after-effects of being swept, he bowls this full and outside off, well outside the wide line"
"loops it up nicely outside off, Tiwary is deceived in flight as he steps out to go over long-off, ends up skewing it towards deep cover, where Farhaan Behardien runs in to take a good low catch. Pressure on RPS"
whipped wide of midwicket to get off the mark
punched wide of midwicket
"he's picked the lone man in the deep. Poor shot selection. He was hitting across the line and towards the bigger boundary, but the slog sweep has found Miller who takes the simplest of catches at deep midwicket. Second wicket in the over. MS Dhoni is disappointed with that shot, and the look on his face tells you a story. He wasn't even looking at Khawaja as he walked past him. Shakes his head in frustration. Is that a big moment in the match?"
driven on the up to sweeper cover to get off the mark
"drifts into middle, worked wide of midwicket"
"hint of bounce, the ball also stops on him a touch as he punches it to cover"
gets forward and smothers the spin
nearly sneaked through the gap between bat and pad onto the stumps. Flies past leg stump as he stabs outside the line of an incoming delivery
"drifting into middle, Dhoni lunges forward to defend"
driven with the spin to deep cover
"slow leg-cutter on off stump, punched wide of Vijay at cover, it was a half-stop but he saved a run"
"what has happened there? Looks like the ball got stuck in to the pitch. It was the slowest variation of a slower delivery from Rishi Dhawan. Banged in short, the ball took ages to get to Irfan who was already through with the pull as the ball lobbed off the bottom edge Saha, who did well to run in a few paces to take a low catch."
"another slower delivery, worked across the line to midwicket"
"length ball into middle and leg, punched to deep midwicket, Dhoni wanted the second, Thisara wasn't keen"
"another slower one, well we should be surprised only if it's a seam-up, worked wide of square leg"
whipped towards deep midwicket
"fires a full delivery outside off, exercise for the umpire"
"steps out and offer his pad to the quicker one, but did well to ensure he was outside the line of the stumps"
"steps out and works it with the angle to Abbott at fine leg, excellent running"
dabbed to the short cover fielder
"gently tossed up on middle, Dhoni waited, waited and waited before swatting that across the line into the deep midwicket boundary. Flat hit for six."
"goes back deep into the crease and play a straight paddle towards deep fine leg, where Abbott runs around a long way before dishing in a slide to keep it down to three"
"full toss on the pads, flicked to deep backward square leg"
"slants the length ball across Thisara, who misses the cut shot"
"this time he crunches that to Behardien's left at point, that release shot was round the corner. Had lot of room and he gave it a good old thwack"
"looks to flay that over cover, Abbott rolls this one across the batsman, who misses"
"arches back and lofts the length ball over point, good strong arm of Behardien can't prevent the second"
"he's pummeled that into the second tier at long-on. Too full, Thisara made a bit of room to get the swing going right and he teed off like a golfer to find the dead center of his bat"
pierces a packed off side ring with ease. Backs away and swats the length ball between cover and point.
"shot of the evening! Intentionally opens the face of the bat, takes it on the full and angles it behind point. Wow"
"rip roaring yorker on middle, Dhoni jams his bat down on middle to squeeze that out"
"shapes to play the lofted hit, ends up squeezing the full-length delivery on off to long-off, couldn't get underneath the delivery"
"swung across the line, looked to go straight over long-on, I reckon. Manages to hit it into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on"
"he was waiting to slog that into the stands, but had to change his stroke in the end, punched to deep cover instead"
"once again, gets his execution spot on. This one was full and tailing in to him, swung across the line to long-on"
"full outside off, crunched to Miller at long-off"
he was perhaps thrown off guard by Dhoni's initial movement as he bowls it full and well outside the wide line on the off side
"the match is well and truly alive. Once again he goes full and wide, Dhoni uses his reach to good effect and slices it over point, picks the gap in the deep to perfection"
"sprays it wide outside off, did the ball slip out of his hand, or was it the pressure of having to bowl to a feared finisher? We'll know after the match"
"pulled across the line, lands on the bounce to Miller at long-on"
"excellent yorker this time on middle from around the stumps, Thisara squeezes it towards square leg for a single"
"misses his length by an inch, if not more, and Dhoni has blasted that into the long-off boundary. Got underneath the delivery and clobbered that. He backs his strengths when the situation demands. Can he get another one away? Little doubt as to who is under pressure now"
"looks to punch it past cover, the ball kept low to beat the inside edge"
"big, big wicket. Mohit floats this full outside off from around the stumps, Thisara looks to swing across the line over long-on, but only manages to get a thick outside edge which Saha accepts with glee."
makes a bit of room to squeeze a full ball to point for a quick single
"he's got it away into the point boundary. Not entirely convincing but it doesn't matter. Low full toss outside off, Dhoni's big swing ensures he gets enough bat on it as he slices it into the boundary. Wrong line, the match is alive"
"the slower ball works this time, but Dhoni refuses the single. He walks across the stumps to fetch the slow ball on middle towards deep midwicket. He hit it well, but straight to Amla. Immediately signalled to his partner to suggest 'don't even bother trying to take a run'"
"rip-roaring yorker on middle and leg, Dhoni just managed to get his bat down in the nick of time to prevent that from smashing into the stumps"
"squeezed back past the bowler to long-off, another yorker-length delivery which Dhoni couldn't get underneath"
"dot ball. Absolute gold. Fired into middle, Dhoni mistimes a pull, but hits it straight to deep midwicket"
"was he trying to bowl a bouncer or what? Ball left his hand late as he tried to dart one into middle and leg, Saha stops it like a goalkeeper"
"that's why he refused the run. This one was into his hitting arc, too full and Dhoni clobbered that over long-on. What swing, what power off the bottom hand"
"he flat-batted that towards deep cover, was certain it was a boundary but Amla, who was running around to his left dived full length to his left to stop that. <b> They missed an opportunity to pinch two runs </b>"
"short outside off and he's flat batted that over cover, one bounce into the ropes. An inch on the other side and it would have been six. Is this alive still? This was too short, Dhoni had enough room to slap that over the infield"
"short on middle, Dhoni moves back into the crease and swings this one over deep midwicket. Wow! Incredible. Too short, he picked the length early"
"what a man! Yem Yessssss Dhoniiiiiiiiiiii. Remember the nammeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Axar bowls this from over the wicket, but the change of angle does little to alter Dhoni's bat swing. This was fired in, too full on middle and leg, but Dhoni had decided he was going over midwicket come hell or high water, and that bottom hand of his is into play as the ball flies off the middle of the bat into the deep midwicket boundary. Shades of the good old helicopter in that one. The powerful wrists of his to the fore as he flicked it up and over. Wow!"
