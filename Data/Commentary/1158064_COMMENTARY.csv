"full and swinging away, 134kph/83mph but Jennings can leave happily enough... Roach still struggling to find the money with the new ball"
"<b>that's a better attempt!</b> Maybe some inside edge involved? Big appeal as Roach darts the ball in to clip the front pad - maybe he just got something on it, <b>although UltraEdge doesn't think so!</b> West Indies chose not to review"
"tempter in the channel, half motions to play at it and then thinks better"

"<B>zoinks, it's starting to get lively!</B> Another nibbler, angling back into the pads, and rapping the inner thigh with a bit of extra nip"
"<strong>pinged on the pads, and up goes the finger!</strong> Goodness, a minimal appeal, and a very belated <B>review</B>! Denly was so deep in his crease, maybe struck just outside off at a pinch? Nope, I strongly doubt that... will height save him? <B>Nope! Denly's a goner too!</B>"
"speared into the toes, nudged to the leg side again"
"<B>another nipbacker into the pads!</B> 147kph of full-length inducking. Buttler's feet go nowhere, and only the height denies Gabriel another loud lbw appeal"

"outside off, sharp pace once more, just back of a length but wide enough to leave alone"

banged in short again and <B>Dowrich does well to claw it down</B> and save the five wides

big stride forward
"<B>beaten again!</B> Angled in, straightened off the deck. Through to the keeper!"

"outside off, no stroke this time"
"thrashed into the covers, a hint of movement off the deck, and he's reaching for the stroke"
"solid block, nice high elbow"

"biffed on the up, into the covers, a Lara-esque slash into the stroke, but can't find the placement"
tucked to the leg side
"<B>slammed through the covers!</B> That's quality from Buttler, striding onto the front foot, battering through the line. Top tonking"

"driven again, into the covers"
"worked off the back foot, into the leg side"
"outside off, tight line, hint of turn, through to the keeper"
"<B>toe-ended slash through the covers!</B> A bit loose from Buttler, short and wide, but didn't quite reach it with the meat of his bat"
back and across to defend
"<B>too short and that's battered out to deep midwicket!</B> A roundhouse pull, Joseph just putting the ball on the spot without the conviction of earlier spells, and pays the price!"
"more solid bat on ball, flogged into the covers but with feet a little stuck in the crease"
through to the keeper
through to the keeper to finish a productive hour. That will be <B>drinks</B>

floated up and blocked on the front foot
"flatter, Stokes is on to the front foot and defends"
presses out to defend once again
"drops short, Stokes pounces on it, muscled through backward point on the cut - <b>that's his half-century</b>, first one in a while for Stokes. Not been vintage, Hail Mary stuff, but more like his punchy(!) old self"
plants the front foot and lets this spin through
gets on to the front foot and taps towards cover
"length ball, swerving away from a wide-ish line, no stroke"
"good length in the channel, 141 clicks and Buttler leaves it be"
"probing in the channel, still a touch wide and there's nothing doing from the batsman"
"dug in short, steepling through... too high, me old son"
"another short ball, Buttler crouches and leaves alone"
Buttler taps the ball down square into a gap for one
"gottim, <b>pouched in his follow-through!</b> Scratchy pull shot from Stokes, looked like it came off the bottom of the bat... and it plops into Joseph's lap for a smart reaction catch! <b>Hang on, they're checking the no-ball</b>... This doesn't look good for the Windies! Stokes has left the field, but he's going to be called back!"

"now Paul oversteps, another one to the extras column"
"short on the hips and tucked behind square, no bat involved"
defended back down the track
tossed up a little wider and Buttler drives
"pushed through, worked towards mid-on from the crease"
"comes forward and punches down the ground, <b>brings up the 100-run stand for England</b> - unsurprisingly the first time they've managed that this series"

"seaming a fraction, <b>finds the outside edge</b> but the ball stays low, squirts through the cordon and down to third man"

through to the keeper outside off
"tighter line, a hint of movement off the deck, but left alone again"
"big stride from Stokes, pressing back down the line of the ball to defend"
"tight off-stump line again from Roach, he's already a foot tighter than he was in his first-day spell"
"there we go, he's back on that wide line. Just a waste of shine and effort really. Stokes ignores"
<B>much better!</B> Nip off the seam on a tight line this time. Climbing into the gloves with good carry. Stokes had to play at that and is grateful to miss it
"<B>utterly cleaned up!</B> That's superb from Gabriel, fast, straight, full and angling in. Buttler is guilty of playing the sort of loose drive that sank England in the second innings at Antigua, but he was simply beaten for pace! What a wicket so early in the day!"
"angled into the pads, tucked to the leg side to get off the mark, some two hours of play after he first thought he was starting his innings"
banged in short and wide from round the wicket
"round the wicket, Dowrich is sent sprawling down the leg side to intercept a wayward one"
swaying inside the line as Gabriel bangs one in short. That was lively!
"fenced to gully, good kick from back of a length. A successful over!"
left alone outside off
"swing on a full length, that's a probing line. Stokes leans forward to defend"

"slightly squared up in defence, on the back foot as Roach finds some extra lift"
"firmly forward, Roach is attacking the stumps better this morning"
"left alone outside off, through to the keeper"
stabbed into the off side
"<B>lovely bowling!</B> So full, really fast, and zipping into the pads as Bairstow is stranded in the crease. An inside edge prevents the appeal"
"pushed into the covers, a sharp single"
"shovelled off the pads, a rapid riser into the ribs, and another single picked off to square leg"
"firmly forward, but that's the spot, full and stump-threatening. Probing stuff"
"angling in from round the wicket, fenced into the covers off the back foot"
flashed to the on-side
"<B>stabbed in the air, and through gully!</B> Stokes on the back foot, defending with firm hands as Paul kisses the edge with a back-of-a-length delivery"
"<B>a stifled appeal</B>, sliding down leg, but this is an encouraging start from Paul"
"angled bat, into the cordon"
good zip off the deck as Stokes shoulders arms to a tight line
clipped to the leg side
"banged into the deck, outside off, Bairstow shoulders arms"
"<B>Bairstow is clobbered on the grille as he leans into a limbo!</B> Ferocious bowling from Gabriel, YJB played it pretty well to be fair, bending his back and watching the ball all the way, but the ball just kept following him, and pinged over the cordon to boot!"
stabbed into the off side
swished into the covers as Gabriel aims a touch fuller
"<B>beaten outside off!</B> A loose flashy drive as Bairstow instinctively leans into a fuller ball, but it's no longer there... it's over there, in the keeper's gloves!"
swished out to cover
"driven on the up, slightly leg-sided when he was aiming to cover, but finds a gap in the field all the same"
<strong>ghosting past the outside edge once more!</strong> That angle into the left-hander from round the wicket is causing bother when he finds late seam movement
"tip and run to cover, and <B>Bairstow has to hurry!</B> He's home"
"ushered through to the keeper, outside off"
"<B>wow, that's close!</B> Left on length, and that was nearly Bairstow's 30th bowled in Test cricket. <I>Millimetres</i> over the off bail!"
standing tall in defence
"thuds into the pads, skids a touch low as Stokes and Gabriel exchange pleasantries"
"on the toes, back-foot defence to the on side"
<B>pulled with intent in front of square!</B> The sweeper tidies up but up comes England's 250
"full length, angled in, blocked into the covers"
"<B>drilled back to the bowler and dropped!</B> That was so nearly Gabriel's second of the morning, Bairstow through his drive too soon, chipped back down the pitch, and he couldn't gauge the pace as he adjusted in his followthrough"
"<B>beauty!</B> There's one of those naughty nibblers on a full length, hitting the indentation and jagging around the edge as Stokes is lured into the drive"
"right behind the line of the ball this time, solid defence"
advancing out of the crease to defend
"wider on the crease, Stokes is wise to the increased angle into the body, and hauls a pull behind square... well timed and directed. Paul's change-up doesn't pay dividends"
"back on a fuller length, through to the tumbling Dowrich"
through to the keeper on a wider line
whittled out through the leg side
"through to the keeper on a tight line from round the wicket, a hint of away movement"
full-faced drive into the covers
a grunt of effort as Roach fizzes one through to the keeper outside off
"outside off, nibbling off the seam from a tight line. A good leave"
"a shimmy down the track from Stokes, but a leave-alone in the end"
"<B>smashed high in the air, and a brilliant grab from Dowrich!</B> Stokes thought he'd picked the one to pull, but found a spiralling top-edge into the leg side. Caught in the breeze, drifting out to square leg. The keeper was the only man near, he sprinted, he dived, he stretched, he grabbed. Stunning judgement and the end of a vital innings"
off the mark straightaway with a dab to midwicket
zipping through to the keeper
"sliding down the leg side, Dowrich once again forced to spreadeagle himself to save the byes"
"nurdled to the leg side, midwicket gathers"
"<B>nibbles past the edge!</B> That's a stunning length, just wobbling down the track and zipping like a legbreak round a flaccid edge"
<strong>A flat-footed hoick from Bairstow!</strong> A strange retort to some fine bowling. But he survived. And that is<B> drinks</B>
"pitched up, Moeen gets across and squirts the ball towards backward point with an open face, well grabbed on the stretch to prevent a run"
"shaping away in the channel, Moeen lets it go"
fired in straighter and met with a solid block
"stays back and opens the face again, off the outside half of the bat but he keeps it down, gully gives chase and does well to drag the ball back just in front of the rope"
"over thew wicket to YJB, this veers in menacingly, bit of extra bounce and he takes his bottom hand of the bat when defending"
"another nip-backer, rearing up... <b>that's hit him right in the spuds!</b> Kemar is laughing, but Jonny isn't, he drops to his haunches, gulping in air. Let's hope he's got a sturdy box, something like <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q85aphCzTog target=_blank>Faf du Plessis' beast</a>"
"Paul goes round the wicket and hangs the ball in the channel, left alone"
"pitched up, Moeen gets out and tickles a drive through cover-point for a couple"
"this curves in late, struck on the pad working to leg, but I think it was heading down"
"wafted through point, <b>in the air but no one's there!</b> The epitome of a Moeen Ali drive, that, playing well away from his body but it was quite a way in front of Chase, who hares off after it"
"fired in straighter, again nudged off the pads"
"ooh, this boomerangs back in, Moeen cops a blow this time"
"oh my, he's shouldered arms and <b>been pinged on the groin this time!</b> He's either very confident in his protective gear, YJB, or mad!"
"coming back in, wears another blow, lower down on the thigh this time... Moeen calls him through as the ball rolls away to the off side, but West Indies <b>review</b> the lbw appeal, though it looked high to me. Yep, Roach was being optimistic there,<b> going over according to Hawk-Eye</b>, so West Indies lose their second review"
"round the wicket, good length and shaping away outside off, left alone"
"similar line, again Moeen doesn't need to play at it"
"slips in an attempted yorker, 136kph/84mph and he digs it out to the leg side for one"
"shortish outside off, Bairstow attempts a short-arm jab and gets a bottom edge"
"over the wicket, pitched up and flicked off the pads through midwicket for a couple"
"better line, gets Moeen pushing tentatively outside off"
"nipping back on a line with off stump, gets his bat down in defence"
"short, 130kph/80mph and Moeen clouts it well in front of point, not completely timed but he picks up a couple more"
"yeesh, play that! <b>Seaming back in past the inside edge</b>, superb line but just a touch short, over the top of off and pretty much knocks Moeen into a cocked hat"
"fired in straight and defended, via an inside edge"
"shortish outside off, I think that's hit him on the hip this time, rolling towards third slip... He's got magnets in his pants this morning"
"good length, nibbling in and he gets a thickish inside edge to the leg side"
"stays back on off stump, tucked down to leg"
hung out wide and YJB lets it go
"<b>timber!</b> Loose drive and YJB sees his stumps pinged again! He has not looked comfortable, taken a bit of a peppering, and Roach finally finds his spot... Full and tempting, Bairstow falls for it hook, line and sinker, via a thick inside edge"
"pitched up and swinging in towards leg stump, Wood gets a firm connection on a clip past short leg for an all-run four from his first ball"
"back of a length, tapped down to the on side from the crease"
"length ball, sprayed a touch wide, no stroke"
"back of a length, holds its line as Moeen dabbles - <b>and steers a thick edge to first slip!</b> Decent ball from Joseph, thought Moeen really didn't need to play at it; West Indies coming back strongly with the ball this morning"
"in the channel, touch wide and Broad ignores it hanging back"
"shortish, 137kph/85mph and it stays a little low as Broad pokes at it defensively"
"shouts of interest as Joseph brings the ball back in, deflected down towards the cordon"
on a length but leg side as Broad mooches across
"full and swinging in, again Wood flicks it off his toes for a couple"
"searching yorker, <b>nearly knocks Wood over</b> - but he keeps it out! Wood finds his feet, grins back at the bowler"
"short ball, top-edged on the hook... <b>and taken nonchalantly on the run by Joseph at fine leg!</b> Looked like it might go all the way, then it appeared a tough chance for Joseph, haring across to his right; but he pouched it like a man catching a cupcake tossed across the counter and just kept on running along the rope, cool as"
"fired in full, Anderson gets his bat down in time"
"snorting short ball, rearing up and <b>gloved to slip!</b> Excellent ball, to any batsman never mind England's venerable No. 11, he turned away and threw up his hands reflexively, the ball lobbing gently off the top hand to fourth slip. Job done, West Indies"
full and sliding on to the pads as Brathwaite flicks it square
"pitched up, 128kph/80mph on middle and leg, just needs a tickle of bat to run to fine leg for the first run of the innings"
over the wicket and nibbling in past the bat as Campbell props forward
"hits a length, pushed across the bows and he shoulders arms to this one"
"good length and drawing him forwards, steered towards backward point off the outside half of the bat"
"holding its line in the channel, Campbell gets on to the front foot and waves his bat inside like it's a light sabre and he's Obi Wan Kenobi about to take on a squad of droidekas"
"puts the ball on a length, Brathwaite jumps back and stabs it away in front of square on the leg side for one"
"round the wicket, good length and toodling through to the keeper outside off"
"ooh, that's the one, <b>steepling bounce and just enough nip from a length</b>, fizzes through past the outside edge as Campbell is square up on the crease!"
"straighter line, clipped off the pads, Jennings throws himself to his right at short leg to prevent a run"
"in the channel, 136kph/85mph and left alone"
"touch short, this nibbles in but Campbell is well across and judges the leave precisely"
"hits a length around off stump, Brathwaite jabs down on it hastily in defence"
"in the channel, not much swing so far, lets this one go"
"full, met coming forwards, cushioned politely back to the bowler in his follow through"
fired in straighter and Brathwaite tucks it away to leg via inside edge and pad
"length in the corridor, bit of knock-down ginger... but Brathwaite isn't playing"
"bit of extra grunt from Anderson, 136kph/85mph to finish the over, defended on the front foot - and that will be <b>luncheon</b> at Darren Sammy's gaff"
"round the wicket, good extra lift already, as Campbell squirts off the splice through gully. Four slips and a short leg in place"
"outside off, lift off the seam again, and left alone"
<B>more bounce and movement!</B> Campbell is flat-footed as the ball jags off the seam past the edge
"a fraction fuller, met with a firm push into the covers"
"<B>wobbling past the edge, and Campbell goes fishing!</B> Big jag off the pitch once more. Broad has been unlucky since returning to the side"
a very determined leave to finish a probing over
"outside off, through to the keeper"
ghosting in and just trundling past a half-cocked defensive blade
"leaning forward, head over the ball to defend the full length"
"poked off a fat edge, down through the fifth slip position, and Brathwaite picks off his first boundary. Nothing wrong with that shot, angled bat, using the width"
"tapped into the covers, and <B>Campbell slips mid-pitch!</B> This must be out, but <strong>Denly's shy goes wide!</strong> He wasn't in the frame! Thoughts of a single, sent back, Mike Atherton-at-Lord's-1993 style, and nearly paid the price"
shoulders arms to finish another eventful over
"tapped into the covers, off the front foot"
poked with firm hands to the tumbling point
"swished off the hip, down to backward square"
"wider line, Brathwaite barely breaks out of his stance to leave this one alone"
"full length, tailing into the timbers, clipped to midwicket"
"<B>zipping past the edge!</B> That's the length for this pitch, just rearing at the splice as Brathwaite holds his bat on an off-stump line and prays"
"<B>pongo-ed on the up, over long-on!</B> Well, that's different, shades of his dismissive winning biff in Antigua, in the arc, and a stiff-armed slam to the rope! Like watching Jermaine Blackwood!"
flicked out to midwicket
"<strong>knees up, and flipped off the hip!</strong> This is dismissive and destructive! Too short from Jimmy, and out comes the left-handed Gordon Greenidge tribute!"
"thumped back to the bowler, and <B>Anderson has a foul-tempered shy at the stumps!</B> Grrr..."
"<B>crashed on the pad and up goes the finger!</B> Well, this has escalated quickly! A <B>review coming up from Campbell</B>, and lo and behold, the ball is <B>zipping over middle!</B>"
"<strong>another massive appeal </strong>as Campbell aims a dismissive waft across the line! Root eventually called for the review, but he had taken too long! Scenes! Looked like it pitched outside leg, but <B>this is getting tasty!</B>"
"four slips in place, but Campbell isn't afraid to test them with a jab of the wrists, down through the cordon"
"tapped to the leg-side, a scampered single. West Indies were attrition personified at Antigua. They've taken a leaf out of England's manic run-harvesting book this time!"
"<B>another swing for the hills, another appeal for lbw!</B> Once again, that looked to be heading down leg. But he's in a right mood here!"
"better stroke, a firm tap into the covers with a perfectly straight bat, and they jog the single"
"down the leg side, and clipped into the gap"
"eased down the ground to long-off, and well, this has been all action!"
a whoosh through a loose drive as Brathwaite joins the slightly manic moment. Good nip off the seam back into the right hander
patted back to the bowler
"well bowled, full and straight, with a hint of nibble off the seam. Defended to cover"
solidly behind the line of the ball
tapped back whence it came
"good lifting delivery, angled back into the stumps, but well left on this occasion"
"<B>flogged on the up, over extra cover!</B> Campbell's at it again, taking on the gaps in the off-side with more strong-armed jabbing through the line of the ball! Plugs in the off side"
hops across the stumps to defend to the leg side
"cracked with a hop, off the front foot, out to cover. Taking on the wide one"
"flicked to the leg side, after Broad had aborted his initial run-up after getting his thumb caught in his trouser pocket. As you do"
"stabbed into the covers, head over the ball"
"outside off stump, swinging away, left alone"
"full and outside off for now, pressed to short cover"
"<B>sublime!</B> Utterly pasted back past the bowler. Imperious, and perfect, straight bat, straight lines, high elbow, dumped into the rope!"
"whipped to leg, Anderson continues to leak runs"
"whittled to the leg side, good scampering gets them back for two"
through to the keeper once again
"<B>well bowled</B>. Brathwaite plays one defensive stroke, then a second one a second later, on a slightly wider line, having played completely down the wrong one initially"
"lifting through to the keeper, as Campbell aborts another expansive wallop in a non-specified direction"
"chasing the leg-side bouncer, doesn't get any glove on it. That's two short balls for the over, which leaves Broad a bit miffed"
"thumped in short again, but below shoulder height this time. Campbell grins as it passes behind him"
"fully forward, and dabbed into the off side"
"zipping through to the keeper, sliding past the leg stump as Broad gets his cramping angle a bit wrong"
"punched with hard hands, off the splice and into the covers. It's manic but effective from Campbell"
fully forward on off stump and defended
"leaning out of the crease, angled bat, defended to the leg side"
forward to ease a drive back to the bowler
Jennings has a sniff at short leg as Brathwaite stretches forward
"a bottom-handed biff to mid-on, looking to stay busy"
"advancing out of the crease, full-faced defence"
"round the wicket, banged in short again, Broad persists with the ribcage approach, as Campbell swings into another missed pull"
"connects on the pull this time, Jennings at deep backward square gathers"
"fuller length to the right-hander, and squeezed out to the off side"
pressed into the leg side as Brathwaite shuffles across his stumps
"outside off, shoulders arms"
"<B>beaten outside off</B>, another jagging delivery off a good length. Broad continues to threaten in that area, though he's spending most of his time trying to knock Campbell's block off, which perhaps isn't the ideal use of a still-new ball"
"swept, and effectively so, down to backward square leg. Well clawed in on the edge of the rope"
"back and across, worked to the leg side"
"Brathwaite's turn to sweep, behind square and cleaned up with a sliding stop"
"pressing forward, climbs into the gloves, but safely so"
"very straight lines, head over the ball in defence"
"firmly driven from under the eyeline, down to long-off"
"raps the pad, but that pitched outside leg"
"swing from a good length, and greeted with a flat-footed mow, full of intent, but lacking in timing ... interesting!"
"pinged on the pad again, nipping back into the left-hander. Lbw-ish...but no appeal. Too high maybe"
"<B>battered through the covers!</B> Only half a click of width from Anderson, but that's all Campbell needs in this mood! Flogged to the rope, and up comes yet another half-century stand"
<B>a no-ball from Anderson!</B> That's about his second in six years!
"nipping back in on a good length, and with no room to free the arms, Campbell is a tamed beast. Flicks the pad-flap"
"outside off, no stroke offered. And that will be <B>drinks</B> after a breathless hour"
tossed up and Brathwaite comes down to tickle through mid-off
"pushed through from round the wicket, defended playing back on leg stump"
"floated up on middle and off, defended"
"flighted, outside off and Campbell drives through extra cover"
"flatter, skipping on from over the wicket, Brathwaite jabs down on it in defence"

"pitched up on off stump, 134kph and straightening a touch, squared up but he keeps it down and they pinch one in front of point"
"angling away and stabbed down wide of the slips, Campbell has to hurry but he gets back for two as the throw comes in"
floated up and defended coming forwards
"some turn for Moeen, bit of interest as the ball hits the front pad, think he was outside the line... and it dropped safely"
"oh dear, Kraigg... the Windies captain goes for a heave over midwicket, <b>picks out Anderson in the deep!</b> That's a release shot for him against spin, played to good effect earlier in the series, but that's an error of judgement, and it's let England in! The man was stationed deliberately at cow corner, and Brathwaite slogged it to him running in"
"sliding in and struck on the pads - <b>given!</b> Was it straightening enough? Campbell decides to chance a <b>review</b>, but it only has to be clipping, remember. He was coming forward and flicking across the line, the ball skidded on past the inside edge... and would have toppled leg stump, according to Hawk-Eye!"
"pushed through on off stump, Bravo shows it a straight bat"
"floated up, gets a bit of drift on to middle and leg, Bravo leans out and taps it away"
"angled in on the stumps, worked to the leg side"
"good length around off stump, defended towards point"
"touch back of a length, gets him fending with the bottom hand off the bat, squirted down to fine leg for one"
"pushed across Bravo from over the wicket, 130kph/81mph and he lets it go"
"round the wicket, dug in short of a length and Bravo jabs it away, took a blow on the hand, I think"
"pitched up in the channel, looking to bluff Bravo into a flat-footed drive. Not his first rodeo"
"flighted, going on with the arm as Hope drops back, flicks one through the leg side"
"round the wicket, pushed on towards the stumps, tucked to leg"
goes back on off stump to defend
"floated up, straightening on fourth stump, shows it a straight bat"
"gives this a bit more air, Bravo leans out and watches it on to the face of the bat"
"fuller, a touch wide and Bravo drives this time, shouts of 'catch!' as it scuds low towards Root stationed at short extra cover"
"full in the channel, good pace first up and Hope has a poke, fails to connect"
"hits a length, this skids through gun-barrel straight as Hope hangs the bat out and is beaten"
"shorter, 141kph/88mph and climbing, nipping in, past the outside edge once more"
"slammed in short, <b>this clocks 145kph/90mph</b>, a head-hunting bouncer that Hope is quickly out the way of, dropping to his knees"
"pitched up, extras wheels, <b>Hope slices it to gully!</b> Wood takes off, arms spread, he has a wicket with his fifth ball... That was even quicker, 148kph/92mph and too hot for Hope, who was rather hitting-and-hoping there, flashed at a drive but skewed off the outside edge! Wood lights the fi-yah for England!"
"short and jumping, jiving at Chase, <b>who thick-edges his first ball to gully!</b> Two in two, for the second time in a matter of overs for England! Wood is off again, before being mobbed by his team-mates... That was 149kph and Chase just fenced blindly, gone first ball for the second match running! Well taken by Burns, given it came at him so fast"
"round the wicket, floated up and defended on off"
"pushed through a little flatter, Bravo defends"
stays back and blocks on off stump
"straighter line, Bravo goes back and works towards the man on the 45"
tossed up and blocked coming across
"flighted, outside off, he plants the front foot and lets it go"
"round the wicket, shortish and a touch wide, <b>152kph/95mph and practically leaving a comet trail</b>... but Hetmyer can hang back and leave"
"ooh, that's close, closer to the stumps and nipping past the bat as he stays deep in the crease!"
"short of a length, 149kph/92mph and <b>Hetmyer is beaten poking in the channel once again!</b> This is rapid stuff, he can't lay bat on Wood"
"pitched up, 90+ mph again, so quick he loses his footing in his follow-through... Hetmyer prods this one defensively square"
"fired in straighter, again he dabs it down defensively to the leg side"
"over the wicket, hits 150kph/93mph on the speed gun again, but wide enough for Hetmyer to leave well alone"
"tossed up on off stump, defended"
"slows his pace up, Bravo comes forwards"
"spinning a touch on off stump, poked back down the track"
pushed through and tucked to the on side form back in the crease
drops slightly short and he cuts firmly but picks out backward point
"lets go a full toss, which Bravo bunts fiercely but straight to Buttler at extra cover"
"full in the channel, Hetmyer throws the bat <b>and clears the leap of Burns at gully!</b> If you're going to flash, flash hard..."
"back of a length on off, 147kph/91mph and Hetmyer fends away from his body, <b>takes the edge but lands in front of slip!</b> How on earth did that not carry??"
"banged in short, the line is a touch wide and he bobs out of the way"
"short of a length over off stump, 145kph/90mph, Hetmyer gets into line"
"short outside off, Hetmyer swings an adrenalin-fuelled swipe away through point for a couple - Wood had overstepped, too"
"on a length, 149kph/92mph and punched into the off side, they pinch the one"
"back of a length outside off, <b>Bravo douses the fire with a glide through backward point</b>, played that superbly well, angled the bat and used Wood's pace to pick up four"
"tossed up around off stump, defended softly"
"slightly straighter, worked against the spin through midwicket"
"floated full on the pads, Bravo clips it past short leg and they come back for two"
tossed up and defended coming across on off
"Bravo continues to patrol the channel, defended"
touch flatter outside off and he opens the face to squirt the ball towards point
"short and snorty! <b>Takes the outside edge and nearly hits Root in the throat at first slip!</b> Wood has a third, and England are <i>rampant</i>, for pretty much the first time in the series... No doubt about this one carrying, Root nearly let it squirm free, as he brought his hands up to shoulder height and juggled the ball before holding on. Time for one more ball, in the end, and one more back in the Windies hutch!"
"outside off, through to the keeper on a tight line"
"lifting through to the keeper, no stroke needed"
"<B>sizzle!</B> Perhaps not! Short and head-hunting, Dowrich jump-ducks out of harm's way, doing a passable impression of Mike Atherton at Sabina Park in 1994"
tucked into the gap to get off the mark
"<B>boing!</B> Trampoline bounce outside off stump. Well, that was bouncy"
back of a length and defended
"good areas from Broad, who is back on a fuller length now that that bat-flinging irritant Campbell is back in the hutch"
"fuller, straighter, poked out to cover"
"bashed out through the covers, overpitched, in the slot, and clobbered!"
"tighter line, blocked on an off-stump line"
slipping down the leg side
"banged in short, uncomfortably into line to defend down into the crease"
"<strong>edged, gone, Root at first slip!</strong> A touch fuller after ramming Bravo back into the crease with his first ball, a thin tentative poke, and the skipper takes this one much more comfortably, waist-high to his right. Wood is veritable bonfire!"
"full and straight, it's a no-ball, which Wood, oddly, might not mind. Another ball to play with ..."
"<B>boshed with absolutely no footwork, one bounce over long-on!</B> Well, that's one way to do it... wonder how close to his half this next ball will be?"
"on the back foot, but not desperately short. Paul was waiting for it and hopped obediently into line"
"short and fast! But sliding past Paul's frantic swipe, down the leg side, and all the way to the rope"
"biffed into the covers, no standing on ceremony once again"
"thumps the pad, a low leg-sided full toss. More wheels on display than at a Monster Trucks rally"
firmly into line to defend
"swished down the leg side, good lift at an arm-pit length"
"wider line outside off, a flat-footed slash, no contact"
"full and straight, firm defence into the off side"
"full again, but with the greatest respect to Broad's 138kph and 430-odd wickets, there was so much time to line that up and push it to cover"
"up on the toes, worked into the covers"
"short, and swatted off his eyebrows ... can't quite make contact as Bairstow gathers"
a beautiful booming straight drive ... but the ball ends up lodged at Paul's ankles! Not sure how he managed that. Trick shot!
"attempted pull, under-edged into the pads. It's a shot a ball!"
"banged in short, a touch wide, lovely gather in the gully to intercept a jab through the cordon"
"slower delivery, slogged to the leg side, as Wood takes his habitual tumble in his followthrough ... <B>112kph that time, down from 145</B>"

tucked to the leg side
"back of a length, lifting into the ribs"
"flicked behind square, to bring Paul back on strike"

"tossed up on a wide line outside off, fully forward to defend"
"low full toss, eased down the ground to long-on"
"<strong>walks straight past a Moeen drifter, and off come the bails!</strong> Lured down the pitch, the ball just ghosts past a non-shot, and Bairstow has all the time in the world to seal the deal. That was a 9 that was far more entertaining than his total suggests"
firmly forward on the front foot
tossed up and blocked to cover
"outside off, a hint of turn into the off stump, and defended"
"on the pads, flicked to leg... now then, five at the tail ..."
"outside off, through to the keeper, as Root brings mid-off and mid-on up to stop the single"

"a bouncing bomb outside off stump, pushed back into the sticks to defend"
"straining for the yorker, a decent set-up, but slightly too leg-sided to wriggle through"

"<strong>sliding past the edge once more</strong>. Moeen finding a nice bit of drift outside off, that might have flicked the pad as the appeal was stifled"
firmly forward
crunched into the off side
"reverse swept, very impressively, out through backward point. Excellent contact"

"outside off, left alone"
"outside off, back of a length, left alone with indifference"

"lifting outside off stump, through to the keeper"
"beats the outside edge once again, good jag off the seam, but from back of a length"
"firmly into line, on the back foot"
"banged in short, and <strong>Roach is hit on the lid!</strong> Took his eye off the ball and bowed straight into the line of fire. He's fine, but a quick bit of helmet maintenance required"
"firmly forward, well played Kemar ... body on the line for the cause"
zipping past the edge to complete the over
"fully forward, pressed into the covers"
"beats the outside edge, and <B>Bairstow appeals for the stumping!</B> This might be speculative, Dowrich was a bit off-balance, and did raise his back foot at an inopportune moment ... <strong>Actually ... this might be very tight! </strong>His heel just goes walkabout as the gloves come into the shot, but it's a matter of matching up frames.... and <strong>the benefit stays with the batsman</strong>"

lobbed up wide of the stumps and Roach clips a drive to the sweeper
"flighted, Dowrich drives inside to out, Broad clanks across from mid-off and dives full length to cut it off and keep them to one"
"tossed up outside off, tempts the drive and Roach obliges with a slash through backward point, Stokes gives chase from slip but won't get there"
"short ball, again Dowrich leaps across and whips the ball away to leg, gets it between deep backward square and fine leg for four"
"legcutter from Broad, seems to pin Dowrich on the back pad in front of off stump... Rod Tucker isn't giving it, but Broad is convinced, already in celebrappeal mode and England <b>review</b>. The only question is whether impact was in line - <b>and Hawk-Eye says it was!</b> Broad was rightly confident, the ball shimmying past Dowrich's forward prod to thump into the knee roll, and its destiny was top of off"
"short and seaming away outside off, bit of a yahoo from Joseph hanging on the back foot, fails to connect"
"fired in straighter, 136kph/84mph over the stumps, defended in upright fashion"
"beats the outside edge, excellent line on fourth stump as Joseph feels for it"

"round the wicket to Joseph, pushed through and into the gloves past the forward defensive"
"slogged straight up, Broad is backpedalling from mid-off but might not get ther... <b>BRILLIANT CATCH!</B> Broad throws out his right arm and takes a one-handed screamer over his shoulder!

tossed up from round the wicket and blocked on the front foot
"short and wide, just an 84mph loosener and Gabriel rocks back to sledgehammer a cut through point for four!"
"<b>timbeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrr!</b> Wood gets his five-for! Rattles the woodwork, and Wood's work is done (for now). Fires in the full bunger, hits the base of middle stump, and he takes the plaudits for a quite spectacular return to Test cricket"

fired in at 144kph/89mph and Burns just nudges it away to the leg side for a single

"on the pads again, this time, Denly sensibly opts not to use his bat for the run"
"angling back into the left-hander, through to the keeper"
"<B>big swing!</B> That's a lovely hooping line, bending late back into the off stump. Jennings props forward well to block"

"on the back foot, and blocked into the off side"
"<B>edged, dropped! And it's a sitter at third slip!</B> Popped from a good length, much like Root's in Antigua, and came rather slower to Hetmyer that he was expecting"

It was missing the wicket by a distance, until it got caught in Jennings' thigh pad as he tried to glance, and plopped out on to leg stump. Jennings can't stop himself smiling, which says something about his character. Will that be the last time we see him in Tests?"

tucked to the leg side on a full length again
Root nudges the single into the gap and scampers up the other end
"flicked in the air, down to long on, but got enough bat through the ball to race away to the rope. A much quicker outfield today than on the first day"

"hopping back and across, flicked to backward square"
"<B>attempted ramp!</B> Not sure it was entirely intended! Root was suckered by the late inswing, and was also flicking at the ball out of self-preservation. Steady on, old chap!"

"dug in and Denly cuts again, <b>feathers through to the keeper!</b> There'll be no maiden hundred, but he's done his job... Reward for the persevering Gabriel, though he would doubtless have preferred having Denly held at slip on 12. Ball No99 gets its second wicket of the day, too"

"dug in and looping through to the keeper, called wide on height"
"woof, <b>that's pogo-ed off a length</b>, sliding in and then jacknifing up and away as Root takes evasive action. England's bowlers won't mind seeing a bit more of that"

"pitched up and clipped neatly off the toes, they run well for a second"
short of a length and pulled away for one through square leg
"full toss, scooped to the leg side - <b>and taken by Hetmyer diving forward at midwicket!</b> Root's fun is over, and his average will stay just a tick under 50 for now, too. Gabriel gets the wicket, though it was far from his best ball, and Root takes the applause as he walks off"
"starts on a nice line outside off, swinging a touch and Brathwaite flirts, <b>sends a thick edge between third slip and gully for four!</b>"
drifts a bit straight and he works this away to fine leg
"drives at his first ball, fizzes off the edge - <b>and Moeen takes a screamer in the gully!</b> Anderson gets his early wicket, and it's Campbell, his main antagonist this series, who isn't granted any extra lives this time thanks to a brilliant one-handed grab over his right shoulder by Moeen!"
"slightly back of a length, sliding down the leg side and Hope shuffles out of the way"
"fired in straight again, 132kph/82mph and <b>there's a flick of something as Bairstow takes it down the leg side</b>, belts out an appeal... Anderson asked the question, too, but I think it was pretty clearly pad"

"good nut, tempting line and nipping in past the forward push"
back of a length and defended on the stumps
"Broad plugs away outside off, another prod-and-miss from Hope"
angled in on the stumps and defended
"testing line, Brathwaite's bat scissors down at an angle, <b>and Stokes just clings on to the catch at second slip!</b> Two in two overs for Anderson, who was doubtless steaming after going wicketless in the first innings but has a grudging smile on his face now! Brathwaite admonished himself for not leaving his first ball, but this was one he had to play at"
"big nip-backer first ball, pinned on the crease... Bravo was up on his toes, looked a bit high to me, but England eventually decide to <b>review</b>, Root perhaps just throwing his senior bowler a bone (not that he needs one). <b>Hawk-Eye quickly establishes it was going over</b>, so Bravo continues and England lose one of their reviews"
"superb line, a pearling inswinger, <b>beats the forward push and just clears off stump!</b> Through him like last weekend's leftover curry"
"short ball, yoinks that has got up, <b>England think he might have got some glove on it</b>... But no! Just about got his hands out of the way, no review this time"
"holy moly me oh my... <b>Anderson beats the outside edge again!</b> Pitched up, dragged him forwards, into the gloves. Just missing the all-important nick"
"trundles in and hits a length, fourth-stump line as Hope comes across"
"back of a length, plays deliberately inside the line"
"<b>dropped!</b> Another shocker from Buttler in the slips! And off Broad again, too... Decent line, drew him out and found the edge, <b>straight to Buttler at chest height but he flubbed it!</b> Broad was already pointing at the sky in celebration. Oh dear!"
"comes across, Hope is more circumspect about playing at this one"
drags him forward and nips away past the outside edge again
"back of a length, 137kph/85mph and down the leg side as the batsman comes across"
"good length in the channel, Bravo steps out as if to play and then lets it by"
"pitched up, slightly wide and he's happy to let that go"
murmurs of interest from the cordon as Bravo pushes forward
comes across and taps this one down
"good length, nipping away outside off as he gets into line"
"badgering away outside off, again Bravo pushes slightly down the wrong line and is beaten"

pushes this down the leg side as Hope wanders across his stumps
comes across on off and defends a back-of-a-length delivery
"hits a length, 137kph/85mph and Hope thrusts his bat out in defence"
"fuller, tight lines and Hope clamps down on it in defence"
"<B>edged and gone!</B> That's right in the channel from Anderson, outside off, lifting past the edge, tempting the drive, and Root at first slip gobbles the opportunity! Loose from Bravo - he wasn't tempted in that manner in 340-odd minutes in Antigua. But he's gone without scoring and Anderson is flying!"
"head over the ball, stretching onto the front foot, and Chase avoids the king pair. Which is progress"
"outside off, left alone, good line and lift"
"back of a length, holding a tight off-stump line, poked through the cordon"
"poking onto the front foot, edgy block into the leg side"

"full and straight, plugging away"
"defended into the off side, leaning onto the front foot"
"nip off a good length, cutting back in as Hope leaves alone"
"onto the front foot, and punched into the covers"
"<strong>bounce and movement!</strong> Lively from Anderson, outside off and hitting the deck. Just about avoids playing a stroke there"
"squeezed to the leg side, pressing forward uncertainly on a middle-stump line, and he's off the mark at last"
"zipping sharply back in off the seam, blocked"
"full and straight, shape back into the right hander, defended to midwicket"
"outside off, hits the deck hard and jags alarmingly away from the bat with good lift"

"closed-face drive, up to mid-on"
"solidly blocked, hints of swing"
"outswinger, on a wide line, no stroke needed there"
"this one slides straight on, and defended"
"yorker, well enough dug out, if with an inside-edged splinter of bat"
forward to defend
"back of a length, and zipping quickly towards the knee-roll! Defended on the back foot in a bit of a rush. 139kph so far. A mere loosener"
through to the keeper on a wider line. 142kph this time
"<B>bouncer!</B> That was short and to the point! Hope hops, and ducks, as the ball fizzes through"
"full-length outswinger, at 143kph. That was a loose waft outside off, as Hope wants to get his licks in. Wood loses his footing in his followthrough again"
"thundering through to the keeper again, still not quite clicking up to his first-innings pace"
"on the pads, jabbed square, out of Jennings' reach under the lid"
"fenced into the leg side, from a full length"
"leaning out of the crease, pushed to the off side"
"pushed onto the back foot with that familiar angle into the right hander, and jabbed down into the crease. Tucker's hat took a walk behind the bowler's arm as Stokes delivered that one!"
firmly forward once more
"up onto the toes, fenced into the covers"
wide of off stump and ignored
"angled bat, squirted down to third man"
"lifting into the thigh pad, from a full length. 141kph again ... not sluggish by any standards"
"wider line, full length, no need to play at that one"
"banged in short, called as a wide on height. Umpires are seriously militant about those these days. This is the an extraordinarily extra-ful match"
"full and straight, and whooshing past the edge"
"<B>that's a tremendous stroke</B>. Unfussed by reputation, just playing the ball on merit, too full, big stride, full face, eyes pointing where the ball is intended, and rifled through the covers"

"full length, and dead-batted back up the pitch"
"outside off, banged through to the keeper"

"worked to the leg side, and a sharp scamper to the non-striker's end"
full length and speared into the toes from round the wicket. Firm defence
"<B>fierce!</B> Short and to the point, angled in from round the wicket, Hetmyer ducks and rolls onto his back to stay out of harm's way"
firmly into line to defend. Wood still hovering around the 140kph mark... not quite as wheel-some as in his first innings but rapid all the same. That's been a session of rich reward for England

"bouncer, maybe taking the pace off a touch, 132kph and looping over the attempted pull - actually signalled wide, on height"
pushes this one down the leg side again
"dug in short, 140kph/87mph and Hetmyer pulls in the air, bounces away through backward square but holds up in the outfield"

"low full toss, 145kph/90mph and Chase swats it away through point... they try to come back for three, <b>but Hetmyer is struggling here!</b> Oopsie, West Indies lose their fifth wicket in shoddy fashion.

"keeps low outside off, can't lay bat on those .... luckily it was wide of the timbers"
defended with a full face to mid-off
"outside off, and through to the keeper"
another one slides through a touch low. Well watched into the middle of a pokey bat
"decent start, well flighted, bit of bite, solid defence"
"tossed up this time, a loopy full-toss into the toes"
"flat legbreak, into the pads"
"<B>slammed back past the bowler, and so nearly caught!</B> Denly put his fingers in harm's way but that was travelling! Bursts through, so technically a <strong>drop</strong>"
tucked to the leg side
"dragged out of the crease, not quite to the pitch, and wafted back down the pitch"
"<B>another grubber outside off!</B> Anderson has found the sweet spot here, and Roach can only shrug in frustration. One of these will have his stumps in trouble..."
"this one lifts off the hip, and tucked to the leg side"
"good carry outside off this time. It's a bit of a lottery. Anderson is consistently back of a length in this spell, which is odd, when you consider he scalped three wickets from a fuller length"
sliding down the leg side
"<B>so nearly!</B> Anderson aims fuller for once, finds a bit of wobble on a good length, and a flashing drive eludes gully! But that is nevertheless Chase's fifty and it is very well earned"
sliding down the leg side as Anderson pulls his length back again
"loopy stuff, blocked"
tossed up and drilled to cover
"battered into the covers, too short and wide, and that will help the mood"
"sliding onto the legs, nudged round the corner"
open-faced wallop into the covers
"leaning forward, nose over the ball. and that will be <B>tea</B>"
"full and straight to begin with, clipped off the toes and it runs away through midwicket for three"
"back of a length, 138kph outside off, Roach plays inside the line"
dug in short at 138kph/86mph and seaming away as Roach goes back and across and drops his hands
"fuller, finds the outside edge... <b>flies away through fourth slip for four!</b> Don't think it would have carried if there was a man in there"
"short and at the body, fended behind the dive of short leg"
"back of a length down the leg side, Chase flicks at it and England go up... Dharmasena shakes his head, sounded like thigh pad, most likely"
"over the wicket, tossed up and Roach has a swing, comes off the inside edge to the leg side"
pushed through and defended doggedly
"floated up on off, Roach leans on a forward block"
"ooohh, <b>another shooter outside off!</b> This time from the spinner, stays down as Roach stays back and jabs at it unsuccessfully"
comes across and stabs into the covers
"<b>dropped!</b> Chipped to mid-off, nice, easy head-height catch, <b>but Rory Burns makes a hash of it!</b> Slipped through the hands, almost as if he had too much time to think about it"
"fullish on off, 141kph/88mph and bunted towards xtra cover"
"nasty delivery, rears up to hit the glove as Roach fends it down in front of short leg"
short of a length and defended on the back foot
"shortish, coming in with the arm from over the wicket, again Roach pokes it safely down into the leg side"
"<b>dropped!</b> (Technically!) Feisty bumper, 142kph/88mph and brushing the gloves as Roach throws his hands up - <b>but Bairstow can only get fingertips on it!</b> That got up high, but Roach gets away with it"
"banged in, another splice-rattler, <b>loops away towards gully</b>... but won't go to hand once again!"
tossed up and Chase defends on the front foot
comes across and works into a gap
"flighted, this goes on with the arm as Roach presses out, <b>takes the outside edge but flies wide of slip this time!</b> Roach had his Lucky Charms for breakfast this morning!"
tossed up and defended going back on off stump
pushed through and Roach blocks
"drags him forward, again takes the edge as Roach comes forward but he keeps it down and picks up one more"
"short and rising up on middle and off, Roach jumps into line and defends stoutly"
"leg-side bouncer, 137kph/85mph and Roach ducks it"
"another short ball down the leg side, he gets well out of the way"
"back of a length, Roach deflects it off the hip down towards fine leg"
"round the wicket to Chase, 140kph/87mph and pinged in towards the ribs, lined up well in defence"
"short and leg side, Chase gets his lanky self out of the way"
"slogged to cover, <b>Roach's road runs out!</b> Moeen feeds the drive and he picks out the man, to bring an entertaining post-tea cameo to an end"
"sliding on with the arm, past the outside edge as he props forward"
"floated up nice and slow, driven down the ground to long-off"
tossed up and blocked diligently on the front foot
"quicker delivery on off, Chase covers the line"
"tossed up wide of the stumps and Chase lashes it through point, the England fielders aren't going to bust a gut to try and field it... and the ball tickles for four to keep Joseph on strike"
"short outside off, shaping back in late as Joseph has a swing and a miss"
swatted away through backward point for a single
"round the wicket again, slammed in short at 141kph/88mph and Chase has to be up on his toes as ti climbs wickedly towards his throat - played it well in the end"
"dug in short but Wood is a little down on gas now and it sits up at hip height, <b>Chase swivels and batters it through midwicket for four!</b> Noice"
"slammed in short, 139kph and rising up the shoulder as Chase half-jumps and then tucks in his head turtle-style"
"over the wicket, back of a length outside off and Chase tries to leave, hits the back of the bat and runs to gully"
"flighted on middle stump, bit of drift and Joseph prods at it, gets a thick edge past slip for one"
pushed through and punched to cover on the back foot
"tossed up and spinning a touch, poked back defensively"
"nice and full, Chase's eyes light up and <b>he blooters this straight back over the bowler's head for a massive six!</b> That went into the top tier! Hold the shape, Chasey"
pushed through and tapped away
"flighted and flicked through square leg, he's happy to take two and leave Joseph on strike"
"short ball, well-directed by Joseph gets his not-inconsiderable height out of the way"
"full and flayed through the covers! <b>Struck right out of the middle</b>, minimal footwork but plenty of hand-eye coordination"
"back of a length, 143kph/89mph and Joseph has a hack, <b>manages to clear cover running back!</b> Buttler was the man running after it, which might not have inspired confidence, but he couldn't get there"
"short of a length, lets this one go"
"plugs away outside off, Chase happy to leave it be"
"pitched up and he's driven back down the ground, maybe a sign that Wood's done for now... Nicely into line and stroked through mid-on"
"full and loopy, Joseph has a mow, <b>lands just short of mid-on!</b> Anderson does well to grab it one-handed on the bounce and stopping it skipping past him"
"sliding on with the arm, into the gloves"
tossed up and punched back down the track
"flighted, slightly wider and Joseph prods it to short extra cover"
"tossed up and <b>belted back down the ground!</b> Strong bottom-handed humpty from Joseph, fetches him another boundary"
"flighted, Joseph swings it through mid-off, one to the man halfway back and he takes it to stay on strike"
"short of a length, 132kph/82mph over off stump, blocked in front of point"
"bit of width, Joseph has a happy slap but doesn't get the timing this time"

"pitched up a but further, Joseph boinks a drive into the ground towards mid-off"
"short of a length outside off, swing and a miss"
"touch short and jabbed away past backward point, again he takes the single. Enjoying himself out there"
"<dropped!</b> Round the wicket, Joseph drives and takes the edge, <b>Stokes can't cling on one-handed to his left!</b> Sharp, reaction chance, he flipped it up but couldn't get to the rebound"
"floated up and he slugs this up and over mid-on, <b>only just manages to clear the man!</b> Living on the edge eight now, is Alzarri!"
pushed through and worked off the pads
presses out to defend
"more tap for Moeen, clears the front foot and <b>banjos this a long way over deep midwicket!</b> When he hits 'em, they stay hit... Dropped on the grass banks, too"
"slow and loopy, outside leg and he just lets it hit his pad"
"touch short of a length, lets this of outside off"
"full, 138kph/86mph, jams right into the toe of the bat as Chase drives and it bobbles back to the bowler... might have broken the bat, that"
"pitched up and struck in front, up goes the finger, looked pretty plumb... but Chase <b>reviews!</b> England think they've got their man, he was quite far back on his stumps, but just hold on a moment! <b>There's a spike on UltraEdge</b>, some bat involved, and this will be overturned!"
"good length, Chase keeps this one out"
comes across on off stump and blocks
"good length in the channel, comes across and shoulders arms"
tossed up and slogged over the head of mid-off! Clears Burns running back and <b>goes all the way!</b> Joseph still swinging
pushed across and into the gloves
tossed up and he goes heave-ho again! Denly was on the rope at deep midwicket but watched it sail over his head - <b>that's the fifty stand for the eighth wicket</b>
goes back and slaps a short delivery through the off side
"spooned up and this will be taken - <b>Anderson does the job at mid-on!</b> One slog too many from Joseph, this came high off the bat and Anderson had time to run across to his left and settle under it"
tossed up and worked away
"length on the pads, sliding leg side and it deflects away, a sloppy bit of fielding gives them a run and gets Chase on strike"
"shortish and defended on off stump. Chase still playing properly, at least"
swing and a miss outside off
"bumper, just outside off, Chase ducks it"
comes across and taps the ball away
"tight lines from Broad, blocked on off stump"
"round the wicket, tossed up and patted away"
Gabriel again comes across to defend
"lobbed up and Gabriel goes a little harder at this, in the air but wide of the bowler for one"
presses out to defend
"Chase steps out and belts this back over the bowler's head, skips away to the rope"
"tossed up and Chase doesn't bother looking for a single, opens the shoulders and smears wide of deep mid-off for four more!"
"back of a length over the top of off, comes off the inside edge as Gabriel blocks"
"arrowing in towards the stumps, Gabriel is back on his stumps but manages jam it out"
"fullish, swings hard, those meaty shoulders opening up to carve over midwicket... won't go all the way"
"finds the outside edge, <b>just short of third slip!</b> Just a poke from Gabriel, but the ball didn't carry to Moeen diving forward"
comes across and bunts into the covers
"short of a length, another legcutter and it kangaroos through to the keeper, well past the bat as Gabriel flails in the channel"
tossed up and patted back
comes forward and defends
Chase has a swing and gets a thick inside edge through square leg
"stays round the wicket, sliding across as Gabriel hangs back and is beaten"
"over the wicket, defended back on his stumps"
"loopy and full on middle stump, Gabriel plants the front foot and blocks once more"
"<b>is that a drop?</b> No, I think it brushed the trouser leg as Chase was beaten on the inside... The ball cleared the stumps and then Bairstow put it down going one-handed to his left"
"pitched up and Chase strokes this back down the ground, beats mid-off and runs away! He's into the 90s"
"full length, he goes again, big wind-up and follow-through on a flowing cover drive and <b>that's going to outrun the fielder, too!</b> Just a hit away now"
"short of a length, nudged off the body and he takes the one"
lets this one go outside off stump
"fullish on off, 135kph/84mph and Gabriel dead-bats it back down the track"
lobbed up and he takes the single on offer through mid-off
"flighted, full and straightening a touch on off, defended"
"oh, <b>slides one past the outside edge!</b> Into the gloves as Gabriel pushes forward and is beaten"
tossed up and blocked
"pushed through and this clips the edge, running wide of slip... but they don't take the run"
"tossed up full, Gabriel jabs down on it in defence"
"short of a length, hits above the knee roll with Chase hopping back on off stump, England go up for lbw... Probably high"
"dug in and tucked off the hip, they amble the single though midwicket"
"off-stump line, Gabriel shows it a straight bat"
"bangs down the bouncer, over the ducking Gabriel"
"back of a length, Gabriel swipes... <b>and nicks off!</b> He's done it again (sort of)! No review, he knew he'd hit it, just couldn't help himself"
"full and swinging in at 144kph/89mph, Paul shows solid technique to defend to cover"
"lobbed up, Chase gets a thick inside edge that squirms out of Jennings' reach at short leg! Lummy"
props forward and defends
lobbed up and poked into the covers
"drops slightly short, Chase rocks back and cuts, this is going to run away... <b>Hundred up for Chase</b>, his fifth in Tests! He crosses the arms in celebration, been an excellent knock in tough conditions, and without much support (though credit to Keemo for hobbling out)"
"oh my, <b>how has this missed off stump?</b> Bit of grip for Denly's legbreak, slides past the inside edge but sneaks past the timbers, too"
tossed up and tapped away
"short ball, <b>Paul hammers it up over midwicket!</b> Nothing wrong with his arms, clearly"
"full toss, maybe an attempted slower ball, swung to the leg side"
"pitched up and he latches on, sent rasping though point with a free swing of the bat, four more!"
"low full toss and <b>he smokes this down the ground!</b> Like Gordon Greenidge, he's dangerous on one leg"
"short ball, loops up off the splice as Paul pulls - <b>Stokes takes it in his follow through!</b> And then throws down the stumps, for good measure. Not sure why, perhaps he thought he had overstepped, but he quickly offers his hand to Keemo Paul, who did his bit for his team-mate"
