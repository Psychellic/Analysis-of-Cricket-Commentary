"fullish outside off to start, shovelled towards midwicket for a single."
goes down leg for a wide. Loses his line. Good delivery to the right-hander
"better. On a length around off, Parthiv defends back"
"tidy again from Bhuvi. Fuller than a good length outside off, fourth-stump line. Blocked to mid-off"
"good single. Full and straight, flicked towards mid-on for a quick single. Nabi fails to pick up cleanly."
"good stuff. Brought third man up, and bowled a slow, straight legcutter. Skews off the outside half to short third man. Very game aware is Warner and the execution from Bhuvneshwar spot on"
"another legcutter on leg, clipped to square leg. A tidy over. Sunrisers' plan comes together in over 1."
"fires one in on middle and leg, clipped to midwicket"
"quick and straight, pushed to mid-on for a quick single. Good tight single from Parthiv"
lovely length. Simmons wants to tee off but the length isn't full enough. Pushed to cover
"that's the result of some wily bowling. The pressure was built and Simmons misses a slog. It's full and straight again, no spin. A wild swing from Simmons is missed by some distance. Goes through a big gap between bat and pad, and hits middle stump. I'm not sure how he missed the ball by that much, and on the inside edge. Understandable if he was beaten on the outside edge, playing for some turn"
"full outside off, defended towards cover"
"beaten on the outside edge. Another tidy over this. Flat and wide outside off, Rana misses the ball on the outside edge."
"good length delivery outside off, carved towards extra cover"
"that goes all the way. Shortish length outside off, there is some extra bounce but you can't afford to give Parthiv width. He gets underneath the length and nails his upper cut over point. Shot"
"better. Slower delivery outside off, pushed to mid-off for a run"
"finds the gap. That isn't great bowling. Good length delivery outside off, Rana taps the ball in the gap between short third man and backward point."
"131 kph, a short loopy bouncer goes over Rana's head. Wide called"
"lovely stroke from Rana. Fullish delivery outside off, Rana drills a straight drive. Knew Warner was wide at mid-off so he hit this a lot straighter"
"another slower delivery that is closer to off, played quietly to backward point"
"flat delivery outside off, flat-batted over the bowler's head for a run. Again, not full enough to hit. Credit to Nabi"
comes down the pitch. Nabi follows him. Off the pad. Skidding on with the arm
"flat, but slower on off. Pushed to point. Good bowling. Varying his pace effectively"
"fuller delivery outside off, pushed to cover this time"
"a flat, slow delivery outside off. Rana looks for a dab to third man but makes no connection. Superb start from Nabi"
"almost goes through. Flat and straight, the ball skids on and skews to deep square leg off the inside edge"
"gets a wicket off the first ball. Rana goes. The pressure has built steadily and a loose shot the result. A shortish length outside off, Rana picks the length early but doesn't account for the pace of the surface. It hurries onto him and his pull lobs to mid-off."
"<b>dropped</b>. Another dolly. What is happening? Short and wide outside off, an awful delivery. Parthiv can't keep his cut down either. Hits it straight to Vijay Shankar at point who puts his hands up for a reverse-cupped catch, but lets it through. Yikes, another one. Burst through his hands"
"on a length and straight, flicked away through midwicket"
"a slower ball on off, patted towards point."
"too straight goes Kaul, flicked through square leg for a run"
"full and straight again, pushed away towards mid-on for a quick run"
"flat and wide, Parthiv stays back and slaps a cut past cover. Warner at long-off cuts it off"
"flat and wide outside off, Parthiv stays low and drags a sweep over midwicket. Probably the wrong shot but picked his area and executed well"
"shortish on off, worked down to fine leg"
"flat down leg, clipped to square leg"
"shortish and straight, Rohit punches a drive towards cover"
"quick and flat again, clipped to square leg. Good finish by Nabi. He's done his job"
"Parthiv has chipped a catch to long-on. That isn't good batting. A slower delivery outside off, Parthiv just chips the ball down towards long-on. Many fielders wouldn't have come close to that, but Warner attacked the ball, got there and took a classy low catch. Mumbai struggling"
"a good bouncer. Short on off and middle, hurries Rohit who pulls the ball over midwicket. Not quite timed but got enough of that"
"another couple. 140 kph, full and wide outside off. Crashed through cover for two more"
"<b>another big appeal.</b> A bouncer on middle and leg, Rohit misses a pull. The ball ricochets towards cover off the helmet. Umpire Padmanabhan has no idea what he's doing. He takes a step towards the leg umpire, then bails out. Warner comes up to him and says weren't you going to ask the other umpire? The umpire says no. Just helmet it looks like, the right call but no confidence at all. Rohit beaten for pace"
"a slower ball on middle and leg, a mis-timed slog finds mid-on"
"full and straight, towards leg stump. Flicked through midwicket for a couple"
"flat and slow outside off, defended"
"full and straight, worked to midwicket."
"slow again through the air, a bit of spin. Clipped to midwicket. Another dot. Have to find the gaps. use your wrists"
"much better. Flat on off, Hardik opens the bat face to find a single to deep point."
punched towards deep cover from the back foot
"shortish delivery on middle and leg, worked to square leg for a single. Hardik wants two, the captain says nah. Hardik scurries back. A lovely spell of disciplined bowling from Nabi."
"flat delivery outside off, Hardik doesn't pick the legbreak. Beats the bat."
"fullish delivery outside off, drilled wide of long-off for a single. Better intent from Hardik"
"beautifully played. Short and wide outside off, played late, played off the face of the bat, down past short third man. Using the pace"
"short and straight, flicked away towards midwicket"
"a googly outside off, Hardik cuts through backward point for a couple. Nicely played"
"another googly, Hardik doesn't pick this. Misses his flick and is struck in front of middle and leg. Going down"
"full on off, blocked to cover"
"runs at the bowler but the length is shorter outside off, slashed to deep point for a run"
"fantastic effort from Hooda. A slower delivery outside off, ramped over the keeper. Hooda runs to his left from third man to save a run. Awesome stuff, saved one"
"138 kph, fullish on off, pushed to long-off"
"140 kph, a yorker on middle, clipped to midwicket. Takes it on the full"
a slower ball that is ill-directed. Drifts far too wide outside off. Wide called
"a good short delivery to end, aimed outside off. Left alone. Hardik wears a rueful smile."
"almost picks out deep square leg. Picks the length, not the variation. Reads it off the pitch, short on middle and leg. Pulled to deep square leg on the bounce"
"flat and wide, the legbreak. Beats the bat"
"flat outside off, another legbreak that rips past the outside edge"
"and one more. Flat and wide outside off, Hardik looks for a cut from the crease but the ball goes past"
"flat and wide, pushed to cover"
"deposits that over long-on's head. A slower ball outside off, Rohit gets down low and creams a swat over long-on. Fantastic stroke. A cross-batted shot, an indicator he wasn't quite picking Rashid"
"full delivery outside off, comes back in. Pushed to long-on"
"good length  on middle, nudged towards short fine leg for a run"
"good length outside off, hit to Henriques' left at cover. Rohit is sent back too late but his throw bounces over the stumps. <strong>Out with a direct hit</strong>"
"full and straight, pushed to long-on"
"a shortish slower ball outside off, dabbed towards cover"
"a short delivery outside off, sits up for Hardik but he can only swat a pull to long-on. Another tidy over from Sunrisers"
"a legcutter outside off from Bhuvi, punched on the up to the sweeper cover"
"another legcutter, so wary that he doesn't bowl it overly full. A shortish length is pulled to long-on on the bounce"
"a short slower ball outside off, hit towards long-off"
"129 kph, another legcutter outside off, off the outside edge down to short third man"
"that is good. Full and wide from Bhuvi, Rohit wanted to go over cover but the ball skews off the outside half and over backward point."
"a short legcutter well outside off, Rohit dances down and drills a drive to long-off"
nicely hit. A slower ball outside off from Henriques to start. Rohit gets underneath that and lifts the ball over cover. Nice execution
"short and wide outside off, slashed to deep point. Pulled that length back on seeing Rohit advancing"
"good length and wide outside off, carved to deep point"
"to the other side of cover this time. That is experience and class. A shortish slower ball outside off, Rohit punches the ball off the back foot to the right of cover. Long-off can't get across either"
"brilliant batting. This is quick and short outside off, Rohit opens the bat face and guides the ball between backward point and third man. Yuvraj at backward point gets a hand on it but Bhuvi can't cut it in"
"on a length, worked to deep midwicket"
"shortish outside off, flicked to deep midwicket. Not a bad tactic to play Rashid out"
taken this time. Moises' safe reverse-cupped hands. A flat delivery on middle and leg. He wasn't reading the legspinner so the sweep is the best option. But Hardik's slog results in a top edge which settles in cover's hands. Timely wicket
"85 kph, short delivery outside off, stops on Rohit who pushes the ball back to the bowler"
"short again, flat. Punched to long-on"
"a googly on middle and leg, clipped to deep backward square leg"
"great stop. Flat and wide, carved towards short third man who dives to his right to save three."
"full outside off, carved past backward point for a couple. The sweeper cover sweeps up"
"a low full toss on middle, pushed back to the bowler who deflects the ball into the stumps and then to long-on. Rohit brings up fifty"
strays down leg for a wide
"a slower ball on middle and leg, worked to deep square leg"
"short and wide, a poor delivery. Scythed towards backward point where Yuvraj stops the ball, but has done some damage to his little finger. The doctor comes out to check on him."
"ooh, lucky. A full toss on the pads. Pollard misses out on five runs by missing his flick. Off the pad towards square leg"
"beautifully played. poor ball. A short delivery outside off, the ball sticks in the surface but third man is up so Rohit just lifts the ball over the keeper. Exceptional execution."
"full and quick, off the outside edge to point for a run"
"flat and wide, carved to short third man. A loud 'noo' from Pollard"
wow. Rohit goes for the reverse sweep and misses it by a pitch or two. Nowhere close
"a googly outside off, cut towards short third man. Siraj dives to his left to save three more"
"quick and flat outside off, the ball spins past Pollard's edge. Sensational bowling"
"and another one. Wow. Sticks with his stock ball, the legbreak. Pollard has no idea which way this is going. The ball spins past the outside edge. Very tidy from Rashid."
looks for the yorker does Bhuvneshwar. Misses the length and it's a low full toss that is clipped through square leg. Played well
"picks the gap and gets six. A short legcutter outside off, Rohit picks it. And pulls through midwicket. Superb stroke."
"that's his best delivery, just stick with it. A low full toss on leg, worked to deep midwicket"
another good yorker outside off. Shovelled to long-on for a run. Fantastic defensive bowling.
"Rohit comes down, looking to convert that yorker into a full toss. He does so but can only find long-off with a drive"
"140 kph, drifts down leg for a wide. Naman can't collect cleanly. There are two extras"
"a yorker on leg, dug out towards cover where Rashid runs in and unnecessarily concedes a run with a fumble."
"played onto his stumps. An awful delivery gets the wicket. It's short, it's wide, it's tripe. But Rohit picks the wrong shot. Looks to pull but the ball stops in the surface, comes on slower and takes his inside edge. And then disturbs the stumps. A fine, fine innings from the captain. Has looked classy all night."
"full delivery, shaping away. The ball angles away and beats the bat. Lovely bowling."
"good length delivery outside off, slapped away to deep cover. Just what he has to do, give Pollard the strike"
"eeeeks, a full toss on middle, flicked away to deep square leg. Should be hitting those for sixes."
"another slower delivery, pace off. Superb bowling. The knuckle ball. Karn is too quick through his slog and the ball goes over the stumps. Bounces in front of Naman. So far, so good from Kaul"
"four to finish. A low full toss on middle, Karn opens the face of the bat and guides this through backward point for four. Not a great finish to a tidy over for Sunrisers"
"Bhuvneshwar wins this one. It's a not-so-good delivery. A full toss on middle, in the arc. Pollard swings and the ball is swatted straight to deep midwicket. Just struggled all night did Pollard. That swung back in the air, ending in the inside half of the bat and Shankar's hands, of course"
"a legcutter outside off, outside the tramline so he'll have to rebowl that"
exceptional. The execution of the yorker can earn you millions. Bhuvneshwar doing it again. Harbhajan can only dig that out
"another slower ball, the legcutter, the length isn't full so that Harbhajan can get underneath that. bounces in front of Naman and goes away for a couple of byes"
"another legcutter outside off, a flat-batted slap to long-off. Just one more. Great bowling"
"edged and gone. A short, slow delivery outside off. Karn looks for a cut but it just keeps shaping away. Ends up getting a thick edge to the keeper. Bowling outside the lower order's hitting arc, just fantastic execution again."
"an offcutter outside off, swatted to wide long-on for a couple. Another tidy finish from Sunrisers"
"tossed up full outside off stump, Warner goes for the reverse sweep and is beaten. Patel flicks off the bails...but he's appealing to the umpire at the non-strikers for some reason. It's not given"
"short and wide outside off, he's quickly behind it and slaps this in front of cover point"
"back of a length, spinning away from outside off, but he bunts it to miwicket off the back foot, across the line"
"full at off stump, premeditated sweep, no connection at all. Barely gets the sticker of the bat, then boot, then slowly into the leg side"
"good length at middle stump, forward defence"
"full ball, fired flat at leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
"surely. Yes. Plumb in front. Warner's gone, we're going to have some chase now. This is full at middle stump, floats in and thuds Warner on the back leg as he looks to flick this. No doubt for Erasmus there...although replays suggest, vaguely, that there might have been a faint inside edge. There wasn't a dramatic reaction from Warner or anything. Tough to tell, other than the minute wave disturbance on the replay."
"back of a length at off stump, swivels hurriedly and gets this to deep square with a short arm pull"
"good ball. The perfect yorker at off stump, he squeezes it out to extra cover"
"good length at off stump, defended to point on the up"

"good length at middle stump, flicked on the up to deep square leg"
"overpitched on the pads, flicked uppishly, but wide of, and, in front of deep square who cleans up on the bounce"
"good length at off stump, pushed on the up to extra cover's left"
"shot. He's exposing his leg stump in the stance before this ball. Probably to cut out the stride. And when Malinga bowls it full at middle, he doesn't need one. Gets to the pitch rapidly and drives it nicely, to mid-off's right"
"good length at middle stump, once more he doesn't need to make room, half a stride to push it on the up to mid-off's right"
"in the blockhole at leg stump, tucks it to short fine's left"
"back of a length at middle stump, goes back in the crease and punches it to long-on"

"flat, fast, back of a length, leg stump. He's back quickly and whips this to deep midwicket"
"good length, fired in at middle stump. Poked on the up to mid-on"
"good length at leg stump, flicked very late, past the midwicket area"
"good shot. Back of a length, just outside off stump. Stands tall and puts in a small stride, then punches on the up. Uses his wrists to get it between cover point and extra cover"
"nicely fielded. This good length ball skids through outside off, he slashes at this, gets it into the turf and point dives to his left to parry it"
"nicely done. Back of a length at middle stump, gets on top of the bounce quickly and spanks this pull shot in front of square with complete control"
"offcutter, back of a length outside off, steps out and pushes to short extra"
"offcutter, back of a length at off stump, punched off the back foot to mid-off"
"offcutter, dropped short outside off stump and Henriques only has to decide where to place this. In the end, he goes for the slice to get it well to the left of sweeper cover. Third man was inside"
"offcutter, full at off stump, driven firmly to sweeper cover"
"good length at off stump, driven on the up, straight to Pollard at short extra"
"legcutter this time, looped nicely, full at off stump. He tucks it off the toe-end to mid-on and steals a single"
"glorious shot, but straight to the fielder. Gives him the charge and thumps this length ball from middle stump with a straight bat. Lovely connection, hardly any placement. Mid-off puts in the barrier"
"back of a length, spinning in at off stump, chopped off the back foot to backward point"
"lovely. This is tossed up outside off stump, he skips down the wicket, gets to the pitch and picks this up with some balance over long-on"
"back of a length at middle stump, whipped off the back foot to deep midwicket"
"doesn't read the googly, but he's saved by the pad. He pushes at this anxiously as it pitches on leg and is almost beaten down the leg side whilst outside his crease. Safe in the end, it tickles off his pads to short  fine's right"
"back of a length at middle stump, punched off the back foot to long-on"
"googly again, pushed through flat, back of a length at off stump. Didn't seem to know about this either. Bunted into the off side hurriedly"

"slower ball, good length outside off stump, chops it onto his back leg as he pokes away from the body"
"good length, angled across off stump, and he leans into this gorgeously to push it on the up past mid-off. Pollard gives chase and pulls it back with a slide"
"poor bowling. Drops the offcutter short outside off stump, he just has to camp on the back foot and slash this past point"
"good length at leg stump. Poor bowling again. He'll nail that sweep most times, as he does now. Deep square had no chance"
"good length outside off stump, not to the pitch as he slashes. Beaten. arthiv took the bails off as Dhawan moved to balance himself. Replays show it's not out."
"good length at middle stump, lets it spin and cops it on the pad"
"back of a length at middle stump, steps out, beaten in flight, pushes it back at the bowler"
"oh Dhawan. This is incredible. It was good bowling from Karn. He knew Dhawan was coming down the track, so he pushed this one wide, back of a length and beat him in flight. But Dhawan went after it, picked the turn and slapped this flat over long-on"
"googly outside off on a length this time. Dhawan wins the mind game. Stays on the back foot, opens the face and steals a single to short third man's right"
"good length, flat outside off from around the wicket, chopped to backward point"
"goes for the reverse sweep, doesn't control it, but finds the gap. This was back of a length at middle. He had turned quickly and went through with the shot. Hit it in the air, but safely in between backward point and short third"

"short ball at off stump, easy meal on the pitch, he's on top of it and pulls confidently to deep square"
"<b>falls short of Harbhajan.</b> Short ball again, this one rises more than the last and Henriques gets the pull high on the bat. He's late on it. It floats in front of Harbhajan and lands in front of him. Might have dived forward at some other point in his life"
"classy. For a second, he's beaten by Malinga's slower yorker. But he recovers, waits, makes it a full toss, and then lifts it over midwicket with a short arm jab"

"fired back of a length, flat at middle stump, pushed to long-on off the back foot"
"good length at middle stump, flicked into the leg side, easy peasy"
"<b>dropped.</b> This one carried to Harbhajan. Back of a length, he looked to punch this off the back foot and was through the shot too early. Hung back a nice catch to the bowler, who went down too late and didn't get his fingers under this"
"good length at middle stump, no feet this time, pokes away from the body, gets an inside edge to squeeze through to short fine"
"good length, outside off stump, plonks the front leg down to sweep, misses. Loud appeal but that hit him outside off"
"keep it slow, silly. Henriques through the shot early once more. This is full, an offcutter outside off. He goes for the short arm jab without any feet. The bat face closes too early and he balloons a leading edge to extra cover's right and he takes it comfortably. Henriques falls six short of his fourth fifty of the season."
"offcutter, back of a length at middle stump, jumps at Dhawan and hits him in the midriff as he looks to flick this"
"good length, angled across off stump. Pokes this into the off side with an open face....<b>and he's clutching this hand immediately.</b>"
"back of a length at middle stump, he hops in his crease nervously and looks to close the face on this, gets a leading edge that lands in front of cover point"
"yikes. Bumrah is unforgiving. Bowls him a bouncer this time. He half hooks, half evades, fully takes it on the body"

"offcutter, back of a length outside off stump, cut to sweeper cover"

"back of a length outside off stump, pushed to point off the back foot"

"yorker outside off, arches backwards and looks to drive this through the off side, gets a thick inside edge that is too slow for deep midwicket to reduce to a single"
"back of a length, angled into him. He backs away and slaps this over the umpire, but not with enough timing to get the boundary. Long-on cuts it off"

"yorker at off stump, gets the bat down quickly and squeezes this past point"
"slower ball, full toss outside off, tapped back to the bowler on the bounce"
"oh nice shot. This tails in at leg stump, overpitched, and he brings down a nice full face on this, with a high elbow and executes the perfect on-drive. Long-on is back though"
"bouncer down the leg side, he goes for the hook and misses. Parthiv takes it to his left and is already celebrating halfway through the appeal...umpire signals wide."
"offcutter, back of a length outside off stump, opens the face and runs it down towards third man"
