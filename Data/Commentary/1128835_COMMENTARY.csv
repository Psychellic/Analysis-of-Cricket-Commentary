Devcich attempts a dinky paddle and manages an inside edge onto the thigh pad
"Fahim Ashraf sneaks under the bat of Ramdin and hits the stumps. Ramdin beaten three times in a row, this results in his dismissal for 9 off 20 balls. Poor tactics from Lahore; they shouldn't have sent in Ramdin ahead of Baz and Narine in the first place. This dismissal might not be a bad thing for Lahore. Full and straight, Ramdin looks to slog it away. He loses his shape and his stumps"
he brings out a fluent cut right away. Guided to third man
"Sami runs back from square leg and takes this skier. Short offcutter, goes away outside off, Devcich can't control a pull. He only top-edges it hiiiiiiiigh and Sami judges it superbly. Two new batsmen in the middle. This Lahore innings has unravelled and how"

"wide of the crease, Ashraf sends down another inswinging yorker, this time to Narine. He backs away, exposes his stumps, and eventually loses them. Top execution from Ashraf"
Sohail gets under a full ball outside off and swings it to long-on
"<strong>141ks rocket from Sami,</strong> and it breaches through the defences of Sohail. This was the perfectly-pitched yorker, Sohail eyes up the leg side, but the ball squeezes under his legs. Oh replays, suggest the ball ricocheted into the stumps off his pad"
"very full and outside off, squeezed down to long-off"
"Sami misses the yorker now. This was fullish on middle, Baz shimmies across and scoops it deftly fine over the keeper's head. <strong>He has ramped it all the way for six</strong>"
"Sami loses his length, sends down a full-toss on middle stump, which is swatted away past the left of square leg. The ball spins away from the fielder and rolls away to the boundary. The fielder should've done better"
"full-toss on off, Baz slogs it away to wide long-on. There's a mix-up between the wickets on the first run as well as on the second... or Baz just stopped momentarily on the second. He allowed Ronchi to take the bails off and ensured he did not cross over to save his wicket. It is Yamin who has been caught short. Cheeky from Baz"
