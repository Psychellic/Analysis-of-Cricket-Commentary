"<B>trapped deep in the crease</b> and struck on the back leg as he goes back to this arm ball. Looks on first glance like that might have been sliding down leg. But Elgar shakes the head and won't even consider it. Does he feel a sense of justice in not reviewing? It's a very close call - but Elgar's right. On replay, we see that's hitting leg stump. Dilruwan has his foot behind this time and that man Elgar in his wickets tally. At last."

"full on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
"length outside off, blocked on the front foot"
<b>brave leave.</b> And a huge grin. Rabada expects this length ball to turn away as he puts in a picturesque leave. But it's come back with the arm ad perfectly avoided everything on its way to the keeper
"<b>is that it?</b> Yes it is! Maiden Test hundred for Theunis de Bruyn and you can bet it's been one of his most challenging knocks ever. Confidently gets down at this length ball on middle and paddles it very fine, keeping his eyes on it, keeping his shape, keeping his wits - everything he's done all innings long. Very impressive."
"yorker length, dead-batted"
"full on off stump, blocks into the pitch"
"length outside off, rips past the outside edge as he looks to defend"
"<b>five for Herath!</b> This is mastery. It's the work of a man who has 34 five wicket hauls. He has made South Africa's best batsman look like No. 11. What a ball this is. Pitching on the same spot as the previous one, maybe mariginally fuller. Seam pointed into the off side, but it's an arm ball. De Bruyn is looking to leave, but it's skidded into off stump. Takes the best to get the best. An angry roar from Herath as punches the air. This lion doesn't age."
"length on off stump, watchfully defended on the front foot"
"length on off stump, bat-pad into the off side, along the floor"
<b>taken at first slip.</b> The new ball is doing its job and the end is nigh. Length ball turning and climbing away from off. Rabada defends away from the body. Mathews takes an easy one to his left. Straightforward stuff.

"<b>pummelled.</b> Length ball outside off, spinning in sharply, so naturally you must hit it to deep midwicket. Swings and connects sweetly with the slog"
"<b>bring it on, says Steyn.</b> Herath slapped him over the midwicket earlier. He returns the favour by jumping down the track and slicing him into the boundary padding at long-off"
too good for Steyn. Rips past the outside edge as he looks to block
"length on off stump, dead-batted into the pitch"
"full on off stump, inside edge onto pad and into the turf. Herath enquires about the lbw, it's turned down by everyone around him"
"<b>Herath wins the duel</b>, Sri Lanka have the match and the series. Steyn jumps down the track and isn't to the pitch of this length ball. Looks to slog, gets it off the toe-end and it's high, straight over the bowler. Long-on gets under it and takes with a reverse cup"
