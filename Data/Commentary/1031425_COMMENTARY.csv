"dragged down slightly, Amla seizes on it, the line was adrift too and he swishes it away through backward square leg for four"
"oh, done him with the googly, but it runs away for four more! Fortune for Amla, who appeared to misread it as he prodded forward, nothing much Buttler could do as it flew to his left past the stumps"
comes across and pushes into the off side
"ooh, du Plessis gets in a tangle here, fending at the ball as it straightens off the deck and hits the splice"
"fuller, reaches for the drive, thick-edged down to third man for a single"

tossed up and pushed into the covers coming forwards... Good over from Rashid and he gets roundly clapped back to his position <del>where someone leans over the fence and gives him his flat cap and a pie</del>
"ooh, beaten, Amla dabbling at one wide of the stumps"
"now he nearly chips back to the bowler, maybe stopped on him a touch"
Plunkett is bowling cross-seam and it again jumps at Amla and he can't do anything with it
"touch back of a length, crashed through backward point, just one to the sweeper"
"tough on Plunkett but that's a wide as he goes leg side, du Plessis was advancing and then almost danced his feet out of the way as the bowler followed him"

"floated up and Amla is beaten in the flight, pushes uppishly into the covers, shouts of 'catch!' but it doesn't carry"
"Plunkett hits a length outside off, carved off the outside edge down to third man"
"too straight this time and that's a welcome boundary as Amla tickles it fine, that's four and a hard-fought fifty, at quicker than a run a ball"
"goes well across, attempting to glance and the ball ends up in Buttler's gloves... any inside edge? Tim Robinson doesn't think so. Thigh pad, says Ultra Edge"

pushed through and driven along the carpet this time for one more
flighted on off and Amla bows his head in monkish forward defence
"short of a length outside off, driven on the up through mid-off for one"
"length in the channel, 85mph and Amla drops back to glide one to third man"
"pitched up and draws him on to the front foot to drive, gets a thick outside edge through vacant gully for a single - that's the SA 100, too"
"dug in and this nips back to trouble Amla on the inside edge, takes it on the thigh pad"
"shortish in the corridor outside off stump, again dabbed calmly to third man"
full in the channel and lashed to the cover sweeper on one knee
"a googly, touch short, du Plessis plays back and drives to cover"

"turns into the front pad from outside off, a strangled appeal"
"not a million miles from the stumps as Amla traps down on a good length ball, squeezes between his legs"
"short of a length, eased to deep cover"
"that's the breakthrough! Big appeal for lbw as Amla misses a straight one as he gets well across his crease and England have gone for the <B>review</b>. Rod Tucker said not out. Struck around the knee roll. You could see leg stump behind him. No bat involved. Height the issue? No, it isn't, it's three reds! Smashing into middle and leg."

off the mark with a back-foot punch to deep cover
"full, at the stumps, nearly gets through but a thick inside runs towards long leg and the speed of this pair makes it into a second"

"on off stump, defended to the covers"

"short of a length, beats the top edge as he goes for a pull"
"fuller, angled in at off stump, punched to mid-on"

"and he resumes with a shocker, a long hop down the leg side and de Villiers swings it wide of short fine leg"
"on the stumps, full, driven to long-off"
"full at off stump, worked back to the bowler"

"full, eased to deep cover"
"picks out deep midwicket! Probably not bowled for and got, but it doesn't really matter. Dragged down short, Duminy had all the time in the world but plants it down Woakes' throat on the boundary"
"his greeted by a reverse dab sweep from de Villiers, goes fine of short third man...Rashid does very well to flick it back inside the rope. Takes a divot from the outfield"
"round the wicket, full at off stump, pushed into the off side"
tapped from outside off to midwicket
"on the back foot, pushed down to long-on"

"full at middle, defended"
"makes himself get forward, pushed to the covers"
"a touch shorter, this turns but Miller has time to adjust and places through the off side...nice over from Moeen"
"strikes first ball! Another giveaway. Short of a length, bit of a loosener really, Miller doesn't even try to keep it down and picks out deep midwicket - the one man in the deep on the leg side - with pinpoint precision"
"length ball in the channel outside off, dabbed down to third man"
"shortish and stabbed down towards gully, Morgan had put a man in to block that area but a diving stop can't prevent them running to get AB back on strike"

"short of a length, fourth/fifth stump, 85mph and jabbed towards point"
back of a length over the top of off and punched back to the bowler
floated up just outside off and pushed into the covers
"smashed down the ground, sheer brute force and it beats the dive of Stokes at long-on!"
"goes for the reverse-sweep, top-edged and Buttler takes a dolly! Mo gets Mo and the momentum is surely with England now... You could see what Morris was trying to do, taking the aggressive option against spin, but there was just a bit of grip and bounce and it popped up to the keeper"
"round the wicket, angled in and defended on the front foot"
"pushed a little straighter, into the pads as Parnell looks to work it away"

"short from Woakes and de Villiers brings out the driver to muller this out towards cow corner, the longest part of the ground and it bounces <i>just</i> short of the rope"
"goes again, this time skipping out and making room to crash a drive through the covers, gives the man on the ring no chance!"

"nicely bowled, tossed up outside off and spinning sharply to beat the outside edge"
gets across on off stump and defends
"tossed up, Parnell comes across and pokes uppishly into the covers"
"flighted, outside off and pushed down the ground for one"
"de Villiers steps out, looks to hit this out of the ground... but he's picked out deep midwicket! Moeen gets his man, de Villiers dies by the sword and Yorkshire can feel this one swinging their way"
darted flat on the stumps and Parnell works it towards mid-on. Moeen takes the spoils from that over
"pushed through, possibly the googly, beats the bat as Lucky goes back and swishes"
"tossed up on off, defended on the front foot"
"slips in the googly again and this raps the pads as Phehlukwayo plays across it... Not given by Rod Tucker but England decide to gamble on the <b>review</b>. No bat involved, so the question is whether it pitched outside leg - which it did, quite clearly on replay, so the not-out call stands"
""
"floated up and Phehlukwayo gets hold of this one, swiping a powerful sweep for four to deep backward square"
tossed up and this time he gets behind it solidly in defence
"timbaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Bowled him behind the legs attempting to sweep again, Phehlukwayo's average is chopped in half and England move to within two wickets of victory. Looked like the googly, fuller and spinning to clip the pad before rattling leg stump"
"<b>dropped!</b> Parnell swings for the fences, picks out Stokes at long-off... and he <b>completely goobers it!</b> Looked like he just lost his footing slightly as the ball dipped on him but it was a straightforward take for a man like Stokes"
turned into the leg side

"tossed up on off stump, Rabada leans forward in defence"
flatter and tucked off the pads for one more through midwicket
"floated up and he tempts Parnell into trying to clear the boundary ropes again, not a great connection and this one bounces short of Plunkett at long-off, who does well to stop it with his legs"
pushed through and Rabada misses with a cut
"darted on off stump, nicely played by Parnell, down early for the reverse-sweep, which he gets away fine for four"
"drops back and cuts one in front of square... Buttler had dislodged the bails, which caused a moment's intrigue before he tidied up his own mess"
angled in with the arm and worked away for one more to  leg
"flat outside off, Parnell opens the face to steer in front of square"
"tossed up and Rabada gets under it, <i>just</i> manages to clear the bowler! Earns him a single to long-off"
"touch short, goes back and whirls a pull away through midwicket"
"goes full and straight, Parnell swings it down the ground, off the toe of the bat for one to long-off"
"short ball, Rabada plays it nearly off the back foot into the on side for one"
"cutter from Plunkett, short of a length and Parnell swings and misses"
"dug in short and this is top-edged up and over his shoulder, not quite as much hang time on this as de Kock's dismissal and Buttler can't get there"
"length ball, Parnell opens up his stance and hits cleanly on the up over mid-off, bounces away for four"
"full, around leg stump, hits the pads as he flicks across the line"
"now Rabada hits his straps, gets down on one knee and carts four over midwicket, into the untended acres"
turned off the stumps for one more
swings hard and gets a thick inside edge behind square on the leg side
"flat on off, Rabada gets his head into line and defends"
"tossed up, in the slot, clears the front leg... and smeared into the crowd at long-off! Rabada clearly knows where the boundary is, showcasing a capable David Miller impression, there"
"tossed up on the stumps, flicked away with a turn of the wrists through square leg for one more"
"length on the stumps, blocked back to the bowler"
"Rabada swings across the line, mishits into the off side and he sets off before Parnell tells him not to be daft... then a direct hit at the non-striker's end gives them a run anyway, as Parnell had his bat safely grounded"
"angled across, shortish, pulled into the ground"
"bumper from Woakes, swings hard again, top-edged...and taken this time! Simple catch for Wood at mid-off and England are one wicket away from an impressive win"
"another shortish ball, gets across his stumps, defended"
"cutter wide of the stumps, Rabada chases it, gets a big snick and Buttler finishes the job! A tidy four-for from Woakes and <b>England have mopped up a 72-run win</b> at Headingley to go 1-0 up in the three-match series"
