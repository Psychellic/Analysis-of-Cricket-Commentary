"on a length, and nicely straight from Amir to start. Just a hint of shape into Akmal, who prods forward to drive to mid off"
"just short of a good length, but the line is straight once again and Akmal turns the ball into the leg side"
"there's half an appeal as Amir pings the front pad, but it's pitched well outside leg and they pinch a leg bye as the ball rolls away"
"Imam has a little fiddle at one that leaves him off the deck, but can't put bat to ball"
"Imam taps a full one towards mid on and sets off, but Akmal just turns around and walks back to the non-striker's end. Didn't want any part of that quick single. It would have been tight, but not <i>that</i> tight"
"again Imam works into the leg side, but this time he finds the small gap between mid on and midwicket so the single is on, and he's off the mark"
"he trundles in and delivers a back of a length delivery that's just a little too straight, Imam glancing off the hip for one"
"Akmal stands tall and tries to force the ball through the cover field, but he can't find a gap. Or much timing, to be honest"
"<b>bowled him!</b> Akmal didn't know too much about this one. The ball pitched on a fifth stump line and jagged in off the seam, beating a lazy push and hurtling through the gate to shatter the stumps. Early strike for KK!"
and he's off the mark straight away with a little tuck into the leg side
<b>Imam steps out to monster the ball over wide long on!</b> He took a couple of steps down and then just swung through the line at a length ball. Straight out of the middle
"good batting, Imam turning the strike over with a quick single to mid off after the big hit"
"straight, and very full, Imam digging it out back to the bowler"
"floated up full, Amir searching for whatever early swing there might be, and Imam flicks off his legs for a single"
"whoops, this one slips down the leg side"
"Amin is forward to drive, but Amir gets a hand to it and mid off cleans up"
"Amin taps to mid off and sets off ... Imad charging in from that position and hurling in a shy that goes wide. Had it hit, that was out"
"tapped to cover, on the drive, and no daring single this time"
"Amir belts out an appeal as the ball slaps into Imam's front pad, but it's clearly slipping down the leg side, and they pinch a single too"
and Imam greets his introduction by <b>dancing down and scooping a drive up and over point</b> for four
"straight and on a length from Shinwari, it's turned to midwicket but straight at the fielder"
"Imam pushes a full one back at the bowler, who can't stop it in his follow through, and they take another quick single"
"pushed to mid off, and there's no space for a single"
"Shinwari bends his back and attacks the stumps with a full, quick one, Amin pressing it to point"
"a cracking drive is intercepted by Imad at mid off, but he can't stop the single"
"Amin sets himself for a pick-up into the leg side, but the ball is through him in a flash, ricocheting off the pad. Skiddy stuff"
"much fuller this time, and all Amin can do is dig it out"
"full again, but this time Amin manages to find some space on the leg side for a quick single"
"Yamin sticks to that very full length, and Imam picks him off his toes for a single through square leg"
"Amin spots a length delivery and clubs it into the leg side, but there's cover in the deep"
"pushed through the off side field, off the front foot, and one more to the total"
"Imam tries to manufacture a little room, but Shinwari follows him and the most he can do is push a quick single into the covers"
"<b>straight back over the bowler's head!</b> Shinwari pitched this one a little too full, and Amin spotted the length early, sending it back from whence it came with a full flow of the bat"
"Shinwari aims even more full this time, and he's dug out to mid on"
"flung down the leg side, and the umpire calls it a wide"
"no fine leg, and Shinwari offers up a gift on Imam's legs. All he has to do is get some bat on it and beat the man at short fine, and he does"
"fired full, fast and straight, and Imam works a single into the leg side"
"Shinwari targets the stumps, but Amin nudges him to midwicket for another quick single"
Amin threads a drive through the covers for a single
"full and drifting across the left hander, who drives it back down the ground, where the bowler dives to stop it in his follow through"
"<b>cut through backward point!</b> Imam backed right away to leg, making room, and then placed his cut just so to beat the field. Nice touch"
"Imam steps forward and works into the leg side, against the drift"
"chipped in the air - purposefully it seems - up and over cover, and they're back for a second"
Amin flicks a single through mid on to keep the strike
"floated up on the breeze, nice and full, and Amin can only get it back to the bowler"
"<b>Raza is the bowler with a golden arm!</b> He comes on and strikes second ball with a wonderful piece of bowling. He gave it some air, hanging the ball in the fresh evening breeze, even as Amin danced out to attack. But he was done in the flight, and Rizwan did the rest."
"Raza lopes in, his action all energy and twirling arms, and he finds a bit of purchase off the strip to fizz the ball in to Madsen and test his defence"
"floated up outside off, and a drive is stopped at cover"
"<b>two in the over!</b> Raza is all over them. This was the classic offspinner's dismissal. He beat Madsen with flight, he beat him with spin, he beat him with guile. The length and the drift away drew him into an injudicious drive, the dip and spin took the ball back into the stumps."
"flighted once again, and spinning in off a length. Pollard is rooted in the crease as he pokes half forward to defend"
"the orthodox left-arm spinner from Imad, and Imam plays with the spin into the leg side"
"speared in flat and fast by Imad, and Pollard is hit on the pad as he rushes out at the ball. There's an appeal, but the umpire says no, and they don't ask for a review"
"<b>bowled him!</b> Pollard plays for spin where there is none, the ball drifting in, kissing the pad, and smashing into the stumps"
""
""
"Imam places a full ball through point, and the call is for a two immediately. They hustle, and they make it back"
"Raza finds an excellent length, and Dawson can only work it to midwicket. Still not a run off Raza"
"and another dot, this is excellent bowling. Dawson waits on a late cut, but it goes straight to short third man"
"finally a run off Raza as he floats one up full and wide, and Dawson drives out to the cover sweeper"
"<b>big appeal!</b> Raza came round the stumps and got one to rush on with the arm, beating the inside edge of Imam's defensive push and striking him on the pad. This looked good. Plumb, in fact. But Imad doesn't ask for the review. That looked dead in front"
"flicked into the leg side, this time he puts bat to ball"
"just the single, Dawson cutting into the deep"
"worked with the drift, down to long on"
flicked off the pads and into the leg side
"miserly stuff from Imad, targeting the stumps as Dawson presses forward"
"flighted up a little slower, and it's clipped to midwicket"
"nudged into the leg side, but he can't find the gap"
"Imad gives this one a little more air, and Dawson manages a drive down to long off"
"Dawson aims a hack into the leg side, but it's not there to hit and there's a sweeper at deep midwicket"
Imam waits and waits and then dabs a late cut down behind square
"first boundary after a five over drought for Zalmi, and this one from Raza was flighted just a little too full outside off, Dawson lacing a square drive through the field"
"much less air on this one, and Dawson works it to midwicket"
"landing on middle and spinning down the leg side, Dawson helping it on its way for a single"
"floated up on the toes, and Imam finds a single to long on"
"Imam skips down the track, but Imad spots him and adjusts his length, cramping him for room"
"quick through the air, and plenty of drift too, and they pinch a single off the pad as Dawson misses his flick"
Imam slices a cut down through backward point
"Dawson bends low into a sweep, and he finds some timing but can't place it past the deep midwicket fielder"
"eased down to long on, one more to the total"
"Dawson plays with the drift, tapping the ball to midwicket, and he's called through for a quick single. That could have been tight, had the fielder collected the ball cleanly"
"<b>too short and Dawson clubs it over midwicket!</b> Dawson picked the length early, but he got a little more height than distance, and the ball went <i>just</i> over a diving Liam Livingstone on the boundary rope"
"swiped into the leg side, but there's cover in the deep"
"Imam dances out and Raza spots him coming, firing the ball down very wide of off, but Imam puts bat to ball and they hustle back for a second as the ball rolls through point"
"flighted up outside off, and Imam is almost done in the flight as he bends to sweep, but he finds the gap for a single"
"Raza comes around the wicket, firing in a quicker one that slips out as a low full toss, Dawson clipping two through midwicket"
"Raza belts out an appeal as he gets his last ball to kiss Dawson's pad from around the stumps, but it's not given and, again, no review"
"Dawson lets his bottom hand do the work, getting a full ball down to long on for one"
"very full, right at off stump, and Imam digs it out to cover"
"slower one from Yamin, a little offcutter, and it's chopped into the off side. <b>There is some dew forming on the outfield</b>"
Imam comes forward and drives to long off to turn the strike back over
"flung down full and very wide outside off, and Dawson slashes his drive through point"
"<b>full toss, outside off, and Dawson clubs it through the covers!</b> He's into the 30s now, and there seems to be some momentum building in his innings"
"Imam steps down the track and biffs a confident drive up and over the covers! <b>That brings up the fifty partnership, as well as the team 100</b>"
"<b>fifty for Imam</b>, his first in the PSL, and he gets there with a flick off his toes through square leg"
"cheeky stuff! Dawson taps the ball towards gully and they steal a quick single, but the fielder throws down the stumps at the non-striker's end, and they pinch another run off the ricochet!"
"full and straight, Dawson turning the strike over with a drive to long on"
"Shinwari angles a full one in towards Imam's pads, and he's worked out to long leg for one"
"well bowled, very full and right at the stumps, and Dawson can only dig it out"
"<b>clubbed through the covers!</b> Amir comes back, and his first ball is on a length and wide of off. Dawson waited in the crease and picked his spot"
"Amir slips a full, wide yorker under Dawson's flailing bat. Well bowled"
"<b>lucky!</b> Amir sends down an excellent delivery, a dipping yorker right on middle, but Dawson manages to get some bat on it somehow, inside-edging the ball past his stumps and down to the fine leg boundary"
"Dawson clears his left leg, but he can't find the connection he wants and it's just a single to cover"
"<b>he's hit him!</b> Amir bends his back on a 135km/h bouncer, which isn't the quickest but Imam seemed to be taken by surprise by the bouncer. He tried to take it on, but the ball hit is shoulder and bounced down to third man. Ouch!"
"Imam backs away and Amir follows him, but a little too closely as the ball goes down the leg side"
"<b>hammered through cover point!</b> Again Imam backed away to leg to open up the off side field, but this time Amir didn't follow him with the ball. He hit the cover off that one, and that's <b>18 off the over!</b>"
"<b>Shinwari strikes!</b> Dawson was looking pretty good out there, but Shinwari has hurried him with a rising length delivery. Dawson set himself to hit over the leg side field, but he sliced a little underneath the shot to send the ball sailing up into the night sky. Shinwari was waiting for it when it came back down, completing the dismissal himself"
"Shinwari directs a pinpoint yorker in at Imam's middle stump, but he jabs the bat down on it and finds a single to point"
"<b>and he's off the mark with a boundary!</b> That's one way to do it. Sammy doesn't move his feet an inch, but he brings the bat down on a short, wide one just right to find the third man boundary with a late cut"
"pushed well down the leg side, and called wide"
"that is a fantastic yorker! Sammy has done well just to lay bat on this one, which seared in through the air right at his toes. Somehow he gets his bat to it, protecting the stumps, and they steal a quick single to boot"
"<b>bowled him!</b> Shinwari has his second of the over. Imam has smoked a couple tonight, but he's relied on his touch and proper cricket shots. This was anything but, as he backed away, cleared his leg, and (possibly) shut his eyes as he swung wildly across the line. There could be only one result from that, and the stumps were shattered by a full one from Shinwari. Vital strike at this stage"
"Shinwari greets Wahab Riaz with another yorker, and this one is dug out to point"
"Sammy chips a full toss up and over the covers, but some excellent fielding at the boundary saves runs"
"shorter, the ball hitting Sammy on the thigh pad as he tries to shovel into the leg side"
"<b>what's happened here?</b> Wahab chips the ball in the air and out to deep midwicket, where Raza (who else?) charges in from the ropes and times his dive just right to pluck the ball from the air inches from the turf. The third umpire asks to have another look, and then accidentally presses the 'not out' button after replays show the catch was clean. He quickly corrects his mistake, and Riaz can see the funny side as he trudges off"
"Sammy swings his bat like a battle axe, but he can't quite time it and it's just a single to long on"
"Hasan chops down on a full one, the ball bouncing through to the keeper"
"yorker to finish, and it's dug out to deep midwicket"
"Yamin aims for the yorker, Hasan flings his hands through a drive and the ball squirts down to third man"
"<b>there's some power!</b> This wasn't even that well hit by Sammy, but such is his power that the ball bounces away to midwicket and has the beating of a diving fielder there. Sammy has rolled his ankle setting off after the shot, but he's good to continue"
"<b>they're having a look for a run out!</b> Sammy's drive to a full one rocketed back and smashed the stumps at the non-striker's end. Hasan wanted a single, but Sammy sent him back, even as Yamin gathered the ball and charged back. As the stumps had already been broken, he had to pull one of the stumps clean out of the ground to effect the run out, and he does so with Hasan marginally short"
"an attempted yorker slips out as a low full toss, and Sammy <b>scythes a drive through backward point</b>. Fiercely struck!"
"slammed down the ground, but Raza makes excellent ground from wide long on and then pulls off a slick diving stop to save two runs"
"<b>a six to finish the innings!</b> Sammy does it with a flourish. The ball was a low full toss, and he met it with a lumberjack-style swing of the blade. He knew how well he hit it, and started walking off even while the ball was still in the air"
"<b>Hasan strikes first ball!</b> It was full, it nipped in off the track, and Livingstone's feet were stuck in cement. The ball struck him right in front of middle, and that's just the start Peshawar Zalmi would have wanted"
"<b>beaten on the outside edge!</b> Dunk pokes at one that is angled across him, and hits fresh air"
"skidding across him, on a length, and Dunk taps it to point"
"<b>beaten again!</b> Hasan shoots another one across Dunk's bows, and a big drive brings a play and a miss"
"a touch too straight this time, and he's off the mark with a glance to leg"
smell that! Hasan steams in and bangs in a bristling bouncer. Babar sways out of the way to let it through
"phew! Not sure Dunk had his eyes open for this one. He steps down the track and aims a mighty heave at Umaid's first ball, the delivery rising up and past his outside edge"
"fuller this time, and straighter, and it's another dot as Dunk taps softly to leg"
"well, when Dunk <i>does</i> hit them, he looks really good. The important thing is he didn't just try to wallop this one, he set himself at the crease and then let the right hand lead the shot to chip the ball firmly over mid off without losing his shape"
"whoops, normal service resumes as Dunk stands at the crease and is <b>beaten</b> outside off once again"
"Umaid is hitting an excellent line and length to the left hander, and Dunk goes fishing outside off to be <b>beaten yet again</b>"
"on a length and aimed at off stump, Dunk laying bat to ball to find a quick single to mid off"
"Hasan hustles Dunk with a skiddy length, the ball bouncing off the pad into the leg side as they steal a quick single"
Babar hops at the crease and guides a single to third man
"<b>through the fielder at short fine leg</b>. Hasan tried for a yorker, and Dunk got bat to it to send the ball towards short fine leg, where the fielder tumbled over it late to let it through"
"chopped down to third man, just the one"
a full delivery bounces off the inner half of the bat with a woody sound and rolls to mid on. Nowhere near the middle
"<b>this is magical from Hasan Ali!</b> Athleticism, match awareness, and accuracy with the throw. Babar was beaten by one that nipped in, and set off to try and steal a single as Hasan appealed for an lbw. But Dunk didn't want the single, and by the time Babar turned back, Hasan was sprinting after the ball, picking it up and throwing down the stumps in one fluid motion"
"flicked off his legs, and out through square leg"
""
"finally, Dunk edges one! He'd been beaten quite a few times tonight already. Riaz sprints in and offers width outside off, Dunk throwing his bat out at it, only to feather an edge"
""
"<b>Colin Ingram has been hit on the head, this is not looking good.</b> The ball was a swift bouncer, and he turned his head as the ball rose up at him to be struck on the side of the helmet, right by his ear. As Riaz walks up to him with a look of concern, Ingram's legs wobbled and he lost his balance. He looks groggy, and the physio sprints out ... Ingram eventually settles, and he's drinking some water, but surely he'll have to go off. <b>Well, no, he's going to bat on.</b>"
"<b>edged down to third man</b>. Wahab goes full and wide, and Ingram edges his drive down to third man"
"Umaid hustles Raza with one that nips in off the seam, <b>does this hit pad first?</b> They briefly consider a review, and replays show it was pad first, but looks to be outside off. Would have been a tight call, either way - Umpire's call on the point of impact"
"on a length, and Raza is forward to push to point"
"more length from Umaid, and Raza responds watchfully"
"<b>spanked back over his head!</b> Too full from Umaid, and Raza lifts it cleanly back over him with a sweet drive"
"a touch of extra bounce for Umaid, outside off, but it's easily negotiated by Raza"
"hmm, looks like there could be some inconsistent bounce in this track. After the last delivery, this one keeps a touch low and Raza has to add a little extra bend to his knee as he rushes to defend"
"just short of a good length, outside off, and Ingram is <b>beaten on the outside edge</b>"
"<b>timing from Ingram!</b> Well, he's still seeing the ball alright, hopping into a firm backfoot punch that sends the ball scorching through point"
"hits one, misses one. Riaz hits a length, outside off, and Ingram is flat-footed and <b>beaten on the outside edge</b>"
tapped softly to point this time
"<b>punished through extra cover!</b> Flair from Ingram too, as he flays a full ball through cover off the back foot, Caribbean style"
"and he <b>misses the next one!</b> Riaz fires this one in straighter, and the ball rushes under Ingram's pull - but over the stumps"
"Raza steps out to his first ball, and he's not to the pitch but plays for the turn and cracks a brace through cover"
"and this one rushes on straight with the arm, but Raza jabs down on it just in time to find a single through point"
"a little short and wide, but Ingram is too early into the shot and taps it back to the bowler"
"legbreak, and it's turned into the leg side for a hard-run two"
<b>too short</b> and Ingram muscles a pull through the leg side field
"tapped wide of mid off, and Ingram keeps the strike"
tapped softly into the leg side for an ambled single
"<b>direct hit at the non-striker's end!</b> Raza tapped a full ball just to the left of Imam, at a straight midwicket. Ingram wandered out, looking for a single, and he was sent back, but the throw was fast and right on target to find him well short"
Raza finds a single with a glide to third man
Imad angles his blade to find the point fielder
"straighter this time from Pollard, and Imad nudges a single through square leg to get off the mark"
"<b>was this a drop?</b> It's Madsen at point. Raza backed away and rifled a cut shot very hard, the ball dipping as it reached the fielder, and popping out"
"Raza is taken surprise by some purchase, and taps it back to the bowler"
"very straight, again, and Raza can only get it back to the bowler"
"some turn, outside off, and Raza mistimes the cut"
"<b>huge appeal from Dawson!</b> This was the arm ball, and it beat Raza's short arm pull. It's given! Will he review it? He didn't ask for one earlier, when he could have had a wicket, and he's got his captain at the other end again. Will he take one now? He does! And it's a good one, the ball clearly headed down the leg side."
Raza stays deep in the crease and turns the strike over with a punch through cover
Imad collects a single with a wristy flick through midwicket
"slow bouncer from Pollard, and Imad crunches a pull down to long on"
"Raza walks out and slams a drive at mid off, where the ball spills through the fielder's hands to allow a single, <b>bringing up the team fifty</b>"
"Imad waits and waits to cut, but he can't thread the gap between point and short third man"
"<b>almost a run out!</b> Raza clubs a slow bouncer in the air, but well short of deep square leg. He wants a second run. but Imad sends him back - late. There's a shy at the stumps, but it goes wide"
Imad guides another single through gully
"Raza has a huge heave, but the ball takes the inside edge and rolls to short fine leg"
"floated up outside off, and the best Imad can do is a single to long off"
"Raza chops a cut and wants a single, but he can't find one. There's some indecision yet again in whether to take the single. Pressure"
and the pressure builds a little more as Raza taps a full one back at Dawson
"Dawson gives Raza nothing to hit with a full, drifting arm ball that he can only defend"
another dot as a shot goes nowhere
"<b>missed stumping!</b> In desperation, Raza charges out but runs past the ball, but Kamran Akmal can't take it cleanly and the stumping is missed. Ah, and they sneak a run"
"<b>finally, the pressure tells!</b> Raza had to do something. Umaid bustles in and delivers a full, straight one as he backs away and has a hit. But he misses, and the ball hits his stumps"
Rizwan is off the mark straight away with a drive to long on
"<b>big appeal</b> as Umaid hits the pad with a full one, but it's pitched outside leg and the umpire says no"
"a chopped cut bounces through to Akmal behind the stumps, another dot"
"this will help a little! Imad leans into a crunching drive as Umaid dishes up a half volley outside off, and he finds the gap"
<b>beaten outside off</b> as this one keeps a little low
"nice shot from Rizwan, coming down the track and <b>driving inside out</b> over cover to find a vital boundary"
"full, straight, and it's tapped back to the bowler"
"<b>through Sammy's hands at extra cover!</b> Rizwan comes out to play another lofted drive, but he can't get the height he wants. He does hit it very hard though, and Sammy leaps but can only parry at extra cover"
an arm ball rushes him and takes the inside edge down to fine leg
Imad stays deep in the crease to work a single through square leg
"tapped through mid on, but it's just one more and <b>the required run rate leaps up to 12.14</b>"
"Rizwan bends to sweep Pollard out to long leg, where the fielder fumbles to let them back for a second"
"nice placement, and very hard running, brings two runs. Rizwan tapped the ball into space at midwicket, and calls immediately for the second run"
this time it's just the single as Rizwan hits in the same direction but much more firmly out to the boundary sweeper
"big swing from Imad, but he toe-ends the ball and it goes nowhere"
"slugged down to long off, just the one"
"Rizwan makes some room with third man up inside the circle, but he aims his late cut straight at the fielder"
a rising delivery on middle stump is whipped down to fine leg
"ouch! Hasan rushes a fast, seaming delivery in to Rizwan, who swings right across it but misses the ball and is struck in the stomach"
"Rizwan comes down the track, but he can't find any timing as he drives to long on"
"Imad slaps a drive out to wide long on, just the one"
this one slips down the leg side and it's called wide
Rizwan backs away and pings the cover fielder with a drive
"Rizwan fakes a back-away to leg, and then walks into a drive, but the attempted innovation brings only a single"
"Rizwan hops and chops a cut, but again he can only get as far as the cover sweeper"
"Imad looks for a big hit down the ground, but the bat makes an awful hollow sound as he hits the shot. This pitch has slowed up and negated any thoughts of big hitting"
"short, and it's pulled out to deep square"
"cracked through cover, and they push for a hard-run two. Could have been close, if the throw from the deep was more accurate"
"Imad slaps one hard off the back foot, but Andre Fletcher runs around and keeps them to two"
"Imad swings hard, but it's just another single down to long on"
wristed out to wide long on
"pushed out through cover, another single"
"Imad clears his front leg and slaps the ball straight, baseball style, but with precious little timing, and a diving Riaz at mid off keeps them to one"
"<b>finally the boundary drought is broken!</b> Rizwan lets his bottom hand do the work, clubbing a full ball out to the midwicket boundary, and finding the gap"
"Rizwan looks to attack the cover boundary, but his drive sends the ball out to deep cover, on the bounce"
"another drive, and once again Wahab Riaz skips across to stop it at deep mid off and keep them to one"
"Riaz bends his back to get the ball rising outside off, and Imad's uppercut can only get as far as the cover sweeper"
"Rizwan chops a cut, unerringly picking out the fielder at point once more"
"a flashy cut from Imad, but he's hanging his head as he trots through for a single, looking as though he missed out on that one. And the single <b>brings up the team hundred</b>"
"Riaz comes around the stumps, and Rizwan swipes a pull out to the deep square fielder"
"Imad clears his leg and swings across it, the ball squirting off the inner half of the bat and out to midwicket"
"Rizwan slices his cut, and picks out the sweeper"
"Hasan bustles in to begin his final over, Rizwan clubbing the ball out to the fielder in the deep at midwicket"

"full, and dug out back to the bowler, who parries to mid on. A stinging blow to a taped hand"
"<b>brilliant catch in the outfield!</b> Yamin falls for a golden duck. He looked to chip his first ball, which was full and aimed at the pads, over square leg, but Dawson ran in from that position and timed his dive just right to catch the ball inches from the turf"
"very full and quite wide, and Rizwan digs it out through point"
"<b>and another!</b> Hasan has his fourth, with the final ball of his spell. Amir aims for the bleachers, but gets a terrible connection on his shot and can get it only as far as mid off"
""
"<b>caught in the deep</b> and they're folding now. Pitched up by Pollard, and Umer Khan slogs it straight out to Hasan Ali"
"very slow slower ball from Pollard, Shinwari missing it to be struck on the pad - but it's headed down leg"
"the follow-up is a shorter, quicker one, and Shinwari swings wildly at fresh air"
"another swing across the line, but this time he puts bat to ball to find a single to square leg"
pulled out for a single to end the game - <b>and this is the first time in PSL history that an entire innings has gone by without a six being hit</b>
