"floats it quicker and fuller on middle, Smith gets forward and defends"
"slides one into middle and leg, tucked to midwicket. McCullum was halfway down the pitch when he was sent back. No damage done"
"too short, and punished! Not much spin for Nadeem who fires it down leg side, Smith helps it past short fine leg. Easily done"
gets half-forward and deflects it with the angle to square leg
"bit of grip this time as he lands it at length on middle, flicked uppishly wide of midwicket"
"did that miss the stumps? Umpire Chris Gaffaney says Brendon McCullum got an inside edge. This one skid back in from wide of the crease, McCullum missed as he played all around it. Everyone went up in a spontaneous appeal. Looked really close to the naked eye. <b> Didn't look like there was an inside edge there. </b> Lucky break"
"starts off with a buffet ball on the pads, and Smith flicks the half-volley past midwicket. Super timing on that one"
"back of length delivery angling into middle, Smith punches it to mid-on"
gets onto the backfoot and pushes it to cover
"slower and fuller outside off, and he's thumped that past Zaheer, who puts in a gingerly dive at mid-off. Clean strike that. Can't err in length, he'll put those away nine times out of ten"
"misses the flick off another half-volley, the ball rolls to square leg off the deflection"
defends the incoming delivery on middle with a straight bat
"back of length delivery on middle and leg, worked behind square leg"
"there's protection at sweeper cover for the drive. Too full, driven through the line to Nadeem"
"gets a bit of lift off the deck on middle, Smith gets back into the crease and bunts it to short midwicket"
"strong off his hips, worked behind square leg for an easy single again"
"and the wily old fox has done it, this time with a cutter. McCullum doesn't turn up at the party. Looks to pull, but it wasn't short enough, and the only connection he made was with the dry, hot Rajkot air as the ball hits the top of off stump. The customary roar of 'come onnnnn' from Zak as he sends back the danger man. Dream start for the Daredevils"
"overbalanced a touch as he looks to work it behind square, is hit high on the thigh pad"
"and he strikes immediately! This one was short and sliding back into middle, Smith punches it down the ground, almost as if he forgot there was a man at long-on. Chris Morris didn't have to move much there as he pouches it easily. Double blow for the Lions. Looked like he wanted to play it a lot straighter, ended up dragging it as well."
"slips out of the hand as he looks to bowl another quicker one, Finch tried to reach out to play that past square, missed it"
"slips it down leg, Finch tickles it to short fine leg to get off the mark"
hops back into the crease and punches it to long-on
"slower through the air this time, lands it on middle, played back to the bowler"
makes a bit of room and plays the slap-pull with a horizontal bat past mid-on. Muscular blow that
"two in the over for Nadeem, and there's a hush around the SCA Stadium. This one was nicely tossed up by Nadeem, Finch was looking to slog sweep across the line, and only managed to top edge it to Rishabh Pant at short fine leg. Disastrous start for the Lions. It's Daredevils who are roaring at the moment"
"plays a wristy flick wide of midwicket, Raina fetched the length ball from off stump on that occasion"
"yorker-length delivery outside off, squeezed to Billings who fires a quick throw at the bowler's end from point, <b> DK would have been walking back without facing a ball had that hit </b>"
"walks across the stumps and whips it past the leg-gully fielder. Once again, Raina looked a little awkward as he looked to play that short ball."
"rip roaring bouncer on middle from wide of the crease, that was bowled at close to 140 kph, DK sways out of the way easily"
"hustled for pace again as he plays that short ball off the backfoot, raps him near the glove"
"incoming length ball on middle, he hops back and taps it towards a short square leg fielder. Top over"
"uppish, but no damage done. Length ball on middle, Raina makes room to go over cover, but didn't get the elevation, just short of cover point"
"another short ball, this time Raina makes room to hit it over the slip cordon. He was expecting the short one and got enough bat on it to clear the third man boundary."
"appeal for lbw as he hops across to work it to the leg side, he was hit high on the pad. The ball pitched outside leg as well, they get a leg bye off the deflection to cover"
skids onto DK's bat as he gets forward and bunts it back down the ground
gets across a touch and works the incoming delivery to mid-on
worked wide of midwicket for a quick single
"starts off with a lovely in-drifter. Nicely tossed up, Karthik gets a thick inside edge off the push towards short midwicket"
"trifle short on middle and leg, punched with the spin to deep midwicket"
"this one's full and a slider on middle, DK gets forward and defends that with soft hands"
"gives it a lot of air again and lands it on off stump, DK lunges forward to defend with the spin"
gets to the pitch of the ball and works it to long-off
swift work by Shami at short third man to keep that dab off a short ball to a single
"big appeal for caught behind. Raina was clearly playing for a short ball, but this one was full on leg stump. He looks to tickle it fine but the ball clipped the pad on the way through to Quinton de Kock. Poor call from the umpire"
hops across the stumps to the length ball on middle and works it to Billings at deep midwicket
"welcome boundary, and an important one for the Lions. Fine leg was square, but there was still a lot of risk involved. DK walks across the stumps and ramps the full ball outside off into the fine leg boundary. Great when it comes off"
goes back deep into the crease and angles his bat to ease it behind point
"in control of the pull this time as he plays that into the deep square leg boundary. This time, there was a conscious effort to get on top of the bounce to keep the ball down. The timing was outstanding. Billings had no chance. Excellent execution on that occasion"
"Billings is kept busy, this one's flicked to deep midwicket"
"hops back to ride the bounce, but can't get bat on it. The ball deflects off the thigh pad to fine leg"
"doesn't get to the pitch of the ball as he looks to drive, chops it wide of cover"
"swept with the spin, but straight to Zaheer at short fine leg"
"the googly this time, but it was a touch short, eased towards Nadeem who dives to stop the ball at point"
"punched wide of the bowler to Karun Nair, at long on"
works that one off the backfoot to long-on
"nice flick of the wrists to work it towards deep midwicket, Billings charges in from the boundary to keep it down to a single"
"starts off with a full ball, Karthik slog sweeps it on the full towards deep square leg, Mishra covers a lot of ground from deep midwicket and then tries to flick it back to Morris, who was coming towards the ball from long-on, makes a bit of mess but ensures he wasn't in contact with the ropes when his hands touched the ball. All this to save one run"
eased towards the vacant square leg region
"makes a bit of room and works it wide of the man running in from deep midwicket, DK was off the blocks for the second much before Raina completed the first run there"
punched back to Duminy who moves swiftly to his left to stop that
"sliding into the pads, worked wide of Nadeem at short fine leg"
"short and he's slapped that over the infield, Billings is in business at deep cover"
"steps out, gets to the pitch of the ball and works it to deep midwicket"
"sensible cricket, steps out and chips it over the bowler's head, long-off had some work to do. DK knew what he was doing there"
"fired in full on middle, flicked with the angle towards wide long-on"
"dances down the track, takes it on the full and flat-bats it into the long-off boundary. Excellent use of the feet"
makes room and drives it with the spin to deep cover
"beautifully done, what a comeback by Mishra. Even Dravid, who generally remains very serious in the dugout, applauds. Raina steps out, Mishra sees that and slides it across him, only to miss the ball completely as de Kock effects a regular stumping. Touch-and-go with the no-ball there for Mishra, he was saved by a millimeter or two there. Wicket against the run of play for Gujarat Lions. <b> Third umpire took a long hard look to see if de  Kock's gloves were in front of the stumps when he collected the ball. </b> Clearly, that wasn't the case here. Raina takes ages to start moving, but he has to go. <b> Raina falls for his fifth 20s score this season </b>"
"worked into the gap at deep cover, back for two quite easily"
"cramped for room, he hops back and dabs it with soft hands to the off side"
"the slowness of the surface coming through in that delivery, it was short and sliding down leg, DK was through with the pull even before the ball got to him. Is hit high on the thigh pad. <b> Zak has a few words to say to him </b>"
"sees him coming and floats a yorker-length delivery on middle, flicked into the gap at deep midwicket. 'oooohs and aaaaas' from Zak. Is he trying to set him up here? Never know with Zak"
the superbly executed knuckle ball that he made famous by bowling it to Mike Hussey in the World Cup quarter-final. It stops on Jadeja who defends it to midwicket. DK was strolling down the pitch and had to make a desperate dive to get back in. A direct hit at the non-striker's end from midwicket and he would have been gone
"eased towards deep midwicket, Billing comes around quickly"
gets to the pitch of the ball and eases it to long-on
"slides past the outside edge from around the wicket, not there for the drive, the ball dipped on him and went past the outside edge"
"wow, he's in sublime touch. It was short, he made room and crunched it in front of square. Super placement"
gets a good stride forward and pats it with soft hands
steps out and drives it straight to cover
nurdled with the spin to square leg
"he's in great touch. Zaheer errs in length. Too short and sliding down leg, DK takes him on and pulls him imperiously between deep square and fine leg."
gets forward and bunts it back down the pitch
"sees the batsman give him the charge and spears it full and wide, Karthik reaches out for it and squeezes it down to third man"
"looks to force it past cover, not much room to work with, played back down the pitch"
"another knuckle ball, Jadeja is authoritative in his footwork as he defends to cover"
off-cutter which he eases to point
"flicked into the gap at deep midwicket, two was the call immediately after he made contact. Well-executed, got inside the line and eased it away"
dabbed wide of the keeper for an easy single
"slower one on middle, defended to the fielder coming in from point"
"pulled, and he's picked the bones out of that one. No one at deep midwicket and he picked the length early to play it in front of square"
"the short ball hurries onto him as Jadeja looks to turn it square on the leg side, lobs back towards Shami's left"
"beaten by the off-cutter, kept low as well as the ball scoots low to de Kock"
"steps out and lofts it with the infield over cover, Billings runs around from the deep to keep that down to two"
"swept really well, but Sanju Samson does well at deep square leg"
punched over the non-striker's head to long-on
"that's a crunching cover drive that beats the diving Rishabh Pant at long-off. Fast hands, quick feet and boom! He got to the pitch and drilled it into the gap. He called 'two, two, two' the moment he hit it, perhaps didn't realise how well he played that. Top shot."
"squeezed towards Duminy, who has to run in a fair bit from deep square leg. Two easy despite Jadeja slipping on the turn. One short, says umpire Chris Gaffaney. Hawk-eyes, I tell you"
"drilled back to the bowler, who half-stops it, the deflection rolls to mid-on"
"the mishit has barely made it past the 30-yard circle, but they hare back for the second"
"hit back hard over the bowler's head. Right into his hitting arc and Jadeja drilled it straight over the bowler's head, bisected long-on and long-off"
"Jadeja, the batsman, has sprung to life. Slips back inside the crease, opens his wrists and plays it late to ease the ball behind point, the ball pinged the dead centre of his bat as third man had no chance"
"looks to run it down to third man, beaten by the slower one"
"sliding down leg, aimed for the base of leg stump, missed it by a fair bit. Jadeja needed to get little touch on that to get four, he missed too"
"slower one on off stump, Jadeja was looking to tee off but just checked his shot at the last moment"
"another slower ball, but can only skew a skier towards midwicket. Nadeem was running in from the deep and was in no position to take that catch. The momentum kept bringing him forward and he was on the move when the ball lodged in is hands. Tough chance, you have to say, but a chance nevertheless"
"rip-roaring bouncer outside off, he is beaten on the pull, the ball whizzes past his gloves"
"another short ball, this time he is ready for the stroke, the angle helped him too. It was coming back in, and he simply used the pace to pull it into the deep square leg boundary"
"excellent follow-up. Full, straight and a touch ahead of the length area on off stump, Karthik made room to hit through the line but missed it; the ball just about clipped the bails. Top knock from DK."
"inswinging yorker that tails back into  middle, hit down to long on, Nair prevents the second"
"looks to clobber that into Jamnagar with the wild slog, but can only get a thick inside edge onto the pad, they take the run off the deflection towards the off side"
"inswinging yorker again, squeezed to long on, Nair is on the ball this time"
"right into the blockhole on middle, Faulkner makes room and jams his bat down in time to squeeze that to long-on"
"another attempted yorker, turns out to be  a low full toss, hit hard to long-off"
"full toss angling into the pads, flicked into the gap at deep midwicket, excellent running"
"clipped off his pads to deep midwicket, again"
"superb yorker-length delivery on off, he swings to fetch that towards deep midwicket"
"the scoop doesn't work. Walked a little too far as Morris angles the full delivery on middle and leg, Faulkner missed and the leg pole was flattened."
"into the slot, and Jadeja has muscled that into the long-on boundary. Too full on middle, he got underneath it and lofted it cleanly"
"deflects off the thigh pad to square leg as he looks to tickle it fine. There was no short fine leg, so Shami got away there"
"swung across leg side, but bottom-ends the full toss to deep midwicket"
"works it off his hip to deep square, Jadeja wanted the second, Kishan was a touch slow"
"swivels, but can't get much bat, there wasn't much pace on that either, rolls down to fine leg"
"helped over the infield to deep square, there was no chance of a second, Kishan was halfway down, when de Kock collected the flat throw to break the bails."
"floats a length ball on middle, he stays inside the crease and bunts it back down the pitch"
"play and miss, looked to punch that on the up over cover point, but was beaten by the late away movement"
"too short on leg stump and he's played the short-arm jab towards deep square, where Shivil Kaushik makes a mess of that. Tried to slide, but his hands were nowhere near the ball"
worked wide of midwicket for an easy single
"leading edge, just manages to squeeze it between cover and point. He turned the bat face early, the ball stopped on him and popped towards his India Under-19 teammate Ishan Kishan"
punched between midwicket and mid-on. Finch did well to move to his left but dived over the ball. PK looks irritated. Both boundaries should have been stopped
"gets away with that full and wide ball outside off. Floated across, batsmen lets it go thinking the umpire will call it a wide"
"thumped on the up, but Jadeja throws himself to his left to stop that rocket hit, four runs saved"
"wow, the flick of the wrists fetches him four. Touch of Yuvraj Singh in that. It was a length ball and he picked it up superbly to play it over midwicket. Excellent use of his bottom hand"
opened the face of the bat at the last moment as he lent into that to pick the gap between cover and point. Sourav Ganguly would have been proud of that
"he's pierced the off side ring again. Too short, he slides back into the crease and thumps it over point. Punched it into the ground to get it over the fielder."
too full and he's picked that towards the sliding Ishan Kishan at deep midwicket
driven through the line to long-off
"hint of width outside off, a touch short s well, eased wide of point"
punched to long-off
"sliding down leg, misses the flick, they get a run off the deflection to third man"
makes room and eases it into the gap at long-off
"drifting into middle and leg, nurdled wide of midwicket"
"short and wide outside off, punched well but straight to point. Have to say a scoring opportunity missed."
he's picked the short ball on middle over the boundary at deep backward square leg. Just a flick of the wrists and the ball sailed over the ropes. Will that force PK to change his angle?
"angling down leg, de Kock misses the flick, rolls through to the wicketkeeper"
"slower delivery on the pads, tucked to midwicket"
"too straight on the pads, picked over the infield to deep midwicket"
"just a flick, but it nearly carried to Kishan at deep square leg. Didn't control it well"
"slower delivery on middle, errs in length as well, de Kock makes room and blasts it towards point, where Jadeja once again does a Jonty. Another four saved as he dived full length to his left and then stick his hand out to stop it. The recovery was remarkable too"
"the leading edge sneaks through cover, is the ball stopping o the batsmen?"
"solid punch in that stroke as he eased that past the diving cover point fielder, Kulkarni does well to give it chase and pull it back in"
"excellent stop by Kishan, this was squeezed into the off side, but Pant was swift to move to his left at cover point"
eased with the angle to midwicket
"slogged across the line, and boy has he made clean connection or what? No one at deep square, that fierce hit smashed one bounce into the advertising boards"
"gets away with the short slider again, worked behind square"
"slow off-cutter on leg stump, turned past midwicket"
"slower bouncer this time, he stays inside the crease and plays it late with soft hands"
slashed between point and short third man. They're rattling along here. Too much width and he is a master of that shot. De Kock cleared his front leg to make more room and then picked the gap superbly
"nearly splits the same gap again, this time Jadeja runs to his right from point to stop that with a full-length dive to his wrong side"
"slower ball but he's picked it off his hand almost immediately and muscles it over midwicket. Didn't hit it off the middle, but the swung gave enough power for it to clear the infield"
"would have been wide had he let that go, instead went through with that whip behind square, the ball deflects off the pad to DK"
"tossed up on middle, he made room and crunched it straight to cover"
"chops a short ball to McCullum at cover, again"
"drifting into the pads, turned to Jadeja at long-on"
whipped towards long-on
"too close to cut, once again chopped, this time to point"
"deceived in flight as Pant looks to drive, was off balance as the ball whizzed past the outside edge. DK didn't rise with the bounce and <b> fluffed a regulation stumping chance </b>"
"is that another chance missed? Yes, it looks like. Pant looks to play the reverse sweep, but is into the stroke too early, it beats Dinesh Karthik to the third man boundary. There was definitely some glove there."
"quicker one on middle, bunted to the off side"
gets back into the crease and taps it with soft hands to the leg side
"another cheeky reverse, straight to Finch who fires a wayward throw from short third man, DK can't collect it cleanly and they get an overthrow"
gets a thick edge to short third man
"good flight, dip and spin back in, de Kock lunges forward and smothers the spin"
"steps out, but Raina shortens his length as de Kock is hit on the right pad as looks to work it across the line"
"smashed back past Raina, and into the straight boundary. That was hit like a rocket. Got to the pitch and drilled it down the ground"
"too short, picks the length early and slaps it into the midwicket boundary. Lions are bleeding runs here. Too predicable, has Raina been"
steps out and defends
"it's a slog, but it's got enough muscle to clear the long-on boundary. This wasn't full, Raina did him in flight, but he dragged it from outside off and still managed to clear the ropes with ease"
nurdled wide of midwicket for an easy single
"at the moment, it doesn't matter who bowls. Gets to the pitch of the ball and swings across the line into the wide long-on boundary"
stretches forward and defends
fine piece of fielding by that man Jadeja again. How quickly does he sprint? This was hit firmly towards the wide long-on boundary. Jadeja anticipated the swing and moved to his left before sliding across to stop it
gets to the pitch of the ball and works it down to long-on
"looks to go down town, but ends up yorking himself, just managed to keep that out"
makes room and bunts it into the gap at sweeper cover
"there was width on the off-cutter, but he missed the cut"
"angles his bat down to squeeze it behind point, late on the ball"
"slashes at a wide delivery outside off, cut away to third man"
shows a straight bat and bunts it back to the bowler
played towards deep midwicket
"too full, gets underneath that one and knocks it to deep cover"
slashes a short ball outside off towards third man
"uppish flick towards Kishan at deep midwicket, there was a misfield, but de Kock wasn't interested in the second"
"slower one outside off, drops it towards point, Pant didn't want the run this time"
gets an inside edge that nearly rolls onto the stumps as he looks to work it wide of midwicket
"Finch in business at point, he mistimed the cut shot"
"disdainfully done. No respect whatsoever for a World Cup winner. Length ball outside off, Pant could have gone over cover, but he went for a cross-batted swat over the bowler's head, hit it with precision as it carried all the way"
squeezes the full delivery behind point for an easy single
"low full toss on middle, drilled down the ground past the diving mid-off fielder"
"on the pads, flicked towards deep midwicket"
"was that a dropped chance? Good bounce, de Kock looked to pull and may have got some glove on it as it flew to Karthik. Regulation catch fluffed. He didn't have to move much to his right either. Smith is annoyed"
"lofted cleanly, this time he strikes it well. Behind the line as he lofts it on the up wide of long-off. Quality batting this, superb hand-eye coordination"
chopped wide of point for an easy single
"quicker one on middle and leg, worked with the spin to deep midwicket"
"full and straight  on leg stump, squeezed back to the bowler"
"the party is over, but surely it has come a little too late for the Lions. It was gently tossed up Jadeja on middle, Pant looked to slog that over deep midwicket, but only managed an inside edge onto the pad as Karthik gobbled up the lob. Top knock, got his opportunity at the top of the order, and made the most of it"
driven with the spin to long-off
"too short, makes a bit of room and punches it to sweeper cover"
"slider onto middle and leg, wrists it to midwicket"
"on the shorter side again, the short-arm jab is played towards deep midwicket"
"scooped, but on the bounce to short fine leg"
"juicy full toss on middle, he makes room and plays it to deep cover"
"short and turning away from outside off, steered to sweeper cover"
"two in two. De Kock looked to slog that tossed up delivery towards the biggest boundary, but didn't get any power behind the stroke. It appeared to be a tired shot, Smith didn't have to move an inch at deep midwicket. A half-century was there for the taking, but he's done his job"
"steps out and defends it back to the bowler. Kaushik lobs the ball up and the crowd goes up, but it was hit hard into the ground"
firm push past the bowler to long-off
"it's the slider on middle and leg, Duminy looked to reverse-sweep but couldn't get much bat behind that as it rolls to short third man"
"that's an outstanding delivery, but <b> Jadeja has clearly overstepped. </b> The ball drifts in, hits middle, turns away sharply to beat Samson's feeble push. DK collects the ball and whips the bails off before Samson's backfoot is inside the crease. But none of this mattered as Jadeja's first landing was on the line. And the line belongs to the umpire."
"the free-hit has been taken full toll off. Too short, he makes room and muscles it into the long-off boundary"
drops it towards cover with soft hands for a quick single
leans forward and eases it with the spin wide of midwicket
"arm-ball on middle and leg, defended to Praveen Kumar at midwicket"
"delicate, and very very effective. It's a lovely little reverse-dab past short third man. Premeditated, but executed really well. It was short, which gave him enough time to play the stroke"
"chipped over cover, and boy, that has raced away into the cover boundary. It looked like a gentle push!"
worked with the spin to wide long-on
"the cheeky late cut again, but straight to short third man again"
"sliced towards Smith at deep cover, got to the pitch of the ball and then slightly opened the bat face to get it over point"
"too short, enough time to rock back and wrist it into the gap at deep square leg"
"what an effort by McCullum at long-on! That would have been six on most nights. It doesn't matter to McCullum that just eight are needed. It was lofted clearly down the ground, and was soaring over long-on until McCullum moved back a couple of paces and then leaped high in the air to get his hands on the ball and force it back inside the field of play. Acrobatic would be an understatement"
"game, set and match. This time he has clobbered that over deep midwicket. Gets down one one knee and slogs that effortlessly over the ropes. Samson's former Rajasthan Royals teammate James Faulkner walks up to give him a warm handshake. This has been as clinical as it can get by the Daredevils"
