"huge appeal for lbw, Pakistan are very interested. Azhar checks with the bowler, keeper and signals for a review. This one came back in a long way to hit Shanto on the right thigh pad or thereabouts. The height may be the only bone of consideration here. <strong>And what a good review it is</strong>, ball tracking confirms this would've crashed into leg stump. Measured call to take the review. It wasn't impulsive, they all collectively felt it was worth a shout and boy, have they been proved right or what? Right at the fag end of the day. This will lift Pakistan just as Bangladesh were beginning to dream of wiping out the deficit with not more than two down."
"full, straight and gone! What a ball from Naseem. Make that two in two. This was angled back in from wide of the crease, the ball veered in late to beat the inside edge and hit him low on the pad. Naseem didn't even bother appealing. Nigel Llong sent him on his bike almost immediately"
"<b> edged and gone! Naseem had done it. Hat-trick! </b> He has lit up this Test and how. Joy in the Pakistan camp. He bowled this full and wide. This was there for the drive even though the ball moved away just a little, Mahmudullah couldn't hold back but was late on the shot. Got a thick edge that flew low but Haris pouched it superbly. He needed to stay low, moved instinctively to his right to pluck that. What a find this Naseem Shah is."

I think this is good, very, very good. <b> Yes, decision overturned on review, </b> Liton is out. Ball tracking confirms this would've crashed into middle and leg."
