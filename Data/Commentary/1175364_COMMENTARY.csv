slightly short length outside off and Rohit pushes it into the covers for one
"pretty straight and slow on off stump, he blocks it back"
"on middle and leg now, worked off the pads to mid-on and he's off the mark too"
"flatter and quicker towards off stump, Rohit goes back and punches it into the covers"
"bit of mix-up as Rohit pushes the ball to cover point, de Kock wants a single and is nearly halfway down the pitch. Rohit called early so de Kock went back in time but they got an overthrow eventually after a direct hit at the non-striker's end"
"just outside off, de Kock drives with hard hands and gets a thick edge just wide of Gayle at slip to see it race to the third-man boundary"
"on middle and leg, flicked off the pads and a bit of misfield gets Rohit two"
"short ball from Shami at 139kmh, Rohit hooks and he gets a top-edge to send it over short fine leg for four. Rohit pulls and hooks very well, mind you"
"short ball well outside off this time, Rohit throws his hands at it and sends it to third man after a bounce. That flew quickly!"
"nice delivery on the stumps, no room, and he pushes it down to mid-off for a quick single"
"look at that drive from Rohit! Gets room to free his arms outside off, and he sends it caressing along the ground with some timing and power for a cracking four"
"back of length and towards middle, worked off the back foot behind square for one"
"stays low and well outside off, Rohit steers it to short third man"
"turning in towards leg stump now, worked down to long-on for one"
"<strong>just over backward square leg</strong> and it goes for four! The length delivery was coming in towards the batsman and he used the angle to sweep it well, and just over a jumping Viljoen"
outside off now and steered towards point for one
"on length and turning in a bit, dabs it down to long-on"
"angling in towards the pads again, helps it to long-on easily for one"
short ball to start things and de Kock pulls it nicely for two on the leg side
"some room outside off with the angle, he runs it down to third man for one"
"nice and accurate towards off stump, Rohit waits and opens the face of the bat late to help it to third man"
"angling away from de Kock, he cuts nicely but finds cover point"
"bit fuller outside off and de Kock brings his bat down with hard hands to send it wide of third man. Oh, Rohit almost bumped into de Kock while running and lost his bat in the middle of the pitch"
"full on the pads, flicked away off the pads by Rohit for two in the gap"
"low full toss at 132kmh on off, pushed gently down the ground for one"
"a slower ball at 112.7kmh pretty wide outside off, Rohit goes after it with a big swing and doesn't quite middle it but gets just enough to beat the fielders chasing it"
"looked like a slower one again, this one on the stumps and he pushed it down to mid-on"
"115kmh, he's not giving much pace, as usual, Andrew Tye. Slightly wide of off stump and driven into the covers"
"comes down the track, looked like he wanted to smash it but he adjusted so nicely to the short of length delivery outside off. He just waited and then cut the ball square with good timing to beat point for four"
short of short fine leg as Rohit pulls the short ball after walking down again. This time the ball beats a diving Chris Gayle and goes for four more
"hint of room outside off, cuts it hard to third man with a bottom edge for one"
"<strong>loud appeal for lbw</strong>, the finger goes up late and Rohit is walking! That was slightly full on middle, it had the angle with it and Rohit missed it while targeting the leg side, to be struck on the front pad. There were two sounds but the bat probably hit the pad, and Rohit looks at de Kock but doesn't review it. Was it going down leg, though?"
"full on the pads, flicked to midwicket"
"slower on middle and leg, Surya goes across a bit and works it to fine leg with some nifty wristwork. There's a misfield at the edge of the circle and he gets four"
"too full this time, Surya just shows the full face off the bat and drives it down the ground with hardly any follow through. Lovely stroke"
"down the leg side again, worked off the pads square enough to beat short fine leg and there's a close call for the dive at the boundary. Mandeep tried keeping the ball in with his first dive, the ball was still rolling as he went across the rope. He then put in dive from outside the boundary to keep the ball in again. The question if his fingers touched the rope while he pushed the ball in"
"on length on off stump, pushed back to the bowler"
"stays a bit low, Surya misses the ball completely as he tries to pull the short of length ball and <b>he's plumb</b> in front of middle stump. It pitched on off, came in with the angle and trapped him right in front"
"flatter outside off, goes away with the turn far away from the bat, that googly"
"turning in towards the pads, worked away and he's off the mark"
"KL Rahul thinks he's got an edge and celebrates. No other Kings XI player is appealing, R Ashwin isn't moving. De Kock went for the cut outside off as the ball turned away and looks like he didn't get anything on it"
""
"almost in the block hole, he digs it out back to the bowler"
"more towards middle now, he defends on the leg side"
it was the offbreak from Ashwin but it came in with the arm and de Kock got just enough bat to cut it fine on the off side for four
"more towards middle and much shorter, pulled to leg"
"on middle and leg, no turn as Yuvraj works it with the angle to leg"
"fullish on middle, flicked to square leg for one"
"googly outside off, decent bounce, and de Kock defends on off, off the back foot"
"way too short, de Kock walks down and then pulls this straight down the ground, the long-on is pretty wide and he smashes it for four"
"full on middle this time, de Kock drives it nicely with the turn to bisect the gap between deep midwicket and long-on for four more"
"short outside off, de Kock wants to smash that too but gets a thick inner edge"
"turning away again from off stump, this one keeps a bit low as he cuts it to deep point"
"oh, <strong>beats him outside off by a whisker</strong>! Yuvraj was struck on the crease as the ball pitched around middle and leg, and was turning away. He showed the full face of the bat but it turned just enough to just miss the outside edge and off stump"
"down the leg side, and it's worked to short fine leg. Gayle fumbles a bit and they get one easily"
"no room, right on target on off stump and Yuvaj defends it on off"
"hint of room outside off, he dabs it to third man easily"
"just a bit short, not too much, but de Kock pivots on the back foot and hoicks that behind square with a lot of power to send it flying for six!"
"nicely struck as it's pitched up on middle and leg, de Kock is looking in really good touch. Flicks it away and long-on goes to his left to save two"
on leg again and it's worked towards square for one
"slower length ball, angling across to off stump. Looks to swivel and hoick it away through midwicket, ends up inside-edging into his pads"
"back of a length offcutter, angling across to off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
"shot. That's full, on leg stump, and Yuvraj makes a bit of room to stay leg-side of the ball and loft inside-out over wide mid-off"
"slower length ball on off stump, pushed gently into the covers and they complete a quick single. Risky, but M Ashwin, sprinting in from cover and attempting a pick-up and underarm throw in one motion, can't collect cleanly"
"slower ball, back of a length, swivels and pulls it round to long leg"
"whoops, another error in length from Tye. He overpitched one to Yuvraj, now he feeds him a slower ball that ends up as a friendly knee-high full-toss on off stump. Yuvraj punches it stylishly down the ground, between the stumps and the non-striker, and holds his pose, right elbow nice and high"
"floated up full on off stump, driven to long-off"
"wrong'un pitching outside leg. Gets down low to sweep but is a touch late on the shot, ends up getting hit on the front pad"
"another wrong'un, but this is a half-volley pitching on leg stump, and de Kock clears his front leg and heaves it away, up in the air and just out of reach of long-on sprinting at full speed to his left. Brings up his fifty too"
"short, spinning away from off stump, slapped to the left of backward point"
"flatter now, wrong'un spinning from leg to off. Big stretch forward to block"
"length ball, another wrong'un, this time headed towards middle stump. Presses forward and dabs it gently, with the turn into the covers"
"quick length ball angling across towards off stump, punched back to the bowler"
"slower ball, back of a length, down the leg side. Looks to help it to fine leg but can't make contact"
"back of a length on middle and leg, looking to cramp Yuvraj for room. Blocked gently into the covers for one"
"shortish on off stump, slower one, pulled to deep square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, opens his bat face to steer to third man"
"shot! That's a slower length ball pitching on off stump and angling away from him. De Kock steps forward and brings his wrists into play to just flick it over the backward square leg boundary, a la Sanath Jayasuriya. Or even the man at the other end"
"big appeal, that's definitely hitting the stumps, but did it pitch in line? Given, and de Kock has reviewed. De Kock shuffled across his stumps and looked to hoick this one through fine leg, and ended up making no contact. It's on the fuller side of a good length. Where did it pitch? Juuust in line with leg stump, and it's going on to crash into middle and off stumps"
"flat, back of a length, outside off, chopped towards short third man"
"similar line and length, cut hard into the ground, rolls towards backward point"
"fires this into the pads, clipped to the left of short fine leg"
"flat carrom ball on middle and off, stays in the crease and stabs it back to Ashwin, getting opened up slightly in the process"
"another carrom ball, just outside off, dabbed towards short third man"
"flat length ball wide of off stump, Yuvraj goes for the big drive and misses, wide is signalled"
"flat, shortish, angling down leg. Yuvraj doesn't quite middle this horizontal-bat swat, ends up rolling gently to short fine leg"
"back of a length, leg-stumpish, swatted away to deep backward square leg"
"wrong'un pitching on a good length outside off, presses forward to defend and the ball slides into the square-leg region off the inside half of the bat"
"well bowled. Quickish wrong'un angled across to off stump and spinning away further. Yuvraj doesn't quite pick it as he comes forward, trying to open his bat face and steer it square. Slides past the outside edge"
"another wrong'un, and he uses the big square boundaries to get his man. Pitches outside leg, on a good length, fairly slow, and Yuvraj has to manufacture all the power himself as he looks for the swivelling slog-sweep. Ends up picking out the man at deep backward square leg"
"unlucky for the bowler. Extra bounce on the googly as Hardik rocks back to cut, gets a thick outside edge and it flies away to the fine third man boundary"
"legbreak, flat on leg stump. Gets on the front foot to clip it away through backward square leg"
"Slower length ball just outside off, presses forward for a push into the covers"
"quicker length ball, goes wider on the crease and angles it into off stump. Driven to long-on, showing the full face"
"back of a length close to off stump, shuffles across to work it through square leg"
"short, gets up to chest height, angling into the batsman's body. Pulled through backward square leg"
"slower ball outside off, reaches out to cut and misses"
"in the blockhole, angling in towards off stump, clipped through square leg and the fielder running to his left from deep backward square leg fumbles"
"slower ball, back of a length, angling into the body. Looks to work it away but plays too early and gets hit on the thigh pad"
"another slower ball. Shorter this time, and outside off, hops to ride the bounce and dab into the point region"
"shortish offcutter, only gets up to waist height on off stump, and Pandya pulls it away into the big gap between deep midwicket and deep backward square leg"
"in the blockhole on leg stump, looks to whip it away and gets a thick inside edge that rolls into the square leg region"
"shortish, angling into the hip, tucked away to the right of deep backward square leg"
"length ball, angling in from wide of the crease. Looks to drive down the ground - maybe to long-off - ends up hitting it through mid-on without a lot of power, off the inside half of the bat"
"got him! Knuckle ball, long boundaries, and Pollard's attempted big hit skews high in the air off the outside half of the bat, and Mayank Agarwal settles nicely under it right on the edge of the long-off boundary. Would have been a mishit six in a lot of other grounds in the IPL"
"short outside off, pulled to the left of deep midwicket"
"slower bouncer, gets up to chest height over off stump. Pulled along the ground through square leg"
"takes a big, premeditated step back and across and gets outside off stump. Tye bowls a slower length ball on off stump and he clips it away through midwicket"
"slower ball wide of off stump - he bowled wider because of Pandya's premeditated shuffle across his stumps. Ends up just outside the tramline, and it's called wide, though he's arguing that the batsman had moved across in advance"
"full outside off, uses his wrists to clip it down towards long-on"
slower ball down the leg side. Krunal can't quite put bat to ball as he tries to paddle it fine
"bouncer over middle stump, rises quite steeply, controls the pull well, keeps it on the ground through square leg"
"Excellent placement. Short ball rising to stomach height on off stump. Jumps across for a short-arm jab that perfectly bisects deep midwicket and deep backward square leg - he's helped by the fact that both fielders seemed to slow down, letting the other do the dirty work"
"back of a length on off stump, and it sits up for Krunal to carve away, big follow-through, places it well, to the right of extra-cover"
"short again, this time he digs it in hard and gets it up to shoulder height. Much more difficult for Krunal to control the hook, especially since he had to fetch it from a little outside off. Miscues it, and deep backward square leg takes a straightforward catch running in from the boundary"
"short, wide, stands up tall and cuts it hard, easily beats third man to his right"
"slower short ball wide of off. Hardik, who took that premeditated back and across step again, looks to pull and misses, through his swing too early"
"full now, angling in towards off stump. Looks to flick and misses, gets a bit of pad on it - well outside off stump - and it ricochets to the left of the bowler as the batsmen sneak a leg-bye. He fields it in his follow-through and throws at the bowler's end and misses. Hardik would probably have made it anyway"
"looks for the yorker, doesn't quite nail it. Driven firmly down the ground to long-on, doesn't take the single"
"slower ball, ends up as a full-toss on off stump, and this is why he refused that single. Again takes that big back-and-across step, which allows him to get underneath this ball and whip it away over wide long-on"
"full, close to off stump, not quite a yorker, carves it away with an open bat face to the left of deep point, and that's excellent running to pick up a second"
"gone. The bend-your-back short ball is a great ball to bowl on this ground. Gets up to shoulder height outside off stump, and it's a hard place to fetch a pull from. Hits it pretty well, but on this ground you need to hit it better than that to clear the fielder at deep midwicket"
"McClenaghan takes a big step across, looking to target the fielder at short fine leg. Shami fires a full-toss outside off, pretty close to the batsman's body as he tries to scoop it fine. No contact between bat and ball or ball and body, thankfully"
"looks to shuffle across again, and Shami fires in a yorker just outside off. Misses the flick and it rolls away through square leg off the pad"
"length ball, some room on the off side with the angle, Rahul uses soft hands to guide it to third man. Off the mark straightaway"
"<b>loud appeal</b> for lbw mainly from the bowler, the umpire doesn't move and Rohit signals from slip that it was too high. It angled in from off, was just short of good length and nipped in to strike the pad high in front of leg stump. Was probably going down leg too"
"accurate length delivery outside off, middles the defence on the off side"
"pulls the length shorter outside off, Gayle wants to slam it away on off but doesn't middle it"
"and short it is! Nicely bowled - around off and rising towards Gayle's throat, so he lets it go by swaying  out of its line"
short again but it's still outside off and Gayle does well to ramp it with minimal movement of the body. Just raises his arms at the last moment and gets four
"starts with a leg-stump line, Rahul nudges it away to the leg side for one"
bit of mix-up halfway through the pitch as Gayle dabs the slower ball towards backward point and Yuvraj fumbles there to make the batsmen go back and forth. No damage in the end
"outside off on length, Rahul steers it to cover point"
"swinging away from just outside off, Rahul goes back and defends towards cover point"
"slow cutter on middle stump at 111kmh, Rahul watchfully pushes straight down the ground for one towards mid-on"
futile yet loud appeal for lbw from Malinga as this quick delivery beats Gayle but he was struck outside the leg stump after he missed the flick. It also pitched outside leg
outside the leg stump and he nudges it towards midwicket for one
short ball <strong>smacked for six</strong>! It's almost like he knew the shorter ball was coming. He planted his front foot towards the leg side as soon as the ball was delivered and he pulled the incoming delivery waaay over the long-on area for a massive six
"pitched up this time but for the same result! Almost full on the stumps, it was a cutter, and Gayle stayed still to loft that with his big arms in the same area - clears long-on easily"
"length delivery this time on the stumps, he works it wide of mid-on in the gap"
"almost cramped for room on the leg side, Rahul works the length delivery to midwicket"
"114kmh, slower one keeps low on the leg stump, Rahul goes back and helps it to deep square leg"
and right on target he is - length delivery angling in from outside off. Rahul defends it back
"angling in a bit further towards middle and leg, he helps it to square leg"
"slower one at 118kmh, outside off and nipping in, Rahul gets an inside edge behind square on leg"
"no room whatsoever still, angling in from wide of the crease and Rahul defends again"
"gets some room finally, not much, and Rahul jumps on it by driving that length delivery nicely along the ground, between cover point and cover for four. Must be a relief for him"
"drives again, reaching away from the body, and he finds point this time"
just outside off and he punches it into the covers
"back of length on middle and leg, Gayle pushes it down to mid-off"
"nearly in the block hole, and Gayle does extremely well to move his feet out of the way in time and he drives that down the ground past Rahul, right from the middle of the bat. Malinga replies with a smile"
"113.9kmh, pitched up around off and he chips it down to mid-off after a bounce"
he gets some room on off and waits on the back foot to punch that away between cover point and point for a cracking four
on the pads and he helps it to deep square for one
"on the pads, he wants to work it away but gets an inside edge on the pads"
"short and quick rom outside leg, no room as Gayle goes on his toes and defends down the ground"
goes a bit wider outside leg and Gayle pulls it straight to square leg
"targets the top of middle stump now from wide of the crease, Gayle pushes it down to mid-off and takes a quick one"
"pitched up outside off, he drives it down to mid-off"
"angling in sharply from wide of the crease, slightly short too, and he works it with a roll of wrists to square leg"
"starts with an offcutter outside off, Rahul drives it down to mid-off"
"pulls the length shorter outside off, Rahul steers it square this time"
just back of length around off and this one is punched down to long-on for one
"clears that massive square boundary for another six! Pitched up on leg stump and in typical Gayle fashion, Gayle opened up to hammer that with a wild swing. Up and over deep square leg"
"smoked down the ground this time! Pitched up again, Gayle knows what to do with those lengths. He stays still this time and tonks it into the sight screen"
"slower one well outside off, it rolls away for a wide"
"another slower one well outside off with the angle, Gayle lets it go and looks at the umpire but it's not called a wide"
"angling into the pads, he helps it to deep square leg"
"<strong>he's skied that</strong> one and picks out long-on, look who's taken the catch - it's Hardik Pandya! This one was pretty wide outside off, hardly any flight, and Gayle went after it to dispatch it down the ground, not easy to smash a wide delivery with the spin. It went really high, and Hardik pouched it easily a few yards inside the boundary"
"on middle stump, he pushes it to long-on. Off the mark"
"goes on the back foot and works it to the leg side with soft hands, calls for two immediately"
"towards the pads again, worked away with the wrists"
smart work and placement from Mayank - length delivery on the stumps and he chips it down the ground with sweet timing to bisect long-on and long-off for a four
"legbreak outside off, driven with the spin into the covers"
"googly down the leg side after pitching on middle, for a wide"
"quicker one on off, goes straightish and he pushes it towards cover"
"that's too short, Mayank goes back to open up and pulls it in the gap again. Picks it up from off stump and finds the gap between long on and deep midwicket"
"skids this one from off stump, worked to leg for a quick single"
"no turn again, angling in towards leg stump and helped to leg for one more"
"another short ball, doesn't bounce that much and Mayank puts this one away too. In the same gap on the leg side, four more"
length delivery chipped down to long-on for one
"makes room to target the leg side, not much room on off so he cuts hard but gets a thick inside edge fine on the off side for four"
"tries to paddle it fine on leg, misses and it's a wide"
flicks this length delivery away towards midwicket for one
pushed down to long-on for one
goes back to work the ball off his pads to deep midwicket and they come back quickly for the second
"loud appeal as he is hit int front of leg, it was going down leg"
"length ball, angling in towards off stump, straightens slightly. Pushed down to long-off"
"looks for the flick off a length ball angling across to off stump. No timing at all, just clips it back to the bowler"
"length ball angling away from off stump, opens his bat face to squeeze this to the right of the diving Yuvraj at backward point"
"back of a length on off stump, punched with a straight bat to deep midwicket"
"length ball angling into middle stump, nudges it gently into the vacant midwicket region, and forces the bowler to chase"
"shuffles down the track and McClenaghan shortens his length, angling it across the batsman, Driven to the right of deep point"
"length ball, straightening towards off stump, wristy drive to the left of long-off"
"down the track to a flat one aimed towards off stump. Meets it on the full and slaps it away, and point dives right to get a hand to it and slow it down considerably"
"back of a length on off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and flat-bats to the left of deep extra-cover"
"down the track, and that's beautiful timing. Quick feet to get himself close to the pitch of this middle-stump ball but not close enough to deny himself elevation. Swings cleanly through the line and easily clears the long-on boundary"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to deep extra-cover"
"back of a length on off stump, steps out and punches to deep extra-cover"
"back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face and steers it to backward point"
"back of a length, fifth-stump line, uses his wrists to whip it to deep midwicket"
"short slower one wide of off, tapped to the right of backward point"
"full, a bit of width, and that's nicely played by Rahul, steps back and across to shorten the length and slap it away to the left of McClenaghan, who has to sprint a long way and slide to make the stop at deep point"
"slower ball, shorter and again on that wide-ish line, slapped to deep point"
"overpitched, a bit of width, and Agarwal will be displeased that he couldn't beat the infield with that drive. Timed it well, to the right of extra-cover but too close to the fielder"
"bam. Flat, full, angling into middle stump. Not full enough to deny Agarwal elevation after he gets his front leg out of the way and swings through the line for a flat six to the right of long-off"
"goes back to the slider angling into leg stump, punches it into the gap between long-on and deep midwicket. Two runs were always on, but Rahul has to dive to complete it at the non-striker's end"
"another wicket for Krunal, who's keeping Mumbai in the game here. Back of a length, no turn, keeps going with the angle and cramps up Mayank, who was always looking to stay leg-side of the ball. Punches hard, but ends up popping it back to the bowler at around chest height"
"down the track to a flat one outside off, whips it with the turn to the left of long-on"
"shortish outside off, chopped away to the right of deep point"
makes a lot of room early and Krunal follows him with a flat length ball at leg stump. Driven to the right of sweeper cover
"Make that 50 to win. Short, a bit of width, gets up to shoulder height, and Rahul makes a little extra room and uppercuts over the backward point boundary"
"back of a length on off stump, worked away to deep square leg"
"back of a length, down the leg side, Miller can't connect with the leg glance"
"change of angle, no change in fortunes. He's trying hard to cramp Miller for room, but ends up spearing this full one down the leg side"
"back of a length on off stump, straight-bat push to the right of extra-cover"
"overpitched, lots of width, Rahul just hits through the line with a straight bat, and though it's in the air, it's in the gap to the right of Rohit at extra-cover. Hit really hard, so Rohit doesn't bother diving, even though it's not too far from him at about shoulder height"
"fuller still now and outside off, to deny the hit down the ground. Opens his bat face to ease it to deep point"
"another boundary, and this may well be the over that wins it for Kings XI. Short, down the leg side, and Miller swivels to use the pace and help it away to the fine leg boundary"
"slower ball at the pads, clipped away through midwicket"
"full on off stump, driven to long-off"
"short, a bit of width, but the ball loses a lot of pace off the surface so Rahul drags his attempted cut in front of square, to the fielder sweeping on the cover point boundary. More pace onto the bat and a boundary could have been on, with backward point and third man in the circle. Misfield on the boundary allows a second run"
"looks for the yorker, gets a bit of late inswing too, but ends up swerving it down the leg side"
"fullish slower ball on off stump, clipped to the right of long-on"
"Immediate shortening of length, but the angle takes it down leg, and Rahul swivels on the hook to send it flying away to the right of short fine leg. Brings up his fifty too"
"slower length ball on off stump, punched down the ground to long-off"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to mid-off"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to the right of the diving backward point fielder, who gets his hands to the ball but can't keep it from rolling away from him and conceding two runs"
"and that means there's a gap to exploit between extra-cover and mid-off. Bumrah allows him to with a full-toss close to off stump, and he punches it away through that very gap"
"back of a length, angling in towards middle stump, and that's a super shot, takes a step across his stumps and whips it away in the gap between deep square leg and fine leg"
"bouncer outside off, Rahul looks to lean away and ramp it fine, but he can't make contact"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, punched to sweeper cover"
"slower ball at leg stump. Looks to step across and help it fine, but only manages a tickle off the thigh pad, to the left of the keeper"
"bouncer outside off, Miller ignores it, pulling his upper body out of the way"
late inswing causes this yorker to tail in towards Miller's feet. Nearly falls over while trying to flick it. Thick inside edge into pad
"sees Rahul trying to make himself room and follows him with a slower, back-of-length ball. Slapped to extra-cover"
"full on middle stump, flicked away against the angle to deep square leg"
"looks for the yorker, ends up sliding a low full-toss down the leg side. That brings up the 50 partnership, off just 30 balls"
"makes room premeditatedly, and leaves McClenaghan with two options - follow him or make him reach for the ball. Goes for option two, with a full one outside off, but it's still within his reach and he frees his arms to slap it away to the left of deep point"
"back of a length, not too far outside off, and third man is back, but he's fairly square, and Bumrah offers Rahul plenty of pace to use, just opens his bat face and guides it down nice and fine"
"short, angling into off stump, steps across and hooks to the left of fine leg"
"short, angling across the left-hander. Miller looks to jump across and work it against the angle, can't put bat to ball"
"short, gets up to chest height fairly wide outside off, Miller pulls to the left of deep square leg and completes the job"
