"straighter this time, length again and gets it to jag back in, Rohit nudges it fine on the leg side"
"length around middle and off, cramping him for room, defended"
"really full again, around middle and leg with a hint of inswing again, Rohit squeezes it away towards deep square leg"
"length outside off, Rahul tries to steer it down but can't beat short third-man"
"full and swinging away a touch, Rohit opens the face and drives straight to cover point without much timing"
"length, he backs away and Holder follows, quite unlike Rohit, all this movement before the ball, helps it along for one to fine leg"
"length outside off, moves away a touch but unfortunately for the bowler, that helps Rahul free his arms and beat the wide slip to his right with a thick outside edge"
"this time more deliberate and very delicate from Rahul, waits for the length and ball and places it wide of slip, he was in full control of the stroke, beats third man again"
excellent come back! Pulled his length back and got it to rear disconcertingly from a length to go whizzing past Rahul's glove as he went feel for it
slightly fuller around off but leaves Rahul who feels for it again and is beaten due to the extra bounce. Great comeback from Holder
"<strong>that's 400 sixes for Rohit!</strong> He's in the mood tonight, picks up the length early and clubs it over deep midwicket"
"that's more traditional and class written all over it, full around off, just a gentle forward push from Rohit helps the ball beat mid-off"
"pulls his length back and cramps him for room, Rohit nudges it towards fine leg for one"
"full on the pads, hint of swing, Rahul clips it to deep square leg for one"
"full around off, not overpitched, Rohit tires to blast it through the line but can't beat short cover"
"length around off, it's at full pace and all Rohit has to do is give it direction, beats short third-man and that's four more"
"length around off, punched to cover point's right, he's quick to the ball and has a go at the non striker's end, would have probably had Rahul short of his ground, but Williams let's it through backing up at mid-on and Rahul gets a bonus run when he could been run out"
"full around middle and off, defended"
"length and angled in, nudged away to the leg side and in the gap for another couple"
"length outside off, and a rare leave in this format, watches it through to the keeper"
"wide on the crease and angled in, it's full and Rahul gets under it, scoops it using his wrists over midwicket, two bounces and into the boundary"
"wide on the crease again but it's short and wide, Rahul swings hard with that exaggerated, almost West Indian flourish and it sails over the third-man fence"
"spin for the first time and Rohit greets him with disdain! Length around off, Rohit goes down on one knee and picks it up over long-on"
"<strong>Has he taken that?</strong> It's Lewis on the fence and he nearly pulls off a stunner, it is a stunner regardless, actually. He caught this mid-air with just his right hand but showed great presence of mind to throw it back in play to save four. The batsmen take two. It was short and Rohit was ready for it, rocked back and pulled it hard and flat towards deep midwicket and couldn't quite believe his luck when Lewis got his hand on it. Neither could I!"

"full around off, driven to deep cover for one"
"flat around off, Rahul comes forward and defends, bit of extra bounce for Walsh"
"flat outside off again, but Rahul waits for this, takes it from the keeper's gloves and dabs it fine"
"length and angled in, pushed to long-on, they consider two but Rohit wisely turns it down"

"length around middle,and it makes a cracking sound off the bat, down on one knee and swept powerfully over deep square leg"
"pulls his length back a little, slows it down a little, almost deceives Rohit in the air, but he he goes through the shot, it goes high into the night sky and sails deep into the stands down the ground"

"fired outside off, left alone, and a dot"
"length outside off, cut away for one"
"length around off, swats it down the ground to long-off for one"
"googly on middle, was backing away but manages to get bat on it for a single into the covers"

"length and angled in, Rahul tries to help it past short fine on one knee but can't beat Williams"
"full toss on middle, pushed down the ground as Rahul loses his grip a little, single to long-on. Good over so far"
length around middle and a little slice of luck for Rohit who swung across the line but got an outside edge that flew past the keeper
"slower ball and down the leg side, called wide even as Rohit swings and misses"
"full toss on middle, Rohit pushes it to deep midwicket for one. Not a bad over for West Indies"
"now he drops short, though, and even though the line is good, angling into middle and leg or thereabouts, Rohit can rock back and hoick it away, high over deep backward square leg"
"flat and quick on middle and off, just short of a length, Rohit defends back to the bowler. Can't manufacture room"
"full outside off, driven firmly to cover, can't beat the fielder"
"four more. Makes just enough room to drill this hard and beat deep point to his right. Full outside off, and Rahul moves his front foot away from the line to create extra swinging room to thrash it away"
"bam. Poor bowling in this over. Dangles a full-toss on off stump, about knee-high, and Rahul whips it away, wristily, to beat deep midwicket to his left"
"tossed up on middle and leg, clipped down to long-on to keep the strike"
"slower short ball, a bit of width, and deep point sprints quickly to his left to stop Rahul's square cut"
"slower short ball outside off, takes ages to get to Rohit, who flat-bats it down to long-off"
"another slower one, back of a length close to off stump, chopped away towards the sweeper at deep cover point"
"gets too much underneath that ball, and Williams has broken the partnership. Hard length, on off stump, not short enough for the pull. Doesn't have enough time to get on the back foot, and ends up shovelling it in the air, towards deep midwicket, where Hayden Walsh judges it nicely"
"full, close to off stump, driven to sweeper cover"
"full-pace ball, slanting away from off stump. Was going for the yorker, ends up as a hard-to-hit low full-toss. Pant goes for the booming cover drive, and gets an outside edge that bounces before reaching the keeper"
starts with an attempted yorker that ends up as a wide down the leg side. Rahul can't get any bat to it while looking to flick it away
"slower ball, back of a length, close to off stump. Rahul walks out of his crease, towards the line, and uses his wrists to work it down the ground towards long-on"
"full, wide of off stump, and Pant goes for the big drive and picks out long-off. Not a bad shot, and his instructions must have been to go after the bowling from ball one, but the ball is slightly off-pace, and he doesn't get enough power or elevation to beat the fielder"

"length ball angling into the pads, clipped to deep midwicket"

"flat, back of a length, close to off stump, can't beat backward point with his cut"
"short ball on off stump, rocks back to pull and hits it one-bounce to long-on. Wanted to hit that to the fielder's right, but the ball skidded on quick and he didn't get the time he needed"
"tossed up on middle stump, and Kohli's firm sweep goes straight to midwicket"
"this one gives Kohli too much swinging room, and he takes full toll. Flighted ball, just outside off, not wide enough to make him reach for it, and Kohli slog-sweeps with good use of his bottom wrist to hit it hard over long-on"
"what a shot. Holder saw Rahul sliding away from leg stump to make premeditated room, and he followed him with a full ball angling into his feet. Misses his line by a few inches, though, and Rahul hits a glorious inside-out drive all the way over the cover boundary"
"<b>missed run-out</b>. Good ball, yorker aimed at Rahul's feet as he shapes to make room once more. Looks to flick, misses, and the ball  rolls a short way into the off side. Kohli sets off quickly, Rahul hesitates as Holder closes in on the ball, and comes to a stop with Holder aiming at the bowler's end stumps. He has all the time to aim and fire, but he misses, and Rahul survives"
"shot. India are getting a crucial move on here. Fullish, angling into leg stump, and those Kohli wrists generate enough power through an uppish flick to beat deep midwicket to his right"
"whack. That's the Ross Taylor hockey swat. Full-toss on the stumps, maybe an attempted slower one, and Kohli whips it away with a lot of bottom hand, over square leg"
"length ball close to off stump, angling in, and Kohli clears his front leg and puts away another nonchalant hit. Another bottom-hand whip, this time up and over midwicket and to the right of long-on"
"slower bouncer outside off, pulled along the ground to deep square leg. 22 off the over"
"shortish slower ball, wide outside off, the width is an adjustment when he sees Kohli stepping across his stumps. Chops at it but can't beat backward point"
"wide of the crease, angles this back-of-a-length ball in towards off stump, at full pace. Kohli ends up cramping himself for room with his step across the stumps. Can only block it back to the bowler"
"slower ball, shortish, wide outside off, jabbed to the right of backward point"
"short and wide once more, and Rahul reaches for the cut and bottom-edges, on the bounce, to the keeper"
"low full-toss on the pads, clips it neatly but can't beat short fine leg. Cottrell does well to stop it with a dive to his left"
"another slower short ball, wide outside off. Excellent bowling to his field, and Kohli chops it away, without much power, towards sweeper cover. Brilliant control from Williams right through - not easy to bowl that line and not concede wides"
"length ball on the pads, whipped away to the left of a sprawling short fine leg, but deep backward square leg runs across to his right to cut it off"
"shortish slower ball angling away from off stump, can't beat backward point with his cut"
"length ball on leg stump, makes some room and punches to long-off"
"lucky. Slower ball, back of a length, angling across the batsman. Looks to clear his front leg and hoick it over the leg side, and extra bounce takes the top edge and beats Pooran leaping to his right behind the stumps"
"another slower ball, fuller this time, whipped away to deep midwicket"
"muscled. Short ball angling across the stumps, slower one, and it gets up to around the right side of Rahul's chest. Opens up and swats it back past the bowler's right foot with a tennis-smash-esque shot, and beats long-on to his left"
"fullish, angling into the pads. Misses the flick and the ball rolls to the left of Pooran off the pad, slow enough for the batsmen to steal a leg bye"
"shot. Slower offcutter, full outside off, Rahul takes a step across, keeps his shape well, and launches a mighty hit high over long-off"
"back of a length on off stump, cramps Rahul on the pull, and he hits it along the ground to the right of long-on"
"bang. Williams has bowled brilliantly through his first three overs, but he's missed his lengths marginally, twice, in this over, and both those balls have disappeared for six. Full, but not full enough to be a yorker, angling into off stump, and Kohli clears his front leg and bottom-hand whips it high over wide long-on"
"back of a length close to off stump, dabbed towards short third man"
"full-pace length ball angling into leg stump. Rahul stays back, leg-side of the ball, and punches towards long-off, who has to come in a long way off the boundary, so they can hurry through for a second"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, and Kohli is in stunning form. Clears his front leg and launches a baseball hit high over long-on"
"six more, and he brings up a 21-ball fifty. I don't know why he plays within himself so often in T20s. Length ball angling into the stumps, and he dismisses it over wide long-on with a powerful whip of his wrists"
"slower ball outside off, clears his front leg and whips it down the ground, to the left of long-on. And oh, Pollard has overstepped here. Not by a long way, but it's long enough"
"length ball outside off, and Kohli drives powerfully, on the up, to the right of sweeper cover. Incredible generation of power through that flat-bat hit, and Hetmyer, moving to his right, seemed to have it under control, but he's deceived by bad bounce, and the ball turns like a legbreak past his hands and into the boundary"
"back of a length outside off, steps forward and swipes to long-on"
"another slower one, back of a length and fairly wide of off. Rahul muscles a flat-bat hit to long-on"
"shot. Full outside off, not wide enough to make him reach for it, and not close enough to cramp him for room. He doesn't even need that much swinging room, because of the power he can generate with his wrists, and he whips it away over the midwicket boundary with another bottom-handed whip"
"full, angling across to off stump. Looks for the reverse-sweep and only manages a leg-bye into the point region"
"what a ball. Out of nowhere, a full-pace bouncer whistles past Kohli's left ear as he looks to hook. There's an appeal for caught behind, and umpire Nitin Menon <b>gives it out</b>. Kohli's reviewed immediately, and there's an ultra-edge spike, but is that glove, or is that helmet? I think it's grazed the top of his helmet... Yup, no glove"
slower length ball angling away from off stump. It's a good angle to bowl with Kohli in such murderous leg-side-targeting mode. Gets down on his back knee for a flick/sweep along the ground through midwicket
"bouncer, angling into a wide line outside off, and Rahul top-edges an attempted hook, which Pooran gets comfortably under behind the stumps. They're checking with the third umpire for height, and it's at around shoulder height when Rahul meets it, so he has to walk back, nine short of a hundred"
"off-stump yorker, and Kohli's attempted flick rolls gently back towards the bowler. He nailed the length, and the angle was to difficult to hit against"
"is that a wide? Seemed to finish inside the tramline outside off, but he has to factor in the left-arm-over angle. Full, angling away a long way, and Kohli reaches for the slash and misses"
"and India will finish on 240. Slower ball, full, angling away from off stump, and Kohli has to reach for it, but he manages to connect well, dropping onto his back knee to slog-sweep back over the bowler's head"
"full and swinging away quite a bit, the batsman spotted it early and left it safely"
"this one comes back in from outside off, Simmons gets his bat down just in time to keep it out"
"length on around off, shuffles across and clips it towards square leg for one"
"length outside off, steers it to third-man for one"
"full around off, shuffles a little again and tucks it away to deep square leg for one"
"inswinger on the pads this time, all he has to do is tickle it fine, the man at short fine leg gets a hand but can't stop it from trickling away into the boundary. Spoils an otherwise excellent over. Relatively speaking, Chahar would have taken 7 from it at the start"
"in the air, but short of mid-on. It was an inswinger but came on quite slowly, Simmons was early into the drive and sort of scooped it but doesn't carry"
"advances and makes room, the length and line is predictable and he slashes it over cover for four"
"tucks him up with a fuller inswinger, tucked away through square leg for one"
"full and swinging away a touch, goes for the booming cover drive but doesn't quite time it"
"<strong>King falls!</strong> It was a slower ball, King made room and threw his hands at the length ball, he had to stretch a little and couldn't get any power, the fielder, who had just been stationed at deep cover settles under it and takes it comfortably"
"inswinger around off, jags back sharply, Simmons shuffles again and uses it to his advantage, tickles it fine for four, albeit off the thigh pad"
"length around middle and off, squares up Hetmyer who was trying to work it leg side, gets a thick edge towards backward point"
"length on middle and leg, he swings but can't connect, Simmons meanwhile had taken off from the non striker's end, Shami was quick to it and hurled a throw back bus missed, could have taken his time and lined the stumps up"
"length around middle, jags back in to cramp Hetmyer up, gets one to mid-on"
"length and into the body, Simmons swings wildly across the line but misses and takes it on the body"
"short one outside off, clever change of length and it's much too quick for Simmons who swings and misses again"
"slower ball, Simmons swings across the line again and finally gets some bat, but unfortunately for him, it's a leading edge that goes high up in the air over point, who runs back - never easy to do - keeps his eyes on the ball and takes it comfortably. Shami, playing his first T20I in over two years strikes in his first over, and an excellent over it was"
"short and wide outside off, and India are already putting on a show in the field, the third man Shivam Dube had to make quite a lot of ground running to his left  and needed a dive to eventually get his hands under the ball, keeps control of the ball even as he falls, and Nicholas Pooran goes for a duck. A wicket each for the three India seamers as Chahar gets into the act"
"length outside off, it was threatening to shape back in but started too wide, left alone"
"this one's a full inswinger on the pads, he falls over a little as he flicks to square leg but gets enough bat for one"
"short one with Pollard keen to come forward, lets it through to the keeper"
"another short one, this one's far too high and called wide"
"length and shaping away nicely outside off, Pollard wants nothing to do with it"

"length around off, opens the face and steers it towards point who comes running in quickly to keep the batsman on strike"
"this one's in the slot, full around off, he makes room and that's the first real shot of authority, clubbed down the ground"
"shorter but not short enough, about waist height, Hetmyer makes a little room again, opens up and hammers a pull flat and hard in front of square"
"slower ball, deceives him completely as he is late to adjust his bat speed as it comes down, gets an inside edge towards short fine"
"full, inswinger that starts outside off, Pollard defends to the off side with an open face"
"length outside off, leaves him after pitching a little, another knuckle ball, Pollard is beaten as he tries to dab it fine"
"full and straight, cramps him up, defended back to the bowler"
"how has he done that? It was full around middle and Pollard didn't even look like hitting it, just a flick and it carries over the deep square leg boundary. All timing"
"length around off, pushed into the off side for one"
"full on middle and leg, Hetmyer misses the flick and is struck on the pad, they come through for a leg as the ball trickles into the off side. India have reviewed it, a poor review, the sort you now almost expect them to take, it always seemed to have pitched outside leg, replays confirm that"
"length on middle and leg, it's hardly a short ball to trouble Hetmyer, he opens up and hammers a pull over deep midwicket"
"slower ball, goes full and wide of off but Hetmyer showcases his range, blasts this flat and hard wide of mid-off"
"attempted yorker, low full toss, squeezed away to deep midwicket for one"

"googly straight up, Hetmyer was backing away, cramped for room, defends"
"quicker flatter one around middle, pushed along the ground to long-on for one"
"length outside off, it was pretty flat from Kuldeep, Pollard swats it down the ground, high and handsome over long-on for six"
"another one from the front of the hand, full on middle, clipped to deep square leg for one"
"slower this time, conventional leg break, turn and bounce to beat Hetmyer"
"another leg break, looks to cut but can't beat cover-point. Only eight from that despite the six"
"length around off, Pollard pushes to mid-off and takes off, Bhuvneshwar has a go at the non striker's end, but Pollard was back"
"<strong>dropped!</strong> India have been good so far but Shami spills this at mid-off, it was hit hard and flat to his right, at a slightly awkward height, but should have clung on to it"
""
"short slower one, Pollard sways out of the way, it's too high and called wide"
"full around middle, in the slot, he gets under it and clubs it wide of long-on, it wasn't even off the middle, the bottom hand drags it wide but enough power to take it well over"
"full and wide outside off, drilled down to long-off for one"
"full toss and angled across, Hetmyer was down on one knee and trying to slog it away towards deep midwicket, gets  a massive leading edge that lands short of long-off"

"full outside off, and Hetmyer shows he is no one trick pony, goes inside out this time, classy shot, flat and hard and wide of long-off, still six"
"<strong>change of angle does the trick but it had little to do with the wicket!</strong> Kuldeep could not have been luckier, it was a full toss from around the wicket, Hetmyer swung hard but mistimed it straight down long-on's throat. Leggies are notorious for striking off full tosses and long hops, here's one for Kuldeep"

"another googly, too wide this time, called so"

"full again, ends up as a half-volley on middle and off, driven sweetly past the bowler, and long-on sprints to his left to prevent the boundary"
"low full-toss on off stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"wrong'un, nice and slow, starting on middle and off and spinning further away. It's not full enough for Holder to hit confidently against the turn, and he has to reach well in front of his body to try and get to the pitch of it. Has to go for it anyway, such is the situation, and Manish Pandey sprints to his left at long-on to grab on to the steepling top-edge"
"slow teaser tossed up on off stump, spinning back in. Pollard defends into the covers"
"wrong'un, flat and short, spinning into a wide line and making Pollard reach out. Pollard flat-bats it back down the ground, past the non-striker, and a brilliant bit of work from the diving Pancdey, sprinting left from long-on, saves the boundary. Incredibly, Poillard didn't run at all because he was certain it was going for four"
"googly, gets forward for a push into the cover point region"
"tossed up on off stump, chipped back over the bowler's head off the front foot"

"back of a length, slanting away from off stump. Slashes hard with an angled bat and misses"
"back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face for a dabbed single to third man"

length ball angling into a wide-ish line outside off. Stays back and punches to extra-cover
"full, on the pads. Makes room and tries to squeeze an inside-out drive past extra-cover, but doesn't hit it far enough to the right of the fielder, or with enough power, to get more than a single"
"tossed up on off stump, and Pollard has launched that into the crowd. Drops down onto his back knee and slog-sweeps high over wide long-on"
"full and flat, marginally down leg. Looks to flick and misses, and Pant does well not to let it run away for byes. 109kph, one of the fastest balls Kuldeep must have ever bowled. Should that have been called wide?"
"length ball wide of off stump, and Pollard steps forward and across and drives up and over the cover boundary. Exceptional timing, and he met that with a firm base despite having to reach for it. Super shot"
"flat, full, on leg stump, driven powerfully down to long-off. Refuses the single. Why not - one more six off this over will help West Indies more than this single might have"
"there's that six. Or is it four? Stunning shot. That's not a short ball, but he moves his heavy frame with incredible quickness to jump deep in his crease and manufacture a bit of shortness of length. From that position, he shovels the ball hard and flat, straight onto the wide long-on boundary cushions. May have bounced a foot or so inside, maybe"
"flat again, on leg stump, goes back and whips it through midwicket"

"wow. Length ball on off stump, and he clears his front leg marginally and otherwise simply stands still and dismisses it into the stands beyond long-on"

"short outside off, gets up to chest height, and Pollard cracks a pull to deep midwicket"
"leg-stump yorker, clipped away to deep midwicket"
"gone. Another shoulder-high short ball from Bhuvneshwar. They're not easy to hit, especially from an off-stump line, and he goes for the pull and only gets it as far as the fielder at deep midwicket. End of an excellent innings from Pollard - he must have surely worried India considerably even though West Indies are still 100 runs away from their target"

"length ball, slides on towards off stump, tries to dab it to short third man and is beaten. Doesn't miss off stump by much"

"flat length ball angling in towards off stump, no turn. Presses forward and blocks into the off side"
"<b>dropped.</b> Length ball angling in towards leg stump. Looks to make room and drive it back hard. Hits high on the bat and hangs in the air, to the left of Bhuvneshwar, who sticks a hand out but can't hold on"
"slower length ball angling away from off stump. Hangs back and looks to cut, ends up bottom-edging it into the pitch, and it doesn't miss off stump by much"
"bouncer over middle and leg. Looks to hook but misses, too late on the shot"
"full, close to off stump, swiped away to deep midwicket, all along the ground"
"another six. 28th of the evening. Slower length ball close to off stump, and Williams clears his front leg and launches a flat, straight hit beyond the long-on boundary"
"well played. Slower bouncer over off stump, leans back and dabs it cleverly over the keeper's head"
"in the blockhole on off stump. Looks to make room and jab it away through the off side, only manages to play it back to the bowler off the inner half of the bat"
"gone, seven down. Length ball outside off, and he opens his bat face and scoops a simple catch to Jadeja at backward point. Was the knuckle ball, and he didn't pick it. Ended up with far less pace to work with than he'd anticipated"
"short ball outside off. Looks to pull and misses, and both bowler and keeper go up in belated appeal. Was there a thin edge? No reviews left for India, but there seemed to be a noise as ball passed bat"
"low full-toss on off stump, and he has enough room to scoop that over mid-off for another boundary"
"back of a length outside off. Looks to clear his front leg and slog it away over the leg side, but can't connect"
"and it will stay that way. Back of a length, offcutter. Looks to step away from the stumps and make room to swat through the leg side, but fails to make contact, and the ball spins from off stump and misses leg"
