"shortish delivery on middle, punched back to Nabi"
"slow turn, gets some purchase off the deck, bunted to the man coming in from cover"
appeal for lbw again as he shapes to play a sweep. Not sure there was pad on that. Square leg swoops in to fire a throw at the striker's end but misses. They scamper a run
"flatter one on middle and leg, turned to square leg, Nabi was slow to move across, excellent match awareness from the batsmen to pinch two"
defended back to the bowler
"on the pads, defended straight to midwicket"
"slow turn into middle and leg, eased to short midwicket"
gets across the stumps and turns it to square leg
"drifting away but from around the stumps, turned to short fine leg."

"the bouncer sails over the ducking batsman's head. Too high, says the ump."
genuine <b>outside edge</b> as he comes reaching for a fuller delivery nipping away outside off stump. Lucky there aren't any slips
"hides deep in his crease to deal with a flat dart from over the wicket. Eventually though, out comes the punch to long-on"
"seems both men prefer playing Hamza from the crease, lulled perhaps by his flat trajectory. But this is a full delivery, angling into the pads. Good on Hope to adjust by keeping his hands low and flicking lat to square leg"

"feigns a move outside leg, but Hamza fires it in just outside off. Block"
pushes a fuller delivery outside off to short cover
brings down a straight bat in line with a tossed up ball on middle
clips it off his thighs to short midwicket
"well taken by the man coming in from deep point. He comes into play as a result of a shot Lewis likes to play - the on the up smack over extra cover. But this time though the ball goes off the outside edge, swirls in the wind and makes a lot of demands of Hamza, who responds to them all well by appropriately moving to his right."

blocks a ball heading for the top of off stump to point
slaps a short delivery to the sweeper cover
cracks a fine looking cut shot to the right of deep third man to get off the mark
drills a flat delivery to midwicket
a little more flight and he drives the ball to long-on
fires it in and Mohammed going back is beaten for pace as the ball hurries in off the pitch and pins him on the pads. Would have missed leg so the appeal is shot down
"a little more flight, but the batsman is still not comfortable coming forward. Weathers another lbw appeal, and this too would have slid down"
""
"tosses it up outside off, drives through to the sweeper. That brings drinks on the field"
blocks a fuller delivery into the covers where Rashid is prowling
"drills a full delivery through to mid-off. Honestly, it's a game of pin-ball today. The ball pings off the middle straight to the fielder"
"shortish and outside off - might have stuck in the pitch a bit, judging from Hope checking his cut shot. Single past cover's left"
guides a short ball to point. How very kind. Naib should send him a gift basket
"back of a length and outside off, offers no shot"

brings him forward with a flighted delivery outside off. Block
"works a shortish delivery to long-on, and Nabi isn't able to cut across to his right without colliding with the non-striker"

pushes a shortish delivery outside off to cover
"tosses it up on middle, defends"
"<b>oh he's gone</b>! Extra bounce does him as he backs away to cut. Fine catch from Zazai considering the ball came off the top edge. He moves with the ball and the batsman, gets up high as he needs to be, doesn't take it at the first grab, but the rebound works. <b>But wait</b>, the umpires are asking for a second opinion. Seems they're trying to see if the <b>ball hit Zazai's helmet grille</b>. The limited camera angles do seem to suggest there might be some contact made and Mohammed survives!"
"shortish and outside off, cut to deep point"
"quicker, flatter, on middle, punches it down to long-on"
"pushes a quicker, shorter delivery through a little too far outside off stump. Leaves it alone"
"tries to drive a flighted delivery on off stump, but the drift secures the inside edge"
"hangs back to a flatter, but fuller delivery, and saves himself by showing the full face of the bat"
loopy delivery - becomes a full toss - which is driven strongly through the covers
"finally! Spots the tossed up delivery and says you're mine. That was a slog sweep a long time coming, and what's more the ball's lost. New ones, please!"
"tosses it up on off stump, drives down to long-on"
"<b>outside edge</b> but there is no slip. Devilish bowling from Afghanistan. The threat doesn't seem apparent but balls like these - not spinning but instead drifting away from the right-hander, throwing him off balance as he reaches outside off to defend - keep coming"

"short and just outside off, but good footwork, moving him to his left allows him to cut the ball strongly to the sweeper"
turns a length ball into the leg side
punches a shortish delivery to short cover
"and he strikes first ball! He's like clockwork. So accurate. So deadly. Especially to batsmen who haven't faced him too many times. Here, Mohammed hangs back to a good length delivery, prodding at it with hard hands. There is just enough turn to snatch the outside edge and go through to slip"
"golden duck! Whoops of delight from the Afghanistan players, some of which might have come from Rashid himself who didn't even bother looking at the umpire. Bowls the googly, flummoxes the batsman completely, pins him on the pad and then just rushes over to celebrate with his team-mates"
"it's the googly again, and Carter is able to defend it off the back foot"
moves back to handle another delivery that goes on with the arm towards off stump
"goes for the sweep upon seeing a tossed up delivery outside leg. Another googly, turning to hit the pad"
<b>beats him with a snorter</b> and its the wrong 'un again. Pitching way outside leg and leering at the batsman as it goes past him to the keeper's gloves

"throws it up outside off, Carter ignores it"

pushes the open face of the bat out to a ball breaking properly away off this pitch. No run to point
""
"rapid delivery on off stump, slung off a round-arm action, pitching very full too. But it is a window into the minds of these West Indies batsmen and their ability to play spin that they keep hiding deep in the crease, looking to read the turn off the pitch. Cartner somehow manages to defend it"
"starts with the wrong 'un again. Hope does not read it as he shuffles across to block. Gets an inside edge onto pad, but it doesn't carry to the man under the lid"
"overpitched delivery, but it is sent back to the bowler"
"he has another, but credit for this should go to the slipper! What a catch! Nabi, moving swiftly to his left, low as well, sensational reflexes. He was brought into play by a legspinner from the legspinner - that's been rare today - which Hope prods at with no feet. Outside edge, academic. Catch, outstanding"
"through him! He's on a hat-trick again for the second time in two overs! What a talent! Nobody seems to be picking his googlies so he is tossing them out like fresh fruit. Lures Holder forward, makes the ball dip, and zip through the gap between bat and pad"
huge appeal for lbw but umpire Shamsuddin holds his ground and shakes his head. Nurse the new batsman goes for the slog sweep - did he pick the googly? - and is struck on the back pad. But it is outside off stump
"it's the one that turns the other way again, and West Indies insist on playing back to a man who is very happy to see them do so. Spins past Carter's defence and the only thing that saves him after he is hit on the pad is the ball making impact outside off."
"tosses it up outside off, Nurse swings blind and is beaten"

gives em the run around with the googly again and Carter stepping forward to block is beaten
"low full toss, nudges it to long-on"
"shapes to sweep, and then considering the ball turns into him, the right-hander, bizarrely, just pads up. But the ball must have bounced up and taken a bit of his glove because the umpire gives it as runs"
"huge appeal for lbw as a tossed up delivery is pushed down the ground. The appeal was for pad first, but it wasn't"
"tries the sweep again, but this delivery is too full for such a shot. Beaten. For those wondering, that was a googly too"
that's his fifth! He has bowled only 24 balls - and he has already changed the game on its head. That googly that is becoming the stuff of legend has another victim. Nurse plays back and is surprised by the swiftness and the magnitude of the turn off the pitch. Flicks all around it and is pinned lbw

pokes outside off at a full delivery - this one is the legspinner - and it too deceives him
seems to read the googly - off the pitch probably because it was short. Punches a single to point

"shortish and outside off, steers it down to third man"
thick outside edge flies past the first slip and brings up the West Indian hundred. We also have drinks
"appeal for a stumping, the wicketkeeper is quite confident, but the third umpire has been called to confirm. This is a googly, which Carter does not pick. Wafts at it with a drive, his front foot stretching out, but it stretches right back, and just in time too. Helpfully the wind has ceased and the bails had been on the stumps now."
noise as the legbreak slides down leg and Carter goes for a flick. Afghanistan are seriously excited now. They're going up for everything. This one comes off the thigh
'catch it' is the cry as Carter pulls - and even though this is a rank short ball Rashid's mastery is such that even with this he beats the batsman and hits him on the gut

"good length ball outside off, defends"
comes down the track and smacks the ball to long-on
"<b>leading edge</b> soars towards, who else, Rashid Khan at backward point. Lands beyond his reach as he runs to his left. There's a run-out chance as well with Joseph haring out only to get a no in response. Manages to reach safety before the throw"

"thumped down the ground. Too full, got underneath the length and lofted it straight. Rashid does well to slide across from long-on to cut that off"
"tails in a full ball on middle, squeezed to midwicket"
picked away easily. Full toss on the pads and he timed the flick beautifully to beat deep backward square leg. Is there something brewing?
"struck firmly but Hamza dives to his right, his wrong side, to stop that at extra cover"
"straight down the throat of midwicket. As easy as they come. Skiddy short delivery from Dawlat, Carter had no room to play a full-blooded pull but still ended up going through with the shot, no power whatsoever and the man placed specifically for that stroke didn't have to move an inch."

squared up but somehow manages to defend off the backfoot
play and a miss. Skids across the surface from length outside off. He looked to steer it off the backfoot
"as straightforward as decisions go for an umpire. You knew this was coming. Predictably a wrong'un that fizzes back in from outside off, Joseph plays back to a delivery he should have well been forward, the ball spins back in to beat the inside edge and pin him plumb in front. No sooner than Rashid turned back to appeal, the umpire's finger was raised."
