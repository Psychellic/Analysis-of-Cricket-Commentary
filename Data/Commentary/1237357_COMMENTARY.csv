"pitched up in the channel, again Karunaratne is well across his stumps and lets the ball go"
"pitched full, Perera is forward and seizes on the drive ball, punches a couple through the covers to get the scoreboard ticking"
"starting off round the wicket, shortens his length and KJP has a woolly woof at this"
"over the wicket now, short and targeting the ribcage, gets his arms up out of the way"
"pushed across the bows, 139kph and inviting him to drive again, Perera leaves this be"
"straighter line of attack, 137kph and Perera wears it on the body as the delivery shapes back and tucks him up"

"length, 132kph and holding its line, back to leaving"
"pitches this on a length in the channel, again Karu is happy to leave those all day long"
"impressive bounce from Nortje this time, has Perera fending at it on the back foot, fails to connect"
"hammers the deck, 144kph and Perera is in all sorts of trouble, <b>takes the blow on the body</b>... Just couldn't get out of the way, though he avoided getting glove/bat on it"
"<b>145kph</b>, nearly dragged on! Stuck in the crease, prods tentatively and it rolls away past leg stump off the inside edge"

"diligent lines, zipping through in the corridor, the batsman shoulders arms"
"touch fuller, 132kph and defended on the front foot"

"length, on the pads and deflected wide of de Kock, Karunaratne quickly declines the run"

"better length, 143kph and he defends this towards midwicket, head down"
"<b>rips off the glove and that's the breakthrough!</b> Snorter and snortje! The short-of-length attack finally pays off, and it's Sri Lanka's captain who is extracted.

"frees his arms to <b>crash a length ball over the covers!</b> Slightly too short, but the width was the key factor: Perera latched onto it early, and thrashed it over the infield"
"KJP is cramped for room this time, flicking a back-of-a-length ball off the hip towards fine leg"
"<strong>slapped over mid-off for a one-bounce four!</strong> KJP is in the mood here. Width outside off again, and if this were a one-day game, I'd say this was in the slot. His feet stay still, and he thumps it over the man at mid-off"

"fuller, angled across the left-hander, and steered out towards point"
"<strong>beaten!</strong> That's a ripper. 82mph/132kph, awkward length, and angled across Thirimanne. He doesn't know whether to play or leave, and it nips away past his half-hearted prod"

"fuller on off stump, dug out back to Ngidi who fields in his follow-through"
"half-volley, <strong>slapped dead-straight down the ground for four more</strong>! Overpitched from Ngidi, and Perera makes him pay. It deflected slightly off Thirimanne's bat as he scrambled to make his ground in case Ngidi got a touch on it, but I reckon it would have been four either way"
"<strong>spanked for four more!</strong> Utter carnage from Perera. Slightly full of a length, and only a hint of width, but KJP's eyes lit up either way and he clubbed Ngidi over wide mid-on"

"length ball, nudged to short midwicket on the back foot and they race through for another sharp single"

"back of a length, looks to work for a single into the leg side but it trickles back towards Mulder"

"length ball, KJP shapes to club over the leg side but he can only find short midwicket on the bounce"
"back of a length, punched out towards cover"
"length ball, defended with a straight bat"
"<strong>edged, and dropped!</strong> Slightly back of a length, tentative prod with soft hands, and Elgar, at third slip, had to come forward and stuck out his hands, just above the ground. It threatened to stick but then spilled out, and he looks to be in some pain as a result. Stays on the field for now"

"slightly overpitched outside off, and Thirimanne presses solidly into the covers for a couple"
"hung outside off stump, and left alone"
"gone this time! <strong>Perera's fun comes to an end.</strong> That's how to bowl to Perera. Mulder's pace, or lack thereof, means he can't just throw the bat and get away with it. Length ball, not enough room outside off to free his arms, and instead a thick edge on a half-formed drive finds Markram in the cordon"
"<strong>chance, but it falls short!</strong> Another beauty aimed at the top of off stump, and Mendis pokes forward reluctantly. Played with soft enough hands for it to fall short of Elgar, who is back on the field at third slip"
"fifth-stump line, left alone"
"squeezed out into the covers, probing length in the off-stump channel"
"<strong>edged again, and gone this time! Mulder has two in the over!</strong> Perfect length again, with a hint of nibble away from the bat off the seam. Mendis' hands were harder this time, and it kissed the shoulder of the bat, looping up for a straightforward catch at first slip by RvdD. Almost squared him up"
"length ball, nudged towards midwicket to complete a double-wicket maiden for Mulder"
"<b>shot!</b> Sweet timing from Thirimanne. Length ball, angled across him from over the wicket, and he lunges forward to drive with a high front elbow. Holds the pose as it races away through extra cover"
"beaten this time! Squared up by a length ball in the channel, which zips past the outside edge"
"on a length, clipped towards square leg"

"<strong>edged, gone, and Mulder has three in no time!</strong> An innings to sum up Thirimanne's Test career. Slightly full of a length, angled across him as he looked to clip into the leg side, but a hint of nip away off the seam means it takes the edge. Faf takes a sharp low catch at second slip, and Thirimanne throws away a start, just before the interval, and just as he was starting to look set"

"picks up his first boundary in Test cricket. Length ball, Bhanuka stayed tall, shifting his weight back, and square-driving through point for four. Super shot"
"<strong>and it brings a wicket!</strong> Back of a length and some extra bounce, and Bhanuka decides to play at it. It gets big on him, takes the outside edge near the splice of the bat, and flies to first slip where RvdD takes an excellent catch. A nothing shot, if truth be told, and Bhanuka will be furious at himself to get out to the last ball of the session"
"pitched up, gets him coming forwards, <b>steered low wide of the cordon for four!</b> Dickwella off the mark, though the bowler won't mind seeing him play out there"
"shortish, 123kph down the leg side, swish and a miss"

"fullish on the stumps, poked back"
"full again, 139kph and creeping through low to give de Kock a difficult take, wide enough to leave alone"
"<b>another difficult take but de Kock swallows it!</b> Thick edge as Dickwella drove away from his body, and Quinny went soaring full length to his left to take the catch! May well have carried to first slip, but the captain takes responsibility, and SL slip further into trouble"

"pitched up, tad straight and he clips it neatly off his front pad through midwicket for couple more"
"<b>creamed through the leg side</b>, Hasaranga shows some lovely timing off his pads this time! Mulder targeting the stumps, but the ball goes fizzing away via some revolving-door wrists"
"<b>battered over backward point this time!</b> Don't look back in Hasaranga, he's an oasis of calm out there... short and wide and slapped for another boundary!"
"Nortje finds a testing length in the channel outside off, play and a miss"

"drops a little shorter, Shanaka jumps into line and lets it go"
"pitched up, moves across to punch towards mid-on, who makes a stooping stop"
"climbing to hit the outside half of the bat, the edge goes low towards the cordon, and du Plessis does well to get a hand down and prevent it running away"

"pushed in a little straighter, tapped down towards short midwicket"
"<b>gottim!</b> Big booming drive without foot movement and he nicks behind... or does he? Shanaka <b>reviews</b>, though it seems more out of hope than expectation as UltraEdge quickly reveals a feather. Nortje has his fourth, and the smell of blood in his nostrils"

"digs this in, coming back at the right-hander, who prods it down from the crease and picks up one"
"round the wicket, banged in at the body, <b>looping chance high and wide of de Kock</b>... actually, I think Quinny knew that was off the thigh pad and didn't waste energy leaping after the ball"

"tight on off, 129kph, short of a length and he dabs it down square for a single"

"hits a good length, 136kph and straightening a <i>smidge</i> to beat Chameera's forward poke"
"slightly shorter, and he lines this up with a block into the covers"
"<b>should be run out coming back for two</b>... but the throw from the deep is poor! Flicked through square leg, Hasaranga presumably wants to be on strike for the next over but Chameera looks a long way short, only for Maharaj's relay back to the keeper to leave de Kock with too much to do"
"feathered behind, and <strong>Hasaranga falls straight after drinks!</strong> Length ball on fifth or sixth stump, and Hasaranga poked at it dozily, away from his body. He reviews, but UltraEdge confirms a spike, and de Kock took a straightforward catch behind the stumps. Sipamla gets his first, and Sri Lanka are deep in the mud"
"edged, and <strong>Bavuma shells it!</strong> Bavuma was in at fourth slip, one of six. Dangled the bat reluctantly in the channel outside off. Straight into the hands as he lunged forward, and straight out again. Bavuma furrows his brow"
left alone outside off stump
"length ball, keeps a little low, and Vishwa jams the bat down, defending towards cover"

"short ball, in at the ribs, and it drops just short of Bavuma, in under the helmet at short leg"
"<strong>gone this time! Nortje has five and lets out a broad grin!</strong> 89mph/143kph, short ball aimed at the badge of the helmet, and Chameera swats carelessly at it. He gets a decent edge on it, giving de Kock his fifth catch of the innings - four of them off Nortje. Sri Lanka nine down."

"tries the same trick again, stepping outside leg, but this time an 89mph/144kph short ball flies past his right shoulder"
"<strong>tiiiiiimber!</strong> Six-for for Nortje. Asitha has realised that there's only so much point trying to survive when facing 90mph/145kph rockets, and swings the bat wildly once more, jumping towards the leg side. But Nortje fires in a yorker, and Asitha looks round to see middle stump out the ground, and leg stump angled towards square leg. Nortje leads the team off, with career-best figures of 6 for 56 to his name."

"deep in the crease, worked down to long leg for a couple"
"full, outside leg stump, and Elgar shovels off his pads for <strong>four more</strong>! Another half-volley, if truth be told, and that is Elgar's strong zone. Take a look at his wagon wheel below, if you don't believe me."

"short ball, Elgar ducks underneath it. 86mph/139kph - that's more like it, Asitha"
"worked through midwicket for four. Tailing in towards the off stump, and Elgar clips effortlessly off the pads"

"<b>tonked in front of point, and that'll be his century!</b> Let's out a shriek of delight as the ball races away - 13th Test ton for Elgar, and he makes sure to go on this time, after that 95 at Centurion. Plenty of love up on the SA balcony for his efforts"

uneasy defence as Shanaka snakes a lifter into the gloves from a good length. Awkward pop once more
"<strong>exceptional bowling!</strong> After unnerving Faf with the lifter one ball earlier, Shanaka probed that uncertainty on a fuller length with a hint of nibble off the pitch, and a skimming edge was scooped up by Dickwella! South Africa have lost their stranglehold since drinks!"
"short, and whisked out through midwicket with a pivot of the heel"

"<B>well, that's a fine way to go to lunch!</B> Very full, right in the slot, and Mulder unfurls an imperious on-drive, clean through long-on!"
"over the wicket, short length at 129kph and Bavuma helps helps it off his hip behind square"
"struck on the full - <b>given!</b> Looked a touch leg side to me, though, and Mulder reviews Adrian Holdstock's decision. What does Hawk-Eye say? <b>Umpire's call on impact</b>, Mulder's a goner! That was <i>so</i> tight, I'm not sure of the exact margins employed, but definitely appeared to be outside the line of leg stump to the naked eye. But the decision stands, and Mulder walks off disappointed"
"on the stumps, worked behind square on the leg side to get going"
"pitched full, some shape back in for Vishwa, this ricochets off the inside edge behind square on the leg side"
"goes round the wicket now, drifting on to the pads with the angle and Bavuma works it in front of deep square leg for three"
"fullish, tailing in as Maharaj props forward, deflects to leg for one more"
"pitched up and shaping away outside off, left alone"
"good length, 135kph in the channel, holding its line as Maharaj creeps on to off stump and leaves"
pitched up and tapped away off side
"nicely bowled, curling away and dragging Maharaj across his stumps, manages to keep his bat inside the line"
"zip from a good length, Maharaj is hanging back and beaten outside off"
"<b>gets him this time, Asitha rips out another!</b> Beautiful line, curved like a scimitar and whipping wickedly through to Dickwella via the outside edge! Second wicket of an impressive debut for Asitha, who's brought some spunk to this attack. SA rocking a little on their heels here"
"over the wicket, on the stumps and tapped away"
"back of a length, calmly shows it the face of the blade"
"<b>dropped!</b> Flashed straight through the hands of gully! Thick outside edge from Bavuma as Fernando drew the stroke from round the wicket, <b>but Shanaka didn't lay a glove on it!</b> All going off out there now"
fullish and prodded into the covers half forward
"fired in straight, Bavuma covers his stumps"
"sharp out-break from Vishwa, scrambled seam and darting away past Bavuma's angled bat... no bat involved, although that didn't save Temba a week ago"
"in the channel, 135kph and Nortje lets his first ball go"
"<b>finds the edge but this flies wide of the slips for four!</b> Good areas, good pace and Nortje feels for it away from his body, but his luck is in"
fuller on off stump and bunted away
"back of a length, 131kph and he stabs the ball down towards backward point"
"scuttles through, clips the toe of the bat as Nortje jabs at it late, <b>doesn't carry to slip!</b> But Asitha is pouncing and pawing like a cat among the pigeons out there"
"trundles in again, good shape away from the right-hander, Bavuma trusts the bounce and lets it go - keeps Nortje on strike for Vishwa"
"round the wicket to Nortje, clips the pads and runs wide of Dickwella"
"fired in straight, looking for lbw but it's played neatly through backward square for a single"
"short of a length, Bavuma gets on his stepladder to defend"
"in the channel, Bavuma steers it in front of backward point, Nortje sends him back as the fielder races in"
"<b>drilled through mid-on</b> - literally in this case, as Kusal Perera dives over the ball, giving Bavuma four!"
"<b>shoulders arms and that's salmon and trout!</b> Bavuma is going to review this, but Vishwa has done him like a kipper here... Slippery in-ducker and Hawk-Eye has it <i>smashing</i> into middle and off! Temba blunders again, padding up to a straight one, and even the technology can't save him from this misjudgement. SL's quicks rampant"
"punched in front of point, Nortje wants two to keep the strike, and Sipamla could be struggling... but Asitha is nowhere near the stumps when collecting the throw and the chance is gone"
"length ball, angling in at 138kph, blocked towards cover"
"shaping away, too wide to make Nortje play"
"full length, 134kph and he pokes this cautiously towards point"
"back of a length, Nortje bounces into line and defends"
comes across on off and steers one into a gap in front of square
"<b>angles the bat, keeps it down and picks up four!</b> Pitched up on off, 131kph and Nortje does well to glide it through backward point"
"full on off stump, punched to mid-off"
"<b>bagged at slip, Vishwa has four!</b> Attacking line, and the ball straightens enough from round the wicket to clatter the outside edge and fly to second, where Mendis stays low to grab it at shoulder height! SL are lovin' it, lovin' it, lovin' it"
"<b>straight through him</b>, holding its line as Ngidi attempts an on drive to his first ball, clears middle and off!"
"<b>clattered through the off side</b>, another ambitious shot but he connects this time, smoking four to the cover rope!"
"fired in straight, shows this one a straight bat in defence"
"fullish around off stump, Sipamla blocks"
"angling in, tight lines and again he shows it the maker's name"
"pitched up, 137kph and looking for that fatal nibble, Sipamla defends resolutely again"
"digs in the bumper, well directed but Sipamla spots it and adjusts in time to duck"
wide of the stumps and ignored
"pitched up and met with a defiant front dog, pushed to cover"
"length on the stumps, <b>Ngidi has smoked this down the ground!</b> Driven on the up and timed so well it leaves mid-on in its dust"
"<b>gloved over the keeper!</b> More runs for Ngidi, not that he knew much about it... Over the wicket, dug in short and he fended it awkwardly up and over"
"length ball, big old yahoo from Ngidi fails to connect"
"bunted into the ground back to the bowler... although SL think it might have gone straight up. The umpires are going to check, but no, it's definitely a bump ball"
"pitched up in the channel, Ngidi flaps it towards mid-off on the bounce"
"fullish and driven again, this time along the carpet to mid-off"
"<b>sconed him!</b> Straight up off the helmet and taken by the bowler in his follow through! Asitha, in true fast bowler fashion, appeals for caught and bowled, but I don't think Ngidi got his hands anywhere near it"
"digs it in again, 139kph but the line is a touch wider and he sways out of the way this time"
"bumper, right over the left earlobe as Ngidi as an unsuccessful swish at it"
"thunders down another short ball, leg side and well over shoulder height this time, ignored"
"fizzer from back of a length, rising through past Ngidi's hack across the line"
"and he concludes an over of rib-ticklers, not quite short enough to be a bouncer and wide enough that is sails through past another attempted swipe"
"length ball on the stumps, Sipamla defends"
"full outside off, <b>Sipamla nails a cover drive for his first runs in Test cricket!</b> In the slot and crunched, brings up the SA 300"
"goes back over the wicket, struck on the thigh pad as the ball veers back"
"back-of-a-length ball, 131kph and worked away to square leg"
"Ngidi gets the bumper treatment from Vishwa now, fended in the air but short of gully"
"round the wicket, another short ball but he's down early as it flies through over his left shoulder"
"back of a length, jabbed down to the leg side"
"dropped on a length, Sipamla covers his stumps shuffling across"
"back of a length, 133kph and taking the bottom glove but he keeps it down towards backward point"
"dug in, 135kph bouncer but it clears the batsman"
"round the wicket, back of a length and jabbed down into the off side"
short but angled across outside off and he can hang back and leave
"back of a length, whizzing through to the keeper, left well alone"
patted into the covers
"back of a length, tight line, solid in defence"
"back of a length again, outside off, stabbed to gully, and <B>VIshwa Fernando has his five-for!</B> Hugely deserved, and smiles all round for Sri Lanka. They have clawed their way back from oblivion with a big two-hour stint"
"round the wicket, very tight line, thumping the knee-roll right back on the stumps, but doing too much"
"good lift from an awkward full length, angling back into the batsman, and blocked via the pad-flap down into the crease"
"full length, and pushed back down the pitch"
"on the back foot, wafted to the leg side, Ngidi's line is giving no width whatsoever"
nurdled to the on side
"outside off, climbing through to the keeper. A very tidy maiden to open proceedings"
right behind the line to block back down the pitch
"leg-stump line, fenced off the thigh-pad, that threatened to be quicker than it actually was, but still a rapid 137kph. In fact that wasn't just thigh-pad, it squelched the bottom hand as well, and the physio is out with the magic spray"
"leaning onto the front foot, but weight still anchored on the back. An unconvincing block to the full-length ball"
"poked to square leg, full and leg-sided"
tucked to the leg side once again
"stretching out of the crease, pushed to cover, thoughts of a hopeful single but no way through there"
"an ambitious waft on a very wide line, careful!"
"<B>that's the money shot from Ngidi!</B> Perfect line from round the wicket, impeccable seam position, zipping back off the deck, through the slenderest of gates as Perera throws his hands into a cramped drive, and plinking off the top of the leg bail! South Africa are up and running, and well, just as well there are no tickets to refund for day three onwards!"
fenced back down the line
"outside off, through to the keeper with a watchful backwards glance"
"outside off, through to the keeper, slight late bend through the air as his seam position does the talking"
"full and stump-threatening, attacking the front pad but a slight inside-edge spares any lbw appeals"
"poked off the hip, Nortje's line has been very leg-sided to the leftie"
"<strong><em>that's </em>the line for Nortje!</strong> Zipping from middle-and-leg, past a vertical bat, so close to the edge!"
"fired down the leg side as he loses his bearings again, 87mph that time"
"on the pads, poked to square leg"
"<B>pop from a good length<B>, and so close to the second wicket! Explodes into the gloves, and point has to scramble to gather the looping chance, but it falls just short"
firmly into line to defend
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"climbing off the seam from round the wicket, no stroke offered"
"<strong>edged and clean through the gap at fourth slip!</strong> Hard hands from Dimuth, a hint of shape away, and there's no intercepting that!"
"outside off, left alone on a wider line"
"thrashed through point, in the air for a time once again, and through the clutches of Maharaj on the half-volley. They think about a third but wisely think again"
"clobbered off the back foot, out to point again"
"outside off, and lifting off the seam, a well-judged leave"
"full length, away swing, a toe-ended drive to short cover"
pumped into the covers again
"sharp pace, 146kph, but wide enough line to leave"
"hard-handed drive, tight line, gathered at mid-off"
"head right over the ball, stretching forward to the 90mph blockhole ball"
"inducker from round the wicket, clipped in the air for a while, but with the cordon packed there's oodles of space at deep midwicket. Runs are the next best thing to mere survival!"
"width, and an off-balance slash, can't connect"
"wider line from round the wicket, no stroke offered"
"fuller length, homing in on that off-stump line, forcing Karunaratne to make a decision, which he does with a confident leave"
"outside off, wider line on a full length, another easy leave"
doesn't get up as much as Ngidi probes away outside off once more
"solid block, right behind the line as Nortje attacks the top of off"
"jammed down into the crease as Nortje gets this one to pop, the ball rolls dangerously close to off stump but Thirimanne is alert to the danger"
"<strong>inside-edge and so nearly a chop-on!</strong> Too cramped to cut, and how he got away with that, only the ball knows!"
"<strong>now that's what he was lining up!</strong> Another fling of the bat, but this time with a planted front foot, a high elbow and a ferocious followthrough, through the covers!"
"shoulders arms, outside off stump"
"lifting off the seam, through to the keeper with another good leave"
"hitting the seam from the outset, blocked on the walk outside off"
"lift from an awkward length, he's finding that extra bounce at a high-medium pace again"
"tighter line, on the pads, nudged to square leg"
nudged off the legs
"fired out wide, trying to tempt the wild hacked drive, but too wide to chase this time"
"firm in defence once more, and that will be <B>tea</B>"
"length ball, angled across from over the wicket, Thirimanne leans out and sniffs the breeze as the ball zips by"
"similar line, <b>145kph</b> in the channel, again he watches it through"
"goes round the wicket now, pitched up a couple of feet outside off, 142kph and left alone"
"angled in a little closer to the stumps, short of a length and Thiri drops the hands"
"hurls the ball down very full and wide of the stumps, nothing doing"
"<b>skelped through cover point</b>, that's a lovely response from Thirimanne... 144kph in the channel and he just open the face on a drive. Sanga would be happy with that"
"over the wicket, just short of a length and Karunaratne tucks to mid-on"
"on the stumps, 125kph and nudged off the pads"
"length ball, Karu is watchful in the crease and works it to midwicket"
"slightly short, he drops back to help the angle for cutting, picks up a couple through backward point"
"<b>rattled off the legs, races away to deep midwicket!</b> Straight out of the middle as he eases a confidence-bolstering four off the back foot"
"length in the channel, 126kph and no stroke offered"
"146kph in the corridor, wide enough for Thirimanne to ignore"
"back of a length, the eyes light up as he goes to cut but some Joburg juice takes it whistling past the outside edge"
"<b>times the pants off this!</b> Gets a stride in and snaps shut on a drive ball, sends it racing to the cover boundary"
"better length, <b>149kph from Nortje</b> but it's calmly defended coming across"
"short, climbing through in the channel, Thiri is quickly down on his haunches after moving into line"
"another lickety-split bumper, 146kph and fizzing through over the ducking batsman"
"on the stumps, defended to leg"
"tempter, full and wide at 127kph, Karu drops back and watches it by"
"length on middle and off, tucked away watchfully... and Mulder had overstepped"
"hangs this one out in the corridor, no stroke required"
"touch shorter outside off, 126kph and he punches off the back foot into the covers"
"floats a lollipop ball wide of off stump, Thirimanne isn't tempted"
"tighter line, 128kph and straightening on the left-hander as he drops back to defend"
"back over the wicket, full around off at 146kph and Karunaratne drives, gets a thick inside edge through square leg"
"back round, <b>146kph</b> and full enough to drive, a misfield at mid-on gives them one more"
"over the wicket to Karunaratne, 145kph bumper and it demands evasive action"
"length on off stump, <b>150 clicks from Nortje</b>, defended solidly"
"dug in, 145kph but he's ready and waiting, <b>biffs a pull through midwicket for four!</b> Stares down the SA quick man"
"on the pads, uses the pace again, <b>zips four in front of the deep square boundary rider!</b> Lanka captain carrying the fight here"
"dangles a 127kph delivery outside off, Thiri happy to leave alone"
"pitched up and skidding into the pads as he overbalances... think it landed outside leg stump, but that's a good line of attack for Mulder"
lets this one through in the channel outside off
"pitched up, 129kph and again not coming back enough to make Thirimanne play"
"<b>belted down the ground!</b> Pitched full and he tonks through the line, slightly uppish but Mulder was never getting a hand to it"
"pushed across the bows, on a length and left"
"round the wicket, angling in on the stumps and defended"
"drops a touch short and Karu throws his bodyweight into a mistimed pull, the ball whizzes through beneath the bat"
"just back of a length, Karunaratne tries to get forward to drive but is beaten by the ball going away from him"
"<b>punched back in the air</b>, Sipamla can't react in time! Struck well because it ran all the way, but it was a nice height to the bowler's right, <i>just</i> misses the fingertips!"
"angled in on a length, 133kph and tucked to leg"
stays back and steers one into the covers
lets this one go in the channel
"good length on middle and leg, 129kph and Karunaratne defends with head bowed over his blade"
shuffles across and taps the ball back
"pitched up, leg-stump half-volley and <b>Karu whips it away to deep square!</b> Umpire Holdstock has to dodge as it flies by at head height"
"128kph in the channel, lets the ball go"
"back of a length, waits for it and fends one more to the square leg region"
on the stumps and nudged towards mid-on
"fullish, 137kph and bunted into the covers coming forward, 'No!' is the call, which is proved a good one when cover hits direct at the non-striker's end"
"140kph, hangs this out in the channel, no stroke"
"back of a length on the stumps, Karu nudges to leg"
"touch short of a length, the batsman is back and across and punches a drive, Sipamla fields in his follow through"
"pitched up, 141kph and driven into the covers without timing"

"angling in on a fullish length, deflected behind square leg with a turn of the wrists"
"length around off stump, blocked coming across"
"pitched full, 126kph and Karu checks his drive, Mulder sticks out and hand in his follow through"

"full outside off, 128kph and he connects with a drive, but Mulder again gets a hand down to it"
goes back and across and dabs one more behind point
"length, 138kph in the channel, Karunaratne chops this into the turf and they rotate the strike again"
<b>thrashed through point on the square drive!</b> Ab-so-lutely blooters this to the rope for a crowd-pleasing four (you'll have to imagine the crowd for yourself)
"good comeback, holding its line after drawing him forward to drive, <b>beats Thirimanne on the outside</b>"
"<b>does him again</b>, though probably saved by the length... Scrambles the seam and gets it to jag away with Thiri stuck on the crease, misses the edge by some way"
"back of a length, 136kph and zipping through again, feeling for it outside off"
"<b>slashed over gully and away!</b> Width on offer and he throws the bat, gets a good chunk of it for four"
"<b>spiked on the thumb</b>, that's going to hurt in the morning! Kicks from a length to hit the bottom hand, flush on the end of the thumb - and he's going to need some treatment here"
full and straight and flicked around the corner to get Karunaratne off strike
"pitched up in the channel, <b>Lahiru butters his parsnips for four more!</b> They are flying on the 'veld now, well forward and he opens the face to slice it hard behind square"
"<b>clipped off the pads, back-to-back boundaries!</b> Too straight from Mulder and he pings it through midwicket"

"angled in on the stumps from round the wicket, tapped away to leg"
"dug in short, Karunaratne was across and looking to pull but it got big on him, bailed out late"
"goes full, 142kph and he seizes on the drive, sends it back to the bowler on the bounce"
"pitched up and <b>crunched down the ground!</b> Hits through the line, neat-looking on drive for four"
"full and thumped past mid-on again, not such a clean connection but it goes the same way... <b>Half-century for the skipper</b>, first since late 2019 in Tests, and he's leading from the front"
"fired into the pads, deflected square on the leg side"
"short and wide, flogged through point to the sweeper"
"length around off stump, Thirimanne gets across"
"tight line, 131kph and coming back in as Thirimanne leaves, knew that would be bouncing over"
"shortish on the stumps, defended from the crease"
"length, 131kph on fourth stump, driven on the up into the covers but he sends his partner back"
"<b>gone, tickled down the leg side!</b> A tame way to go, and that sums up Thirimanne's career, really... Nothing ball on the hip, maybe a bit of extra bounce, but he only succeeds in getting a touch of glove through to de Kock. Disappointment writ large for the tourists. SA are back in it"
"pitched up and <b>stroked through point coming across</b>... More punchy stuff from Karunaratne, skimming another drive for four"
"full, straighter line, 138kph and pushed towards mid-on"
"length on off stump, poked back down the track"
"shortish outside off, tapped down"
"whipped aerially over the leg side, Mulder is in the deep but seems to lose the ball, has to scoot around to his right to prevent it bouncing away for four"
"back of a length, 134kph, zips through past the bottom edge as Karu attempts to pull"
"would you believe it, <b>another strangle down leg!</b> Flying catch by de Kock and Mendis goes first ball for a pair! Went straight off the face of the bat, on another day it flies for four - but this time the keeper was there, two-handed to his left, similar to his take in the first innings to get Dickwella. Mendis curses his luck as he slopes off. Meanwhile, Ngidi is on a hat-trick!"
"outside off, through to the keeper with good carry"
"fenced down into the leg side, Ngidi hobbles in his followthrough after landing awkwardly, but he'll live"
"through to the keeper once more, round the wicket and outside off"
"drawn onto the front foot, a firm flog to the diving short cover"
a wicket maiden as another one flies through outside off
"crashed back to the bowler, on the drive from round the wicket"
"on the front foot, pumped to mid-off, reaching for the drive"
"short and swatted round the corner, a touch toe-ended out to Ngidi at backward square who hobbles round to gather"
"stretching forward, poked to cover with an angled bat"
"flashed on the up through the covers, where Elgar makes a hash of a simple pick-up and away it races to the rope"
"keeps low, scudding towards middle and leg and chiselled off the pads with a late stab of bat"
"lifting through to the keeper from around the wicket, keeping things tight"
"hitting the deck hard, just back of a length. More good carry. Some fly, a few scuttle..."
"kneeling into a drive, not quite timed, mid-off collects"
"bottom-handed flog, clean down the ground, and Karunaratne's stranglehold of Sri Lanka's run-rate is intensified!"
"<strong>battered, violently, through Ngidi's clutches!</strong> Technically a chance, but he hit it so hard and straight, that the bowler barely had time to change direction and gather"
"zipping past the edge on a wide line, no real danger of snagging it"
"banged in short, attempts to draw the hands inside the line, but instead is squared up and fends out to gully"
"on the hips, hitting the deck, shrugged down to backward square for another single"
"goes for the pull ... and <strong>what a sensational take from Maharaj!</strong> It's a sharp delivery from Nortje, rising from just back of a length at 150kph, and slamming the top edge as Bhanuka is too late on the stroke. But there's a lot of work to do, running back at midwicket, where Maharaj flings himself full-length, clings on his fingertips, and from a promising platform, Sri Lanka are unravelling at pace!"
"short, <B>snortingly short! </B>Clean over the keeper's head!"
"there's some wheels in that delivery! 92mph, and battering the splice as Karunaratne hops back and across in self-preservation"
"keeps low, and so nearly plinks out the off stump as Karunaratne's wafty pull finds thin air!"
"welcome to the Bullring! Back of a length, snagging the seam and jagging past an upraised bat!"
"outside off, a raise of the bat to let it zip through"
"head over the ball, pressed with a full face into the covers"
"edged, but that's well played, very soft hands, taking all the sting off a good old-stump delivery, as slip gathers with a fumble"
"edged again, but down into the ground again, an angled bat taking the ball down but keeping the slips interested"
"outside off with more carry to finish a probing over, left alone with a lift of the hands"
"fenced through third man, and<strong> that'll help the Bannerman race!</strong> Soft hands once more from Dimuth, riding the bounce"
"aggressive line, into the ribs, an uncomfortable flinch to the leg side, but another single"
"another stab through third man! The two left-handers are taking it in turns to tease the cordon right now. But both playing with admirably soft hands, so no danger there"
"banged in short, Dickwella tries to reach it with a dickscoop, but he's far too short"
wafted off the back foot into the covers

"more savage kick off the seam, ripping into QDK's gloves"
straightening off the deck again but met with a solid front-foot block
"back of a length, tight off-stump line, this is probing work from Ngidi, giving nothing away"
"<B>fenced in the air, and through the cordon!</B> Hard hands for a change from Dickwella, and so nearly the breakthrough! Dragged forward on a good length, pushing at the ball and so nearly curtains!"
"stabbed off the back foot into the covers, another single to the cause"
"<B>whoosh!</B> That has exploded from a good length, round the wicket, and high past the splice"
"leaning forward, head over the ball, second slip pounces to prevent any leakage"
"attacking the toes, clipped from middle and off out to acres of space on the leg side, and that brings up Dickwella's 2000th run, at a very healthy average, even if he hasn't yet got that hundred"

"back of a length, poked to the on-side once more"
"back of a length, and a wafty attempted cut, can't connect"

"inside-edge! A touch loose outside off, a big gate as he leans forward, but the deflection eludes his stumps"
"outside off, a wafty poke on the back foot. A bit too wide to go chasing those"
tighter line and left alone this time
left alone with a big wave of the bat
"<strong>a drive at thin air!</strong> Living a bit dangerously in these last few overs... need to knuckle down as Sri Lanka will be in credit soon, and then the game begins to swing again"

prodded off the front foot to cover
"yorker, and well dug out with a stab of bat, down into the toes"

"very wide line, Karunaratne cocks the rifle but doesn't pull the trigger on his cut shot"
"straighter, right up to the bat, solid thump through the line and that's four more to the skipper, clean down the ground. Quite some innings he's compiling here...."
"back of a length, round the wicket, no stroke offered"
"<strong>sliced over the slips, and so close to holing out!</strong> A calculated risk, and nearly a miscalculation, reaching for the wide one with an open face, and hoisted through the fingertips of du Plessis, leaping high at second slip. He's into the 90s... and Sri Lanka are into the lead!"

"banged in on a length from wide on the crease, worked down to long leg"
"short, not really wide enough to cut but Dickwella, the maverick, takes it on anyway. It hits high on the bat, and races away between point and gully for four"

"hung wide of the off stump, left alone. Good carry through to de Kock"
"overpitched, whipped down to long leg to nudge one run closer to his ton"
"presses forward, defending towards extra cover"
"length ball, defended calmly towards mid-off"
"length ball in the sixth-stump region, left alone"
"overpitched, and Dickwella <strong>drills through the covers for four!</strong> Half-volley on fifth or sixth stump, and the ball flies away off the middle of his checked drive"
"slightly full of a length at 93mph/150kph, and Karunaratne <strong>drives through the covers for four</strong>! Maybe a fraction too full, and enough width for Karunaratne to chase after it, moving to 97..."
"back of a length, wide, and <strong>cut away for four to bring up the ton!</strong> His 10th Test hundred, and his first outside of Sri Lanka since October 2017"
"fended away down to long leg for one. Extra bounce from Nortje, hitting Karunaratne high on the bat, possibly even on the handle"
"beats him! 92mph/148kph outside off, Dickwella comes forward shaping to drive, and it flies past the inside edge with a bit of nip in off the seam"
comes forward to defend. 92mph/148kph
"back of a length, stabbed out to deep point for a single"
"springy extra bounce from back of a length, and Dickwella does well to get himself out the way as he leaves it alone"
"<strong>lofted cover drive for four!</strong> What a start to the day from Sri Lanka. Length ball, maybe a fraction too full, and Dickwella decides to take it on. Of course he does. It's uppish, but there's no fielder there to worry about"
"shapes to upper-cut a back-of-a-length ball, but can't get bat on it"
"jags away viciously off the seam, beating Dickwella's outside edge. Exaggerated seam movement from round the wicket, and Dickwella is beaten all ends up"
shoulders arms outside off stump
defended firmly towards mid-off
"banged in on a length, nudged towards square leg. 89mph/143kph"
"bottom-edged cut towards cover-point, and they take a single. Karunaratne jogs through and is given the hurry-up as Bavuma fields, but his throw at the bowler's end is wide, and DK had made his ground either way"
"back of a length, fended behind square on the leg side"
"92mph/148kph, miscued out towards cover"
"<strong>skied up to square leg, and Mulder takes the catch!</strong> Oh Dimuth, what have you done? He's late on the shot, looking to pull a back-of-a-length ball, aimed into the body. The top edge loops up into the leg side, and Mulder hardly has to move to get underneath it. Nortje's extra pace makes the breakthrough, and Karunaratne has to go after a hard-earned ton"
"short ball at 89mph/144kph, which flies over everyone. This is why there's a long stop - or a very fine third man on the boundary - in place, to cope with Nortje's extra pace, and he cuts it off"
left alone outside the off stump
"back of a length outside off, cut behind square for four! Controlled, measured cut shot, just guiding the ball through the wide gully region with an open face"
"oh Dickwella. Oh Dickwella. What have you done? <strong>Why do you do these things?</strong> He has looked in good touch this morning but this is a truly dreadful shot. Slightly full of a length from Ngidi, nipping away off the seam, and he has a half-hearted, ill-conceived swipe at it, with his weight all over the place. He was looking to go down the ground or over mid-on, but it skews up off the edge, and Bavuma gets round to take the catch at mid-off. Ngidi has his fourth, and South Africa are threatening to do this in a hurry."

"beauty! Back of a length, nips away off the seam, and flies past the outside edge. Maiden"
defended back down the pitch
"half-volley on the stumps, pressed towards mid-on"
"precision engineering from Ngidi. Pitches on a length, shapes away from the right-hander off the seam, and it flies <i>just</i> past the outside edge, as Hasaranga covers his off stump"
"loose shot from Hasaranga. No foot movement, looking to shovel through mid-on, and he misses it completely. Poor batting from an allrounder. Ngidi has a chuckle in his follow-through, sensing a fifth wicket isn't far away"

sprayed very wide outside off. No shot. 91mph/146kph
left alone outside off stump
"straighter, but calmly worked down to long leg from a length for a single. A cry of frustration from Nortje, and that might be the end of his spell"
pushed into the covers
nibbling around a fourth-stump line on a good length. Shanaka defends
"back of a length, steered out towards point"
"fuller, defends watchfully"
"chipped up, and gone! <strong>Another tame, tame dismissal</strong>. Good length on off stump, no great menace in the delivery, and Shanaka plays a shot that is neither one thing nor the other. He looks to attack it, but almost realises during the stroke that he's making a grave error. That means it ends up being a half-hearted lunge, and it loops up into the grateful hands of Sipamla at mid-on."
"keeps a fraction low, and Chameera jams the bat down to defend"
"banged in at 91mph/146kph from round the wicket, and it flies up off the pitch, flying over the ducking batsman and well out of QdK's reach"

"<strong>whipped off the toes with aplomb!</strong> Overpitched and into the pads, and that was an emphatic response with a semi-helicopter followthrough"

"leaning forward, and pushed into the covers"
"wicket-to-wicket line, blocked with high hands back down the pitch"
"<B>slashed through third man!</b> No catcher at backward point, so that's safe enough once it had eluded gully. Weight not quite into the stroke, but valuable runs all the same"
"<B>nut!</B> That's unplayable. Shaping in on off stump, straightening and exploding past the splice. Did well not to touch that"
"<B>that's revolting!</B> A fraction fuller, and a hideous hack off a full length. Sipamla knocks back the off and middle stumps, and Sri Lanka's series is nearly cooked. For the fourth time this morning, a disciplined innings ends with a donation of a wicket. Those hopes of a three-figure target are distant now"
"angled bat, deflecting the full length through backward square to get off the mark"
"back of a length, slower ball, blocked on the front foot as he waits for the ball to come on"
"nip off the seam, jagging back into the pads, awkwardly blocked"
"<B>five for Ngidi!</B> Fernando is reviewing but de Kock is in no doubt. Good length, hitting the seam, zipping off the <strike>edge</strike> <B>not the edge!</B> That's flicked the back pocket. And Ngidi will have to go again"

dangling the bat outside off and dabbed into the covers
tapped into the covers
"<B>huge appeal!</B> For the second time in as many overs, there's an apparent catch behind the wicket, but this time it's South Africa reviewing. Climbing off the seam once again, and yep, this time there's a clear spike as the ball passes bat. Sri Lanka are nine down"
"full length outside off, a very No.11 drive as Fernando swings from well outside leg, and misses"
"<B>perfection to finish the innings!</B> Off stump line, nip off the seam, pace and aggression, pings past the outside edge of a not-very-well aligned batsman, and plucks out the off stump to wrap up an innings that promised much more first-thing this morning"
"back of a length, rising outside off, and a <B>kangaroo cut from Markram to get off the mark!</B> Rising up onto the balls of his feet, kicking his heels up as he slams through cover"

"round the wicket, aggressive length, rising into the gloves, fended out to point"

"back of a length, firmly into line to block back to the bowler"

"pushed back onto the stumps, as Vishwa hits the deck hard on a middle-and-leg line"
"<B>edged, and a stunning take at slip!</B> Wow, that was fast and fizzing, low to second slip, where Kusal Mendis scooped it up almost behind the body. The umpires are taking a second look, but his fingers look to be under the ball to me. The soft signal is out, so is there enough to overturn it? <B>Nope, it's been overturned!</B>"
"tapped into the leg side, the chastened Markram gets back into the runs"

"sharp bouncer! Whistles through as Elgar ducks uneasily, a better end to a woolly over"

"up on the toes, punched out to cover"
flicked off the legs to deep midwicket
"keeps a touch low outside off, poked with a crouch to point"
"angling into the right-hander, closes up in defence to push back to the bowler"

"fenced to the off side, sliding into line"
"signs of swing on a full length, but easily left alone"

"cramped on the back foot, pressed to cover"

"up on the toes, another controlled edge, down through third man. Too many gaps in the cordon to take any advantage, and Elgar marches on!"
"<B>yikes, that's a yahoo and a half!</B> Over-pitched, outside off, and the kitchen sink comes flying off the newly tiled wall as Elgar flings his entire body weight through the line!"
"outside off, left alone. A thoroughly underwhelming follow-up to the last non-shot"
"wide of off stump, swinging away, Markram cocks his bat but doesn't fire"
"<B>pouncing onto the front foot, and pumped through the covers!</B> Lovely high elbow guiding the stroke past a flailing fielder. The requirement is dwindling"
