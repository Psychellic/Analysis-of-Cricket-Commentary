attempts an inside out drive as he sees the ball tossed up outside off. Can't hit the gap at cover
steps forward and blocks the fullish delivery on off stump
"drives on the up, seeing as there's room for him to free the arms, but cover moves to his right and stops it well"
"<b>beats him</b> with a 140 kph delivery that pitches on a good length, tempts the airy-fairy drive, and nibbles away just enough to make the batsman look silly"
"<b>gorgeous shot</b>! He seems adept at pulling these off. The ball is climbing on him. It almost seems like it gathers pace off the pitch. But who cares about all that. Markram gets his body beside it, gets up on his toes so he's on top of the bounce and clatters it between point and cover."
"on the other side now, through midwicket, Very measured from Markram, responding to the bowler moving round the wicket with a simple dink through a yawning gap"
blocks a full delivery outside off
<b>half an appeal for lbw</B> as de Kock plays for turn but the good length ball from round the wicket just goes on with the arm. Might have slide down leg

"appeal for lbw but de Kock may have been saved by an inside edge. Looks to work this full delivery on the stumps through midwicket, better off playing straight. Replays confirm the angle was taking the ball down leg too, even if there wasn't an inside-edge"
"hits this straight to mid-off, off the thick inside edge. Excellent control from Mustafizur. Top, top bowling. Pressure building."

"drifting into the pads, worked to backward square leg"
"<b> dropped but Mushfiqur makes amends </b> But guess what? De Kock has been run out. <b> Bangladeshi fans go from agony to ecstasy in a matter of two milliseconds.  </b> De Kock looks to cut, but gets a thin edge that is put down. Clearly nervous, he takes off for a run but is left high and dry as Markram doesn't move. Mushfiqur has the presence of mind to run quickly to his right, pick up the ball and hit the stumps at the striker's end to catch him well short. Brain fade from de Kock."

Given out and <b> JP Duminy reviews. </b> Cuts back in from outside off on a length, JP is hurried into a defensive stroke which he tries to execute from the crease, but it's the fizz (no pun intended) that does him in. Hit high on the pad but mind you he was rooted to the crease and the ball didn't have much distance to travel. Clear gap between bat and pad, only thing to see was if it would've hit the stumps. <b> Ball tracking says no </b> so the original decision has been reversed. <b> Huge relief for South Africa </b>"
