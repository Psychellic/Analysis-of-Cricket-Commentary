"length ball on off, and the attempted cut takes an inside edge to square leg. Warner surprised by the extra nip off the deck"
"<B>poor from Prabhsimran!</b> Offcutter on middle, and the ball goes under Saha's attempted swing and on the bounce to the keeper. But Prabhsimran fails to gauge the bounce, and it goes through him for four byes. The extra ball, thanks to the wide earlier, eventually hurts Kings XI"
"full on middle, and Warner backs away before driving to cover. Stopped by Pooran, who throws the ball towards the keeper. The ball flies over Prabhsimran again, but fine leg was backing up"

"<b>Warner escapes!</b> Back of a length on off, and he taps it towards the leg side. Saha's halfway down the wicket before Warner chooses to run. Mujeeb runs across from midwicket to try and throw Warner's stumps down... but he fails to gather the ball."

"full, just outside off, and driven to long on for a single"
"straighter ball, skids into the right-hander on leg stump, Pandey shifts his weight back and flicks through midwicket"
"lovely, restrictive bowling. He chooses the googly. He pitches it on leg stump, the trajectory flat and the pace quick. Warner is thinking about a sweep but it's too quick for a flat-bat shot and so he can only dink it to midwicket"
"<b>sensational</b>! It's a short ball outside off, but the put-away, the cut shot behind point, placed perfectly. There is nothing but timing on this shot. Not even a smidge of over-hitting. He's just that confident he can find the boundary with just touch play"
pulls a short ball turning into him to deep square leg
stays back and nudges the flatter ball on leg stump through midwicket
"he's deceived him in flight, making Pandey reach out, the hands well in front of the body, to meet the legbreak dipping sharply outside off. Still the man is in such good form that he manages to whack the ball - all along the ground - to long-on"
"<b>dropped</b>! But catches like these need to stick. And R Ashwin did so well to actually turn it into a chance. Standing on the edge of the circle at mid-off, he times his jump perfectly, reaching out with his right hand above his head and grabbing a firm hold of the ball. But as he comes down, he loses his grip and Pandey gets a life. Blistering shot, going inside out over the off side, and there was just enough power for him to bat on"
"<b>another fifty</b>, his eighth of the season. And it happens with a late cut. He intends to get the ball fine to the third man boundary, but a thick outside edge helps him out"
"tickles a back of a length ball on leg stump to the right of deep midwicket, specifically to get two runs"
dabs the short ball on middle to point
hoicks a slower ball - short of a length too - out to deep midwicket
"slow and short again but Warner isn't deceived. He just waits for the ball, holding his shape, and cuts it to deep point"
"long hop, but with Ashwin bowling a slow pace, it sticks in the wicket and Warner, for once, doesn't do well delaying his shot, those milliseconds result in a loss of power and balance. Finds square leg on the boundary"
"tossed up on leg stump, he gets down and sweeps it to long leg"
in the slot and he makes it disappear! Pandey sees the flight in this and immediately clears the front leg and goes gung-ho down the ground. <b>Spectacular hitting</b>
spears it into the pads and it slips down leg while Pandey tries to flick
"lovely footwork, getting both of em out of the way of a very full delivery on leg stump so he can unveil a full swing of the bat and sends the ball to long-on"

opens his body up to flat-bat a short delivery spinning into off stump - and bouncing a bit awkwardly - out to long-off
hangs back and cuts the shortish delivery outside off behind point
takes on a length ball outside off and hammers it in between deep midwicket and long-on
"<B>reverse sweeps it away!</b>. And the funny thing is, there is no pace on this ball. It's loopy. And it's way outside off. It's meant to deny Warner his power. But he backs himself. Goes for the unorthodox shot and pulls it off superbly"
"goes for the flat-batted swat down the ground, but ends up getting an outside edge that lobs over short third man. Shami was in business for a few seconds..."
whips a leg-stump yorker out to long-off. <b>Is it just me or is Warner tiring a bit?</b>. He's not holding his shape as much as he used to early on
"short-arm pulls it out to deep square leg, doing just enough to wait on the slower short ball angled into him"
<b>past short fine leg</b>! He's the only fielder up on the leg side and Arshdeep bowls a yorker outside leg-stump. All Warner needs to do is place it and he does that very very well
"surprises the batsman with a banged-in slower ball on off stump. Warner, almost coming down the track, has to stop and then adjust to the lack of pace and then chop it through point"
"goes round the wicket and targets the batsman's head. It's coming right in between the eyes of Pandey. And he just calmly swivels on his back foot and pulls it over short fine leg. That's not the field for this kind of bowling, but it was a decent ball"
"back over the wicket now, and a slower ball on the pads is sent to long leg"
"another back of a length slower ball, cramping the batsman, Warner dinks it to vacant midwicket and keeps strike"
goes round-arm and the advancing Warner can only block the back of a length ball on leg stump back down the pitch
"<b>inside edge</b> as Warner tries to cut a loopy, off-stump yorker out to short fine leg. <b>Might have been the arm ball</b>"
"<b>taken at short fine leg</b>. Pandey does well, initially, getting inside the line of a carrom ball. But it doesn't really bounce and he can't get under it like he wants. That means he can't get power into the scoop shot that he wants to play. Walks off angry at his mistake."
flicks a shortish delivery on off stump through midwicket and pinches two.
stays back and punches the flatter delivery outside off to sweeper cover
"<b>goes round-arm again and it works</b>. Warner is reaching out to this ball outside off. There's no pace on it too. All that means he has to put in all the power and he just doesn't have any at this stage of the innings. A tired shot. A tired dismissal. But Hyderabad loves him. He walks off to raucaous cheers and he sends a kiss there way. It's his last game this season, will he win it?"
slashes the short and wide delivery and the outside edge takes it down to deep third man
works the back of a length ball off his hips to deep midwicket
goes for the yorker and Nabi whips it down to long-on. He was looking more over square leg but miscues it
back foot punch to the sweeper cover. Mike Hesson spoke of targeting him with short lengths. His bowlers are doing just that
<B>inside edge</b> as Nabi stays stuck in his crease and throws his bat at a full ball outside off. Pings away to fine leg
pushes the shortish delivery outside off to sweeper cover. <b>Only six off that over. Kings XI definitely have a shout here</b>
"<b>outside edge</b>! Williamson backs away to try and smoke it over extra cover. But the ball skews away over Gayle, and just as he catches up with the ball, he tries to stop it with his feet and instead kicks it over the boundary"
<b>that's poor bowling</b>. Short. Angled down leg. All Kane has to do is get under it and he does that with a no-holds-barred sweep shot
works a full ball on off stump down to long-on
"<b>launches it</b>! See, he's an awesome hitter. And he proves it by taking on a length ball on off stump and making it disappear over the bowler's head"
"good response, seeing the batsman making room and firing in the wide yorker. Just one problem. The umpire says it's too wide"
"another one that he wants to hide outside off, but skirts the wrong side of the wide line"
"<b>that's the most expensive spell of bowling this IPL</b>. Nabi bestows his country-mate with that label, launching a length ball on off stump away over his head. Those two wides made him bowl straight and now he gets punished"
walks across and tries to heave the good length - off-pace - ball outside off. But he ends up cue-ending it to deep point.
"goes for the bouncer on middle and off stump, Nabi tries to ramp over third man, but the ball keeps climbing and the umpire penalises Shami for it. Rightly so"
<b>good fielding</b> at mid-off by R Ashwin. Moves to his left and puts in the dive to stop a yorker that Nabi has hammered all along the ground. Looks set to reach the extra cover boundary until the Kings XI captain butted in
"<b>outstanding take!</b>. M Ashwin at cover, leaping up to wrangle a cut shot that Williamson intends to send over him. The fielder is up off his feet, both hands over his head, and he plucks it out of thin air. Beautiful stuff. And a slower short ball does indeed do the trick. Shami's gone to it so often this innings"
<b>inswinging yorker</b> and Rashid is just about able to squirt it away to fine leg with an inside edge
<b>takes out two of the three stumps</b> and Shami just walks off. No celebration. He knows this total is a monster. But it is still a skillful piece of bowling. Full. Straight. Nearly a yorker. Nabi clears his front leg and swings. he misses
"lands another inswinging yorker on the base of middle stump, Vijay digs it out to cover and sprints through. Needless throw gives up extra runs. <b>M Ashwin the culprit</b>"
yorker becomes a full toss which Vijay lifts overmidwicket
"<b>outstanding stuff</b>. Rashid is moving all over the place. Walking across, then walking back. Trying to throw young Arshdeep off his lengths. But he takes none of it. Looks for the leg-stump yorker. And absolutley nails it. Rashid is outside leg stump right now and makes a last ditch effort to chop a horizontal bat down on the ball. He's beaten for pace. Utterly"
"low full toss on leg stump - there's swing here, possibly reverse - Abhishek tries to whip it away but does not make any connection. Vijay, at the non-strikers', wants the leg bye and gets it"
"another yorker, this one shaping across the right-hander. Vijay is squared up as he blocks, getting a single to point off the outside half of the bat"
slips down leg. The length is right - another yorker - but the line goes just a tiny bit wrong
misses his yorker and Abhishek does well to hold his shape and lifts the ball over mid-off. Outstanding cricket. There's such a temptation to slog in these times but the youngster does not succumb
"full and angling into leg stump, Abhishek makes room and lifts it to long-off"
"full toss on off stump, Vijay lofts down the ground for a couple of runs"
"full, just outside leg stump, and going down the leg side. Through to the keeper"
"length ball, wide outside leg but coming into his body. Defended towards the bowler"
"<b>big appeal for lbw</b> and not given! Khaleel can't believe it. Lands on middle-and-leg, and comes into Rahul. He misses the flick, and ball hits his front leg. Replays suggest that the ball was on leg stump all along, but height may have been a concern"
"length ball, on off, and he nudges towards the leg side with the bat's face closed. Stopped by midwicket"
"length ball, angling across off, and left alone"
"length ball, leg stump, and nudged off his pads to square leg. Just a single"

"full on off, and angling into Rahul. He comes onto the front foot to block towards the off side"

"length ball, just outside off, and tapped off the back foot to mid-off"
"<B>that's a ridiculous take from Pandey!</b> Length ball outside off, and Gayle tries to clatter this over cover off the back foot. Takes the bat's splice, and goes into the air. Pandey gets under it at cover, and dives forward to take the catch. He takes the catch while his body hits the ground, but the ball pops out of his hands for a moment. Lucky for Pandey, the ball got stuck between his fingers and his chin, and the Sunrisers players rush around him to celebrate the big wicket"
"<b>'oh wow', goes Simon Doull on commentary!</b> Doesn't matter that Gayle just fell. Full on middle, and he clips this nonchalantly over to the leg-side stand"
"length ball, just outside off, and nudged away to point"

"length ball on off, and he muscles a pull to deep midwicket"
"<b>outta here!</b> Full on middle, but Rahul puts his front leg across the stumps before muscling a paddle-sweep over the fielder at short fine leg. Terrific improvisation to play the shot while showing all three stumps. Replays, though, suggest that the ball landed just inside the boundary skirting."
"length ball, on middle, and angling down the leg side"

"full outside leg, and angling into the batsman who has stepped back to get some extra room. Driven inside-out to cover"
"full, just outside off, and that's gone into orbit! Tries to flick it to deep midwicket, but it doesn't have the distance. In the air for ages, and Rashid runs backwards from mid-on, but the ball lands just beyond him. At first this looked like six, but eventually just a couple for Kings XI"

"<b>smoked!</b> Full on off, and he picks the legbreak well. Settles down on one knee and lifts this over Rashid's head"
"<B>holes out!</b> Too easy for Rashid. Goes full on middle, and Mayank looks to slog-sweep. Struck well, but not far enough, and the fielder at cow corner waits for the ball to come to him. Not smart from Mayank. They had collected eight off Rashid's over already..."
"length ball, on middle, and he punches this googly back to Rashid"
"full on middle, and the legbreak is inside-edged onto his pads. A successful over for Sunrisers"
"length ball, just outside off, and he works it towards the leg side. Can't go past Williamson at midwicket"
"<b>reverse swept!</b> But Khaleel does well - from short third man - to stop the ball. Full on off, and Rahul was quick to play that shot. Kings XI could've taken a third had Rahul not assumed the ball to go for four"

"fuller, on off, and he drills a square drive to the sweeper-fielder on the off side"
"<b>crosses the boundary while taking the catch</b>! It just did not look like Pooran got that much into this pull. He's got his eyes off the ball, which by the way is getting big on him. He whips it as it climbs up towards his chest, Bhuvi's down there, he tracks it really well, backpedals to the boundary, leaps up, takes it with both hands - but the momentum takes him over the ropes"
pitches it up and watches it disappear. A simple front-foot stride and a full flow of the bat. #Magic
"shortish and outside off, he goes for the cut, but the extra effort from the left-arm quick makes it bounce over his bat"
"stays low because he needs to with a length ball on off stump, and by staying low, he's able to get under it and basically scoops it to the square leg boundary. <b>Brilliantly innovative batting</b>"
"<b>claims the catch, Bhuvi you beauty!</b>. He's on the long leg boundary. He needs to run in, and then move to his right, dive forward, grab the ball inches off the ground and then make sure his elbow doesn't jam into the ground. That usually makes the ball pop out of your hands. But it doesn't here. Splendid technique. And a word about the ball too: Khaleel got hit for six off this length - the short length angled at the body. Credit to him for trying it again and this time securing the top edge as Pooran hooked"

"drags the length short and it's punished as Miller rocks back and pulls it mightily, in front of square and to the boundary"
"<b>googly, and he's not picked it</b>. Goes for the sweep because the line of the ball is leg stump. Misses the shot and gets struck on the pads. Weathers an lbw shout as well"
"this time he connects with the sweep, thanks in part to the tossed up ball being outside off. Strong shot, but Vijay Shankar on the boundary puts in a lovely effort. Sprints about 10 yards, puts in the full-length dive and saves a run"
"<b>98 kph and he almost bowls him</b>. He pitches the slider on leg stump. And since the trajectory is flat, Miller thinks he should cut it. Goes back, makes room, and then watches as the ball skids on, looking to topple his sticks. Just about stops that"
"<b>hammers it straight to deep midwicket</b>. There is so much power in this pull shot. Bends his knees to get low and get under the ball. But as much power as he puts in it, he doesn't get enough elevation. Huh, usually it's the other way round for a wicket to fall!"
"<b>picks out long-on</b>! This is the googly, invitingly tossed up outside off. Ashwin goes with the spin, but he only picks out Manish Pandey. <b>Rashid's on a hat-trick</b>"

"looks for the reverse scoop, but Bhuvi bowls the most delicious yorker, the ball going right through his legs and, unfortunately for SRH, missing leg stump"
another yorker - this one tailing into the right-hander at the last - and a set Rahul is only able to nudge it to midwicket. Buh-rilliant execution from one of India's best bowlers
"goes for the bouncer against the inexperienced batsman, but it climbs up too far. Prabhsimran can't reach it with his ramp shot"
"backs away and cuts the shortish delivery on off stump away behind point. He's finally getting his timing right, and it's because he's holding his shape better"
<b>beats him</b>. This is class bowling. He knows the youngster is backing away. He knows he can do him if he takes the pace off and keeps it wide outside off
"launches it over long-off. Prabhsimran is deep in his crease against this almost wide yorker and he gets under it so well, sending it miles over Warner"
takes all the pace off and that's why Rahul's heave over midwicket ends up falling short of the boundary. Vijay flicks it back as he runs to his left from midwicket and Nabi collects it to throw it back in
"bouncer, but it's too short and soars over the ducking Rahul"
"<b>looooovely Kane</b>! He runs to his right from extra cover, and this is a hiiiiiiiigh ball. For the longest time it looks like it will evade him, but he tracks it down somewhere near mid-off, puts in the dive and takes it almost easily. Gets a kiss on his cap for that trouble from Khaleel. Rahul's innings ends looking for a big shot , over cover, he doesn't time properly. Piled the pressure on himself. Couldn't claw out of it"
"back of a length and outside off, cuts and misses"
""
stays beside the back of a length ball on off stump and lifts it over short third man
nails the yorker from round the wicket and Prabhsimran slices it through point
<b>traps him lbw</b> but he's reviewed it straight away. It's the no-nonsense yorker. Full and straight. Prabhsimran plays all around it and is pinned on the back leg. Could it be going down? There's definitely no bat and HawkEye says it's umpire's call on impact and umpire's call on hitting the stumps.
does him with the knuckle ball and Mujeeb has already swung himself clean off his feet by the time the ball passed him outside off
"another knuckle ball, another swing and miss outside off"
clatters into the stumps and the slower ball takes out Mujeeb - a duck and 0 for 66 for him in this game
defends the slower ball on middle through midwicket
it all ends with a knuckle ball that is nudged through midwicket. All very tame
