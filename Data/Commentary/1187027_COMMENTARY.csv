"length, jags back in from outside off, and Finch leaves it. Trusts the bounce on this surface, but <em>that wasn't far away from the top of off</em>!"
"length, a hint of movement back in. Finch wants to press forward to defend, and the inward movement makes the bat skew as he blocks"
"strays down the pads, and he can whip it off his legs towards long leg. Wants two, but has to settle for one as the fielder converges quickly from fine leg"
"inswinger, but he stretches and smashes this through covers. <strong>Top shot from Finch!</strong> A short movement forward with his front foot, and then just going with the shot as he would normally do. It's been a mode of dismissal exploited by India in the past, but not this time"
"strays down the pads with a fuller ball, and he can flick it away towards long leg"
"full, wide, and he smashes this hard through cover, but the fielder there is quick to cut this off"
"length, nips back in a touch, and he defends from the crease"
"<strong>ooh, a beauty!</strong> Like a very fast off-break, this pitches around off, and then moves away in the air. Warner half-stretches forward to defend, and sees this whizz past his outside edge, through to KL Rahul behind the stumps. Remember again, no Pant"
"length, around off, and he drives this towards point"
"shorter, a bit of shape back in, and he cuts this towards point"
"<strong>gorgeous!</strong> The length is good, but not as full as what you would consider ideal for the drive. There's a bit of movement back in, and with that Finch just throws his hands at it and strokes it through cover"

"length, and he whips this towards fine leg. Off the pad, says the umpire"
"length, just around off, and he drives this back towards cover"
"length, around off, and he drives this between cover-point and point. Superb shot, with no chance for either fielder to get anywhere near it!"

"length, driven back towards Shami, who picks it up on his follow-through"
"length, angles back into him, and he defends this towards cover"
"length, and he flicks it off his pads towards mid-wicket. There's a fielder there, Shikhar Dhawan, who misfields. Has to chase this all the way to the fence, and he's able to pull it back just in time to prevent four"
"gets the very first ball to jag back from around the wicket. <B>Strikes Warner as he misses that</b>. Was it missing leg, or perhaps too high? Eventually, there's no review from India"
"length, and he presses forward to defend this"
"fuller ball, a hint of movement back in, and Warner drives this towards point"
"short, down the leg side, and he chases it, and <strong>he's been given out</strong> caught behind! Warner reviews after a lengthy chat with Finch. This was a terrible ball actually, and deserved the proper treatment it <i>nearly</i> received from the batsman. Did he just get a feather on it, through to Rahul behind the wicket? No. Nothing on that on the broadcast. Warner stays"
"length, zips in from outside off, and he flicks it with the movement towards fine leg"

"fuller, wider, and he plays over the line of this. Looks for the drive, but misses out"
"length, but width on offer, and he flogs this inside out. Not off the middle, but good enough to go one and two bounces into the extra cover fence. Off the outside edge too"

"length, and he looks to go towards mid-wicket. Skews the bat and it goes off towards long leg. A bit of movement back in, nearly defeats him, but not enough"
"full, but too wide. Left alone"
"short, and he hops to ride the bounce and defend it"
"length, and he picks it early. Outside off, and he has swatted this way over mid-wicket. <strong>Big six!</strong> A bit of glove love from the captain, as Warner announces his arrival in this series"
"looks for the fuller ball, and overcooks it a touch. Some late swing in, but Warner covers it to play it out towards cover, all along the ground"
"length, around off, and he stretches forward to bisect the gap between mid-off and cover. <strong>Top shot again!</strong>"
"length, cut away towards point"

"length, around off, and he steers this towards third man"
"length, and he runs this down towards third man, with an open face of the bat"

"length, outside off, and he runs this down to third man"

"short, but down the leg side. Warner lets this pass"
"slower ball, scrambled seam, but not much of a difference. Warner rocks back, and just pumps it inside out. Rasping cut over the infield, and there's no protection at the sweeper cover fence"
"length, angles in, and he plays it towards short mid-wicket"
"gets the leading edge, but this hasn't carried to cover! Wrong 'un, and he looks to play this with turn coming in, and ends up top-edging it, but it lands shy of Shreyas Iyer"
"sharp turn away from Warner, and he plays off the back foot. Cut towards point, and there's a throw at the non-striker's end that hits Kuldeep and goes off for an overthrow"

"short of a length, and he rides the bounce and whips it off his pads towards square leg"

"cuts back in from outside off, and he plays it towards square leg"
"skips down the wicket, and drives this towards long-off"

"length ball on the pads, flicked towards backward square leg"
"a wrong'un to beat the bat. Finch came forward to defend but it spun past the outside edge. Rahul whips the bails off, the foot was in the air for a fraction and they have gone for the third umpire. Replays show what players seem to know already, the foot is grounded back when the bails came off"
