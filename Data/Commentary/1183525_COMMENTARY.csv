"<b>stumped next ball.</b> Fuller and flatter and wider outside off. A slider, it appears. He steps out and gets too far leg side of it to make contact"

"<b>just out of Zampa's reach!</b> Length ball on off stump, looks for the sweep and gets a top edge just in front of where mid-on would have been. Zampa runs backwards and stretches out his right hand and gets to it with a dive, but can't hold on"
