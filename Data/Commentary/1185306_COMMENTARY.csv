flipped off the toes to deep midwicket

tapped to cover
zips past the off stump as Crawley leaves again

"banged in short, with good dead-deck intent. Ducked"

back on the stumps this time to defend to the leg side

"zippy pace, but down the leg side. Sibley shuffles across his crease to get out of harm's way"
"opens the face, steered to point, from back of a length"
"<B>up and over!</B> Well, why not! Nortje's aggressive intent persuades Sibley to roll with the punches, and hoist another short up away to third man with a sweetly executed uppercut"
"<B>yeeeks, that's close!</B> Crawley gets down on the sweep and is struck in front of the stumps ... it probably didn't straighten enough, as South Africa decline the review. Might have been glove involved too, which could have got the close catchers interested, but Hamza was hurtling from slip to cut off the stroke"
blocked into the leg side on the front foot

"fullish in the channel, nudged out towards deep point for a couple off the back foot"
"<strong>gottim!</strong> Rabada has earned that, he's been making Sibley work hard this over, though it's a very avoidable dismissal. Back-of-a-length ball on the thigh pad, Sibley looks to whip it down to long leg but gets his timing wrong, and steers it straight into the hands of Elgar at wide leg gully/backward square leg.

"fired in towards leg stump, <strong>keeps a bit low</strong> as Crawley looks to work to leg and Maharaj belts out an appeal... but it was always sliding down"

"ooft, how did that miss?! Fullish on off stump, bit of turn as it shoots through low off the pitch while Crawley leaves it alone, and it's not far away <i>at all</i> from trimming the outside of the off stump"

"<B>there it goes!</B> Once again, Nortje fires it into the legs, and Crawley is completely suckered by the clip to leg gully! It's a brilliant diving catch, low to his right from van der Dussen, and that's the opening that South Africa have been toiling for!"

nudged to the leg side

"attacking off stump this time, no way through there"
back and across and defended with a wall of willow on off stump
"<B>another awkward haul to the leg side!</B> That's a poor piece of batting, helping a half-cock bouncer into the leg side, despite two men lurking for the catch. He manages to bisect them but that's living dangerously!"
"shimmying at the crease, as Root thinks of sweeping and opts for the nudge to off"

"<B>sharp!</B> That was brisk, 146kph and rising skiddily from a not-desperately short length. Hamza wears it on the top hand as he does well to keep it down"
"<B>150kph!</B> The fastest of the match, and it looked it too! Snorting through to the keeper past a flinching outside edge!"
"<B>inside-edged past the keeper!</B> Zoinks! 91mph once again, proper wheels in gloomy light. It's a struggle"
"good work from Hamza, seizing his chance to escape the firing line with a shovelled deflection through the off-side, just enough width to open the face"
"banged into the hip ... leg gully is loitering with intent, but that flicks from bat to hip to take the sting out of the ball..."
"well played, tucks himself right in behind the line of another bouncing bomb on off stump"
"leaning forward, blocked back down the track"
sliding past the leg stump
"<strong>pops off an inside-edge, onto the pad, and Bess has two!</strong> Round the wicket, attacking the rough, Hamza closes his face ineffectively as the ball kisses into Pope's hands at short leg, and now South Africa are in bother!"
"leaning forward on off stump, full-faced prod"
"flipped off the toes, and <B>not far away from short midwicket!</B> Oohs galore from a packed close field"
tucked more comfortably into the leg side
"woo, <strong>morning all!</strong> Round the wicket, pace, bounce, straightens off the seam, fizzes to the keeper!"
"uncomfortably jammed down into the pitch off the splice ... that was brisk too. Only one slip at the moment, which seems crazy"
<B>beaten past the outside edge!</B> Another zinger that climbs off the seam from round the wicket at 92mph
"squelched off the pads, as Wood aims fuller. Elgar is hurried but gets enough bat on it"
"fast and full, bending into the pads, flinched to the leg side off the back foot"
"<B>squared up on the back foot!</B> More awkward lift towards the hip, and a leading edge squirts out to point"
"stretching forward on a leg-stump line, round the wicket, slip, leg slip and short leg in place"
tapped off the pads to the leg side
"sturdy block on the front foot, big stride to the pitch of the ball"
"head right over the ball once again, very disciplined in his technique"
"twisting past the leg stump, no stroke this time"
"outside off, on the back foot, punched to the bowler"
still just one slip as Elgar hops into line on the back foot
"jabbed down into the gully, high hands to meet the rising ball. Bess grabs with both hands"
"<B>gets away with a floppy pull!</B>! More of a paddle than a pull in the end, weight falling backwards as Wood found an uncomfortable line into the midriff, and the ball lobs clear of the lurking leg gully"
outside off and left alone
"full length, drifting up to the crease as Nortje responds with a stiff-limbed drive to mid-off"
"outside off, banged into the turf on a fourth-stump line, Nortje drops his hands to leave it alone. He's survived those few deliveries with fewer alarms than the left-handed Elgar, the angle not quite so body-orientated"
flashed into the gap in the covers as Bess drops a fraction short. Good intent
"much fuller length, sturdy defence"
"solid footwork, enveloping the ball in a front-foot smother"
pressed into the covers with a full face of the bat
"back of a length, a hard-handed prod into the off side, getting the ball out of the reach of silly point"
"<B>stunning grab at silly point!</B> He'd moved across just two balls earlier, a fat inside-edge off the front pad, looping into the off side, and Pope flings his right hand forward to scrape the chance inches from the turf!"
"pushed onto the back foot, and fenced out to point"
"banged into the turf, bouncing into the hip, an awkward flinch round the corner for leg gully to fling himself across to intercept"
"brisk again from Wood, 149kph/91mph, short leg is there to gather as another uncomfortable jab comes forth from Nortje's bat"
"solid defence off the back foot, into the covers"
"very full, drilled to cover"
"thumped into the deck, Nortje ducks out of harm's way"
"round the wicket, dipping on off stump as du Plessis topples forward to defend"
tucked to short leg with a lean into the stroke
"<B>intent from the outset!</B> That's the way the skipper needs to play, an assertive shimmy to the pitch of the ball and an emphatic clout through the covers"
"<B>two in a row!</B> Straighter this time, but every bit as belligerent, clumped through long-off as du Plessis plants the front foot"
on the back foot this time as Bess reverts to over the wicket
"<B>poked to short leg and Bess has four!</B> Oh wow... that is an extraordinary passage of play. Bess was briefly dominated, found a new plan with a change of line, a bit of extra bite off the deck as Faf marched forward once more, and the skipper trudges off after a hard-handed jab, with the ball embedded in Pope's bread-basket!"
"<B>nearly the fifth!</B> Quick and in at the rib-cage, a very Nortje line to Nortje himself, whose panicked flick off the body drops just short of short leg"
"a more composed response this time, hopping back and across to get into line for the defensive block"
"well played, whittled off the legs as Wood's leg-side line permits a single to fine leg"
whistling through to the keeper
"back and across, and defended"
sliding back and across to play another solid block to cover
slipping past the leg stump as another one grips from the straight
"head over the ball, and pressed into the off side"
"probing, probing, right onto the front foot once more"
"camped on the front dog now, like a very watchful Alsatian"
"head fully over the ball, knee bent on impact. Blotted away"
turning down the leg side
"three close catchers in the covers, two deep catchers on the leg side, and a solid prod back down the track from over the wicket"
"<strong>nibble and bounce from outside off!</strong> Rassie rides the bounce and jams the ball down into the gully, as Broad rips his fingers on the off-cutter"
"<B>so close to short cover!</B> Another cutter, bites the turf as Rassie's hard hands send the ball scooting at a catchable height, inches out of Denly's reach!"
prodded to the leg side off the back foot... more awkward lift
"wider line, doesn't get up so much, more easily left alone"
"very full, very straight, a solid forward block to finish a lively and intelligent over"
"ripping into the deck outside off, turning into a defensive nudge to leg"
"<B>skids on as Nortje looks to be assertive!</B> Suckered by the change in length, he rocked back for the cut but had to adjust in a hurry"
tucked to the leg side with a closed face
"poked to mid-on, on the front foot"
"pressed back down the track, past a phalanx of close fielders"
right back on the stumps to defend. Another probing over
stabbed down into the off side
"full and straight, tailing into the right-hander who defends with solidity from deep in the crease"
"back of a length, attacking the top of off, firmly into line to defend"
just a touch of movement away from the right-hander as vdD defends again

nudged off the legs
compact block into the covers
"stretching onto the front foot, short leg is loitering under the lid to gather"
"extra turn from a leg-stump line, short leg pounces as Nortje closes the face"
"on the back foot, flapped into the midriff of short leg again, albeit on the bounce"
clips the single into the gap ... and has to scamper as the shy comes in from midwicket but Rassie responded well
"outside off, zipping through with no stroke offered"
solid block back down the track
patted to the off side with a big stride
"<B>nip back off the seam and so close to off!</B> In fact, that's a bona fide inswinger, and Nortje knew nothing off it as he shouldered arms, assuming this was another nipping away!"
"firmly forward, all hands on deck, as Nortje learns his lessons and repels all boarders"
"much wider line, a cautious but justified leave-alone this time"
whipped off the legs to midwicket
"leaning out of the crease, another sturdy block on a full length"
"back of a length, outside off, defended with aplomb to the on-side. He really has looked the best batsman out there this morning"
nudged to the on side
back and across to get into line for an easy push to mid-off
"head over the ball, striding to the pitch, he's giving nothing away"
through to the keeper with no stroke offered
crunched to the off side
left alone on a wider line outside off
"very full and straight, Broad looking to wobble the seam as Rassie stabs his drive to short cover"
"<B>popped back in the air, and inches short of Broad!</B> That one stopped in the surface as well, and England's premier beanpole did his utmost to get his fingers down in time..."
tapped to cover to complete an arduous hour. That will be <B>drinks</B>
"length ball, tickled round the corner lunging forward"
"slid across him, Nortje gets a long way down to smother it"
"fullish, and whipped out into the leg side"
"uses his feet, skipping down, and <strong>clubbed</strong> down the ground through long-on! Uses a lot of bottom hand, and hammers this past the diving Broad at mid-on. Great shot"

"full and straight this time, squirted out towards point"
"length ball, van der Dussen uses his feet and wristily flicks this into the leg side for a scuttled single"
"tossed up, defended with a big stride forward"
"fullish on off stump, defended out to point"
"<strong>dropped</strong>! Arm ball, genuine edge groping at the ball outside the off stump, it flies quickly to Root but he shells a simple chance!"
"turns and keep low from a length, jams the bat down into the leg side"
"length ball, turned round the corner to square leg"

"<strong>bosh!</strong> Where's that come from? RvdD has showed glimpses of intent this morning, but decides to skip down the track and plonk Bess over midwicket! One bounce"
"length ball, defended back"
"uses his feet looking to go again, but can't get hold of it this time as it turns and is struck on the thigh pad. Bess grins wryly"
"length outside off, a fraction short, and punched out to cover off the back foot"
"<strong>goes again! </strong>Pitched up, uses his feet and thrashes him over cow corner again, just short of the rope"
"sharp turn from a length, clipped out into the deep and keeps the strike"
pushed out into the covers for one
"tossed up, overpitched a little, Nortje pats it back to the bowler"
"tossed up above the eyeline, gets forward to defend"

"length on fourth stump, backs away and carves it out to mid-off"
"length ball, good turn, and flicked to short leg... Pope sticks out a hand but only gets a fingertip to it!"
defended solidly
"<strong>got him! </strong>Sharp turn from outside the off stump, and RvdD bottom-edges onto his stumps! Maiden Test five-for for Bess! Thought it was there to cut but he was cramped for room, and chopped onto leg stump. Another massive breakthrough for England, and they look ecstatic about it"

opens the face but can't find the gap at extra cover
"firm in defence, patting the ball back down an off-stump line"
"ooh, lively start! Banged in short on a leg-stump line, at 91mph. Nortje hops back and rides it well"
"sharp pace again, from round the wicket, Nortje shows more admirable pluck to get right behind the line"
"hopping back and across, punched down into the crease with a bunny-hop... more killer rabbit than flimsy tailender"
<B>flashed hard through short leg's right hand</B> and that's technically dropped! Actually it's a brilliant reflexive intervention. Those ones stick or they don't...
"piling into the pads on a very full length, a resounding thud of leather on stuffing"
"rising up on the toes, chopped eagerly in front of square and de Kock is off the mark with a not-quite-timed steer through the covers"

stabbing forward with bat and pad presented down the wicket
"round the wicket, outside off on a back of a length, Nortje hops back and across to fence into the covers"
"<B>head-hunter!</B> That is fast and nasty, and<strong> brilliantly played!</strong> Nortje watched it all the way as it spat at him from round the wicket, and snapped his head out of line. Hope the snappers snapped that too!"
"back and across, flinched behind square with a roll of the wrists, and settles for the single. Well, you would, wouldn't you?"

"round the wicket now, padded away as Bess can't quite bring the stumps into play"
tucked to the leg side
deflected round the corner on the leg side
"<B>tremendous strike!</B> Wood's pace turns a sweetly timed on-drive into a riflingly quick four through long-on. Slightly overpitched, angled into the legs, and dispatched!"
"clattered off the back foot to wide mid-off, de Kock not afraid of having a go when the ball is in his arc outside off ..."
"... <B>just like that!</B> Wood's not quite got it right to the left-hander, offering up too much width outside off, back of a length, and <strong>slapped through extra cover!</strong>"
"a switch to over the wicket, but that's too straight at the pads, and de Kock brings out a languid clip to the fringe of the rope at deep midwicket. Good tag-teaming cuts off the four"
"back and across, bashed to extra cover"
"<B>outside edge! But safe...</B> Just enough bite to flick the outside of de Kock's bat, but the ball went straight down, past slip"
"round the wicket, looped into the blockhole, and blocked"

"controlled pull, back of a length again, eased with a horizontal bat out to deep square leg"
"on the back foot, flipped to square leg"

"full face in defence, no way through"

"round the wicket, crashed off the front foot, through silly point, who winces as the ball clatters him. De Kock apologises, which is nice of him"
"flashing at a ball on the edge of the rough, sliding in.. tricky areas"
pressed into the off side
"<B>supreme strike!</B> Clean through the covers with a big backlift and a guillotine execution. Silly point leaps for his life, and he's gone for good now"
"leaning forward, blocked"
"<B>edged, and through Stokes' hands at slip!</B> Crikey, that was a moment ... it was something of a late cut rather than an edge, so Stokes was slightly second-guessing, but it thumped the heel of his palm and wriggled through his legs! A clear <B>dropped catch</B>"
prodded to point

"shoulders arms, no stroke there"
"<strong>Cheeky from Curran,</strong> he flapped out his non-bowling arm moments before loading up, and Nortje is alert enough to pull out before the delivery! Back to the top of his mark, this time he thumps the pad again on a full length. England trying all sorts!"

"huge shout for lbw first up... and <strong>England have reviewed</strong> Height might save vdD here... struck on the front pad above the knee roll.

"on the back foot, tapped to cover... and <B>yikes, there's a run-out on here!</B> Wood grabs the wayward shy and launches himself Jonty Rhodes-style at the stumps, but not quite quick enough"
"swivel-pull, back of a length on a leg stump line"
"outside off, very full length, no stroke offered"
"deflected to short leg once more, but no bat this time..."
"on the back foot, flapped across the line, past Pope's infallible hands to midwicket"
tapped down to long on
tweaking into the pads from round the wicket again
sliding back into the stumps as Root slips in the one that skids straight on. Canny bowling
high-elbowed defence on the back foot. Another over negotiated

"back of a length, chopped out to the off side"
"<B>big turn, but doing too much?</B> Maharaj is trapped on the back foot as the ball turns back in, but might have been missing leg... EDIT: clipping the leg bail ... would have been out if the finger had gone up!"
eased round the corner
kneeling into a solid front-foot block to cover
"attempted pull on the back foot, not properly connected"
"connects well on a rifled pull, Philander hanging back in full expectation of another short ball, but that's a brilliant diving stop at backward square"

"over the wicket, short again, Philander sways to keep his gloves out of the way"

"flicked, belatedly, down the leg side, leg slip juggles to intercept, never a catch though"
"tapped to mid-off, all along the ground"
opens up the stance to defend gamely on the back foot
"short, and a bit rubbish really. A flat leg-stump long hop, splatted through midwicket. Might Root concede defeat in his five-for quest?"
"much fuller length outside off, and he's got a second slip at last. A hint that he's going to attack the stumps/edge now?"
"full again, signs that Wood is indeed changing his approach. A fat edge down through third man for a couple of runs"
"right up to the blockhole, a big stride to keep it out with a dead-straight bat"
"on the back foot, tapped to the on side"
"surprise bouncer, slapped round the corner, and <B>dropped by Stokes!</B> His fourth drop in two days ... and he barely picked that up, bursting through the gloom at short backward square and hitting him in the ribs. Ouch"
"round the wicket, a bit of a loopy leg-side bouncer, a hopeful appeal as Philander waves the bat, but nothing doing there"
"dipping towards the timbers, fended away off the back foot"
"head over the ball, stabbed out to cover"
blocked on a leg-stump line
"confidently forward as Root offers a hint of width outside off, and a sharp single into the covers"
dead-batted defence on off stump
flicked to the leg side. Root's day is done. What a remarkable spell it's been
"turning into the pads, and flicked to the leg side. That's been a regular line all day, doing too much from over the wicket to trouble the stumps"
nudged into the covers
"better line, just outside off, and biting into a solid block"
"zipping through, bat raised"
"on the back foot, seeing it off for all he's worth"
"no stroke offered, and is that it? Nope... there's time for one more over before 6pm... <B>Root's quest has a reprieve!</B>"

"fullish, angling in towards off stump, defended firmly out to mid-on"
"length ball, runs his fingers across the side, hung outside the off stump and left alone"
"full on off stump, pops up off the inside edge and into the pad, and short midwicket takes the catch! <strong>England strike in the first over of the day again!</strong> Pope takes his sixth of the match, and the easiest of the lot.

"fullish on off stump, nudged to mid-on"
"length on off stump, defended off the back foot"
"length ball on fourth stump, <strong>finds the edge</strong> but through the vacant third-slip region! Slightly odd not to have anyone else in the cordon, even with the ball relatively soft"

"length on the pads, worked out to square leg for an ambled single"
"drawn forward, beats the defensive prod"
"angling in from round the wicket, gets forward to defend"
"edged, through the slips! <strong>Sibley can't get his hands to it</strong>... fullish on fourth stump, drew an edge, and that looked like a drop low to his left"

"crablike defence off the back foot, groans of anguish from round the bat"

nudged out to leg slip on the bounce

defended out to straight midwicket
"fullish on the pads, <strong>chipped straight up via the leading edge</strong> as he tries to turn it into the leg side, and Broad takes the catch at mid-on! Cross-seam from Wood, held in the surface, Rabada was through his shot too quickly and it's a straightforward chance for Broad. England closing in..."

"lobbed up at off stump, driven against the turn to long-off"
length and ripping in at middle stump. Nervously stabbed back down the pitch from deep in the crease
"<b>Root pulls it back</b> at the backward point boundary. Short of a length and sliding on outside off, skips leg side of it and chops neatly into the vacant expanses behind square. A long sprint from the captain who was at extra cover"
"<b>off the toe end</b> as he looks to pummel this over midwicket. Length ball outside off, he's not to the pitch of that before looking to slog"

""
""
slapped through the covers! Short and wide outside off and he winds up and smokes this
"length on leg stump, defended on the back foot"
<b>thick outside edge</b> into the point region. Was looking to drill this full ball through the off side
"swiped to deep midwicket's right. Full toss on middle stump, gets low, watches that closely, and it's a nice and controlled sweep"
"full and down leg side, gets low again and has a swipe at it. No danger really with that line. Gets it off the under-edge and past Buttler"
"<b>and another!</b> Maharaj loves attacking spinners, and right now he's being fed. Another full one pitching outside leg and once more he's down quickly to whip this past leg gully"
"<b>boom!</b> That is some hit, whew. Length ball pushed through outside off. Slides into his arc and he wallops it over deep midwicket"
"<b>and 24!</b> Length outside off again, pushed through again. And slogged cleanly once more. This goes further back in the midwicket direction"
"<b>and now he beats everyone.</b> This is 99kph and moves away from the batsman, off the pitch. He's squared up and Buttler is beaten too as this slides from underneath"
"length at the stumps, defended with a straight bat"
"short of a length on off, backs away and cuts firmly to give extra cover a chase to his left"
<b>past Buttler's shin again</b> but this won't cost runs down the leg side as no shot was offered. That didn't rise
"length on middle stump, tucked into the square leg region with soft hands"
"length on off stump, dragged to long-off's right off the toe-end"
<b>fifty.</b> He's been a very handy bat in the last 18 months. Maharaj cashes in after hanging on through the difficult periods. Length on middle and he gets down to drag this past short gine
"short and across him, beaten on the cut"
full and into the corridor. Gets the front leg into the leg side and slashes from underneath to fine the straight boundary
"full and just outside off, into the leg side again and swish at this with all stumps visible. Beaten"
"short and wide outside off, too far away to connect on his expansive cut"
"full and following him down leg side. Looks to flick, can only get it onto his pad"
"a half-stop at cover. <b>Nearly results in a run-out.</b> Slower short ball outside off, chopped firmly to Wood's left. He parries it to his left, gives chase and turns around to find Paterson hurrying back at the non-striker's end. Dives in and the throw is too loopy to get him"
short of a length and jumping up in the corridor. Bottom hand off the bat as he fends into the off side
"short at off stump, falls into the leg side as he ducks this"
"full and wide outside off, backs away and chops into the covers"
"short at middle stump, backs away and looks to cut over the cordon. Beaten. He probably isn't that good.."
"short at middle stump, jumps into the leg side and looks for the upper cut again. Too fast for him again"
<b>beaten.</b> Length and swinging away from outside off. A top-order batsman might have left that on the front foot. Paterson has both feet down leg side as he chops at this
"<b>just evades mid-off.</b> Length ball outside off, feet are static as he looks to drive over the bowler. It's off the toe-end, loops over and falls just past the outstretched arm of the fielder running back"
"<b>oh this is sweet.</b> Top class from Maharaj. Full on leg stump, half a stride down at it and hardly a backlift as he has a whip at this to get it flat and to deep square's left"
"length outside off, stands tall and looks for the lofted straight drive again. This time it's off the inside part of the bat but good enough to beat mid-off to his right"
<b>slower yorker</b> at the stumps. Checks the slog and squeezes this into the off side
"<b>another whip.</b> Full ball on leg stump, drops the right shoulder and his head into the off side, one eye on this as he gets it well to fine leg's left"
"slower, short of a length and outside off. Beaten on the cut"
"slower ball at a length outside off, pushed into the covers off the under-edge"
"short and wide outside off, backs away and is beaten on the cut"
"<b>sliced to the extra cover boundary.</b> Bit of AB de Villiers to this, not gonna lie. Short and rising in the corridor. Gets on his toes and is forced to swivel a touch as he's cramped. But he watches it on and lifts it deliberately over that region"
<b>just short of short midwicket.</b> Short and into the body as he backs into the leg side. The attempted pull comes off the sticker
"<b>beaten</b> and it's past leg stump. Follows him down leg side again, this time with a slower length ball. Through the slog too soon"
"short of a length, following him down leg. Defended into the off side"
short of a length and slanted into the corridor. Beaten on the cut
"short of a length outside off, looks to slap it through the covers, thick outside edge through the second slip region"
"short outside off, and a crafty little cut down to vacant third man. Leg side of it and carves it"
"full and into the pads. Beaten on the flick, it trickles into the off side off the bat"
"<b>oh there's a sound on that.</b> But only Buttler seems to have heard it on the ground. Short of a length, just outside off. Backs into the leg side and has a heave. Replays confirm the sound but it looks it came after the ball was past bat"
"<b>sliced over gully.</b> Short of a length outside off, slashes at it and gets it over that man. Easy peasy"
"slower length ball at off stump. Clears the front leg for the slog, gets an inside edge onto pad"
short of a length sliding through outside off. Backs away and is beaten
<b>mean bouncer</b> but he manages to evade. Short and at his right shoulder. Bat up in the air as he ducks
"full and wide outside off, 144kph, stumps exposed as he drives to find Broad at extra cover"
"<b>that looks out!</b> Has Curran got them on 99? <b>Yes he has!</b> A direct hit from mid-on. Attempted yorker is hit at mid-on off the toe-end. He decides to jump to his right after starting off for the run, presumably a natural reaction to where that throw is coming from. And that costs him a yard. Curran nails the stumps. Maharaj's highest score will remain 72"
