"nicely done. Full ball outside off, gets low and the stride across off to dab this fine"
"<b>but Stoinis has the last laugh!</b> Stays tall, watches this seam-up quicker one come on at thigh height and ramps it fine. Kuldeep admonishes himself"

<b>Stoinis reviews an lbw decision.</b> It looked very out live. Length ball angled in but going on with the arm as he looked to play the reverse sweep. Trapped in front of middle stump. Is there height on that to save Stoinis? There's no bat...<b>yes there is height. That's going over leg.</b>
"length on leg stump, tapped to long-on off the back foot"
"short ball rising up to rib height, but it's well down leg side"
"<b>missed run-out chance.</b> Length ball at off stump, dropped in front of point with soft hands. KL Rahul swoops down on it and takes some time before throwing at the  non-striker's end. Maxwell a long way down. Looked Rahul was caught between going direct and lobbing it back to the bowler who was still backtracking"

<b>second tier.</b> Krunal drops it short at a leg stump line and Maxwell gets deep in the crease and pumps it high over deep midwicket!
"<b>and another!</b> This is too easy for Maxwell. Flat, fast, length, no turn. Skids on nicely for him to swing from under it and clear long-on"
"<b>three in three!</b> Another length ball pushed in fast and yet again, he gets the front leg out of the way and swipes at it. Wider of long-on this time"

"yorker length at leg stump, jammed out to long-on's right"

"<b>dropped at third man.</b> Khaleel draws the fury of Bumrah. Short ball outside off, chops from under it to try and get it fine but he's sent this straight to Khaleel. He hasn't had to move, but that bursts through his hand. Seems like he was caught off-guard. Bumrah roars in anger"
"<b>drags it straight to square leg.</b> It's possible he's picked the offcutter here, but it's at such an awkward length that he has no control. Hands a long way out as he goes after this and finds the only fielder in the circle"
"full toss on middle stump, looks to power this over midwicket but that's too quick for him. Lobs over the bowler off the high part of the bat and they get two as a result of the poor connection"
"<b>well bowled.</b> Beats him completely. Slower ball at a length outside off, too early into the shot and he's just ended up swatting air"

"good length, middle, defended into the off side"
"<strong>caught by Finch running back from mid on!</strong> He skips down and tries to loft over the on side, scoops a leading edge high back over the bowler's head, Finch runs back gets very close to it but hugs it to his chest! It bobbled a moment but he held on"

"full on off stump, clears the front leg and lofts it wide of long-off with a mistimed inside-out drive"
"<b>stumping appeal sent upstairs.</b> KL Rahul is driving inside the line of a googly, well outside off. Away from the body. He has overbalanced and his foot is on the line before the close-ups...<b>and the close-ups reveal no part of the sole is behind the line.</b> Quick hands from Carey after Rahul is done by the loop."

"length at off stump, blocked on the front foot"
"length at middle stump, drilled back down the pitch and bursts through Zampa's hands low to his right"

slower short all at middle. Drags the pull to deep square
"bouncer dug in too short, ducks under it"
"<b>falls short of Stanlake</b> at wide third man. Length ball wide outside off and he chucks his hands at this. Once again, seems to have misjudged the pace of it and is through it early. Slices high to the fielder's right"
"full and wide outside off, beaten on the drive"
"<b>dropped!</b> Oh that's a sitter. Length ball outside off, beats him in the flight and gets him to jab with hard hands. It floats back to him and he loses his balance to the left as he crouches with the reverse-cup"
"length outside off, steps out and drives to long-off"
"length outside off, looks to slog sweep, comes off the inside half to midwicket"
"<b>taken at short third man!</b> Zampa applies the squeeze on Kohli - 1 run off 5 balls - and has him swatting with no shape under this length ball. Looks like a topspinner. Gets big on Kohli, although he wasn't close to the pitch of that to start with after stepping out. Gets a top edge and it is pouched"
"length outside off, slices to sweeper cover"
"short of a length on the pads, tickled to fine leg off the back foot"
"<b>swats this away!</b> This is nicely done. He has Stanlake figured. Rocks back, gets under the bounce and helps it along over square leg"
"<b>drops short of the fielder</b> at fine leg. Short of a length delivery at leg stump, stays in the crease and ramps it upwards. Fine leg dives to his right and can't quite get it"
"<b>ramps straight to third man.</b> Bouncer at a middle stump line. Backs away and uses the pace. Not a bad ploy, but he's found the fielder at the boundary. Another top innings from Dhawan to follow the last one against West Indies, but is this the game for Australia?"

"googly bowled full outside off, drilled firmly but straight to long-off"
"full toss outside off, mistimed slog off the toe-end to deep midwicket"
a single to extra cover's left. Pant walks down at this but has to adjust to the googly. Can only tap it there.
"<b>clears fine leg!</b> What hands. It takes some doing with his backlift to hit from under the ball. But that's what he's done. It's length, it's climbing up at his thigh, but he just ramps this"
"pumped! Full at leg stump, gets the front foot out of the way and pummels it between long-on and deep midwicket"

length and very very wide outside off. Left alone
"<b>outside edge!</b> And flying past Carey. Full ball outside off, looks to smoke this through cover but that ball slides away off the surface to get the outside edge"
"<b>Maxwell leaps to catch</b> outside the boundary but can't chuck the ball back in before he lands on the floor! This is a full toss, Karthik slaps it to deep midwicket's left. Maxwell is running diagonally back to his left and with that angle, he can only end up over the rope somehow. To counter it, he leaps to catch and tries to flick it back, but he can't quite manage it. <b>India get 25 off the over</b>"
"<b>sliced</b> to third man's left. Slower ball bowled wide at a length, he looks to slap through cover, ends up carving it"
"length outside off, seems to be a knuckle ball. Hammers it to long-on's left with a flat bat"
"<b>beats backward square to the right!</b> Poor ball, but expertly put away. He was tangled there briefly because he had walked down. But it was a slower ball and he had time to swivel and pull this while he was still on the move. Swatted it, and the dive wouldn't do it in the deep"
"<b>outside edge</b> short of short third man. Slower ball outside off, looks to drive on the up, it gets big on him"
"<b>full toss above waist height!</b> This is disintegration. Looks for the wide yorker, seemingly. It's very wide and is called that first, before the umpire looks to his left and sees the leg umpire signal no-ball"
"slower ball, short of a length outside off. Mistimed slap on the up to long-off"
"slower ball at a length outside off, square drive to sweeper's right"
"<b>well wide of long-off.</b> Stunning placement. He finally nails a cover drive after a couple of edges. Slower ball, full outside off, gets to the pitch and in control as he drives firmly"
"length ball wide outside off, left alone. Walked a couple of steps into the off side, it was still too wide"
"length at the stumps, clipped to the deep midwicket region"
"<b>taken at point!</b> Pant looks for the reverse scoop and it's the second time in recent memory that he's been out playing that. It was bowled last time, it's a skier for point this time. Third man and two point fielders were in, the shot was on. But he got this full toss off the toe-end. Is there drama left still?!"
<b>off his helmet.</b> Tye with the bouncer first up and Pandya is in a terrible position for the hook. This flies off the BCCI logo on his helmet. He's on his feet though and they complete the single at square leg
<b>misses a short and wide ball!</b> That was there for the taking. He swatted right under it.
"<b>but he finishes what looked like a decent over with a four!</b> Top class. Just top class slog-overs batting from Karthik. He knows the field and he's going to hit it wherever he wants. Walks across this time, gets the overpitched ball with a stride and drills it, almost half a sweep, to long-on's right. It races away, he has no chance"
<b>slides back in.</b> Completes the second run. Slower ball short of a length delivery wide outside off. Shuffles and wants to pull through midwicket. It's off the toe and to long-on's left
"<b>beaten!</b> Oh this is close. So close. Full toss wide outside off and it's past the wide marker, but Krunal has shuffled and that is in his arc. It won't be called a wide"
"<b>Maxwell with the stunner!</b> Stoinis with a nervous smirk, but he's done superbly to make this wicket. A slower ball, pitching outside off and zipping away. Means Krunal will not connect with the slog sweep. It lobs some 15 yards in front of long-on and Maxwell sprints in, slides, and takes it inches off the floor. Then he gets up and roars. That's a man trying to prove something."
"<b>finds long-off!</b> There is life in this Australian bowling still. Stoinis sticks to his strategy of slower ones despite the caning last over. Drops it short of length outside off, gives him no pace as he walks down and all he can do is slap it, flat, straight to Behdrendorff. Dinesh KArthik won't take India home today, but he's brought them to the gate"
<b>called wide!</b> A slower bouncer. Bhuvneshwar jumps down the track and has a heave at it. It is too high.
"<b>can only get one.</b> Short of a length and rising up outside off. Swats again, makes connection, but it plonks to long-on's right"
<b>Australia have hung on.</b> Not a bad shot first ball from Kuldeep  - walks into the off side and ramps it over short fine.
