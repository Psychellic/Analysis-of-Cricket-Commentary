"darted wide of the stumps, clipped for one more into the cover region"
"over the wicket, hits a length at 134kph/83mph outside off, Roy slaps to cover"
"short of a length, slightly leg side, must have tickled the trouser leg on its way past"

"length outside off, Buttler taps down into the covers"
"slashes at a wide one, <b>nicked to the keeper!</b> No joy for Buttler against the new ball, this was delivered cross-seam and skidded on as he aimed a flat-footed thwack... Early breakthrough for South Africa, as Ngidi continues his good form from the other night"

pitched up and he digs this one out through mid-off
"length outside off, Roy swats it through cover"
"<b>timbeeeeeerrrrrrr!</b> Top of off, off you pop! Phehlukwayo liked that one... Bairstow was maybe set for a slower delivery, hung a limp bat out, only to see the ball rattle his poles. That'll check England's momentum"

"tossed up outside off and spinning away, Morgan swipes a single in front of backward point"
spinning sharply but down the leg side as Roy swings himself off his feet

"length outside off and Morgan runs this behind point, only half cut off but there's just a single there"
"flighted, this skids on and into the gloves as Morgan cuts and misses"
"give it some air, Morgan slogs across the line and doesn't get hold of it... but the ball lands short of the boundary riders, long-on running around to keep them to one"
"smeared though the leg side, and Hendricks misfields! Shamsi was thinking this was a chance, the ball didn't carry to wide long-on, and the beat the fielder on the bounce!"
"goes for the reverse-hoick, <b>fails to connect!</b> Had to make sure he didn't fall out of his ground, too, with de Kock ready to break the bails"

"flighted, straightening outside off and tapped towards backward point"
"length ball, swatted square... not much else going on for England, atm"

"tries to come down, has to drag this through mid-on"
"<b>holes out to long-off!</b> No pace to work with and Morgan had almost backed away too much, looking to open up the off side but scuffed it straight to the man! Struggled to get going, the England captain, and Pretorius now sees him off"
moves across early and whips this away leg side
"over the wicket, full on the stumps and Denly nurdles through midwicket"
"short and leg side... <b>and bowled him!</b> Slower ball, legcutter from Phehlukwayo, and Denly has deflected on to his stumps via his forearm! Foxed by the lack of pace, through the pull shot early, and Denly is done-ly!"
"tapped in front of mid-off,<b> this could be tight</b>... but the throw misses!"
"length ball, pace off and whipped through midwicket for one"
<b>slammed over the ropes!</b> Moeen mooses Phehlukwayo's slower ball over long-on! Just what England need here
"short of a length outside off, slapped through the covers for one"
"another cutter, Stokes waits for it and nudges short of long-on, they come back for two"
"shortish, 127kph/79mph and Moeen under-edges a cut into his body, bobbles into the off side"

"angled in, back of a length and pulled through midwicket for one"
"short ball, pace off and looping leg side... and out of de Kock's reach, but Ngidi does well to cut it off at fine leg"

"<b>Moeen, going, gone!</b> Drilled through the covers this time! Full in the slot from Ngidi and Moeen latches on"
"<b>...and gone for good this time!</b> Scooped high towards long-on, where Temba Bavuma clutches it to his chest! Taken on the rope, but Moeen's chanced his arm to good effect, getting his own back on Ngidi after that final over the other night"

"<b>munched!</b> Picks the slower ball, out the back of the hand... and smoked a long way back over long-on by Jordan! England are flying, too"
"<b>dropped!</b> Bavuma leaping to his left at long-on...! A taller man would surely have got there, but the ball clipped Bavuma's fingertips and bounced over the rope!"
"cutter, gets this into a gap"
"wide of the stumps, Jordan carves it up and over... <b>BAVUMA HOLDS A STUNNER!</b> Made the ground this time, sprinting around the rope from long-off, and he takes it in both hands while diving full length, before rolling up in triumph! Brilliant stuff"
"<b>brutalised down the ground!</b> Picks up Ngidi's cutter and smears this for a 94m six, into the second tier of the stand at long-on! And having barely timed one all innings, too"
"full toss, Stokes swings for the pickets, mistimes it back over the bowler's head, and they come haring back!"
"fired full and leg side, 139kph/87mph and Stokes swipes at it, comes of the pad and squirts into a gap at square leg - they race back for two, and England can be happy with their work, here"

"length outside off, steered to the sweeper at midwicket"
"fullish on off stump, de Kock decides it's time to go and <strong>hoiks him up and over backward square</strong>. Not timed, but enough on it to skew away for four"

"strays down the leg side, freebie for de Kock who <strong>helps this on its way up and over backward square for six</strong>!"
"fires in a yorker, de Kock <strong>looks to scoop</strong> but bottom-edges onto his boot and it skews away to third man. Big appeal from Jordan, but I think there was bat involved"

"speared in on off stump, clubbed out to mid-on"
"drops short, de Kock rocks back and annihilates this, hammering it <strong>high and mighty over cow corner</strong> for a <em>massive </em>six! Pulled his length back, perhaps expecting QdK to use his feet, but he hangs deep in the crease and bludgeons it out the ground!"
"length on off stump, cramped slightly for room as he cuts to point in the ring"
"speared down the leg side, looks to go again, doesn't time it but it's into a gap and just about drops over the rope for six more!"
"tossed up, <strong>driven sweetly, dead-straight down the ground for six more</strong>! Super shot, beautiful flow of the bat and de Kock holds the pose as it flies into the stands"
"pushed into the covers, they scramble through for one"
"yorker on the pads, dug out to mid-on"
"slower ball, little back-of-the-hander, pulled away to deep midwicket. Wayward throw from Stokes, but doesn't cost a run"
"quicker ball, but it slips out and turns into a low full toss which de Kock clips off the pads for six more! Just a flick of the wrists, only 66m but just above enough"
"that one's much bigger! Tries to drag his length back but it's down the leg side and de Kock won't miss out on a freebie like that, <strong>moosing it over square leg for another maximum</strong>"

"googly, Bavuma doesn't pick it and inside-edges into the pads"
"full and straight, Bavuma gets down to sweep, England go up and <strong>it's given lbw</strong>! Bavuma <strong>reviews </strong>almost immediately. What did this hit first? Glove, by the looks of things... no pad involved whatsoever! Bavuma survives, howler from the umpire and that's exactly what DRS is for..."

"slower ball, dug out into the leg side"
"full on the pads, worked out to the man sweeping at midwicket"
"half-volley outside off, de Kock lines this up and <strong>bludgeons it over extra cover</strong>, one bounce and over the rope! Phenomenal batting, right out of the middle"
"attempted slower ball, turns into a full toss, de Kock looks to go again but mistimes it and <strong>Stokes takes a simple catch on the rope!</strong> We'll check for a no-ball here... is that above the waist? It's marginal, but I <em>think</em> he's alright. He was a fraction out of his crease, but it was dipping... yep, <strong>given out!</strong>"

"89mph/144kph, angling in and vd Dussen can only nudge back down the pitch via the pad"
"hammers a hard length again, <strong>92mph/148kph</strong>, and clipped out to mid-on. Great over so far, really cranking the pace up"
"beaten, Miller's feet are stuck on the crease. <strong>92mph/149kph</strong> and pushed across him, looks to push through the covers but can't get bat on it"
"length ball, worked out to midwicket"
"tossed up above the eyeline, and Miller hammers this over deep midwicket for six! Googly, but not full enough to turn much, and the Killer lines it up early, carving this into the night sky and over the stands!"
"length ball, very wide, strikes the bottom of the bat as Miller looks to pull cross-batted"

"yorker, sits deep in the crease, <strong>struck on the pad and it's given out!</strong> Pretorius <strong>reviews</strong>, belatedly, after a shout from de Kock on the balcony. Stokes isn't keen on that but we've gone upstairs. Great yorker, tailing in towards the bottom of off stump. Strikes him on the right boot. Is it outside the line? No bat involved... or is there?
