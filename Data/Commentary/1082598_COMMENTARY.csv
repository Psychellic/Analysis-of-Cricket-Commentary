"goes for a pull but there was really no room to play that shot. Shortish, so it wasn't so much about the length. Though he backs away, he cannot manufacture enough room and gets a top-edge that goes straight down the throat of long-on. Mid-on had dropped back unlike in the previous over"

"shot, what a shot! That's a monster hit. Short and sitting up nicely for Mandeep who has all the time to rock back and swivel around with the pull. The ball goes over backward square and smacks the roof"
"overcompensates with the length. Fires it too full and too wide. The intent is right, making the batsman reach out. Mandeep does so as he tries to drive but the cordon is vacant and the outside edge runs away to third man"

"drives hard away from the body, gives too much power and gets an outside edge that files towards third man. But there is a fielder there and he gets around it"
how's that for placement. Wide outside off and he just opens the face of his bat to guide it wide of backward point. That was nearly a yorker but such is the class of this batsman
"first, there was one that smacked the roof. Now, one has sailed over it and out of the stadium. Biggest hit of the night. Walks across to this low full toss outside off and swings for the fences. Makes meaty connection, bang off the middle and out of here"
"another full toss and it is dispatched. If he wants to bowl the yorker, he better get it right. De Villiers thumps it over deep midwicket. Not as big enough this time but it goes well into the crowd nonetheless"

"slower full ball, outside off, de Villiers comes charging down and lofts it over long-off. He had to make a late adjustment there. Came down the track, saw it was wider and then had to move across slightly to reach out"
"one more that sails over the roof. De Villiers anticipates that the bowler would take it away from him, so he walks across early. Gets right on top of it and smashes it over deep square leg. That was all timing and balance"
