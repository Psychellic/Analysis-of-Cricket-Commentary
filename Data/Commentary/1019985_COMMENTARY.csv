Not a great review, especially looking at the replays. Nowhere near the bat. Erasmus' on-field call is vindicated.

The TV umpire Llong examines it, oh dear, Watling has grassed it. Hammered short on the leg stump from around the wicket, cramps 'em up for room. Shakib is caught in an awkward tangle as he takes Wagner on and pulls. The ball only lobs behind off Shakib's glove. Watling moves swiftly to his right and then pulls out a full-length dive to grasp the ball.
