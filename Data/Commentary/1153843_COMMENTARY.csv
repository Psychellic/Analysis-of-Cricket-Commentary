"<b>he's played him on first ball!</b> A 148.5 kph screamer, on a length coming back into him from outside off. Tentative prod at the ball, which takes the inside edge, and hits the stump via the pads. The ball was just too quick for him, he had hardly got the bat down in time before it was on him. Doesn't help to get one that quick to your first ball on tour."
"150 kph, but drifting on the pads, pushed towards mid-on"
"good length on leg stump, flicked to a widish mid-on. Some movement in the air for Southee"
"too short and Kusal is onto it in a flash. Short-arm jab-pull, showing the power in his forearms. Pulled to the midwicket fence"
"better length, moving slightly across him and bowled much slower, 112 kph. He waits for it and strokes it towards extra cover"
"<b>down the track</b> Didn't time it well though, got it off the bottom part of the bat, to send it over midwicket. But in fielding the ball <b>Ross Taylor seems to have hurt himself</b> He ran back to slide and pick it up, but jammed his left hand's little finger in the ground."
too far down leg and wide
<b>dismissed</b> down the track again and just wallops it like a rocket past midwicket
"<b>that is even better</b> stayed put in his crease, and Southee went a bit shorter. He was waiting, went on the back foot, swivelled and pulled it fiercely to send it over the square leg fence"
"<b>Sri Lanka are turning it on</b> Dickwella's taken a shimmy down the track to a bowler bowling at 150 kph. This was on a length and wide of off, which allowed him to free his arms and send it over mid-off"
"paddle sweep, gets down on a knee moving across and gets it fine. But too fine and the keeper fields"
"149.1 kph, wide yorker outside off, he slashes at it. Gets it off the end of the bat and it flies in the air, but drops short of third man"
"slower bouncer, back of a length and on the fourth stump line. Batsman shaped to pull too early, ends up under-edging it back to the bowler"
"148.5 kph fullish length on off, he goes over the top, but doesn't middle it. Kuggeleijn runs back from mid-off and pulls it in before it crosses the ropes"

"very full outside off, angling across, he jams it down on the ground on the way to point"

"<b>taken at mid-on</b> yorker on the stumps, dug out but the bat turned in his hand and he didn't time it at all. Straightforward catch for Bracewell. Some breathing room for New Zealand perhaps"
"good length on off stumps, squirted to cover-point"
"strays on the pads, and Mendis lifts him over midwicket with a pick-up shot. Doesn't time it that well though, so Munro is able to run back and pull it in"
yorker on the fifth stump line angling across. Carved away for a single
"<b>top edge taken by the keeper</b> Sri Lanka are wobbling after a good start. Bracewell had a good outing with the bat, now with his first ball back, he's sent back an in-form and dangerous Dickwella. Fuller length angled across him, he had a big swipe at it, but didn't get underneath it at all. The ball flew high off the top edge and Seifert called for it early, ran all the way to backward square leg and took it safely while tumbling"
"short ball coming into him, he pulls over midwicket. Again didn't get the timing right but it lands safely, with no fielder back there"
"back of a length again on the stumps, cramping him for room. Pulled from close to his body past midwicket"
"another short ball, another top edge - but lands safe. Bracewell's pace is in the mid to high 130s, but it's probably coming on quicker than they expect. He gets a top edge that flies just over mid-on"
"back of a length on the stumps, and he cuts from close to his body. Good timing on that, but Kuggeleijn, the fielder at third man sends in a rocket throw. They take the second run, but a direct hit would have sent him back"
"back of a length again, outside off, he's slapped it straight, but mid-off fields well"
"good length outside off, steered to point"
outside edge off the intended drive goes to third man. Sodhi dives and fields
"back of a length, coming back into him. He goes on the back foot and turns it to short fine leg off his chest"
<b>that just took off</b> dug it in short and it just FLEW over the batsman's head. Over the keeper's head too for that matter. Five wides
"good length going across him, he clears his front leg to hit to cow corner but swings and misses"
"another false shot from a back of length ball. Bowled straight and he wanted to pull it, but got it high on the bat and it goes in the air, but just short of midwicket"
"full, quick and straight. pushed to point from off stump"
"too short and wide outside off, slashed to deep cover"
"back of a length on the stumps, pulled to deep square leg but didn't go hard at it. Didn't get it off the midlde too, which worked for them since they could pinch a second run before the fielder got to the ball"
"length ball on the stumps, he goes back and turns it round the corner"
"<b>slashed over third man for maximum</b> short ball outside off again, he instinctively goes for the slash though it's a bit close to his body. Gets enough meat on it to send it just over the man at third man. The shorter boundaries at this ground doing their thing"
"goes for another drive off one outside off, but inside edges to fine leg"
"slower ball, not read at all. He was very early into the pull and it was ball coming and hitting bat rather than the bat meeting ball. Goes in the air to deep square leg, but bounces in front"
"good length on off, turning away a slight bit, he stays in his crease and strokes it to deep point"
"tossed up very full, driven back to the bowler's left off his toes"
"the bowler gave it some air, the batsman gave it a whole lot more. On a good length but Thisara spotted it early and slog swept it well over square leg"
pattd to long-on
"flatter outside off on a length, glides it to third man"
"flatter on the pads, whipped to midwicket"
"starts off with a flat one outside off. Doesn't turn much, he stays in his crease and slaps it to deep extra cover off the back foot"
"flatter and shorter, and too much room outside off. Thisara biffs it with a flat bat to the wide long-off fence"
"tossed up more and on a better length, cut to deep point"
"shorter again, but gets some turn. Bowled within the stumps though and he can only glide it to backward point"
"tossed up outside off, and the umpire rules it a wide. Harsh call. That landed within the tram lines and spun away, but still went over them"
stroked past cover
"tossed up and drifting across him. Thisara stays in his crease to try and crash it through the off side, but no pace on the ball. Ends up hitting in the air, but it drops just short of mid-off"
"driven on the up but without timing. Good length outside off, drops short of cover"
"fuller length on the sixth stump line, has him feeling for the ball with feet rooted in the crease"
he's keeping it well wide of off stump and the batsman's not able to create force by freeing his arms because he's not timing them. This one is bunted past the bowler off the toe end
"good ball again, yorker that time, and he can only pat it to long-on"
"<b>slower ball gets him</b> Southee had been good this whole over. This was bowled at just 102 kph, leg-cutter that pitched on middle. He tried to force it over extra cover it looked like, but ends up spooning a catch to mid-off."
"back of a length, tight line outside off again. Glided to third man. Good over by Southee"
"googly take the inside edge and goes for four to fine leg! Unfortunate for the bowler. Nice drift and dip. It grips and turns the other way, the batsman had no clue. Took the inside edge off his attempted push"
comes forward and plays it more carefully
"drags it short and he goes on the back foot to pull hard, but there is a sweeper to clean up"
"<b>Thisara isn't going to muck about with single</b> It was another wrong un, drifting across and turning away a bit more, Thisara just went with the turn for a free swing of the arms to lift this high and well beyond long-off"
"length ball on the pads, flicked to square leg"
"tossed up on the stumps, he comes forward and flicks it to long-on"
"back of a length, bowled from wide of the stumps into the batsman. He stays in his crease and goes on his toes to steer to third man"
"you can't bowl on the pads with fine leg up. back of a length but outside leg. All he had to do is flick it over short fine leg, and there is no one there to prevent the boundary"
"quicker ball than the previous one, back of a length and going slightly across from leg stump. He moves across a tad and clips it to deep midwicket"
"back of a length on leg stump again, he stays in his crease that time and pulls, but deep square leg is in place to collect"
"fuller outside off, steered to third man by opening the face of the bat"
"fuller and angled across him, he has a swipe at it and misses. Some words exchanged between bowler and batsman. They had been muttering at each other through the over"
"speared in at 140.6 kph, he was backing away but the ball follows. Hits his pads and rolls away"
"fuller length on the stumps again, but this time he stays still so is able to clip it to midwicket"
"<b>the short ball does the trick</b> But this wasn't the quick Lockie bouncer, it was at 126 kph, bowled outside off from around the wicket. Thisara wanted to dismiss it, ends up too early in the pull and the ball goes off the end of the bat to long-off. Huge wicket"
"slower ball on a fullish length outside off, squirted to point"
"<b>run out chyance missed by Guptill at short third man</b> He had steered to Guptill and taken off, no run there and was half-way down the pitch when he turned back. He had given up running. Guptill had plenty of time but he lets it loose a bit in a hurry perhaps and misses the stumps."
too far down leg and wide
<b>cleaned him up</b> Fast full and straight yorker at 147.4 kph - the stumps were rearranged before the bat came down. Ferguson has brought New Zealand roaring back into the match
down the track and meets it on the half-volley to clip it to long-on
"flatter and shorter, but bowled very slow. 78.5kph. He waits for it but still plays it too early and uppishly to long on"
"<b>outside edge goes for four</b> good length, spins enough to take the edge off the prod. But more worrying perhaps for New Zealand was Lockie Ferguson seeming to pull up and limp a bit while in pursuit of the ball"
"fuller on off, driven to long-on"
"fuller on the stumps again, driven to long-on"
"fuller, clipped to deep midwicket"
"tossed up and rapped on the pads. Big appeal and they have gone for a review. He got that to drift down and turn in from leg stump, to defeat the forward push and hit him on the pads. Looked a very good shout, but will umpire's call rule the day? No it won't! Three reds on ball tracking and that means another breakthrough for New Zealand"
"tossed up outside off, he comes forward to meet it on the full and pushes to cover"
"down the track and swiped to long-on. Bowled flatter and shorter, got it to turn too. Malinga managed to get the bottom of the bat to it"
"pushed back tentatively to the bowler, Sodhi makes as if to throw it back. Words exchanged"
"<b>turn</b> perfect length, drawing him forward, pitches and rips past the bat"
"fuller and he comes forward to drive, but only goes as far as mid-off"
tentative prod into cover and they get a quick single
too much outside off and it will be a wide
"tossed up very full. He has a stab at it, but the ball takes the inside edge and rolls just past the stumps. Into the boundary moreover"
"tosses it up wide and slows it down, inviting the ill-timed swipe. Malinga manages to keep it along the ground to mid-on"
"full on the stumps again, driven back past the bowler"
"<b>all those swipes had to result in one top edge</b> Santner slowed it down to 71 kph, kept it on the stumps. Malinga backed away to heave it, got a top edge that is taken comfortably between midwicket and long-on"
"too good for the tailender. Tossed up outside off, pitches and turns past the prodding bat"
"<b>shot</b> flatter legspinner, turning into him, comes down the track and flat bats it past the bowler and into the fence"
"<b>immediate revenge</b> wrong 'un pitched outside off. He tried to repeat the last shot to go down the ground, but this spun the other way, took the edge and nestled in short third man's hands. Only a matter of time now"
"tossed up on middle, he comes forward to defend carefully"
"clears his front leg to heave it on the leg side, gets enough to send it to deep midwicket"
"tossed up wide of off and turning further away, given as wide"
"<b>it's all over</b> on a good length, it wasn't full enough to be slog-swept, but that's the shot he goes for. Gets a top edge that flies over his head. Seifert calls for it and snaffles it near leg-slip. New Zealand win by 35 runs"
