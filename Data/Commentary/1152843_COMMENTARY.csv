"fullish around off stump, blocked back to the bowler on the front foot"
"pitched up outside off, 84mph and stroked through cover, not completely timed but he gets a couple"
"that's the line, finds the edge - <b>and take at the second attempt!</b> A phat edge pushing forwards, zipping to Root at chest height, the ball bar-of-soaps up to his right, but gently enough for a comfortable grab. Woakes strikes early"
"good length around the line of off, straightening and blocked"
"just a <i>fraction</i> overpitched, 81mph and Imam presses out to <b>ping an on-drive past the dive of the man on the ring</b>, trundles away for four"

"gets a touch straight, shortish length and worked off the pads"

slightly too straight this time and worked to midwicket
"<b>timed like a horologist back down the ground!</b> Just a touch too full from WIlley and Babar just showed it the bat face, sending the ball scurrying to the straight fence"
on the stumps and clipped to leg for one
"in the channel, no swing and he lets this one go"
"short of a length on off, defended square"
"dug in short, 83mph but that's not bothering Babar, <b>who strongarms a pull around the corner!</b> The crack of that off the bat!"
"four more! Though this one owed more to fielder error, <b>Stokes diving past the ball at square leg and then failing to chase it down!</b> He is absolutely steaming with himself"
"<b>crackerjack!</b> Top of off, sir, top of off! Woakes breaches Babar's defences with a pinpoint delivery, on a line and then nipping like a barracuda out of the murk to clatter off - pow right in the kisser! I think we can stop worrying about Woakes..."
"length ball, sliding through to the keeper as Haris hangs back and leaves"
"fullish around off, pushed into the covers on the front foot"
"length, 82mph and wobbling in, the line was straight to begin with though and it zips behind the pads"

"full again, 82mph and a touch wider, Imam gets well across and then shoulders arms"
"pitched up, tempts the drive again, <b>Imam times this one to the rope at long-off!</b> Just a checked punch coming forward but it leaves Woakes in the dirt trying to chase it down"

shortish on off and chopped into the covers
"off-stump line, Haris draws himself up and punches without timing to mid-off"

"round the wicket, short on the pads at 84mph and Haris clips to deep square leg"
on the stumps and tucked for one more
"<b>dropped!</b> Short ball, swerving late down the leg side... <b>Was there glove on that?</b> YJB doesn't look too excited, maybe he didn't take it cleanly. Umpire Michael Gough sends it upstairs to adjudicate: well,<b> that's a clear drop!</b> Definitely something on the ball as he tried to leave, but Bairstow shelled it going one-handed low to his right!"

"yorker, hint of outswing, that's a tidy delivery. Blocked"
"back of a length, tucked to square leg"
"<B>fancy footwork from Curran!</B> And this is<B> out!</B> That's tremendous alertness from the bowler, the ball was stabbed down into the crease, a not-entirely-convincing call for the single, but the bowler reacted far quicker than poor Haris.

"flicked off the pads once more, another single to midwicket"
"tight line and length to finish the over, skidding through to a back-foot block"

"short, a swishing pull, in comes the shy as they turn for the second, and Sarfaraz has to scamper"
"too short and wide, but that's <B>exceptional fielding from Willey</B>, sliding round with intent to cut off a certain four, then releasing the ball in an instant to threaten a bullet-flat run-out. Imam flings himself to the crease to survive"

"outside off, guided to deep cover, and <B>Sarfaraz is forced to dive for the crease as the flat shy comes in!</B> Nope, he's okay, safely home"
"<B>spanked high into the air</B>, Jordan, the substitute, steadies himself at fine leg and <strong>holds onto a fine swirling chance!</strong> Plunkett rolled his fingers on that one, lured the injudicious hoick across the line, and England have their opening"

swinging past the leg stump
"short, and flicked with intent to the leg side, nicely timed to deep midwicket"
nudged down to third man to keep the strike
"loopy doopy, flighted onto a full length, calmly driven to mid-off. Landed that one well. Better than his first ball in Cardiff, anyway"

"tailing into the toes, very full and inswinging, chipped firmly to the leg side, and good team-work to save the four"

"whipped off the pads, <b>no doubt about it, ODI hundred No6 for Imam</b>, off the comes the helmet in celebrations, looks to the sky and there's a <i>sajda</i> to follow. Now, can he supersize this one?"

"full and smacking the pads, was it outside leg? Paul Reiffel isn't interested and the ball squirts to third man - but England <b>review</b>, hoping probably to avoid the four leg byes as much as anything. <b>Struck in line, according to Hawk-Eye!</b> Good use of the DRS and Faheem is off, hit on the toe <i>just</i> the right side of things as far as England are concerned!"

"a open-faced drive, on a full length, gathered in the covers"
<B>nut!</B> Opened up like a tin of spaghetti hoops ... as the ball straightens off the seam and zips past the off stump!

"flicked to midwicket, looking to pierce the leg-side ring, but can't get through that time"
"thumped into the off-side, rising onto the toes but not quite timed"
"banged in short, and <B>that's sharp</B>. Bairstow bails out of the hook"
"<strong>flipped behind square!</strong> That's the one Bairstow has been waiting for, a touch back of a length, on the pads, Jonny walks inside the line to help himself"
"<B>absolutely huge!</B> Out comes the golf swing, Roy teeing off on a perfect length, slapping his own backside in the followthrough. Massive!"
"on the back foot, jabbed to midwicket, a good single to follow up"
"short, and slapped through midwicket, well timed but the sweeper tidies up"
"very full, into the toes, jabbed to mid-off. That was the slower ball, and pretty effective as Roy digs down late"

"flicked to the leg side, working with the full length"

"rolls the fingers on a good length, pops into a defensive stab."
"<B>flopped to cover, and that's a terrible drop!</B> Slapped off a short length, with the aplomb of a man using a frying pan, and it's lobbed straight into Shaheen's hands and out again!"
flipped to the leg side
"poked off the back foot, into the off side"

stretching forward and defended hard down the pitch
fired past the leg stump
"sliding back and across, a flick to midwicket, a lucrative area for both teams today"
"half a step down the pitch, wafted into the covers"
"back of a length, lashed back at the bowler, and <strong>Imad is hobbling!</strong> That crashed hard into his left foot, and the boot comes off for some running repairs. He instinctly stuck out his leg to intercept the shot and immediately regretted it!"

biffed into the covers
"short and pulled round the corner, a pause mid-stroke and a <B>delicate paddle through fine leg</B>"

"zipped through on a stump-threatening line, Roy hurriedly defends back down the pitch"

"back of a length, defended hastily back down the pitch, Shaheen gathers in his followthrough"
"short and sharp, but getting too big on the batsman for the square-leg umpire's liking"
"outside off, dabbed smartly through third man, <B>that's fifty and England are flying towards a massive target</B>"
"another drilled drive into the covers, a misfield gifts the second"
"too short, so quickly onto the lack of length, <strong>climbing into a kitchen-sink pull through midwicket!</strong>"
"tapped to the leg side, another single"
"gives himself oodles of room outside leg, and slams a drive into the covers"
"down on one knee for the sweep, and <B>that's out of the ground!</B> Picked the length so early ... and shockingly, one of the stewards has managed to track that down, it was clean over the stands"
hoisted to the leg side once more
"honked to the leg side, a slightly muffed sweep, but it's another single"

"round the wicket to tighten up the angle, stabbed off the back foot to mid-on"
"yawned behind square for yet another boundary, and <B>Bairstow has his fifty too!</B> At a quicker rate than Roy, who has had the lion's share of the strike"
"too full, too leg-sided, too easy to pick-pocket that one. <B>Clean through midwicket once more!</B>"
"back of a length, <B>pongo-ed over midwicket!</B> Camped on the back foot, deep in the crease, gets the bat right underneath the stroke and hoists it like a Jolly Roger into the stands!"

"thumped hard back down the pitch, more sharp fielding keeps things relatively tight"

short and down the leg side
"shortish, slashed - <b>gone, taken at point!</b> Roy's fun is over! There's increasingly been a temptation for these two to try and obliterate every ball, and this was just a wonky hack from Roy, the adrenalin pumping. Looped up and simply taken by Asif <b>to end an opening stand of 159 from 105 balls</b>"
"short and a touch leg side, 80mph and worked off the hip to get going"

"<b>dropped!</b> Cracked on the up, back towards the bowler who sticks up a right hand... Managed to deflect it into the the air, <b>but then couldn't twist around to complete the catch!</b> Good effort by Faheem, but Pakistan could have done with that sticking"
short and swinging away as Bairstow swings away and misses
"good length, 82mph and YJB works it to midwicket"

"played on! <b>Bairstow departs after one swing too many!</b> And he has a flick at the stumps, too, frustrated that his time in the middle is over...
