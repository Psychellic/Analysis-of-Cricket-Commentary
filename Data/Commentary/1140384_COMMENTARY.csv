"Malinga hits a length, 135kph/84mph and shaping away a touch as Roy pats it down defensively into the covers"
"Roy on the charge! <b>Hammered waaaaayyyy back over long-off!</b> Brutally clean hit, skipping down to slap a length ball on the up and well beyond the rope"
"dug in shorter, defended into the off side"
"slung down wide of the stumps, a slower ball but it veers away harmlessly outside the tramlines"
"gets it on target this time, dipping on leg stump... but Roy times a sweet ping off the toes and it outruns fine leg for four!"
"on a length, slow and curving in a touch as Roy flicks across the line, gets a single to fine leg"
"overpitched, full outside off and Buttler just presses forward, strokes a crisp drive through the covers for four from his first ball"
"tossed up on the stumps, Roy backs away and mows it down the ground, straight back over the bowler and long-on can't quite cut it off despite a valiant dive!"
"flighted, Roy reverses his stance... and swats it up and away over backward point! Roy's a-roving already, no time wasted"
tossed up and punched for a quick single into the covers
"flat delivery, skidding on to off stump, Buttler picks out extra cover"
"gives this a bit more loop, nicely into the slot for a batsman of Buttler's class, he takes a small step and <i>belts</i> it through the covers for another boundary"
"quicker ball, goes back and chops towards mid-off"
"oh, half a chance! Punched back down the pitch in the air, <b>Udana gets a hand on it in his follow-through!</b> Tough to call it a drop, a real reaction effort, he did well to get fingertips on it"
"over the wicket, clipped off the pads, one to midwicket as the throw comes in"
"mix-up between the batsmen, Roy is at the wrong end... <b>and there's an appeal for obstructing the field here!</b> He has turned belatedly as mid-off made the stop, seemed to be running in a straight line for his ground as Shanaka's throw hit him on the back. Roy's been <a href=http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10718/scorecard/1031433/england-vs-south-africa-2nd-t20i-sa-tour-of-england-2017 target=_blank>given out like this before</a>, of course. But he's okay this time, the third umpire deciding he didn't change course in order to get in the way of the throw"
"piles on the pain, Dorothy-ed over long-on! <b>Roy goes big with another meaty thump down the ground</b>, second six of the innings"
"low full toss, can't get this one away, though"
"full and angling across, Roy drives and the ball squirts to backward point... <b>was that a bump ball?</b> SL appeal, and the umpires are going to send this upstairs as well; but it only takes one replay to confirm this went off the toe of the bat into the ground"
"Buttler skips down, clubbed over mid-off... <b>only just clears Thisara!</b> Big leap from the big man, but in vain. Third four from six balls for Buttler"
"tossed up, this spins a touch, Buttler drives off the back foot... <b>but sends it straight to cover!</b> A miscued effort, and he'll head off disappointed"
"bit of width, Hales clatters it through point off the back foot, gets off the mark with a boundary"
"pushed through flatter, tapped away"
"grips and spins, Hales sweeps... <b>trapped in front!</b> And he doesn't review! That initially looked pretty plumb, though on second view it may have been sliding a touch leg side. Umpire Wimalasiri thought long and hard before raising his finger... Two in four balls for Aponso!"
"tossed up on leg stump, clipped down the ground to long-on to get off the mark"
"back of a length outside off, defended into the ground and Morgan calls Roy through for a quick single"
pitched up and driven for one wide of mid-off
"slower delivery, dipping and gripping on off stump, Morgan dabs it towards backward point"
shuffles into line and defends back down the track
"another slowie from Malinga, short of a length and played beautifully by Morgan, driving on the up past extra cover and it outruns Kusal Mendis to the rope!"
"pace off again, slung down wide and clipped to cover coming forwards"
"pushed through, some extra bounce outside off as Roy cuts hard and misses"
lobbed up straight and pushed down the ground for one
"flighted, makes room to chip over mid-off, Morgan goes inside out with a trademark stroke for four"
"flatter and quicker, tucked into a gap"
pushed through on the stumps and Roy flicks against the spin for a single through square leg
darted on off and Morgan picks out a fielder on the drive
"floated up on the stumps, Roy comes across and punches a single"
"another poor bit of running, and this does result in a wicket! Morgan reverse-swept in the air, didn't quite carry to short third man but there was then hesitation from the batsmen, with Roy halfway down... <b>he eventually made up his mind, but by then Morgan was struggling</b>, Sandakan collected the throw and hit the stumps from five yards!"
"pushed through, maybe the wrong'un, played back to the bowler"
"sliding away outside off, into the tramlines and called"
"spinning in this time, Roy rocks back and heaves down the pitch, can't get it away"
"flat delivery, swatted for one back past the bowler"
"tossed up, straightening on off stump, defended"
"lobbed up on off, Roy drives inside to out for a single through the covers"
"slightly lower arm, sliding in to hit the front pad, heading down leg though"
"dragged down, Stokes marches out and whips a single"
"tossed up full outside off, Roy belts another drive for one"
"and he switches again, darts an offbreak down the leg side, big appeal for caught behind - must have flicked the pad"
"another impassioned appeal for lbw, this skidded into the  pads... but probably missing leg, again. Offspin is supposed to be his weaker suit, but he's troubling Stokes!"
"loss full toss outside off, Roy goes for a reverse-swipe and fails to connect!"
"<b>dropped!</b> Steepling slog-sweep out towards deep midwicket, it should be a comfortable catch for the substitute fielder, Sadeera Samarawickrama, <b>but he spills it like a bar of soap!</b>"
worked into a gap for one
"floated up full, this time Roy nails the slog-sweep, <b> sends it flat towards the boundary boards at deep square leg!</b> Cleared the fielder this time... but not the groundsman, who intercepted it brilliantly the other side of the rope!"
"<b>dropped!</b> Another life for Roy! <b>This time Shanaka drops a dolly at mid-off!</b> Completely miscued, maybe didn't pick the wrong'un, went h-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-g-h into the sky, but straight through Shanaka as he steadied himself for the catch!"
"<b>and now an appeal for lbw</b>, turned down! Pitched around leg stump, straightened as Stokes swept... but enough doubt for the umpire and SL don't review"
"Kamindu lobs the ball up on off, Roy smears it hard and flat through the covers for a boundary, beats the dive"
tossed up and driven down the ground
"<b>switches to right-arm round the wicket</b>, Stokes steps out malevolently and swats one through the covers"
"SLA, low full toss and <b>Roy mullers it over the leg-side boundary!</b> That didn't come out right for Kamindu - <b>Roy goes to his fifty from 30 balls</b>"
"<b>dropped!</b> Third life for Roy, all in the space of two overs! This was tougher, Kusal Mendis running in from the cover boundary, <b>but again it went to ground!</b> Kamindu misses out on a maiden international wicket"
pushed through and punched for a single
tossed up and belted down the ground
"pushed through, spinning away outside off and Stokes rocks back and slaps the ball through point for four"
"wrong'un, spinning in, hits the pads and squirts away"
"tossed up straight, Roy heaves across the line, <b>spanks this over the ropes at deep midwicket!</b> Good connection on that one"
"six more, down the ground! This was not a clean hit, <b>but sailed just about far enough</b> straight back down the ground! Sixth six for Roy!"
"spinning away, wide of the stumps, Roy goes reaching for a cut... and Dickwella is convinced he's edged it! Roy <b>reviews</b>, but Ultra Edge has picked something up! Roy looks disgusted, but probably as much with the shot as the decision"
"Kamindu fires in an offbreak from round the wicket, punched back to the bowler"
"dragged down, Stokes rocks into position, <b>carts the ball over the boundary at deep square leg!</b> Stokes muscles his first six"
"lobbed up on off stump, tapped gently into the covers"
full and whipped away through midwicket as Stokes comes down
"darted on leg stump, drilled through mid-on"
"floated up wide of the stumps, Stokes steps across and pings a drive to long-off"
"tossed up from over the wicket, Stokes steps out and punches one more down the ground"
"tossed up, loopy delivery but Moeen can only pick out cover on the drive"
"full on the stumps, Moeen goes down the ground... <b>plopped beyond the ropes at long-on!</b> Sweetly struck, Moeen is up and running"
"flatter, skidding on as Moeen swings hard, gets a thick inside edge for one"
"length outside off, Stokes slices a drive towards deep point"
"on the stumps, clipped away for a single through square leg"
"sliding leg side, flicked away fine for one"
"over the wicket, short of a length and Stokes gets tucked up, takes a blow on the thigh swinging across the line"
"hits a length, <b>big top edge from Stokes</b>, heaving across the line... but it doesn't quite carry to third man, spins past him as he runs in but holds up rather than running for four"
superb pick-up from Moeen! Just a flick off the pads and it <b>sails all the way over deep backward square!</b>
"mowed by Mo! Stand and deliver, just cleared the front leg and <b>battered this into the stands at cow corner!</b> His third six from eight balls!"
"fuller, driven into the ground and it bobbles down to long-on"
"steps out, bit of width and he lashes through the covers, beats the despairing dive from Kusal on the rope"
"bowled him! Slides this under the bat, Moeen heaves down the ground, <b>misses and Dhananjaya hits!</b> A neat cameo from Moeen but he's swung his last for tonight"
"fired in on the stumps, Denly flicks one through midwicket"
"gets a touch too straight, Stokes works it away for one square on the leg side"
"over the wicket, lobbed up and driven for a single"
"floated up outside off, Stokes reverse-dabs it past short third man, they come back for two"
"oh, <b>so close to bowling him!</b> A viciously dipping slower-ball yorker, squares up Denly on the back foot, he plays inside the line and it <i>just</i> misses off stump!"
"full, 74mph and this time he spots it, driven into the covers"
"slinger! Fires the leg-stump yorker in, nearly knocks Denly off his feet, does well to keep it out via a combination of bat and boot"
another change-up - although I suppose the quick one is actually the change-up - Denly swings and misses as it spins slowly through to the keeper
"length ball, this sits up and he drives wide of extra cover for a single"
"slow and in the channel, Stokes gets across and stabs a drive through cover point"
"darted leg side, Stokes backs away and heaves for one out to deep midwicket"
"another dot for Denly, can only chop down on a quicker ball"
"flat and hittable, Denly gets hold of it at last, cleanly hit down the ground for a straight four"
"skidding on outside off, sliced over backward point, frees the arms and gets it away for back-to-back fours off a thickish edge"
"fizzed down, swings across the line without timing"
"lobbed up and Denly advances, swung away wide of long-on, strikes it well once again and this skips for four more as the fielder runs around! Good over for England, and Denly"
"over the wicket, low full toss, clubbed down the ground"
"slower delivery, sits up to be driven square for a single"
"taking the pace off again, Stokes swings across the line for one through midwicket"
"fired in full around leg stump, Denly can only dig out one down the ground to long-off"
"mistimed into the leg side, Stokes shakes his head after failing to connect with a big hit down the ground"
"back-of-the-hand slower ball, chopped through backward point, they think of a second... but the throw is good, 'No!' yells Stokes"
"starts with a low full toss, Denly flicks it firmly square, Dhananjaya does well to get something on it and prevent four"
"takes pace off, does for Denly, <b>who holes out to long-on!</b> Malinga gets his man, but not before Denly had struck a few blows... Tried to hit straight but dragged across it, completely mistimed and this time the simple catch is taken"
"Malinga hits! <b>Low full toss does the job!</b> Stokes' hard-scrabble stay is ended, he throws his head back, thinking he should have smacked that... but the dip and swerve sent the ball thudding into off stump"
"fires in the yorker, Plunkett manages to get bat in the way! Dug it out well"
"drilled down the ground for four! Sweetly struck as he made room, long-on couldn't cut it off"
"slower ball, over leg stump! Beats Plunkett swinging across the line, but just clears the woodwork"
"that'll help, sliced for another boundary! No third man and it squirted away off the outside edge"
"pitched up, Rashid throws the hands and punches over cover point, just a single to the sweeper"
"full toss on the pads, Plunkett whips it square, wants to come back for two... Rashid is struggling as the throw comes in, would be out by yards, <b>but Udana misses with a shy at all three!</b>"
"full, 135kph/84mph and dug out down the ground for one more"
"poleaxed! Full and straight, Rashid clears the front leg but only manages a <b>thick inside edge into his stumps!</b> Udana strikes with the penultimate ball of the innings"
"full on the pads, 82mph and clipped firmly through square leg, they'll come back for two - meaning <b>Sri Lanka need 188 to win</b>"
"low full toss, dragged into the leg side"
"leg sided, a touch flatter, nudged to midwicket"
and this one beats everyone! Buttler can't grasp as the ball slides past a wild swing. Keeper error
"tossed up this time, dipping invitingly on the crease and nurdled through the leg side"
"good areas, line and length, defended uneasily on the crease"
"<strong>bowled him! </strong>And Denly strikes in his first over back! A violent slog across the line, perfect length, doesn't turn, doesn't need to turn, as the middle stump is pegged back. Scenes at the Premadasa!"
"<B>absolutely flogged to square leg!</b> Back of a length, utterly nailed on the pull, but Alex Hales stoops to gather. A stunning take from England's foremost white-ball lummox, but he's not convinced he's got his hands under it... the umpires are taking a look. Did it bounce inches short ... potentially... it bounces up into his hands, but was it off the fingers or the turf? Soft signal was not out ... <B>not out it is</b>"
"wafted into the off side, from a full length, a hesitation on the single, and through they go in the end"
"quicker delivery from Curran, popping into a back-foot prod, that surprised him, and he's on the balls of his feet as the call for a single comes in. Curran hits the sticks with his shy, but the dive is successful, and<strong> the ball rattles away to the boundary for good measure! </strong>"
"dipping into the crease, a slower ball, good riposte"
"on the back foot, battered to cover. Curran mixing it up well"
"on the back foot, hauled out to square leg, a decent over in spite of the over-throws"
"looped onto the pads, tucked square"
"down on one knee, an ungainly flogged sweep, under-edged through the keeper's legs"
an ambitious bottom-handed drive into the covers
"hoisted out to the leg side, this is a fine start from Denly, that second string paying off well"
"<strong>bowled him again!</strong> A near-replica of that first dismissal, Dickwella playing for the spin and just playing across the line as a result. Good flight and dip, pegging back off stump, and Denly has two!"
"well-flighted legbreak, cautiously poked back down the pitch. Well, well..."
"full and fast, sliding down leg as it deflects off the back pad to point"
"on the back foot, opens the face to ride the bounce down to third man"
"on the back foot, <strong>bashed fiercely through the covers. </strong>Take that, doubters!"
"much fuller, driven with a full face to mid-on"
"slower ball, supremely hoicked over the leg side. Once he'd picked it, the rest was immaterial, just get some bat through it, son!"
"<B>battered back past the bowler!</b> Brilliant double-whammy, hanging back in the crease, freeing the arms, nailing it"
"yet again, luring a mistimed slog with a well-flighted non-spinner. Inside-edged"
"that's better, bashed out through the leg side"
"skidding on once again, rattling off the back pad"
"high elbow, pressed into the leg side for another single"
"driven back down the line once more, Denly pounces in his followthrough"
"well flighted, forcing the straight-batted defence. What a spell, what a comeback! Where has he been for eight years and 384 matches?"
"back of a length, bashing the deck, defended to cover"
"short but straight, clobbered hard but straight to cover"
"<strong>top-edged pull, but flies safe!</strong> Fine leg is up, and so there's no cutting that off"
"slower ball, loose full toss on the hips, does well to deflect it very fine, past backward square and away to the rope"
opens the face to steer to third man
"slower yorker, that's well directed, and chiselled into the covers"
tucked to the leg side
"caught in no-man's land, looking for a drive, under-edged into the crease"
"clipped up and over mid-on, the sweeper gathers"
"firmly forward, bat and bat together as Rashid drops his length back"
"<B>reverse sweep, times it well, but Hales saw him going, and snaffles the catch!</b> There he was, lurking down at deep backward point, perhaps unnoticed against the crowd. But that's a big wicket for England"
clipped to long-on to get off the mark
<b>there's that extra bounce!</b> Zipping through to the keeper
"outside off, and through to the keeper, back of a length once more, with a scrambled seam"
picked up off the toes and over the leg side. That's superbly nailed
"opens the face, and drives out to backward point"
"<strong>plinked sweetly over extra cover!</strong> That's a lovely strike, recognising that he didn't need to over-hit it to clear mid-off"
"back of a length, hauled to deep backward square"
"looped onto a good length, met with an urgent clip on the up through the leg side"
"held back through the air, attempted drive but not timed"
"pushed out a touch wider, and gathered at point"
"well bowled by Rashid, dragging his length back as de Silva advances. Deflected off the pads"
"lots of air, very full, cut to the off side with very flat feet"
"battered hard down to long-off, gathered on the bounce to finish the over"
"<B>absolutely wellied over long-on!</b> That was well and truly in the slot, and launched with alacrity into the night sky!"
high-elbowed drive into the covers
"back of a length, tucked into the gap"
"<B>spanked hard into the leg side, and lost in the floodlights!</b> Straight through the field as the fielders are blinded!"
"pulled over the off side with a reversed stance, and this is an exhibition of strokes now!"
tucked off the toes to midwicket
"tossed up, into the slot,<strong> spanked to deep midwicket!</strong> Mendis had a go, but got a fractional top-edge on his slog sweep, that's a timely breakthrough"
"googly, faster, flatter. Can't get it away"
"very full, raps the pads ... is that actually missing much! <B>England are reviewing.</B> It is leg-sided, but very adjacent... sure enough, <strong>it's taking out leg stump!</strong> Two in the over for Rashid, both of the set batsmen, England very much in command"
"fizzed onto a full leg-sided length, defended from the crease"
flicked uppishly to the leg side
"on the pads, nudged very square. Rashid has 3 for 10 in three overs!"
hoicked out to deep midwicket
"back of a length, worked with the turn to deep midwicket"
"flicked urgently off the pads, out to deep midwicket"
"swept hard, but just another single to backward square"
"on the pads, back of a length, clipped uppishly to deep midwicket"
"<B>spank!</b> That's more like it for Sri Lanka, the sort of noise off the bat that confirms there's only one score coming up. High over the midwicket fence!"
"tight to the pads, tucked to the leg side"
"<strong>slow and cheeky!</strong> So much air, dipping so late as Rashid takes all the pace off the ball, and that's a wild and woolly swing"
worked to the leg side
"on the up, back of a length, pressed back to the bowler"
"googly, sliding into the pads, and deflecting fine"
"another googly to complete an outstanding spell. His best in T20Is, with 15 dots out of 24 to go along with the three wickets. It's left Sri Lanka floundering"
beats the inside-edge of a loose drive
"very full, aiming for the wide yorker, and beats another wild drive"
"full again, a low full toss, much straighter line, and chipped in the air behind the bowler"
"punched off the back foot, Jordan gathers in his followthrough"
"smacks the pad with a leg-sided yorker, Rashid rushes round to intercept a thin deflection through third man"
"right up to the blockhole, pressed into the leg side"
"a massive swing, as Plunkett shapes it across Perera's bows. Very well bowled"
"banged in short, but too short"
"short and straight, seemed to be cramped for room, but he <B>gets underneath it supremely to lift it over fine leg!</b> That'll help"
"<B>pongoed over long-on!</B> Plunkett errs in length, right in the slot with the wide offcutter, and battered back whence it came!"
loses his shape with a wild hoick across the line! Careful now...
"<strong>full, straight, back goes the off stump!</strong> Sneaks the slower ball through Shanaka's wild slog, and that's a good riposte, albeit a pretty flimsy shot"
"full length, calmly driven to extra cover"
"crunched out to cover, a low full toss"
"<B>hammered into the stands!</b> A slower ball from Jordan, but he misses his length, and that is just perfect for the baseball swing over midwicket, saw it from the hand, and skidded into the middle of the bat!"
"inside-out drive, digging out the yorker to long-off"
"<B>crashed to mid-off!</b> Made room, tried to get under the ball, but scuffed his stroke straight to Stokes. That's another limp dismissal with Perera running out of allies"
"very full and wide, can't lay bat on that one"
"<B>yorker, nailed</B>. Second ball, right in the blockhole, clatters the base of middle stump. England are nearly home"
"right up to the blockhole, slapped down to long-on for the single. That'll do for England"
"knee-high full-toss, swinging into the pads, tucked to the on-side to give Perera the strike once more"
"another full-toss, and utterly miscued out to deep midwicket. Not ideal from Curran but those balls can be harder to get away than length balls"
"slower ball again, chipped high into the leg side, but lands out of the reach of three fielders"
"very full, very straight, pressed down the ground to long-off"
"another full-toss, but arrow-straight. Tapped with a straight bat to cover"
"yorker, well-directed, tapped to point"
"slapped hard over backward point, not enough width to dent the requirement"
"wide full-toss, dumped over the covers, but intercepted on the boundary. He turns down the run, as boundaries are the only currency now..."
driven into the covers
"thumped down the ground, this match has lost its fizz"
"excellent yorker, and an undeserved upshot as Perera opens the face well but some lax fielding at point allows a welcome boundary."
toe-ended for the single
"decent yorker, pushed into the covers"
"pumped on the up, out to wide long-on, where Jordan does brilliantly to gather a fast-travelling ball at his shins"
"on the pads, a loose length ball and that's <B>muscled fiercely over midwicket!</b>"
"chiselled into the leg side, briefly thinking of the single, but it's boundaries or bust. (and a no-ball would be handy)"
"<strong>full toss, and belted into the stands to bring up his fifty!</strong> What might have been with a bit of support for the skipper?"
"tossed into the slot, but Malinga can't connect on a big wind-up"
"good length, full and wide, and Perera can't connect"
<B>pumped hard and straight down the ground!</B> No wonder Malinga is backing up where a runner would be standing. He knows where these shots are heading!
"low full toss, <strong>clobbered out to deep midwicket</strong>, and Denly has his third of a renaissance night! Probably his worst ball of the day, but it matters not. The end of a fine captain's knock, and it's all over bar the slogging"
"good length, eased into the covers. Languid"
"<B>Denly has four on his comeback!</b> Full and straight, Malinga plays all round it, and that is a very comprehensive win!"
