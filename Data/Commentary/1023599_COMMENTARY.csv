"full and straight, defended"
"creamed for six. Again, just has to be short or even have the look of a shortish length. Paine picks the length early and thwacks a cross-batted swat over midwicket"
"fantastic comeback. Adjusts the length and asks Paine to play the toughest shot on a bouncy surface, a drive. Moving away a touch and Paine can't control his drive because his feet are not quite to the pitch. Skews off the outside half and Ross takes a sitter at backward point"
133 kph bouncer that loops over the head
"better length. Back of a length outside off, but it's still so high that it's called the second bouncer of the over. No-ball."

hit back straight past the bowler for one to long-on
"flat and wide outside off, scythed to third man"
"given! Sangakkara cannnnnot believe it. Flat delivery on leg, struck Sangakkara on leg. But did that pitch in line? Umpire Wilson thinks so. I don't. Pitched just outside, I reckon, especially because Badree is not a big turner. Definitely no bat. Doesn't matter. Sangakkara trudges off"
pushed calmly to long-on
"another full delivery, driven to long-off for a run"
"bowled. Straight through. Was that the wisest choice of shot with this score? Full and straight from Steketee, Short gives himself some room and looks to go straight but misses the ball. The zing bails light up and Hurricanes in a bit of trouble"

played out into the cover region
nudged into the leg side for one
"nurdled through midwicket for two more. Well placed, well run"
"slower legcutter outside off, worked away comfortably through backward point for three. Ooh, that maybe out. Bailey was cruising the third but his bat got jarred into the turf just before he made the crease and he couldn't get his feet behind the line either. Peirson, the keeper, was unsighted by all this, but still takes out the bails in his own time, yet in good time. Terribly unlucky for Bailey."
"good length outside off, pushed towards cover for one"
tickled off his pads towards square leg for one
pushed out towards mid-on with the full face
"too short, back of a length on off, Wells gets away from the line and sways. Peirson saves four with a great take"

"slow through the air outside off, played into the off side"
"flatter and straight, blocked back"
good again. Tight around off and Baz is forced to defend
"taken off the first delivery. Extra bounce. Hits a good length, and with his height, that was always going to be a tough shot. Peirson wanted to ride the bounce and work the ball into the leg side but could only get a thick leading edge which landed in mid-off's hands. Turned his back and went off straightaway. Could have easily crossed over to give Baz strike. Not good from Peirson"

"full and wide, 129 kph, a legcutter. Off the top edge and way over short third man for four"

"another no-ball. Not good from Broad. More than runs, it's momentum too. A legcutter outside off, McCullum misses his drive"

"four more. Flat on off, Baz gets low and creams his sweep through square leg. Lovely ping off the pad. McCullum and his Heat are turning it on"

"131 kph, on the leg stump, a thick inside edge past fine leg for three"
"full and wide, swinging away. Lofted over cover for four. That was so easy. Just got underneath the length"
"slower ball on a length, cut to short third man"
"a loopy bouncer outside off, McCullum comes down, looking to forehand volley through point, no contact"
"sliced for four more. Full and wide outside off, in McCullum's arc. Poor bowling. How can you bowl full and wide when no one is deep and the off side is the shorter boundary? Ridiculous."
"there you go, four more. Full and wide, Baz hits it along the ground but in the gap. Easy runs. Not a great over, nowhere near"
"where is it? Outta here. Full on leg, in the arc and Lynn says fetch that. No one can. Swung away deeeeeep over midwicket. Lands on the roof and out of the Gabba. <b>125-metres long.</b>"

a thrashy cut to deep point

"a low full toss. No, can't be bowling those. McCullum is able to get underneath it and send the ball over midwicket. Used his reach"
"loud yelps of 'caaatch'. Short on middle, McCullum mis-times his pull, hangs in the air for a while. Deep square leg gets around, but can't get across to it in time. Beats him and trickles into the boundary"

"full and straight, Lynn gives himself room and slashes a square drive to the sweeper cover"
"wow, 144 kph swinging delivery and straight. Ross has no idea what has happened? He's undone by pure pace, add swing to that and you get wickets. Ross looks to work the ball into the leg side, but the ball goes past his closed bat face and hits leg stump."
