They check again, possibly to see if the keeper has collected it cleanly. He's done fine"
bails are taken off again and they go upstairs to check for the stumping. But it seems as though the batsman has just slid his foot back in. Voges was coming forward to this length ball but the ball is pushed across from around the wicket and bounces a tad more than he anticipated. Gets beaten
"Lenton is jumping up in delight and they are celebrating. But they have referred this upstairs. That was a bizarre sequence of events. Voges went for the slog sweep and misses and the bowler appeals for caught behind as he sees the bowler celebrating. The umpire says not out an d replays show that Voges was a long way outside the crease. Had Lenton taken off the bails, he would have been stumped. but the debutant started celebrating and ran down towards the bowler to celebrate.

"pulls his front foot up and pulls around it, like the West Indians of old, except this was more out of nervousness than grace. Johnson hurries him with a short ball"
top edge flies over the wicketkeeper. All that pace Johnson's putting in on the ball works against him this time as Morgan gets outside the line of the bouncer and makes just enough contact with a pull
"back of a length and outside off, steers it to point"
"shortish and outside off, Rohrer tries to ramp it to third man but fails"
"<b>lobs just over the bowler</b>. Oh, this is beautiful deception from Tye. Sneaks in the slower ball, on a good length, on off stump, and Rohrer, who has not looked in nick at all so far, gets a leading edge as he tries to work it to midwicket. Mid-on runs in, the bowler runs back, lands between them"
"back of a length delivery on off stump, Morgan attempts a flick off he back foot, but is beaten by the slower ball that hits his body after he was through with the shot"
"change of pace again, this time angled across the left-hander. Morgan tries to wait and go for a late cut, but the WACA lends it a little more venom. Extra bounce makes sure it sails over the bat"
"<b>beautiful finish</b>. This is another slower ball, pitching on a good length on off stump, and swerving back into the left-hander, who was set up with a big backlift, aiming to cut. Just about manages an inside edge as he hacks his bat down in time to save himself from an lbw"
"relief for Thunder, and Rohrer. He gets a short ball that allows him to get under the ball and leverage it over deep square leg"
pulls a short one to deep square leg
"cut to backward point. The plan works. Turner was brought on to see if he can prey on the pressure that was built by the quicks. And he has managed to do just that. This is another flatter delivery on leg stump Morgan backs away and prepares to cut, and all he does is offer a catch like it was fielding practice"
picks the gap between point and short third man. Turner offers room and Russell exploits it in a manner rather un-Russell like. Delicate little late cut
"ooh, there's murder in his eyes as he goes to slog a length ball outside off. But for all the huffing and puffing he misses it completely"
"oooh, top-edge. The bowler thinks he's got Russell. Poor fellow, he looks up to see the ball land well short of backward square leg running in from the boundary"
"back of a length and outside off, Russell sets up in his power position and swats it to long-on"
"pops it to short midwicket! Doesn't time the short ball, possibly because it was cramping him. Contact is made high on the bat, which virtually means there is no timing on the shot. Scorchers are making sure this is a quick finish"
"full toss on leg stump, flicks it to deep square leg"
goes for the bouncer as Russell clears his front leg. It's high enough to make the batsman think it would be called a wide. Tye seems to have toed the line
"ooh, lovely slower ball. Just outside off stump, on a length, and with Russell swinging blind, not concentrating on his balance, which is usually good when he is in one of his moods, he misses"
solid end to the over as he puts in a slower ball on middle stump and Russell fails to pick it. Slog and miss
"fuller delivery at 139 kph, angled across the right-hander. Cummins drives to point"
picks up the offcutter - which rises up to around chest-height outside off - and taps it to the sweeper
scorcher from a Scorcher. Too quick for Russell as he backs away and tries to slap a short ball over point. Johnson one-ups him with a 143 kph delivery that whistles past him
"skier, massive skier, it's cover's catch. Turner calls for it (That's brilliant work because he had two of his team-mates also hunting down the ball) He watches it carefully. He moves to his left a little bit to get under the ball and takes it reverse cup. Easy peasy. All this after a fuller ball outside off - slower as well - lures a thick outside edge as Russell throws his bat at it"
"bangs it in, but slides it down leg."
"full delivery on off stump, Cummins jams it out and runs. Oooh, this is going to be dangerous. Short cover is on the ball quickly, having moved to his right, sends in an underarm throw and had it it, Cummins would have been out. Not even in the frame"
"140 kph short ball on middle and leg, Lenton ducks under it and gets up to see the ump calling a wide"
"finishes with a full toss on off stump - think that actually swung away, squared the batsman up who was thinking of flicking it through midwicket. Lenton checks his shot at the last second and manages to keep the leading edge down as it goes past the bowler's left hand"
runs down the track at a back of a length delivery outside off and swings as hard as he can. That means the outside edge that results soars over the wicketkeeper's reach
"that's the legcutter, deceives Cummins as he comes down the track again and goes for the slog over cow corner. The bottom hand comes off the bat, but the guy has so much power that it carries one-bounce to the boundary. Great effort from Willey though, moving to his right, trying to pull off a catch that was almost always never going to happen"
"short and wide outside off, lashes it to deep point"
"what's happened there? This 128 kph delivery pitches on a good length on leg stump and just decks away off the seam. Lenton, cramped and awkward with no feet, goes for a flick and is comfortably left behind"
super response! This is floated up outside off and the batsman cashes in with a good stride forward - that's what made this shot - and a full flow of the arms. Fantastic shot over cover

"that's an extra cover drive. Imagine the power to hit that almost to the rope.  Cummins clears the front leg, gets under a length ball just outside off stump and launches it over the top. Bounces about an inch or so short"
"slower ball outside off, Cummins practices his golf swing again but this time he is beaten for the lack of pace"

"back of a length and outside off, swings wildly and lets it alone"
"back of a length and outside off, Lenton backs away to try and slap it over backward point. No dice"
"smashes it down the throat of long-on. Turner has another catch, good captaincy to have him patrolling the straight boundaries. Good bowling to bring him in play as Marsh aims on and around off stump"
"spots the batsman coming down the track, sneaks in the legcutter, and makes sure the length is short as well. Cummins goes through with the slog, totally unbalanced when he makes connection because of the change in pace. But deep square leg running in had no chance of getting under the ball"

"shortish and outside off, steers it towards cover point"
"strays so far down the leg side and Cummins hammers it to the long leg boundary. All he had to do was make sure to place it wide of the man and with the length also being so short, he has very little trouble"
