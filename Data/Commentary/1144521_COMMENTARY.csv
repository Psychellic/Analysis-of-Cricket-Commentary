"rolled his fingers over that, but gave Perera too much width. No timing, and it goes straight to point"
nurdled down to third man. Good first over from West Indies
angling away from off stump. Good line and length. Defended into the covers
shorter and into Perera's ribs. Think it came back in slightly too. Strong start from Thomas
"gets it fine of the point fielder on this occasion. Requires third man to cut it off, but the batsmen run two"
"glorious from Perera! That was Sanath-like. A little bit of width and Perera drills through the extra cover region, sending the ball racing for four"
leaves it alone
"short, targeted the body again. Tucks the batsman up"
"yorker, and <strong>nearly chopped it on</strong>! It got underneath the bat and was trickling on after hitting the bottom of the bat. Karunaratne had to be sharp to knock it away with the back of the bat"
driven back to the bowler
a drag down this time. Cottrell hasn't quite got his lines right so far
"another example of that. Full on leg stump, and with fine leg up, that was asking for trouble. Glanced past the man, and there was no stopping it racing to the boundary"
this one was a half-volley well outside off stump. Lucky for him that the Sri Lanka captain missed out
"gorgeous shot. Full on middle and leg, and the batsman works it away through midwicket. Perfectly balanced at the moment of impact and dispatched with authority. Expensive over"
"some frustration in that last delivery. Well directed bouncer, and Karunaratne happy to duck under"
angled down to third man
wide outside off. The ball kept low
full and wide. Karunaratne guides to poiint
"much too wide from West Indies again. The batsman pounces on it, cutting it to backward point. The third man, Cottrell, found his attempt at saving the four in vain"
comes back with a short delivery the batsman gets his head away from
poked to point. Solid start from Sri Lanka
up and over mid-off. Perera steps out of his crease and flat bats it over point. Sri Lanka are in the mood right now
"full and int the stumps. Perera digs it out to deep midwicket. They think about two, but Perera reconsiders"
shoulders arms to that one
"this is a better line to Karunaratne. Just outside off on a length, looking for swing. Isn't any for now, but the batsman's cautious"
driven to long-on

"wide. The batsman attempts a lazy cut, but the ball sneaks under the bat"

"flashed at a ball that was too close to cut, found himself beaten"
defended into the offside
"bouncer to finish off. Maiden over, and an excellent one from Thomas. Reins SL in after a breezy start"
wide of the wicket to start off. Defended to point but the pair scuttle a quick run
comes around the wicket to the captain. Much too straight and Karunaratne uses the angle to work it to square leg
uppish. Perera lost control over that one. Leading edge spooned it dangerously close to mid-off. Good delivery
follows it up with a drag down legside. Easiest thing in the world for Perera to get a tickle on it and watch it across the fine leg boundary
"better line. Wants to get it across Perera, which is an understandable plan, though one that requires great accuracy and patience"
Much too wide down the legside
"poor, poor start from Gabriel. Identical to the one three balls ago. On leg stump, and Perera need only get a feather on it to pick up an easy four. 11 off the over"
"full and wide. Asking to be driven through the covers, and the batsman only too happy to oblige. Beautifully stroked up and over cover. SL are racing now"

"around the wicket from Gabriel. Yorker to start off the over, which Perera digs out comfortably"
"no timing, Perera wanted to loft it over mid-on, but a thick inside edge takes it to square leg"
pulls his length back to Dimuth. Forces him to defend on the backfoot
"padded through the onside. Gabriel got away with that drag-down a little bit. It has been a better over, though"
"stepped away to try and open up the offside, but Gabriel followed him. Perera settled for driving it to mid-off instead"
"on Perera's legs, but there's protection enough in the deep for the fielder to cut the leak off at two. Four off the over"
"short of a length, poked to point"
defended back to the bowler. West Indies not picking up a wicket in the PP could be a crucial factor in this innings
"whipped to the onside, but can't clear the infielder"
"needed to hurry there! Flicked to the onside, and the batsman had to hurry!"
too short and Perera swivelled to pull gloriously to midwicket. There was a man sweeping up

"full, on off stump, and tapped off the front foot. Back to the bowler"
<b>oh dear! Did the ball slip?</b> A loopy delivery that was aimed near Hope's shoulder. Does well to duck under the ball. Malinga apologises...

"short and wide, Gayle flirted with it, but it was out of his reach. Thankfully for him"
finally! Gayle unfurls the drive over extra cover. Didn't time it but was always ailing to the boundary. Just the one bounce

"caressed through the covers, but smart fielding by the captain cuts off the single"

angled through the offside. Gayle looks a little more - what's the word - on track - now
"well directed inswinging yorker, nearly through the gate"
"good length delivery, nudged to midwicket"
"big appeal from SL. Inswinging yorker, and looked like Gayle got a thick inside edge on it. Which is just as well, because he was otherwise dead and buried"
"caught the leading edge just as Hetmyer closed the face of the bat. Through the offside, but in no real danger"
hoicked through the onside

low full toss that Gayle sees coming. Sets himself up and drives through over long-on using his bottom hand
"and gone the very next ball! Oh Chris Gayle, what a moment this is! Sent this absolute kilometres into the air, and the fielder gets underneath it and adjusts wonderfully to take a sharp catch"

nearly dragged it onto his stumps. Inside edge scuttles away to the fine leg boundary. Was uncomfortably close to the stumps
"tucked away to the onside, and with Gayle gone, the batsmen can take quicker singles"
"<strong>that was a big run-out opportunity</strong> Pooran drove it to mid-on and hared through for a run that Hetmyer was never interested it. Direct hit would have had him gone, but he's just about home"

tucked away to fine leg. They called for two but opted against it
"stump-to-stump, and Hetmyer solidly defends"
slower bouncer that nearly deceived him. Manages to get it through for one

"leathered through the onside, but the only man in the ring on the legside does brilliantly to get a hand on it, and save what was a certain boundary"
sliced through cover
well stopped at point. The ball was there to be driven but Pooran just couldn't drill it through the gap
"cutter. Nothing to work with for Hetmyer. WI will have to take the initiative at some point, though"
and that was what Hetmyer was thinking. Used his feet to try and lob it over the infield. Misses completely. That will compound West Indies' frustration
"what on earth was that? <strong>Direct hit, gone</strong>! Hetmyer dismissed Tickled it to short third and set off on a run without ever lifting his head up to see if his partner was following through. When he did he was more than halfway down, and a direct hit meant he wasn't even in the frame. West Indies are rocking now"
excellent delivery first up to the captain. Tailing in and strikes Holder on the pads. Muffled appeal; the ball was going down
"filthy long hop to start, but not punished"
and another one! This is so wide it's probably violating its parole
flighted and straighter. Much better
flicked to fine leg
"long hop again, but Holder isn't quite set yet to try and launch it out of the ground. Guided to midwicket instead"
too short and wide. Drilled through the offside. It's a mystery how Vandersay hasn't conceded a boundary yet this over
best delivery of the bunch. Almost got Holder to drag it on. He'll bowl better overs
"pitched on leg stump, and tailed back into his pads. Some excitement from the bowler, but probably going over leg"
flash from Pooran. He probably saw that as a half-volley though it wasn't quite full enough. SL are strangling West Indies out of this game
nudged through the onside
full but wide down legside. Rajitha's looking for swing now
mistimed to mid-on
"Lovely timing. Leans into the drive and strokes it through cover. No power on that at all, but doesn't stop the ball from hitting the boundary rope"

"<B>a lot of spin!</b> Full outside off, and turning away sharply. Pooran goes for a drive, but misses, and the keeper whips the bails off. Was his back leg outside the crease? The TV umpire is having a look, and nope - looks like his back leg was grounded. Pooran is safe"

spanked down to long-on. No timing though
"much too wide, and the keeper can't collect. Vandersay has been pretty poor, and lucky not to go for more"

eased through the onside for one
"good line and length, giving Pooran no room to work with. Just blocked back to the bowler"

punched back down the ground off the back foot. Singles are good but they aren't enough at this late stage
"slower ball, defended. Tight over from Rajitha"
Nothing gentle about that shot! Greets the captain with a dismissive jab over cow corner. Nothing delivery and Pooran would not miss out on it
driven down the ground. Carlos will fancy this

flicked to midwicket. This isn't good enough from West Indies
and again. Brilliant fielding. Turning out to be not such a bad over

"spanked over cow corner. There's no one in that vast expanse on the longer boundary, and the ball rolls unchallenged for four. West Indies need much, much more of this"
eased to the onside to give Carlos another crack
slashed to deep cover-point
"<strong>that's a clean strike</strong>. Maybe it's Pooran who'll take the lead today. Back of a length that sat up perfectly for Pooran, and he helped it into the breeze and well over midwicket. There was no stopping that, no matter where you place the fielder"
"cutter, mistimed back to the bowler"
uppish. Almost had point interested for a fraction. Keeps the strike. productive over for the West Indies
"rolled his fingers over it, and Brathwaite takes the single. <strong>That's the 50-partnership </strong>off 38 balls. Just eight coming from Brathwaite's bat. EIGHT!"
"rank long hop. Pace off the ball down legside, where the ball got down on its knees and pleaded to be belted. Pooran puts it away. meat and drink for him right now"
"and that's out, I believe! What a way for Brathwaite to go! Pooran drove it down the ground, and Udana looks like he got a finger to it, before the ball hit the stumps. Brathwaite was well out of his ground. <strong>They have gone upstairs</strong> 

Brathwaite is gone, the ball kissed Udana's long middle finger before thudding into the stumps. Unfortunate for the Windies"

"slower ball, nicely whipped down to midwicket. <strong>That brings up the 200</strong>"

"short delivery. Pooran looks to hoick that out of Durham. Gets the wide instead, which is more realistic"
"classy! Mali just about missed his length and Allen spanked the leg-stump half-volley over midwicket. Gets Rihanna fired up. She hasn't given up, neither should you!"
it's a good-looking drive down the ground this time
slower wide yorker. Pooran can't get bat on it
legbye gets him down the other end

"to mid-on for one. Expensive over from Malinga, that"
thick outside edge to third man

stellar from Mathews at backward point. Sprints a few yards to his left and cuts off the run
"powerful from Allen. Leathered down the ground, and wide enough of long-on to give him no chance. Allen looks like he can support Pooran nicely"
"slash and a miss. Too close to cut, that was"
"full toss, poked through midwicket. Good work on the boundary, good work by the batsmen to run three. Nine off that over."
"destructive from Allen. Smashes Malinga through the mid-off region, and once that beat the fielder there, no chance of it being stopped. Malinga's taking some tap here"
"clears the infield on the offside. Just about did that, mind you. They get a couple. Six off two to start off"
"block and run from Allen. Sensible batting, this"
turns the strike over to Allen. Pooran clearly trusts his partner
