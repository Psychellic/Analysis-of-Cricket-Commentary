driven to sweeper cover
"full outside off, driven to cover"
"short of length, opens the face to third man"
"pitched up on off, driven to cover"
"length, straightens and hits him too high as he misses the flick. Yup, too high"
and the response: a full charge forward and driven imperiously through the covers where Rashid slides across to cut it off in the deep
"length on middle, defended"
advances and drills to long-on
comes down the track and blocks back
digs a yorker out from the crease
"full outside off, driven crisply off the front foot through the covers"
tries to cut with the ball nipping into him and makes no contact
"again, opens up for a cut, straighter this time but still not enough room"
"full outside off, driven into the covers"
"full on the pads, flicked behind square"
"quicker dart, slid into off, punched through cover for a very quick one. <b>Hesitation again but no problem in the end</b>"
pushed to cover for another quick single. <b>Living on the edge</b>
backs away and punches to long-off
"full outside off, blocked"
advances and pushes back
"stays back and tries to flick, seems to have got an inside edge onto the pad. But Afghanistan think otherwise and go for the review. Seemed to be going down leg as well. Okay, no bat, but that's heading miles down leg. Ok, not that far down, but enough to be missing leg. Review lost, and we have ourselves a drinks break"
clips a short delivery off his hips to the left of mid-on
lets the ball come to him and gently gives it the directions to deep square leg
misses out as he goes for the pull against a slower short ball. It seems like he'ad ajusted his bat-swing but not to be
"sneaks in an yorker that has Kusal playing all around it, the flick shot not making contact and the ball thudding into his pads"
"top edge over the keeper. Well, he was looking for a boundary with the pull shot and he, well, gets what he wants."
"crashes the overpitched delivery outside off down to the long-on boundary. He puts a lot of bottom hand into the stroke, but it doesn't go all the way"
steps out of his crease and plays for non-existent turn. So a drive to long-off ends up at long-on
"shimmies down, playing the angle into him from round the wicket, and flicks to midwicket"
"hammers the slog sweep! Lovely shot selection, picking on the ball tossed up and well outside off, giving him the room the free the arms"
"flatter and outside off, carves it to deep point"
"taps a good length ball down the pitch, and it hits the non-striker, which is probably why Kusal doesn't want to take a run"
nudges to long-on
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> but the legbreak pitches on leg stump and spins further, giving it no chance of hitting the stumps. Heck, Tharanga can't even get bat to it"
"skids through with the angle from over the wicket, Kusal dabs into the off side"
googly - dipping sharply into the block hole - Kusal backs away and jams a straight bat down on it for a single to mid-off
"full on off stump, pushes to long-off"
premeditates the sweep and gets bowled! It's too full to play across the line like that and he basically ends up yorking himself. Rashid has a wicket in his first over. The sun rises in the east. And I'm always broke.
"googly first up, which Mathews doesn't quite pick, playing a cover drive and getting an inside edge through square leg. Geez, the dip he gets with that ball!"
another yorker from Gulbadin - he's pretty good with those. Tharanga just about digs it out
"taken at mid-off! And Naib poses for the cameras, showing off his biceps, and a big broad smile too. Tharanga, after struggling through new-ball swing, after being part of a terrible mix-up that led to the run-out of his partner, throws his wicket away by lifting a length ball on middle and off straight into Asghar Afghan's hands"
"full and outside off, pushes to mid-off"
"full and outside off, drives to mid-off"
leaps up to cut this short and wide delivery out to deep third man
"searches for a run at midwicket, closing the bat face a touch too early and getting a leading edge to cover. Mathews wants a single but it's not there"
presses forward to drive the legbreak to long-off
loopy delivery on off stump - possibly a googly - Mathews drills it to long-off
"googly, flatter in trajectory, pitching on off stump and getting a backfoot defence in response"
"<b>skids under the bat</b> as the quicker delivery - at 100 kph - beats Jayasuriya's inside edge. This, by the way, is the legbreak"
"they're appealing for a catch, hoping the ball - having been flicked by Jayasuriya - bounces off the boot and into Rashid's hands. Umpire Brathwaite says no. He's perfectly right"
"full on leg stump, works it to deep midwicket"
"pulls the short ball outside off to midwicket. Nine balls at the crease, and plenty of shots played. Living up to the name"
"full and outside of, Jayasuriya defends to point"
"on the pads, he flicks it away to long leg"
tucks a back of a length delivery outside off to midwicket

"another slower ball outside off, Mathews drives to cover"
width on offer and Jayasuriya flays it to sweeper cover
seems like a googly but it's overpitched outside off. Mathews smears it to long-off
"<b>risky</b> playing so far back to a fullish delivery, which is also on target. Just about gets bat to it, playing a late cut, and the slip fielder moves quickly to his right to stop the runs"

"shortish on leg stump, turns it to short fine leg"
uses the straight bat to punch a quick and flat delivery to midwicket
"floated up outside off, driven through the covers. <b>100 up now</b> but a long, long way to go"
"<b>huge shout for lbw, not given by umpire Gregory Brathwaite. No reviews left</b>. Rashid floats this up on middle stump and Shehan misses with the sweep. Seems like it would have gone onto <b>smash middle stump</b>"

"googly, tucked to midwicket"

tries to clip a fuller one and wears it on the pad

tries to cut one that slides into him and gets an inside edge. <b>Lucky to have not chopped on</b>
"clips a fuller one off the pads to midwicket, and oh dear, what's happening here! Utter chaos. Serious lack of communication. And this seems to be Mathews' fault. Says yes, comes down a few steps and then changes mind all of a sudden, leaving Shehan in the middle of nowhere. Awful, awful cricket"

keeps a touch low as Mathews defends outside off
"steps out, making the room he needs to access the off side, and cracks the ball through cover"
"full on middle, pushes towards long-on. Shenwari cuts across from midwicket, diving to his right and getting a direct hiat the bowler's end as well"
"sensational shot - the front foot not going too far forward so he can unleash a full bat-swing, flicking the straight ball away to the leg of midwicket"
"shortish on off stump, blocks"
"<b>nearly lbw</b>! Thisara plants his front leg across his stumps and the quick legbreak nearly traps him. As such, an inside edge results to midwicket"

clips a fuller one to midwicket
shifts back to a length ball and defends
