"teeny tiny vestiges of outswing on this really full delivery on off stump. Rahane, watchfully, gets in line and defends"
"full again at 142 kph, Rahane drives, with more firmness in his shot, to mid-off"
"back of a length on middle and off, defends"
"and the moment the ball is short, Rahane dialls up the late cut. Prolific with that shot. Just backs away and glides the delivery from middle and off to deep third man"
defends a 145 kph delivery right under his eyes and pinches a single to point
"fuller delivery and outside off, Rahane attempts the drive, without necessarily moving his feet too much and gets a thick outside edge to third man"
"but this time he starts with a full toss and Rahane, deftly clips it through the gap at midwicket. Massive gap there with only mid-on, square leg and short fine leg around"
"tosses it up on middle and leg, Rahane nudges it towards midwicket and takes a single"
a tad overpitched and Tripathi makes a confident move forward and thumps it to long-on
hangs back to a shortish delivery and runs it off the open face towards short third man
"quicker, flatter delivery, and so Tripathi goes for the pull. There is just not the required room to take full advantage"
"another one pushed through on and around off stump, Tripathi pats it back to the bowler"
no-fear batting. This must be Tripathi's brief. Get quick runs at the top. He races down at Milne and crashes him through cover. Makes room on the leg side and slaps it away
"drifts into the pads and Tripathi nudges it away past the left of the diving wicketkeeper. At Milne's pace, those can't be stopped"
"shortish and outside off, Tripathi guides it to deep third man."
"slip had been moved to a gully position before this ball, to stop the glide to third man, and it comes into play straight away. Watson with the stop"
superb hit! Straight down the ground. The extra pace is working to the batsman's advantage. Coming onto the bat so well and it is apparent in this shot. Rahane just plants his front foot forward and extends his defence. And it's four over mid-on
"short, wide, crashed to the point boundary. Now we get to see the outfield's speed. And its lightning. Buckle up, boys. We're set for a high-scorer"
"<B>how has that missed middle stump</b>? Goes right over it. Phew. It's the offcutter, and immediately, it pulls off a false shot. Tripathi backs away and tries to lift it over mid-off, but he is hitting down the wrong line. Plays inside it and is lucky to still be there"
"this has gone so high! But it seems to have also gone long enough. Good call from Tripathi to go over mid-on, so even if he doesn't time it, he could have still cleared the man inside the circle"
"overpitched and he's given some room as well, Tripathi has slashed it over point and to the boundary"
"well adjusted. He was set up for the lash over cover again, but the length isn't there. So he blocks, opens the face and then slides it to third man"
"goes for the short ball, just outside off, mistimes a pull to the left of square leg"
"another short ball, again very little room, and the pull shot wanders into the vacant midwicket region. Not allowed to go too far"
"full and outside off, Tripathi drills it into the pitch and finds cover point"
"shortish and into the body, Tripathi is cramped up, but is still able to sneak a single into the leg side, in front of midwicket"
"adjustment in length as well. The shortish ones, provided they are around off stump, not giving the batsman room, are useful. Rahane now is contained to a block to cover"
"full on middle and off, perhaps with a bit of shape away, Rahane pushes it back to the bowler"
"they tried to block his scoring area at third man by installing a short third man, but Rahane plays the glide finer. Beautiful batting."
"now he splits the gap between backward point and short third man. Off a full delivery. Excellent hand-eye coordination. Read the length and line early, then went down with the ball, and planted the open face so that it would hit the gap"
"rushes down the pitch, rather blindly, and perhaps a bit early, which allows Aravind to fire in a length ball at his body. It sneaks between inside edge and thigh pad. No room to free the arms. Good bowling"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks it"
"drifts a little too far down the leg side, in his efforts to tie Tripathi down. He's not been very good when he can't free the arms"
"shortish on off stump, pulls to deep square leg"
"legcutter from the left-armer, and Rahane picks it, delays his dab to short third man, gets the single. Good running from Tripathi. It is his call and he makes it early and commits to it"
"short ball, not rising high enough to trouble the batsman, Tripathi pulls it to deep square leg"
"another gentle glide to third man, this time it is off a ball that is angled into middle and leg. Shows you how good he is with the shot. Tripathi, again, is alive to the opportunity for a quick single. Beats Chahal's direct hit"
"missed out there. Silly old delivery down leg, Rahane loads up with the pull and fails to connect"
"tosses it up on middle, keeps it out"
leans out to the pitch of the tossed up delivery outside off and flicks it to long-on
"shortish and outside off, pierces the offside ring and finds a single to the sweeper"
"pushes it through on middle, nudges it to the wide open spaces on the leg side. It appears now there is no one saving the single in front of the wicket on the legside. All on the boundary"
"short and pushed through into middle and leg, pulls it to deep square leg"
stands up tall against a flatter delivery on off stump and whips it to the left of deep midwicket
"<b>oh lovely</b>. Jadhav, the wicketkeeper, is able to save a few runs as he lifts his right leg up and blocks the ball that Rahane late cuts"
""
whips it into the leg side boundary between midwicket and long-on
"goes through him with a googly! I think Rahane picks the variation, but he is not ready for the ball to dip on him so much. Slow delivery, drawing him out of his crease, making him overbalance, sneaks under his bat and crashes into leg stump. Great deception"
"tossed up delivery on middle, jams his bat down to find a single to long-on"
"through the bowler this time and all the way to the boundary. Overpitched delivery on middle, lashes it straight down the ground. Lots of bottom-hand power"
"low full toss on off stump, drives to long-off"
"hit seriously hard, and a little to the left of the short cover fielder, but Kohli puts in the dive and is reflexes are quick enough. The lid comes off the Chinnaswamy as their captain throws the ball up high and looks like he owns the place. To think all this had begun with Tripathi doing well to make room to pull off a lovely inside out drive. He seemed to have got the gap too until Kohli made his play"
"loops it up on middle and leg, defends it"
"pulls his pace back, pulls his length back as well, Dhoni does for a little nudge into the leg side, but doesn't get bat to it"
"rocks back to try and hammer the ball past Kohli's left at short cover, but he doesn't allow it"
"tosses it up on off stump, he presses forward and blocks, reaching so far in front of him that the ball pops up for a bit"
"it's the wrong 'un again, pitched way too short though, allowing Smith enough time to read it off the pitch and pull to deep backward square leg"
"comes down the pitch and nudges it to short midwicket, the only man saving a single on the leg side"
"lots of action in this delivery. First Dhoni shapes to come down, which Badree spots and sticks in the short ball. Dhoni, in turn, sees that, and hangs back and then carves it behind point"
"comes down the pitch again, but he can't get close enough to the ball. Badree bowling well. Keeping Dhoni to a dot"
but this time he bowls short and Dhoni backs away and hammers a cut behind point. Think Badree was worried the batsman would come down again
"shortish again, holds in the pitch and spins a distance too, which means Dhoni backing away is not in the best position to find the boundary. In the end, he chops the ball in front of point"
<b>just past short midwicket</b>. He sees a little flight on this deliver and goes for a loft over the leg side. Gets it off more of an inside edge because the ball dips on him. Too far from Badree
stays back and turns it through to deep midwicket
"advances again, but Negi is able to contend with that. Flattens the length, doesn't give any room and Dhoni has to be content with a drive to long-on"
goes back and flicks a shortish delivery on off stump to long-on
"drifts into the pads on middle and leg, Dhoni tries to clip it away, but doesn't connect with the bat. Leg byes are on offer"
comes down the track and whips it through midwicket
stays back to a fuller delivery and pushes into the covers.
works his wrists over a full delivery outside off because he isn't to the pitch. Manages a drive to cover
"heaves a loopy delivery from outside off to the straight midwicket boundary. Once he gets to the pitch of those, there is no reason why he can't hit against the spin"
belts a flighted delivery to long-on
"flatter delivery on off stump, Dhoni goes back and punches it to the left of short cover. A fumble from Kohli allows a single"
"googly on off stump, Smith works it down to long-on and that's the end of Badree"
wanders way outside off to take a length ball on off stump and puts it behind square leg
"good length ball on off stump, pushes it in front of point"
comes down the track to a slower ball on middle and leg and clips it to long leg
preempts a Dhoni move down the track and so looks for the very wide delivery outside off. Overshoots the mark
"<b>lovely slower bouncer</b>. Dhoni doesn't pick the change of pace well because a batsman's instincts, once he sees the ball dug in, is to hit. He loads up for the pull, then has to adjust his bat swing, and with the ball in line with off stump, there is no room to work with either. He completes the shot too early and is hit on the back of the shoulder"
"shortish on off stump, Dhoni keeps legside of the ball and flicks it past midwicket. Dhoni is looking for two straight away and Smith has to comply"
"nails the wide yorker this time, and with Dhoni firmly on leg stump, looking for the room to free the arms, he can't reach it"
"tosses it up on leg, flicks it to deep midwicket"
"makes it drift into middle and leg, Dhoni tries to nudge towards midwicket, but can't get bat to it"
"this is going to be risky! Dhoni comes down the track and taps a flatter ball to short midwicket and calls for the run. But Watson moves to his right quickly, he's set to make a run-out at the non-strikers. Smith has been asked to go back, and he wouldn't have made it with a direct hit"
"looks to get under a flat delivery on the stumps, ends up getting too far under. Heave to midwicket gets too much height and not enough distance"
"tossed up on off stump, Smith drills it back to the bowler"
"slides it down leg, Smith goes for a pull, can't make contact"
"this time it's flighted down leg, Smith opts for the sweep, no luck this time either"
"away she goes! It's a length ball, it's a length ball that Dhoni comes down to and biffs high and long. <b>It's on the bleeping roof</b>. Would've needed a 100-foot tall long-on fielder to do anything about that"
"shortish on off stump, whips it through to deep midwicket"
"back of a length and outside off, steers it through to the sweeper"
"mistimes the pull shot, because of the lack of pace. Takes it from well outside off, having moved across the crease, and hits it to the right of the fielder in the deep. Chahal does well with a dive"
"that's awful. Length ball, down leg, all Smith has to do is flick it away. Did the bowler think Smith would be moving across again? Because this time he didn't. Stayed still and profits"
"slower delivery, full and outside off, Smith goes for a heave, but misses"
"comes down the track to hit him over the off side, Smith doesn't make connection"
"full and outside off, drives to the right of cover. Looks to hit it too hard and loses his timing"
"there for the cross-bat hoick and Smith plays it better than most. Clears the front leg, takes a back of a length ball from outside off and deposits wide of long-on"
"good bowling. Goes for the bouncer, on and around off stump, climbing up towards the right ear of Smith. He bails out of the shot, looking for a wide. Doesn't get it"
"wide yorker outside off, Smith can only bunt it down to extra cover"
"offers width and Dhoni capitalises. Opens the face and glides the legcutter, that is short, to the third man boundary. Chahal puts in a big dive, it's a good dive too, but he is never getting there"
slogs across the line and gets an inside edge onto the stumps. It's too full for a hack through midwicket like that. Too wide as well.
"the stumps are a mess again! Aravind does the job with a cross-seamer that stays a touch low. Smith, camped deep in his crease, on the leg side, looking for a length delivery to slog, hits over the ball and misses it altogether. Then comes that awful rattle"
"shortish on middle and leg, clips it to long leg"
"looks for the yorker on leg stump, finds it, and Stokes can only nudge it to deep midwicket"
"back of a length, off-pace delivery. Christian is into his flick too early, the ball stops on him and jumps at him to mess with his timing. Only the inside edge is possible"
"this is a boundary ball, and though Christian has hit it perfectly, he also picks out deep square leg perfectly. Full delivery, at top pace, on the pads, ripe for the flick. Christian does the needful, but then he hasn't found the gap. Mandeep runs in and takes a good catch diving forward"
"full on leg stump, flicks through to deep midwicket"
"and he strikes straight away! Stays back to a length ball and looks for the pull, but the ball, angled across the left-hander, sneaks off the insid edge and topples off stump. Pune have to swing for the fences because of their scoring rate so far, but they are slogging across the line and losing their wickets. This innings is going so badly for them"
"and gone first ball. Simple catch for AB de Villiers at cover. It is deafening at the Chinnaswamy. Slower ball from Milne, bowled with a cross seam. Thakur is early on to the front foot, pushes and ends up chipping it tamely"
"right up to the batsman, pitching outside off, drilled hard into the turf and to the man at short cover"
"beaten. Fullish length, outside off, at 143 kph, Unadkat pushes away from the body and misses"
"short of a length, outside off, waits and opens the face of his bat late to get it wide of wide slip and down to third man for a single"
"short of good length, angling in, tucked off the pads through midwicket for one"
finds the gap between the two points. They were set to protect this shot because Watson wants to bowl wide yorkers. Ends up with a full toss though which helps Tiwary
"shortish and outside off, keeps a touch low as well, Tiwary tries to cut but gets an inside edge"
goes for the short ball just outside off stump. Left alone. Climbs a little too high not to be called a wide
"in the slot outside off and Tiwary lofts it over mid-off. Hits through the line, as opposed to across it like most of his team-mates"
"flashes hard, but is beaten on the outside edge, as a length ball from Watson nips away off the pitch"
"superb hit, in both shot selection and placement. This is full and outside off, Tiwary gets on the front foot, goes for the extra cover drive, and nails it between cover and long-off."
"they keep bowling too full to him and he keeps smashing them. This is a half-volley outside off, allowing him to both get under the ball and free his arms. Tonked into the sight-screen"
"short and wide outside off, hammered to the sweeper cover"
"slower, short ball outside off, Tiwary slogs it to long-on"
"slower ball, on a length and outside off. Unadkat swings blind, the ball sneaks under him, and Tiwary does well to pinch the bye. Beats the direct throw from Jadhav"
"full and right over the wide lines, Tiwary thinks it is out of bounds, but it just sneaks inside to become a dot ball"
"looks for the yorker, but comes up with a full toss on middle and leg. Easy pickings for a good batsman and Tiwary nails it over the square leg boundary"
"slower ball outside off, almost helicopters it through to long-on, the flick shot, being powered by a wristy flourish at the end. They get a single, they go for the second, Tiwary puts in a huge dive, but he can't get back in time"
"back of a length on middle, Kohli stays in line and flicks to midwicket"
lets the shortish delivery come on and glides it towards backward point
"so much for being under pressure at the start of the innings. Kohli makes a mockery of a full delivery, angling across him, by flicking it over deep square leg. Just imagine the strength of his wrists, and the balance it takes to do so. Such a still head, right over the ball, and everything else comes from that"
flicks it through midwicket
"shortish on off stump, defends towards cover"
hangs back against the short ball and punches it to mid-off
"he seems to have been deceived by the way the ball comes off quite slowly off the pitch. He checks his shot, originally a cut, instead becomes a flat-bat push past the bowler. He may actually have <b>dropped</b> it, with Shardul having to dive low to his left on his followthrough."
"<b>dropped</b>! Tiwary at slip has fluffed one of Pune's best chances to win this game. Its a short ball outside off, Kohli flashes at it, looking for third man. Gets a thick outside edge. Goes at shoulder height to the left of Tiwary at first slip. Doesn't Smith field at slip normally?"
flicks it towards midwicket
waits on the shortish delivery on off stump and turns it behind square leg
"still manages a wicket, but it's the other opener. It's short and wide again and Mandeep goes for a cut shot. Gets a thick outside edge through to the keeper"
"the short and wide tactic won't always work. He's managed to get two batsmen to nick off to that ball, but de Villiers smacks it to the backward point boundary."
"moves around the wicket for a slightly slower ball outside off, dabs it behind point. Adjusts to the lack of pace"
"<b>beats the outside edge</b> with his top pace, getting the back of a length ball to straighten from around the wicket. De Villiers, looking to glide it to third man, misses"
"<b>extra bounce</b> off a good length outside off, de Villiers, playing late, and being alert, is able to avoid the trouble"
"back of a length, it's the cutter again, gripping in the pitch and turning past the open face of the bat"
"shortish and outside off, runs it to backward point"
sits up the baseball swing and de Villiers plays them while he sleepwalks across a tightrope between two skyscrapers drinking tea. Six over midwicket
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"goes past point, Stokes moving to his right and diving to his right. Great effort, but Kohli has driven it just strongly enough"
"shortish and outside off, Kohli nudges it through midwicket"
"full on off stump, defends"
"good length just outside off, drives to the sweeper on the off side"
"great timing, and a slower ball is sent screaming to the midwicket boundary. He walks at the bowler, whose slower ball ends up a half-volley. Still to hit an off-pace delivery so well with a proper cricket shot and not a slog..."
"comes down the track, but finds there is no room to do much and so defends"
"another trip down the track and this time he gets across onto the off side as well, allowing him to work a length ball away to deep square leg"
"shortish and outside off, he slices it to backward point"
"full on off stump, Kohli drives to extra cover"
"picks the slower ball, just stands up, keeping his balance, and then pulls it behind square leg. Tahir does good work, moving to his right and diving, to stop the boundary"
comes forward to slap a shortish delivery outside off to the sweeper
"starts with a good length ball on off stump, Kohli defends it with soft hands towards point"
"full and outside off, spears it to the off-side sweeper"
"awkward shot, there is no way he could have got on top of the bounce of a bouncer, especially on the front foot. Tries to flat-bat it down the ground, instead it skews off towards the sweeper on the off side. Rahane pouches it easily. No room for the shot, too much height on the ball to go through with it anyway"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"targets the stumps and de Villiers, now that Kohli's gone and mindful of the lack of depth in the RCB batting, is playing proper cricket. Blocks to midwicket"
"full and wide, de Villiers nails a drive down the ground and all three stumps are in disarray. They save three runs for Pune. That's the time out as well."
"steps down the track and clips it towards square leg, and before the fielder can come up from the deep, de Villiers has two."
"tosses it up outside off, drives it down the ground, to the bowler's left. Misfield allows a single"
"shortish delivery outside off, Jadhav stands up tall behind it and flicks it towards midwicket"
"flatter delivery, spinning away from the bat, de Villiers flicks it to deep midwicket"
"such good wrists. He basically picks up a half-volley on leg stump and sends it flying past short midwicket. If not for Christian's efforts on the boundary, this would have been four"
""
"good length on off stump, pushes it back at the bowler"
"shortish and outside off, cuts towards cover. As seen in the first innings, this pitch is slowing up"
"goes for the bouncer, and he just toes the line with height. De Villiers let it go hoping for a wide, no such luck"
short ball goes down leg and de Villiers pulls it to deep square leg
"full and outside off, smears it off the front foot through to the sweeper"
"slower, short ball, wandering down the leg side. De Villiers wisely moves out of the way and collects the extra"
"backs away, but Stokes follows him. Now its all about how well balanced AB can be. Turns out, he's pretty good as he drives and connects superbly with it. Rahane at sweeper cover race to his right and cuts off the boundary"
"pushes it through on middle and leg, de Villiers flicks through to deep square leg"
lovely bowling. Slows it down. Tosses it up on middle. Gets it to turn and keeps Jadhav quiet
drifts into the pads and Jadhav is able to pick it away behind square leg
"gives width, and worse, pitches it right in the slot. AB gets down low and nails a lofted drive over extra cover. Hit-me ball dealt with"
"resorts to his usual quicker sliders on middle, AB picks it and nudges it through midwicket"
"pushes it through again on middle and off, Jadhav calmy works it to long-on. These balls would be great if Pune had some scoreboard pressure"
"good length ball on middle and leg, clips it through to deep square leg"
"shortish and down leg, because AB was making room. Ends up cramped up and having to settle for a leg bye off a flick towards square leg"
"shortish and outside off, glides it to deep third man"
"moves leg side, then jumps onto the off side, to set up for the scoop. Christian's back of a length delivery goes over the bat, gloves and past leg stump"
"slower ball, dug in short as well, barely even gets to the batsman and AB plonks it over to midwicket"
"full and down leg, giving AB no room to work with. Swings for midwicket, gets an inside edge towards square leg"
"loops it well wide of leg stump. It's a full toss as it passes de Villiers, yorks the wicketkeeper, Dhoni misfields and RCB take a run and the extra"
"full on middle and leg, clips it through square leg"
"he's stumped! We'll need the third umpire's confirmation, but this should be out. Such lovely flight and then sharp dip too. De Villiers is reaching out, he is off balance, he is flicking against the turn, and he is thoroughly beaten. Dhoni collects it, there is no give, that's his specialty and because of that he is able to break the stumps before AB can get back"
"tosses it up into the middle and leg stump. Watson looks for the flick, but it is a gingerly shot"
"pushes it through on middle and off, Jadhav goes back and flicks through midwicket"
"flighted delivery outside off, lunges forward to block"
"finishes with a googly, pitching on a length and outside off. Watson goes back and punches to cover"
"slips a length ball down the leg side, Jadhav looks to shovel it away to the fine leg boundary, misses"
"<b>top-edge</b> but it lands safely! The bouncer gets up too high for the pull, and Jadhav plays the shot anyway. Lucky to get away with it"
"back of a length and outside off, pushes it through to the sweeper"
"flat-bats it to mid-off, and though it has enough power, the placement is missing. A few yards either side of Smith and it could have been a boundary"
walks at the bowler and drives a fuller delivery outside off to deep cover
"shortish on middle and leg, clips it through to deep midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, pats it through to the sweeper"
"tosses it up on middle and leg, works it through to deep midwicket"
"shortish on middle and leg, Jadhav pulls to the left of long leg"
whips a ball out of the blockhole through to deep midwicket
"seems like the slider, going wicket to wicket. Watson makes sure to stay in line and blocks"
nudges a good length ball on middle and leg towards midwicket for a quick single
turns a flighted delivery on middle to deep midwicket and that ends Tahir's spell - 1 for 27 off four overs. That's the time out as well
"looks to pull a short delivery just outside off stump, but it gets a bit big on him. Mistimes the shot towards long-on"
takes on a short ball and pulls it to the right of long-on. All that muscle though for only two runs. Nearly two per ball required now...
"length ball, outside off, which is good, considering Watson is trying to make room to slog. <b>Knuckle ball</b> from Thakur gets him a dot"
"this is at full pace, but it's a short ball. So why is he on the front foot? Watson goes for the slog, he can't get on top of the bounce and is beaten comfortably"
"that's three dots on the trot. Beautiful work. <b>It's the knuckle ball again</b>, wobbly seam taking it away from Watson's reach as he looks for a six over cover"
"shortish and outside off, belted to long-on"
"fuller delivery, slower as well, Watson drives into the covers and gets a single"
"tries to manufacture a shot - keeping beside a slow, shortish delivery around off stump and trying to dab it past the wicketkeeper. Misses it"
"digs it in short, way too short actually, becomes a wide for height"
"shortish on off stump, there is precious little pace to work with though, and Jadhav's glide only goes as far as point"
swings a slower ball from outside off to deep square leg. This one keeps a touch low
"he's done him with the slower ball! Jadhav tries to force the pace, coming down the track and looking to slog without thinking about anything else. Gets an inside edge onto leg stump. Plays too early. Loses balance. Everything wrong with the shot. Everything right with the ball and tactics"
"back of a length on off stump, nudges it towards midwicket"
that's the first boundary after the ninth over. First four since the fourth. This is a length ball outside off and Binny slaps it over point
"back of a length on off stump, guides it towards point"
"beautifully played. The back foot slap over cover, and that shot is only possible if a batsman is able to time his shots. Which has been hard on this pitch. The shortish length and the width certainly helped him though"
"goes for the rapid bouncer, and he keeps Watson quiet. The pull shot fails"
"keeps low. Pune have done this so well. They haven't panicked after putting on what was thought a below-par total. They have hit the deck, a hard length. They have not allowed any room to any of RCB's big hitters. And here Stokes reaps the rewards. Watson slogs, misses the ball, sees his stumps in disarray"
"fuller delivery on middle and leg, nudges it behind square leg"
"full and outside off, Negi is only able to get a single, squeezing this through cover"
"shortish on middle and off, works it off his hips through to deep midwicket"
"full and outside off, slaps it down the ground, but Christian sticks out his right hand and prevents any runs"
"shortish and outside off, he mistimes the cut towards point"
"on a length, affording him the room to free the arms and Binny takes full toll. It's the legcutter, drags it down. The batsman smashes it over deep square leg."
"top edge over the wicketkeeper. That makes it 13 off the over. Digs it in short, Binny goes for the pull, is quite late on the shot, but still benefits"
"mis-hit, can it be caught? Tahir is running back and to his right. But it falls beyond him. Top-edged pull again"
"no one back at long-off and he picks the spot. It's full, it's wide, it's smashed off the back foot. Still head, good hands"
"this is a spectacular catch! Under pressure is when you least want to be under a skier. A swirler. Tripathi is the mat at deep midwicket, setting himself up, eyes always on the ball coming down on him. Takes it like a boss. Slower ball from Thakur makes Negi stretch out to slog, and that moment when he lost balance, stole his timing away"
"<b>What an effort from Stokes</b>! He is right on the boundary edge at long-on, he is leaning over it, he is still watching the ball come down, he takes it over his head, in the airspace beyond the boundary. But he is losing balance. He needs to push the ball back. He does so, between his legs, as he crumples up in a heap. Knuckle ball, seemed set for six but Stokes, possibly the best fielder at any place on the ground, pulls off something special"
"shortish delivery outside off, looks to slog, but gets an inside edge. Could have raced away if Dhoni had not dived to his left"
"gave him free access to all his stumps and Thakur nails them. Binny had moved right across, well outside off, looking for a scoop. But the bowler delivers it full, straight, doesn't let the batsman have the leverage he needs and then sends him on his way. This is a mess from RCB"
"slower short ball outside off, Milne, the new batsman, pulls towards short fine leg"
middle pole out of the ground again. It's the slower ball again. Pune have bowled a lot of them this innings and have had loads of success. Badree here slogs across the line and is nowhere near the line of the ball
"full and wide outside off - no pace on the ball again - Aravind was expecting it, is beaten and left looking a bit silly"
"slower ball again, and Aravind heaves it over to deep square leg"
"lugs a slow, length ball from outside off to deep midwicket"
comes down the track and smacks a length ball outside off to deep point
"starts with a slower ball from around the wicket, and it sneaks under Aravind's slog"
"another dot ball, and there is no pace on this either. Aravind charges, swings across the line, is beaten. Dhoni gets a bad bounce on the take and gives away a bye"
"topples him. It's a good length ball on off stump, the kind you see in  Test match. Milne swings, misses and has to walk back"
"full and outside off, drives to extra cover"
"low full toss on leg stump, works it away past short fine leg. But Tahir still tracks it down. It wouldn't have mattered, but Tahir tracks it down"
"full on middle, which is defended, which could only be defended."
