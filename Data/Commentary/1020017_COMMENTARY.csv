"141 kph, hint of inswing, but since it's on a full toss, Brownlie has a nice sighter. Flicks to midwicket"
"drifts a short one down the leg side at 144 kph, Brownlie allows it through to the wicketkeeper"
"good line, good length, great pace at 143 kph  as Brownlie is trapped at the crease against a drivable ball outside off. Only manages to push it to short cover"
"142 kph, slings it across the right-hander, who takes a step forward and shoulders arms"
"gets a thick bottom edge of sorts and the ball wanders off past second slip's right. Brownlie tries to drive on the up, but his front foot is again left out of the loop. Only moves after the ball makes contact with the toe end"
"that's a brilliant delivery, at 143 kph, curving into the left-hander. Latham does well to bring a reasonably straight bat down to save himself from being lbw"
"nails him on the front pad, on leg stump, on the full, but umpire Palliyaguruge is unmoved. Starc goes for the yorker, and this one sneaks through Latham's defences. He is hitting around his front pad, with a closed face. This looks <b>mighty close</b> and since it hit the batsman on the full... Ball-tracking shows all three reds. But Australia have not revviewed"
"fuller delivery moving away from the right-hander in the air, drives to point"
camps back to drill a back of a length delivery into the covers
"glorious hit through the covers. He does hit it on the up, but it was considerably wide of off stump, allowing the batsman the room to free the arms. Controls it well because he isn't trying to hit it too hard."
"back of a length on off stump, defends from the crease"
"fine drive again, getting in line to a fuller ball on off stump, bringing his weight and a straight bat forward to meet the ball. Mid-off prevents any runs"
forces him back in his crease with a shorter delivery on middle and off
"146 kph, he is revved up! This is a good length ball outside off, pulling Latham forward to defend it, but it decks away past the outside edge"
flicks it to midwicket
"144 kph, <B>beats him again</b>. Hits a good length outside off, veers the ball away from Latham's prodding bat and then grins wryly."
"hits the deck this time and he gets the ball to carry through over head-height through to the keeper. Latham shuffles, but then sticks his bat high up in the air"
"good length ball outside off, offers no shot"
"of all the balls to fall to. This is full. This is miles down leg. This has boundary written all over it, and Latham tries to oblige, flicking the ball in the air, looking for the fine leg boundary. Instead, he finds the only man there, Josh Hazlewood moving smoothly to his right, diving forward and taking a super catch. So Australia's non-review has cost them, and Starc, absolutely nothing"
"back of a length on off stump, covers it well"
"gives up width, and Brownlie wades into it with a square drive. Times it excellently, but Maxwell at point moves and dives to his right to snatch the ball from it's intended path to the boundary"
"is that a misfield at midwicket? Brownlie is pretty good through the off side but here he takes a fuller ball on off stump and whips it past Travis Head, the roll of the wrists giving him all the timing he needs. Of course, Brownlie gets a little help from a desperate Adam Zampa, who throws himself headlong after the ball, just as it seems to stop on the outfield, and flicks it onto his thigh and then into the rope"
gets back and across and blocks on off stump
"digs it in short, gains too much bounce for the umpire's liking"
"flows into an off drive, but finds mid-off. Hazlewood keeping the ball up, but never overpitching"
"opens the face a touch, holds some of his power back to make sure late outswing doesn't catch him napping and he finds a single through extra cover"
"shortish and outside off, chops it to cover"
"full and wide, the bait thrown for the drive, Williamson doesn't bite"
"looks for the yorker again, this at 143 kph, homing in on off stump, with some late inswing. Williamson jams his bat down hurriedly and gets so good a chunk that it flies past second slip and beats Hazlewood's dive to his left. Seems a touch slow in getting down to it"
"on the pads and Williamson tickles to fine leg, where Zampa runs around quickly enough, with the yellow floppy on, and saves a boundary"
"good work in the covers from Head, moving to his right to stop a backfoot punch from Brownlie"
"<b>beats him for pace</b>. This is another searing yorker, but it's just outside off stump. Lucky for Brownlie"
"more yorkers, this one angled from wide of the stumps into the base of middle and leg, Williamson blocks towards gully"
"good length ball, straightens a hint on off stump, Williamson defends with soft hands"
"gets a slight outside edge as Hazlewood pulls his length back a bit, while still stalking at the top of off stump. Williamson blocks cautiously"
angled into the pads and Williamson is able to clip it through midwicket and mid-on. The ground's large enough to pick up three
"presents the straight bat and it's got enough power to burst past Hazlewood. Although without his touch, it could well have been four"
"full, on off stump, drills a drive to the right of mid-off, who puts in a dive"
"brilliant shot! Cuts behind point. This really isn't short, perhaps that's why he hasn't gone for the full blooded cut. Shifts his weight back, glides the ball off the open face, using Starc's own pace against him"
"full toss, swinging in to middle and leg, nudges it to midwicket"
moves across to a shortish delivery outside off and runs it between point and cover. Concentrates only on placement
"has to get up off his toes to get on top of the bounce of this back of a length delivery, and then steers it to point cool as ice"
"141 kph, has him hopping again, and this time he tries a more aggressive stroke, trying to pierce the gap at point with a punch. Can't"
"he's into the flick a touch too early, if that's possible to a ball at 141 kph, takes the leading edge to the left of mid-off."
"back of a length and outside off, defends"
"pushes his hands, and a striaght bat, hard at the shortish ball outside off stump, but picks out cover"
"beats gully, and the timing is good enough to leave third man a spectator. This has too much width and Williamson picks it up early, hangs back and carves it into the gap"
"a lot squarer this time. If Stoinis has to persist with his length, he might need a deep point. This one decks in off the pitch, but Williamson is ready for it, slashing the ball through point"
"waits on his back foot and blocks the ball, outside off, with such soft hands that it wanders down to third man"
"short and wide, Brownlie cuts but fails to pick the gap. Straight to cover"
"picked away, over midwicket. As lazy a delivery as any from a bowler still getting into his work, half-volley on leg stump, helped away to the boundary"
"139 kph, <b>that's more like it</b>. Lines it up outside off, pitches it full enough to bring Williamson forward, and then gets it to seam away ever so late to beat the bat"
"141kph, back of a length and outside off, dabs it to deep third man"
"brilliant hit down the ground past mid-off. Clear signs that this pitch has excellent pace and true bounce. The batsman can trust it explicitly, as Brownlie does, with this drive, even with his feet not quite moving."
"141 kph, digs it in and since the ball hits the seam as well, it darts away from the bat as Brownlie, committed to a back-foot defence, is beaten"
more evidence of how the batsman can make whatever he wants out here. Brownlie bends his top half away from a short ball intended to cramp him and upper cuts it over point
"full, wide, lashed away through cover point. There is plenty of room to free the arms, and all he has to do is beat the man inside the circle. Does so to his left"
"full on middle, blocks firmly"
"shifts his line onto middle and leg, and Brownlie flicks through midwicket"
"whips it past square leg, towards the longer boundary for a couple of runs. Could there have been more?"
"shortish and outside off, Brownlie hangs back and cracks it to cover"
"tucks him up on his hip, as the ball bounces up a bit too high for his wrists to work it with any power through midwicket"
"good length ball outside off, Williamson steps forward to slice it to backward point"
"145 kph, good length ball, shaping in off the pitch, Williamson has very little room to work with and gets an inside edge as he tries to block"
"146kph, plays this short ball well, shifting across outside off to get the leverage he needs to whip it behind square leg"
"full on off stump at 147.5 kph, pushes to mid-on"
"goes for the fuller ball on middle, and Brownlie picks up the 119 kph variation early, waits on it and then flicks along the ground through midwicket"
"good length outside off at 144 kph, Williamson guides it to backward point"
"starts well, tossing it up, getting the ball to drift into the base of middle. Brownlie flicks, gets most of an inside edge through midwicket"
gets beside the flighted delivery on middle and off and drives serenely to long-off. Excellent footwork to open up that gap
"grunt of effort from Zampa, as he hits a good length and gets some turn and bounce off the pitch. Brownlie hangs back and pushes past cover"
"lobs up a full toss, extending himself perhaps a bit more than necessary, Williamson drives to long-on"
eases into a drive through extra cover
"prefers to stay legside of the ball again, even when it is tossed up. Drives through the covers"
tip and run cricket now with Australia reducing the number of single-saving fielders. This full and wide delivery is deftly eased through point
"keeps back to a 144 kph delivery, pitched on a good length on off stump, and Brownlie glides it to deep third man"
"144 kph, good bowling. Pulls out the bouncer, at top pace, and makes sure it is angled into the right-hander, rising up towards his grille. Williamson watches it carefully and sways out of the way. Great to watch"
"full on off stump and Williamson strides nicely forward, the ghosts of the bouncer nowhere near his mind, and drives to mid-off"
"tries to work a shortish delivery off off stump through midwicket, but is unable to. Didn't quite get over the bounce as he thought"
defends a shortish delivery on off stump and the ball just plops down by his feet
"a bit of a full toss again, drifting in on middle and leg, Brownlie nudges it past the left of short midwicket"
"brings a straight bat down on a tossed up delivery on middle, and moves to his right to stop any runs"
"sees Williamson advancing and changes his length, and pace. Quicker, shorter, forces the batsman to rethink his shot. No runs to midwicket"
digs out a 88kph delivery on the base of off stump
"manages to drive a flighted delivery on off stump past Zampa's left. Again, his footwork is to get himself leg side of the ball"
"tries to come down the track, while making room, and this time Zampa surprises the batsman with a googly. Brownlie hacks it, and mistimes it to long-off. It's only two overs, but lovely spell so far from the legspinner"
<b>squares him up</b> with a good length ball catching Brownlie at the crease. It's at 145 kph too. Thick outside edge dribbles down to third man
"144 kph, good length ball on off stump, keeps it out, consciously keeping his bat face down"
"144kph, waits on the short one outside off and dabs it to third man on the boundary"
"140 kph, goes for the bouncer, but it soars over Brownlie's head, even though he is ducking. Umpire Brown at square leg signals wide and his partner Palliyaguruge follows suit"
goes for the on-the-up drive to a full delivery outside off and at 143 kph. Brownlie gets a thick edge to third man.
"what a beauty! Extra bounce, and darting in off the seam too. It's that movement that does him. The ball begins as a short one outside off so Williamson gets a late cut ready, but he is caught off guard because it rears up, cramps him for room and takes a little tickle off the inside edge through to the keeper. Great reward for a probing spell from Cummins."
"back of a length and outside off, offers no shot"
eases it through to long-on
"tosses it up outside off, Taylor comes forward and slaps it to cover"
plays around his front pad as Zampa gets the leggie to drift in on off stump. Manages an inside edge to mid-on
"drives with an open face towards point, where Cummins puts in a dive to his right"
"a touch short, which allows Taylor to rock back and cut to deep point"
"another short delivery, cut away through point and they're taking on the fielder, and the short side of the ground. The throw needs to be good.... but it's not, forcing the wicketkeeper to leap up and drag the ball down from well over head height. In that time, Taylor dives and makes it"

taps it towards square leg for a single and that takes us to the first drinks break of the match
"waits on the ball to turn, after pitching on a length, and Brownlie slices it to point off the open face"
"that's a top edge, the two men at point are in business, but Faulkner, diving forward, had no chance really. A little extra bounce off a shortish delivery on fifth stump"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
comes down the track to the pitch of the legbreak outside off and drives to long-off
comes forward and hits all along the ground to long-off
"lots of power from Taylor, bringing his bottom hand into play on this flighted delivery on leg stump. Single to long-on"
"back of a length on off stump, keeps it out"
"hammers the short and wide delivery to the point boundary. Has all the liberty he needs to pull off this shot. The pace from the bowler, the width to free the arms and the short boundary too"
"now to the long end of the park. Such a brutal pull from Taylor, dragging the ball from over shoulder-height outside off stump and blitzing it through in front square"
"full, aimed at leg stump, Taylor falls over while he tries to flick. Weathers half an lbw appeal. Would have slid down leg"
"full on off stump, pushes it to mid-on. Some late swing into the bat from Hazlewood"
"full and wide, and Taylor flays it away through point to bring up the hundred. Looks like he won't be holding back. Knows this is a good pitch, that he can hit through the line so easily that even good deliveries fly away."
"shortish, into the body, makes the batsman hop. Brownlie deflects it to the left of the wicketkeeper"
"moves across into the off side to drive a full length deliveyr back at the bowler. Would be outrageous to call that a drop. Solid connection from the batsman, the ball was dying on its way back to Faulkner, and it went away to his right too"
"a thick outside edge runs away to the third man boundary as Faulkner, back over the wicket after the first ball, gets the angle working for him. Unfortunately though, he has four against his name for his good work"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
moves inside the line and flicks a shortish delivery off middle and off to long leg
"full on off stump, from around the wicket to Brownlie, defends from the crease"
"full on off stump, Taylor is forward with a straight bat facing downwards"
clips a shortish delivery on middle and leg behind square leg
on the pads again and Brownlie works it through to deep square leg
"very little danger in that shot, given the liberty to free the arms, Taylor goes full blooded with the cut, soars over point and it's well to the right of deep third man. Nearly goes for six"
"back of a length and only a shade outside off, Taylor respects it with a leave"
whips a full delivery on middle to deep square leg.
"short delivery, angled across Taylor with the left-armer's angle from over the wicket. Mistimed pull shot fetches a single through midwicket"

there's a man sweeping on the off side boundary now and Brownlie's rasping cut only ends up a single
seems to have to deal with a little extra bounce at the last second as Taylor gets a little inside edge off the shoulder of the bat to square leg
"full and a shade wide, Brownlie runs it to backward point"
"full on off stump, Taylor clatters it to midwicket"
"outstanding shot. There is barely any room, with Faulkner coming around the wicket, but Taylor is still able to carve it behind point. Waits just enough and then brings all his power into play"
"thick edge, flies past the wicketkeeper. Very tough to call that a drop, because Handscomb was diving full length to his right. Evades his fingertips"
"fuller delivery, perhaps slower too, defends"
"fuller delivery outside off, smacks it through the covers"
"full and outside off, unleashes a square drive to deep point"
"waits on a full delivery on off stump and tries to scythe it through extra cover, but there's a man there"

"shortish and outside off, hangs back and dabs it towards third man"
loads up a pull and sends the short delivery outside off scurrying to deep midwicket
backs away to a fuller delivery on off stump and steers it to backward point
"huge appeal for lbw but umpire Palliyaguruge shakes his head again. No review from Australia. This is just back of a length on middle and off, and Brownlie is on his back foot, playing all around it. Hit high on the back pad. Height the issue"
"flights it on off stump, Taylor pushes it back down the pitch"
"too short and Taylor rocks back, opening up his hips to nail a pull through square leg"
"loops it up, nice and slow, Taylor tries to hit it so very hard, ends up with an inside edge through midwicket. That brings up his half-century. He was 4 when Brownlie got into the 40s and has overtaken his partner to the landmark"
"shortish and outside off, cuts into the covers"
stays back on middle and drives to long-on
laces it to the cover boundary. Just a little too much flight from Zampa on that occasion and Taylor gets under the half-volley and powers it away
"full and outside off, pushes it to mid-off"
"goes for the blockhole outside off, Brownlie opens the face, looking for a single, but point is alert"
blocks with soft hands into the covers and gets the affirmative from Taylor for a quick single. Top work from both batsmen
"full and wide, Taylor cracks it to deep cover"
"that's his <b>first ODI fifty</b>, gets to the mark with a handsome drive to mid-off. Was out of the side for two years, and now he returns, on his home ground, to get an important landmark for him. Little raise of the bat and back to work"
"short and wide, Taylor reaches for it with a cut to deep point"
"cuts from the stumps, and despite the loads of risk involved, he times the pants off the late cut to the third man boundary. He plays the length, it's just short enough for those hands of his to take over and manufacture something beautiful"
"tosses it up on off stump, drives into the covers"
frees the arms and drives in front of point. Nice and flowing
"<b>just lobs point running back</b>, Stoinis backtracks, leaps up, gets a hand on it, but these kinds of catches have to stick. Lucky to survive is Brownlie, after coming down the track and deceived in the flight. He tries to check his shot, but still the ball leaps off the outside edge. Still, difficult to call that a drop"
"tosses it up outside off, dragging the batsman forward, making him reach for the ball, and then does him with the turn. Taylor nearly pops a catch to short cover"
""
full and outside off allows Brownlie to strut out his on the up cover drive
"offcutter on off stump, gave that away very early with a change in his action, the batsman stays back and flicks through midwicket"
"can't get the cut the way he wants because of the pace, and the line not really being too wide. Chops it to backward point"
"full and just outside off, defends"
stays back even with the ball being full and pushes it to mid-off. Taylor is a little enthusiastic at the non-strikers' but seems to have dived back into his crease to save himself from a direct hit. Finch with the almost golden arm
"back of a length on off stump at 145 kph, tucks it towards midwicket and Starc fields it himself"
"another direct hit, this time from Stoinis at point at the non-strikers' end. But Taylor, in danger again, has made his ground after playing a cut shot to a delivery on off stump"
"Brownlie seems a little fidgety now for some reason, perhaps being forced to get on with it when he isn't ready to. Comes down the track, and has made a little too much room for himself. Ends up with a thick outside edge that falls short of backward point"
pushes it back at the bowler
"comes down the track, so Zampa flattens the trajectory and directs the ball wider outside off. Taylor has to adjust and get bat to ball to avoid being stumps"
"eases it into the covers for a quick single, and Maxwell with a one-handed pick up, throws well over the bowler's head"
no need to do anything fancy with the feet when you can stand and deliver like that. Positions himself leg side of the ball with Zampa always trying to angle the ball into middle and leg and then carves the ball over extra cover.
"shortish and outside off, Taylor, for once, misses the cut"
"oh, that's annoying for the bowler. He has made Taylor push hard at a back of a length delivery that straightens off the seam but the outside edge hits the third man boundary"
"short and wide, Taylor has to reach as far as the wide line to make contact. Single to deep point"
"good bouncer. It's at 142 kph, angled into the right-hander, threatening his chest. Brownlie does superbly to keep his eyes on the ball all the way through and sway out of the way"
works a short delivery off his hips to long leg
"makes him hop, but Taylor gets the better of the bowler by using soft hands and dabbing the ball just to the right of the pitch"
"fuller delivery on off stump, plants it at long-on"
gets just enough bat on a clear-the-front-leg slap down the ground to get himself a boundary. Faulkner gives him the length to leverage and he takes full toll
"fuller delivery outside off, drives to the left of mid-off"
"that's the back of the hand slower ball at 108 kph, Taylor reads it well and nudges it through midwicket to bring up the hundred partnership at nearly run-a-ball"
"big appeal for caught behind, they're going up with the noise, but could it be bat hitting ground? <b>Australia go for review</b>. It's a very full, very wide delivery, that Brownlie looks to slice off the open face. Chris Brown, the on-field umpire, said no. But snicko points out a spike as the ball passes the bat. Umpire Dharmasena asks the decision to be reversed and so Handscomb has a second catch, this one diving forward to pick up a ball that is dying on his way through to him"
"full and just outside off from around the stumps, Broom steers it to point"

"full on middle, Taylor punches it to mid-on for a single"

"the pressure has told. Munro couldn't get anything away. Not even singles, with the field up. And here, he tries to chip a fuller ball outside off for a few runs but does so in the air. Starc at mid-off, comes forward and dives to complete the formalities"

"fuller delivery outside off, Neesham is still hanging back as he defends to point"
digs it in finally and Neesham is in all sorts. Fends a 146 kph delivery off his chest but makes sure to keep it down.
"another bouncer, and this time Neesham goes for a pull, and is beaten for pace and bounce"
""
"chops on and Neesham falls. Clever bowling from Australia, they've realised the kind of bowling that will help on this pitch, the cross seamers and slower balls and hitting the deck with the seam. This one climbs a bit more on the batsman and his trying to find runs at third man fails badly. The ball grazes past off stump, the bail takes a long time coming off, but off it comes. Neesham almost thought he had gotten away with it"

"another offcutter, short and wide, Taylor has to reach out to make contact. Gets a single to point"
"full on off stump, defends"
"backs away as he tries to carve some runs through point, but Cummins one-ups the batsman with a slower ball which results in an inside edge down the pitch. End of a top spell: 10-0-47-1"
"gets a thick outside edge to the third man boundary. That's <b>hundred no. 16</b>, the most by a New Zealand batsman in ODIs, equal with Nathan Astle. Full and wide, he slashes, hard and gets away with it"
"fuller delivery outside off, pushes into the covers"
"full and outside off, drills it to mid-off"
"145 kph, full on off stump, gets an inside edge onto his boot. <b>Has Starc got reverse</b>? As if New Zealand didn't have enough things to worry about"
"low full toss outside leg, Santner heaves it to the left of long-on"
"smashes it over extra cover. Taylor picks up the slower ball, gets under it and beats the infield. Brutal, after a period of wondering what he should be doing."
"short and outside off, crashes it to deep point"
"that's out of his T20 playbook, shuffling across to off stump and swinging across the line of a length ball. Misses it completely, of course, and gets leg byes to long leg"
"tries to hit the slower ball a touch too hard, looking to midwicket instead of long-on, and gets an inside edge to short fine leg"
"aims a yorker on the base of leg stump, Santner flicks it through to deep midwicket"
"pummels it... straight to deep square leg. Taylor walks off to a rousing ovation, but without him, New Zealand have no hope of getting to the kind of score they want. Good bowling from Faulkner, hitting a stump-to-stump line, changing his pace as often as possible"
"back of the hand slower ball on off stump, drives it to long-off"
"good length ball, pitching on a good length, outside off and veering away off the bat after pitching. Half an appeal from the bowler, the on-field umpire Brown says no, but Finch goes for the review. No mark on HotSpot. No Spike on Snicko"
"fuller delivery at rapid pace, Southee is slinking away from the line, throwing his hands at the ball. Beaten again"
"full as he aims for the base of off stump, Southee, for once, stays put and drives through cover"
"yorker on middle, Santner squeezes it to long-on"
"length ball, bunted towards long-on, but the timing is so poor that mid-off gets to it before long-on. New Zealand limp to 250"
"yorker on off stump, Santner can only save his sticks and pick up a single to square leg"
"Faulkner goes blockhole too, on leg stump, and Santner is able to heave it away to deep square leg"
"gets length and Southee winds up... this looks like six.. this should have been six a lot more easily... but <b>Stoinis almost pulls off the most miraculous effort</b>. He is on the edge of the deep midwicket boundary, leaping back sticking his right hand high and behind him to try and take a catch. Does so one-handed and sees Cummins running in from square leg on his peripheral vision, tries to toss it to him to complete the wicket. No luck there. And worse, the back of his boot stamps on the advertising triangles as he got hold of the ball. Great effort, though."
"full and outside off, smears it through cover"
"lenght ball, swings and misses as it lobs over middle stump"
"low full toss on leg stump, Santner whips it behind square leg for a couple"
gets the gap between point and short third man. The slower ball goes awry as Faulkner gives both width and the length to get under and crash it away
"nothing better for a fast bowler. A searing 146 kph yorker on the base of middle stump and Southee, running away from the ball, leaves it free passage to hit his woodwork. Starc's pitch map today would make fine reading. So many into the blockhole"
"another yorker and the stumps are in disarray again. Ferguson's bat just doesn't come down quick enough. Starc just turns around after seeing the bails fly. He wants to get this over with, put his feet up, bag the trophy and go home. Seems to be getting some late away swing as well"
"searches for the yorker again but it comes off as a full toss, a high full toss, over the waist according to umpire Brown, who is not at square leg. Tight call that. In fact, the wrong call, the ball dips well below the waist when Boult defends it towards point."
"swings at the free hit, which seems to be the slower ball outside off, misses"
"length ball outside off at 148,8 kph and it's smacked over extra cover. Starc's quickest ball comes in the last over of the innings"
"whips a low full toss over deep midwicket. A late flourish for New Zealand, Santner making up for all the balls he ate up earlier"
finishes off with a six. This is length again from Starc and Santner is able to get under it with a slog over deep midwicket
"starts off with a wayward delivery down leg, Finch looks to tickle it fine but the ball deflects off the thigh pad into the fine leg boundary"
"nips away from the length area outside off, left aloen"
"some shape away again, Finch stands tall and bunts it to cover"
"uppish but into the gap. Right to the pitch of the ball, and boom. Over mid-off, whacked for four. Can't overpitch to Finch"
"much straighter and fuller on middle from wide of the crease, eased to mid-on"
"gets on top of the bounce and punches it wide of Williamson at cover, solid first over for the visitors"

bunts it towards the man coming in from point as they scamper a single
shuffles across and defends the length ball on middle back to the bowler
"too straight and down leg, Finch gets some pad on the way as the ball deflects behind the wicket"
"glorious stroke! Full and swinging away, Finch gets to the pitch of the ball and lofts him through the line. The ball sails over the ropes at long-off. Just an extension of his arms but the timing was outstanding. Little or no followthrough on that occasion. Big, broad blades, yes, but the timing was super too"
"sliding into middle and leg, flicked into the gap at midwicket, excellent running"

"shapes to cut but this was a lot fuller for him to play the stroke, beaten."
cracking delivery. Marsh shapes to cut again but this one nips back in to cut him in two halves. 142 clicks on that one
firm push but straight to mid-off
"gets this to deviate from length area on off stump, he uses the depth of the crease to defend with an angled bat to point"
"stifled lbw appeal. Marsh plays outside the line in anticipation of an outswinger, but this one angles in and holds its line to hit him on the flap of the pad"
"this time he gets forward and bunts the inswinger back to the bowler. Top over, created some self-doubts in Marsh's mind"
"<b> tough chance </b>, but Southee has taken such catches before. So powerfully drilled that the ball nearly parried off Southee's hands to mid-on. Was hit hard and hit straight"
"angles this into middle from wide of the crease, worked to midwicket"
"tentative in his forward defense this time, on the move as he defends the outswinger to cover. Southee bowled that with a scrambled seam"
"slower delivery but he gets the angle wrong, way down leg and on the bounce to the keeper. 111 kph"
glides this one away towards third man. Had all the pace in the world to play the shot.

"angling into middle and leg, tucked to midwicket"
slides a length ball across Finch who shoulders arms
dabbed softly into the gap between cover and mid-off
whipped off his hip but straight to midwicket
"uppish but one bounce to mid-on. Once again, Marsh was uncertain as to which way that was moving. Looked to drive, got a thick inside edge as the ball nipped back in. Pressure building"
"flicks and misses, hit on the pad. 11 balls in a row and he's just scored one off Boult"
firm push wide of mid-off for a single
"nearly chopped on. Didn't have the width to cut, got a thick inside edge towards fine leg where Ferguson did well to dive to his left and save two runs."
"crunching cover drive this time. On the up, timed superbly. This was an outswinger that had enough width, and Marsh timed that beautifully. That should make him feel much better"
"glides this into the third man boundary. All timing and placement. Hint of width, Marsh opens the face of the bat late and then steers it behind point. Short boundary there too"
"slower delivery, but too full. Marsh gets to the pitch of the ball and cracks that into the cover boundary. Delayed the shot just a wee bit, moved into position and boom!"
shows the full face of the bat and defends that incoming length ball
bunts the inswinger behind point as they steal a quick single
"some outstanding wrist work! Did I just say pressure? How he's managed to wriggle out of that. Marginally overpitched, but he simply drove that back down past mid-on with an air of nonchalance"
"real bonus for New Zealand. Marsh was really slow on the turn. This was full on the pads, he flicked this towards deep square, where Mitchell Santner got to the ball quickly and fired a throw on the halfvolley to Latham, who did the rest. Have to say that was an excellent take from the keeper, and Marsh is caught comfortably short of the crease. Why would you want to self-destruct like that? He was just starting to play some gorgeous shots"
width and he's driven that straight to mid-off
"chopped on! New Zealand are back and indecision in footwork has cost Handscomb. Simply wafts at an away-going length ball, nothing shot really. No feet movement whatsoever. The ball crashes into the stumps off the inside edge"

"solidly behind the line of that full delivery, defended back to the bowler"
"hustles in with a length ball on middle from wide of the crease, worked t midwicket"

"solid push to cover. 150kph this time, he's cranking it up"
"uppish but just short of cover point. Both feet were off the ground when he shaped to cut, didn't get enough bat on it. Nearly a wicket maiden"
"super timing on the flick, but the midwicket fielder does well to run all the way back to flick it back. Santner the man. Did well to dish in a slide to save one run. Not much swing"
"short of length delivery on middle, defended back with a straight bat"
eased gently off the back foot towards mid-off for a quick single
"straightens from a length area on off stump, Head is neatly onto the back foot as he defends"

"full and angling back in from wide of the crease, left alone"
"back of length delivery on off stump, bunted wide of cover as the get across for a single"

"pulled from outside off, but there' protection at deep square. Rolled the wrists over that delivery to keep it all along the ground"
"whipped beautifully into the gap between midwicket and square leg. Just eased it superbly, all timing and class. Super wrist work. Using the pace, 152kph, to time that"
"firm push, not much flourish of the bat. Into the gap at deep extra cover, back for the second in a jiffy"
"whipped to midwicket, where Brownlie moves swiftly to his left to effect a one-handed stop. 152.3 clicks"
slapped off the back foot to deep cover
"Williamson won't be impressed with that effort at sweeper cover. Punched towards Brownlie, who does well to get to the ball, but the late bobble as he tries to push it back in with the slide results in the ball touching the ropes"
"angled into middle and leg, turned to midwicket"
"overbalanced, but he gets some bat on it as he works it behind square on the leg side"
"looked to go square on the leg side, ended up beating mid-off. Slapped. Forehand smash"

both feet in the air as he tucks that off his hip to deep square leg
"too much width, but is lucky to get away with it again. Crunched straight to deep point"

"drifting across the batsman, who rocks back and eases it to deep cover"
"pulled to wide long-on, six off the over"
"<b> drops a tough chance. </b> Too full, Finch looks to go over the bowler's head but doesn't get the elevation. It was hit well alright, but Williamson was just a fraction of a second late to react"
"this time, he clears mid-off. Gets to the pitch of the ball and lofts him over the infield. Easily done"
"into the hospitality area at deep midwicket. Sure, it was the longer boundary but this was a full toss that had to be hit. Connected cleanly"

slapped to wide long-off. Once again too short. Finch gave it a proper thwack but found the fielder

"punched to Boult at deep midwicket. Looked like he was shaping to clear the ropes there, but didn't have much pace to work with"
"uppish but into the gap, down to deep cover"
"Santner had to decide in a split second if he was going for the catch running in from long-off or save three runs. Finch backs away and slaps that over the infield, Santner goes for the catch but the ball just falls short of him. What's worse? It's a four too"
"got lucky with the previous delivery, this time he muscles it straight to the lone man at deep midwicket. Looked to go over long-on perhaps, ended up dragging it a bit, and towards the longer boundary there, he stood no chance. New Zealand back into this"

"147 kph, shortish and outside off, Stoinis goes for a cut but is beaten for pace"
"back of a length on off stump at 146 kph, defends"
"digs it in short, Stoinis ignores it, Latham can't hope to move quickly enough to his left"
"flat-batted down the ground, doesn't get all of it and that's why Southee running back from mid-on is able to pull it back inches inside the rope"
"edged, and past the wicketkeeper's right. This is a genuine mis-hit, Stoinis pushing at a back of a length ball, which seams away just enough to get past the middle of his bat. Had there been a slip, he might have been gone"
"ripper of a bouncer. He shaped to pull but then realised the ball was rearing up alarmingly and tried to pull out, but by then the ball had deflected off his shoulder and over the keeper's head. Handy runs"

drilled down the ground but excellent work by the bowler to put his hand out in his followthrough and stop that
hops across and punches the short of length delivery to deep point
"superb catch by Dean Brownlie at deep square leg. He had to be mindful of the ropes just behind him, but he kept his balance and judged the catch to perfection. Coming back to the delivery, excellent short ball at 140 clicks, Head had to fetch this from outside off. The ball got big on him but he went through with the stroke and simply top-edged it to the fielder in the deep. Lot of credit to the bowler, for the effort."
"rolls his wrists over the pull shot, hit into the gap at deep square leg"
so very close to angling this away-going length delivery to the keeper. Beaten for pace as he looks to run it down to third man
"slower and fuller delivery, but Faulkner had to reach out a fair bit to defend that ,which he does"
"there was a wide slip in place specifically for this. Faulkner is squared up by the late movement, gets a thick edge that was dying on Taylor, who moves low to his left to complete a stunning catch. This is outstanding tactics from New Zealand. First to place the fielder there, and then set the batsman up before eventually.  sending him on his way. The front foot is fine, the umpires were checking for the catch. Kumar Dharmasena, the third umpire, had a couple of replays, before relaying his decision to the on-field umpire."

"gets this to reverse away from off stump, shoulders arms"

a half-stop at cover by Neesham gives a single. This was struck hard on the up
"cut hard, but straight to Neil Broom at point"
short-arm jab to deep square leg. Just a flick of the wrists to keep it all along the ground. It was short and he picked the length early
"<b> tipped over the bar! </b> Taylor couldn't hang on to a tough chance at cover. He was airborne, timed his jump well but wasn't enough. Stoinis checks his shot as he looks to clear the infield, signs of grip on the surface? It didn't come on as well as he would have liked. Tough, tough chance"
"muscles a pull past mid-on, didn't get hold of it entirely but just about enough to beat the fielder"
driven on the up to extra cover
"backs away, opens up the off side and uses the pace of the bowler to glide the short ball down to third man"
too short and way over the batsman's head. Correct decision from the umpire
"drilled down the ground, what swagger, what timing! Stunner to say the least. Marginally overpitched, Stoinis stayed right inside the crease and lofted that down the ground with a straight bat"
now shows he can play off the back foot too! Width and he crashed that behind point. Allowed the ball to slide in to the bat before dismissing that from its presence
"in-drifter on middle, pushed back to the bowler"

firm push on the up to deep cover
"floats this full on middle, worked behind square on the leg side for an easy single"
smeared off the front foot but an excellent stop at backward point. That was travelling
"through with the pull way too early, yes-no, yes-no from both batsmen, eventually they can't scamper a run even as point comes in and fires a throw"
"cuts and misses. It was short alright, but there wasn't much width for him to try the stroke"
"cut away, but straight to point again"
"he's picked out the fielder at long-on. Superb bowling from Santner, tossed this up but the ball dipped on Stoinis, who looked to slap this across the line but couldn't get underneath it and hit it straight to Neesham."

"gift of a delivery. Too short and sliding down leg, he gets a faint tickle that was needed to beat the keeper and fine leg. Too easy"
"looks to clatter this over midwicket but didn't get underneath the delivery. The late deviation did him in. Better bowling, took the pace off on that occasion"
"tucked straight to short fine leg, the man there had been brought up only prior to this over"
clobbered into the gap at deep midwicket but the fielder already anticipates and runs in to fire a rocket throw
"full and slanted on off, squeezed to long-off"
"when he hit it, it looked like this was a dolly to long-off, but the ball kept flying. A leading edge gone for six, would you believe it? 58-metre boundary there."
"looks like Boult has pulled a hammy there. Flat it, he moved quickly to his left and dived full length to stop that on the bounce. Cramps as he moved, then landed flat on his face. Seems fine"
"hammered down the ground, straight into the sightscreen. Hit straight as a dye, got underneath the flight and boom"
firm push off the front foot to sweeper cover
"fired into middle and leg, thought it would be called wide but the ball drifted away to hit him on the pad"

"floats this full on off, pushed to cover for a quick single"
opens the wrists late to use the width and steer this late behind point. No chance for third man despite a dive. The pace of Ferguson made it easier for Starc
pushed off the back foot to cover
"slants a short ball across the batsman, who looks to pull across the line but misses"
"too full on the pads and he's flicked it into the deep square leg fence. There were three men on the leg side, but he still managed to beat them. Too straight, too easily done."
"too full on middle, squeezed back down to mid-off"
"he's hit this into Wellington! Way over the ropes. Runs are bleeding, and there's life in this contest and how. Right in the slot and Cummins was teeing off like he would on a golf course. Currently, New Zealand are running out of ideas"
drops this gently into the off side for a quick single
worked into the deep midwicket region as they jog the single
"too full, gets underneath the flight and squeezes it to deep point"
fetches the slog from outside off towards deep square leg
"too full, crashed to the man at the edge of the circle at cover"
"angles a short ball back into middle from around the stumps, steered using the width to square third man"
"right into the blockhole, Starc brings his bat down in time to squeeze it to cover"
"hammered down the ground, but straight to long-on"
"one shot too many and he's gone! Cummins looks to go through with the pull but was beaten for pace and hurried into the stroke, ended up lobbing it to midwicket where Santner made no mistake. Relief in the New Zealand camp. Is that it for Australia?"
"full and tailing back into middle and leg to hit Starc flush on the pad, but the ball would have missed leg by a mile. Reverse swing, and how"
"another toe-crusher which Starc somehow manages to keep away, gets it to square leg as they steal a run"
"bangs a short ball in but way down leg, easy call for the umpire"
"slower and fuller on middle, defended to the leg side. Looked like Starc was winding up to go leg side but couldn't hit it anywhere because of the length"
"hammered down the ground, long-on comes around to his right to cut that off"
"full and tails back in late towards middle, pushed to cover"
"stunning yorker, point precision. Zampa needs to be given credit too for keeping that out"
"full and wide outside off, looks to squeeze it behind point but ends up getting a thick inside edge that rolls to the right of Latham, who effects a one-handed stop"
"gets a thick inside edge down to long-on, they surely won't mind Zampa on strike"
"he's got five! Ross Taylor was brought in at wide first slip position precisely prior to this delivery and the plan comes off. This is a cutter, gets a bit of grip and bounce, Zampa hangs his bat out without any conviction, gets a thick edge and Taylor does the rest."
"full and straight on off, Hazlewood just about manages to keep that out. Went for the yorker this time"
"he's bowling yorkers on demand now, how did Hazlewood keep that out?  Very, very close again. Right on middle, just managed to bring his bat down in time. Didn't have a high backlift, which allowed him time"
"excellent bouncer, angled in from wide of the crease, Hazlewood ducks under that one"
"crunched. Into the point boundary in a jiffy! Too short, enough width in the world for him to unfurl that cut shot. Australia need more of these"
"you beauty, Boult! Six wickets and <b> New Zealand have regained the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. </b> Subtle change in pace with that length ball, Hazlewood look to force that through the off side, plays outside the line and can only get a thick inside edge back onto the stumps. <b> New Zealand win the series 2-0. </b> These are Boult's best figures in ODIs, his second five-wicket haul in his career, and both have come against Australia. The last time he did it - at the 2015 World Cup at Eden Park - was equally special."
