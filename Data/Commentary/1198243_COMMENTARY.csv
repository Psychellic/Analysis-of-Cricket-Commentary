"oooh movement first up, in the channel. Left alone safely as it's going away"
"good length outside off again, and hint of movement away. Left alone again"
"brings the line closer to off stump and Burns has to play that, which he does well, opens the face and steers it past the cordon with soft hands. Runs all the way to the boundary"
"much straighter, a bit too straight, hits him on the flap of the pad and there's a half-appeal from Shaheen, but that was going down. Possibly going over too"
"back of a length outside off, Burns pulls his bat out in time to let it through"
"good length, straightens a bit after coming in with the angle. Burns didn't really commit to playing it, and it goes past the outside edge"
"straightaway testing the batsman, bang in the channel and he hangs his bat out a bit but keeps it close to body as the ball whizzes past"
too full and clipped nicely off his pads through midwicket. The fielder inside the circle runs back and pulls it in before it hits the rope
"fullish on off stump, jammed backward of square with an angled bat"
"good length on the sixth stump, lets it go"
"fuller outside off, glides it with an open bat face but some good work by gully, who dives to his left to stop it"

"bit of movement away from the batsman, left alone outside off"
"full on off stump, defended solidly on the front foot"

keeps it in the channel outside off and Burns watches it go past
"some decent shape on that away from the batsman but it dies as it reaches the keeper, who has to tumble to his left to gather"

"length on off, pushed into the offside and he was looking for a quick single but sent back by Burns - rightly"
"full on off, defended back to the bowler"
"probing line outside off, but Sibley calmly defends on the front foot"
too straight that time and Sibley able to flick that off his thigh pad to fine leg
"full on the pads and flicked straight to square leg, who has just come into that position."
"fuller, came forward to defend but it nipped back in and took the inside half of the bat to fine leg"
<b>caught at third slip!</b> or is it? Soft signal is out but Burns is waiting. And that looks like it might be a safe catch. Fingers nicely under the ball by Shan Masood and Burns will have to go. Afridi has made the first breakthrough. Got it to pitch on a length and move away enough to take the edge as he was coming forward to defend. The ball was dying on Masood but he did well to take it cleanly.
"leg stump half volley first ball and Crawley says thank you very much, flicks it easily for four through square leg to get off the mark in style"
"<b>that was so close to off stump</b> Risky leave from Crawley, to one that was millimetres away from shaving the stumps. Afridi has his head in his hands, he knows how close that was"
<b>yorker</b> and Crawley's being tested. Jams his bat down <i>just</i> in time and manages to squirt it through the cordon. The scoreboard will show a boundary but the bowler won the contest on that ball
good length nipping back in but good judgement from Sibley to let it go through
"<b>lovely shot</b>. Length ball on the pads, moving further away and all he has to do is clip it through square, which he does with elegance"
"better ball, on off and moving a touch away, bounces a tad higher too, and strikes him on the thigh pad having squared him up and gone past the outside edge"
"oooh play and a miss. Back to familiar tight lines by Abbas and Sibley is forced to play at it, goes past the edge"
"testing, testing times for batsmen. Abbas showing off his control. Brings this one back in sharply from a length, and unlike previous balls on this surface that carries well to the keeper. Goes close to off stump again as he leaves it alone"
easier leave that time to a length ball outside off
"too full on leg stump again, and easily clipped through midwicket."
"<b>beauty</b> Full ball outside off, left him groping for it. Swung into him and then straightened after pitching. Hisses past the edge"
"full on the stumps, pushed to cover. Loud call of 'NO' to quell any thoughts of a single"
"bit of nibble into him, but pulls the length back a bit. Batsman unable to flick it off his thigh pad"
he's getting the ball to nibble in the air for sure. This was a touch too full though and Sibley able to get a nice big stride in to defend
"length ball on the stumps, pushed back to the bowler's right"
"fullish length on off, defended into the covers"
"<b>beaten</b>. On that hard length, he's defending from the crease, what saves him is he played inside the line and the ball moved away a touch"
"length ball on the stumps, and Crawley takes a step and a half forward - probably to negate the movement and disrupt his length - and pats it down to midwicket"
"fuller on off, steered to point for a quick single."
"length outside off, nipping in a touch but safely left alone"
"length outside off, left alone"
"full on off, defended into the off side"

"good length going across him, lets it go through"
"full on off, shaping into  from the batsman late and Crawley gets a thick inside edge to midwicket off an intended drive through cover"

"fuller on the stumps, pushed towards mid-off"
"fuller, slanting away, steered through backward point"
"once again standing outside the crease and coming down the pitch, gets an inside edge to a forward push and a fumble by fine leg allows a second run"
"length outside off, defended solidly"
nipping back into him and hits him on the thigh pad as he tries to push at it. Half an appeal but that was going to bounce over
"fuller on the pads, flicked nicely but straight to square leg"
"was almost caught in two minds, thought about pulling out of the shot but then defended it at the last moment. Full outside off"
skips down the track first ball and takes it on the half-volley to flick it nicely through midwicket

"length ball on middle and leg, punched to mid-on"

keeps it on the seventh stump line and Crawley is happy to let those go
"and after going wide of the crease and keeping the ball well outside off, Abbas brings it much closer to the stumps and seams it away. Crawley gets a thick outside edge through point off a defensive push"
this one nips back in but Crawley stays back and pats it down towards short midwicket. Quick single available
"full on off, driven to the bowler's left"
given some air on a fifth stump line. He goes down on one knee but mistimes his drive
"good timing on that one, full outside off and driven fluidly but good fielding by extra cover to tumble and save"
slammed past short cover. Too short and he rocks back to drive this hard and true

"good length in the channel, mid-80s mph to being with and Sibley watches it by"

"banging away outside off, Sibley happy to leave those"

"floated up full on the stumps, driven along the carpet to mid-on"
"hit on the pads as he skips down, umpire Gough thinks about it... <b>and up goes the finger!</b> Sibley consults with his partner and then <b>reviews</b>, but looks like he is going to pay for playing across a straight one. Couldn't quite get to the pitch and it straightened a touch then skidded into the pad. Hitting middle stump three-quarters of the way up, that's plumb!"

"back of a length, Root is up on his toes to punch this square on the off side"
"pushes forward on off, finds the outside edge... <b>but bounces well in front of third slip!</b> That was a long way from carrying, scuttles through for a single, too. Root getting a bit of a working over by Naseem, though"

"flighted, around the line of off, blocked coming across"

"fuller outside off, opens the bat face at the last moment to steer it past the two slips and into the third man boundary. Extremely well played by Root"
"quicker one, almost a yorker - 88 mph - but Root gets bat down in time to clip to mid-on"

"fuller on off, blocked back to the bowler"
"good line outside off, asking Crawley to fish at it, but he lets it go. Nice carry on that"

"fuller outside off, stays beside it and steers it through point"
short but sliding down legside and he controls the pull shot to play it very fine and collect an easy boundary
"<b>peach gets him</b>. Not much Root could have done about that. Pitches on back of a length and jags away sharply. The line meant Root had to play at it, the movement meant it took a healthy outside edge leaving him squared up. Rizwan flings himself to his right to ensure a beautiful ball gets a deserved wicket"
zips through on a length outside off at 89 mph
"fuller on off, pushed into the offside and Pope is alive to the possibility of a quick single, and takes it"
<b>lovely</b>. Too full and he leans into a creamy cover drive that races to the boundary
"good length swerving in but not enough to make him play at it, lets it go"

"tossed up fuller, defended on the front foot"
"fuller outside off, steered between cover and point"
"<b>cleaned him up!</b> Pinned to the back foot, and he was in no position to play that. It burst through the gate to knock the stumps back.

"<b>and he gets to his second Test century with a punch through point</b>. What a great moment for him. First 100 as a wicketkeeper. He was there for Crawley's century, and Crawley's there to congratulate Buttler on his landmark. Got some room with this delivery, which was also a bit shorter, and he stayed back to punch it.

"swing away first up, on a fifth stump line. Left alone"

"keeps it in the channel, slightly back of a length. Moving away. Left alone"

"length ball on the pads, flicked through square and there's no fielder there so it goes all the way"
"and that's an excellent yorker, catches Azhar by surprise. Jofra belts out a loud appeal, but perhaps that was going down. England have only one review left so they won't be using that. Good decision, that was indeed going down. Azhar late on getting his bat down to that one"

"and another good one back of a length. He's got some wheels on this, 93 mph. Fawad manages to just about fend it off his rib cage while getting tucked up past short leg"
"<b>appeal for caught behind</b> but not given. Root reviews. That was a beaut from Jofra but I don't know if Azhar got glove on it. Short and moving away, makes him fend from shoulder height outside off. Spontaneous appeal but the ball has not hit glove. It's hit shoulder! Great ball but Azhar stays and England have lost their reviews"
"nice loop on that, makes Alam stretch forward to defend"
"good length again, making him reach forward and defend outside off"
"slightly shorter, he cuts that, but can't beat point"

"<b>he's really cranking it up here</b>. 91 mph bouncer, a bit off radar down leg but a bouncer at that pace is really really quick."

"pushed through outside off, Alam is back to cut"
"lures him out, takes the edge - <b>Bess gets his man!</b> Clear edge, spin and bounce as Alam played a long way outside his eyeline. Success for Bess, found the right length and it spat to clip the shoulder of the bat, Buttler snaffling the chance cleanly going up and to his left"

"tossed up on the stumps, punched to long-on"
"good loop on that, on middle and leg, he moves across to try and tap it into the legside but misses, wears it on his thigh pad"
"<b>caught down the legside</b>. That's an unlikely dismissal for a set batsman and Rizwan will be unhappy to get out that way but he's done really well. Length ball on leg stump, seaming inwards ends up down the pads and he tries to tickle it fine. Too fine as it turns out and a diving Buttler completes a good take to his left"

"fuller, he goes through with the straight drive. Comes a bit off the inside half but beats the bowler and there is no one straight so he gets three"
"length on off stump, pushed to cover"
very full outside off and he opens the face to time a square drive beautifully through point
movement off the seam straightaway and a bit more bounce too. On a length on middle and Yasir has to get his bat up a bit higher than expected to keep it down
"in the channel, moving away, left alone"
"<b>beaten</b> Anderson gets it to come in with the angle and straighten, and Yasir is left with his bat hanging away from his body"
"and he's had a waft at it outside off again. tentative poke with the ball moving away, doesn't lay bat on it, perhaps luckily for him"
<b>pulled through midwicket</b> and with one leg off the ground too. Short ball didn't rise much and Yasir deals with it elegantly
"length on the stumps, nudged to square leg on the front foot and they take the single"
"length on off stump, jabbed towards extra cover from the crease"
"<b> edged and taken</b> The new ball does the trick. Bounces up off a length higher than the old ball would, Yasir is on the front foot and looking to defend into the offside but it bounces up to catch the shoulder of his bat. Flying fairly fast but Root does well at first slip to hold it above his head with both hands"
"too full and sliding down legside, he helps it on his way with a nice looking flick, picks up two runs"
banged in short but Shaheen stays calmly in his crease and defends it towards the slips from his rib cage
"fuller on middle, confidently defended with a straight bat"
"zips past the outside edge that time, hits a hard length outside off and moves a touch away, too good for Shaheen"
"good length on middle, moving a touch away, nicely behind it to defend"
"the hard new ball is bouncing a bit more than the old one, especially when it's pitched in areas that the batsmen are coming forward to. Azhar has to defend sharply"
"length outside off, swinging away, left alone"
too straight and flicked off his pads to deep square leg
"swinging away from him, but on a sixth stump line so he can leave it alone comfortably"
"oooh, a play and miss. Full just outside off, he goes to drive and doesn't connect. Wasn't that far from the edge I think"
"full and on off, solidly defended to cover"
"too short and he latches on to that, cuts it over point. Nicely balanced. Pope hares after it and gets to it before the boundary"
"in the corridor on a length, shoulders arms"
keeps it in the corridor but Azhar happy to let those go through
"length ball in the corridor. Broad might have thought Azhar would try to look for a single there, but he lets it go again"
"and he brings this one back in to Azhar, who doesn't connect with the tap into the onside. Bit of an appeal from Broad. England don't have reviews left though"
"length on leg stump, he's a little late in getting bat down to defend, it takes the inside edge to fine leg. And he's off strike first ball"
"full on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"full and tailing into him at off, but he's rock solid in his front foot defence"
"<b>that's very very close</b> and a loud, vociferous appeal from Anderson but Michael Gough shakes his head. Oh my word. There were two noises but that could be bat on pad. But there was some bat on that! Gough's amazing decision making continues. Pitched on the stumps and moved a touch, beat his bat and struck him in line. But he got a feather on it"
this one cuts back in sharply from outside off but left alone
"fuller, pushed firmly to cover but he can't take the single that would make him keep the strike"
<b>superman catch from Buttler flying to his right</b>. Broad banged it in short but mis-directed a bit I thought. Did the job though as Afridi tries to play it down fine from his rib-cage. Only gets a tickle. Buttler launches to his right and comes up with ball in his outstretched glove. Brilliantly done.
"fuller and into him on the stumps, defends solidly"
bouncer and he ducks under it
"length ball nipping back, misses the flick, it hits the thigh pad and plops down"
"fuller tailing into him in the channel, he gets his bat down late to defend"
"full and sliding down leg, another good take by Buttler to his left this time. Abbas doesn't get a tickle on this one though"
"full on off, plonks his front foot forward and unleashes a bullet straight drive. Seemed destined for the boundary but catches Anderson's boot on his follow through"
sliding down leg side and too far away for him to glance it fine
<b>dropped by Burns at second slip</b>. Regulation edge as he aims an ambitious drive outside off. Flies at decent pace to Burns' left. Catchable height certainly. In and out of his hands.
"takes the single, patting it through point"
"<b>dropped by Crawley at fourth slip now</b>! What is happening. Anderson has his head in his hands. Two drops in the over. Length ball that moved away, perfect for a No.10 and takes the edge as planned. Crawley sees it plop in and out of his hands. Went straight to him at waist height"
"goes for the yorker on the stumps, Abbas keeps it out"
"length ball into him, tapped to midwicket"
"short ball, doesn't rise much and Azhar dismissively pulls it behind square for a boundary"
"<b>majestic</b> Azhar Ali is rubbing salt into England's wounds after being dropped last over. Short and wide, sat up to be hit and he just creamed it through point"
"better length now and in line with the stumps, pushed to mid-on"
"<b>run out chance and they go upstairs</b> And he has <i>just</i> made it back. This was a sharp one cutting in, Azhar inside edged onto body and it rolled away to silly point. He wants the single to retain strike and sets off, realises quickly there is no run and starts to go back. Broad meanwhile saw him coming and was also swooping down on the ball. Reaches it and flicks it at the stumps, but Azhar has made it back"
"mis-times his push to mid-on and can't get the single, so it'll be Abbas facing potentially a full Anderson over"
"length ball coming into him on off, defended"
"length on the stumps, nudged to midwicket"
"full on off, Abbas drives at it limply, gets an inside edge that goes to fine leg and gets off the strike"
"length on the stumps, defended towards mid-on"
seemed to surprise him a bit by bouncing lower than expected. Was shaping to slap it away but ends up bunting it back to the bowler
"<b>catch dropped but Abbas is run out</b> Three catches dropped off Anderson in two overs. This was the easiest of the lot. Azhar just chipped it to Broad at mid-on and amazingly, a dolly goes through Broad's hands. Meanwhile the batsmen are still looking to take a single to keep Azhar on strike but Abbas was ball-watching and set off late. Broad in pure frustration lets loose at the stumps and hits direct at the striker's end! What a ball. And what a two overs of Anderson."
"length sliding down leg, Azhar misses the flick. Buttler moves smartly to his left to gather"
"length very far outside off, he lets it go"
"<b>gorgeous</b>. Too full, he stands straight and on-drives beautifully. Leaves the fielders standing. Almost like it was a catch coming to them..."

"dug in back of a length, Azhar taps it down"
"smoked over extra cover, not a clean strike but they'll pick up two easily"
"angling in, 84mph/136kph and turned into the leg side"

<b>hammered through midwicket on the pull!</b> Rocks on the back foot and pings it out of the screws to finish the over with a boundary
"pitched up, wobble seam and it jags to hit the front pad, England appeal but that was heading down leg"
"length outside off, 82mph/1232kph and Naseem does a little rooster hop across and drops his hands"
"angled in, slightly back of a length, again he judges that his off stump is safe and elects not to play"
"too good, 86mph/138kph, <b>straightening past the forward prod</b>, Naseem missed that by quite a distance"
"<b>another beauty</b>, 86mph and darting in and then out as Naseem gropes for it outside off stump"
"edged to slip, <b>SIBLEY HOLDS THIS ONE!</b> Fenced off the back foot, thick edge and it flies low to third slip, this time it's taken, Test wicket No598 for Anderson, and his 29th five-wicket haul!"
"tickled fine first up, length ball straying down the pads. Buttler has to fling himself to his right to field it. Came off the pad"
"length ball in the channel, he shoulders arms"
"and some of the Anderson swing now, moving away from him in the channel. Left alone"
"another one in the channel, left alone"

"and this one comes back in, but is a bit too wide of off stump and is left alone again."
"angling into him, takes the pad to square leg"

"length angling into him, tapped to square leg"
"length but well outside off, easily left alone"
"better line, much closer to off stump, straightens a touch after pitching, Masood happy to watch it go through"
and this one is even more close to off stump which means Masood defends it. Loose hands and the ball drops down near him
"fuller on off, defended"
"fullish on the stumps, moving away a touch, he gets behind it deep in his crease and defends into the offside"
"moving across the left hander, back of a length, he taps it down with soft hands towards short mid-on and takes a quick single"
"<b>beaten</b>. In the channel, pitches on fourth stump and moves a touch away, past the outside edge of his defensive prod"
full too far down leg side
"length moving into him, but the line is a bit off and he flicks it off his pads. <b>And they'll get four overthrows too</b>. Sub fielder Bracey swoops in at midwicket and over-enthusiastic with letting fly a throw to the bowler's end - but there's no one backing up and the batsman's home"
"full on off, driven through point"
"<b>outside edge</b> but falls short of Burns at second slip. Was pushing at it inside the line and the ball's moving away, gets a healthy edge."
"length ball angling in to him, in the channel, lets it through"
"nips this one back in from a length outside off, but Abid has covered his stumps and shouldered arms, so he's safe in letting it go"
"too full and on the pads, Abid is grateful for the gift and flicks it elegantly through midwicket"
"gets the line right now, outside off seaming in, but left alone"
"angling across him, left alone outside off on a length"
"nice tight lines by Jimmy, keeping it close to off stump while going across the left-hander. But Masood happy to leave it alone. Was back of a length so no danger of bowled or lbw"
"<b>is that another drop?</b> You've got to be kidding me! And it's Buttler this time with a fairly easy chance. He took a couple of great ones yesterday. This was full outside off and Masood couldn't resist having a waft at it. Gets a thick edge. Buttler tries to gobble it, it pops out of his gloves and drops down. Unbelievable."

"brings it closer to off stump now, and moving away, arms shouldered"

"<b>was there a noise?</b> Broad thinks so, and England are debating. No review. Short one dug in on leg stump, he was a bit late in getting the bat out of the way, but the ball seems to have flicked his shirt, which is what caused the noise. England saved themselves a lost review"
<b>well bowled<b/>. He knows the last ball has done something and follows it up with a full ball angling across him in the channel. Abid is caught on the crease with bat hanging but keeps it close to body and the ball passes the outside edge

"tossed up on off, driven back to the bowler on the front foot"
"back of a length, he stays beside it and pushes it to point"

"<b>wicket No.600 has arrived!</b> And poetically enough after all those drops, it's a catch to the lone slip. Generous applause from those at the ground. And he's got the first-innings centurion too, the captain. This was the perfect line, millimetres outside off, pitched a fraction short of a length and moved away. I think Azhar wasn't expecting it to bounce as much as it did, takes the shoulder of the bat as he's looking to prod - slightly away from the body - and flies at good pace to Root. The captain ain't dropping that one. You'd think it's about the perfect Anderson ball to get a landmark wicket."
