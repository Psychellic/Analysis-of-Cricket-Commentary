flashed into the covers
swinging down leg once more. A bit meh from Willey in this over
"up on the toes, that's a better line, and defended back down the pitch"
"crashed into the covers, a good sliding stop"
"too much width from Willey, who is caught between swinging down leg and starting too far outside off. It's the latter error this time, and an open-faced glide beats backward point"
"<B>tremendous use of the feet!</B> Dancing down the deck, right to the pitch of the ball, and slotted back over the bowler's head"
fended back down the pitch

"advancing once again, and eased down to long-on"

"a batsman swing through the line, clean in front of square on the leg side"
whipped off the legs to backward square
"pushed onto the back foot, fenced to third man. Australia are keeping apace of the requirement for now"
stabbed back to the bowler
opens the face to guide the ball to point
defended down the ground to long on
too short and flogged hard along the ground to the midwicket sweeper
"tossed up, dipping into the blockhole, enticing stuff"
"held back a touch in the flight, Head advances and clips to long on"
flipped out to midwicket from deep in the crease
pushed off the back foot to mid-off
"short and sharp, Head flinches inside the line as the ball gets big on him"
"sharp pace, but down the leg side. Half an appeal for the strangle down the leg side, but that was mostly to distract from the wide"
whipped urgently off the hip to deep midwicket
thumped into the covers and up comes a very well compiled fifty. Head is taking this chase head-on
"pulled hard, but straight to the man at midwicket"
"on the back foot, flicked to the leg side"
"drawn down the pitch, Moeen holds this one back, and midwicket gathers the delicate flick off the pads"
"<B>another soft and fluffy dismissal!</B> What a way to give it away. Very full from Moeen, which lures a limp pokey nothing shot, straight back into the bowler's grasp!"
pushed out to cover and Stoinis is off the mark
thumped uppishly to long-off
solidly into line
"very full, swinging into the pads, and they scamper the single"

nudged to the leg side
firmly bashed back down the pitch
inside-edge onto the pads as Plunkett comes round the wicket to the left-hander
"over the wicket now, and mown out to deep backward square. A good heavy-balled first over"
"hoisted high and mightily down the ground ... <B>but Plunkett is perched on the rope, and swallows the opportunity!</B> Just didn't quite get enough bat through the ball, and for all Australia's intent, they are in peril now"
"outside off, and tweaking back into a back-foot push"
"onto the front foot this time, and pushed to mid-off"
"delicate from Stoinis, a pre-meditated reverse sweep, gets it very fine, and Rashid can't cut that off"
"a hint of spin from outside off, Stoinis hits with the turn and places it to mid-on"
"on the back foot, defended back down the pitch"
hoicked behind square
flicked to the leg side
"wider on the crease, fuller length, blocked to mid-on"
"slower ball, on the pads, tucked out to deep square leg"
"thumped off the back foot, but straight to mid-off"
"slower ball again, dug into the pitch and hauled into the leg side"
"<B>massive!</B> Down on one knee, pounded into the stands, where there's a very good crowd catch. Scenes!"

"outside off this time, still a touch short, cut to deep cover"

goes for a square cut to a delivery that skids on and beats the bottom edge
"<b>just short of the bowler</b> as Finch gets a leading edge, looking to work into the leg side, turns the face of his bat, loops down the on-side of the pitch and Rashid can't quite reach it. Good effort"
"that flies through to Buttler from short of a length, wasn't a full on bouncer, beats the top edge of Stoinis who wanted the wide call"
"fuller, angled into the stumps, pushed towards mid-on"
gets inside the line and nudges this off his hip to deep square and makes it into a second
"lovely wrist work from Finch, whips a back-of-a-length delivery behind square on the leg side and he's timed it perfectly"
"back of a length outside off, he adjust the line, defended to cover"
"angled down the leg side, that's a poor delivery, doesn't make contact with the bat but deflects off the thigh guard to fine leg"
"full outside off, driven firmly to long-off but excellent running makes it a brace"
"good length, straight, tapped to the off side"
that's muscled down the ground over long-on...Finch stayed in his crease and just levered through the line from a strong base
"<B>done him this time!</b> He tosses it up much slower, Finch goes for another big shot down the ground and is completely done in the air. Lovely stuff from the leggie, even if he does have the cushion of a mountain of runs"

some whippage from Maxwell as he tucks this from outside off to deep square leg
"goes for the pull, drags it from outside off, doesn't connect perfectly but it finds space at deep midwicket"

"touch shorter, he goes back on leg stump, crunched very firmly towards cover who takes the pace off it"
"quite full at leg stump, he plays back and defends"
"there's the googly, he plays back and punches off the back foot to cover"
brilliant work at cover! A flatter delivery is driven firmly and Roy flings himself to his right
"there's some power in that! Full, touch too wide outside off, and Stoinis responds with a skimming drive wide of the cover sweeper"
"over the wicket, outside leg stump, takes the pad towards short fine leg and a poor piece of cricket allows an overthrow as Rashid throws at the stumps and it deflects away"
"short of a length on the pads, dangerous line, flicked straight to short fine leg. Rashid throws again with the batsman in no danger"
"straighter line, tucked into midwicket"
"heaves to the leg side against a pretty full delivery, takes a thick inside edge into midwicket. Willey chases, collects and throws at the stumps himself (worth it on this occasion...just)"
short of a length and he cloths his pull to midwicket
"he's been run out here! <b>An excellent throw from Bairstow</b> coming in from deep square. Stoinis hopped inside the line, worked the ball to deeps square, Maxwell called him back for the second and he's sold Stoinis well short. Bullet arm from Bairstow. Looks of thunder from Stoinis and Langer"

"moves outside leg stump, loses his shape on the drive, bottom hand comes off the bat as it skews to long-off"
"he's basically pulled a long hop to deep square! Good catch by Hales. A drag down from Rashid, Paine only had one man to beat on the leg side but couldn't keep the ball down and Hales moved to his right to snaffle the take"
"that's a lovely little shot, a ball angling across him, short of a length, and it's a delicate dab wide of the keeper"

"short outside off, driven to deep cover"
"full outside leg, flicked into midwicket"
