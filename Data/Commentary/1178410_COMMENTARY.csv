"oh, slower ball first up. Rolled his fingers over it and Parthiv was coming forward to push, gets it very high on the bat. It pops towards cover, but no fielder"
"hits a length and goes down leg with Parthiv walking across the stumps to tuck it fine. Misses it, but it'll be wide"
"good length on the stumps, flicked to deep square leg"
"oooh, gets an outside edge first ball. Another slower one, and that is what has saved Kohli with the ball dropping in front of slip"
"good length on off, clipped to the bowler's right"
"back of a length, Kohli walks across and flicks to deep midwicket"
"back of a length angling into him, misses the flick, the ball rolls off the pad"
"fullish around off, comes forward and works it to midwicket. Quick running gives them two"
"<b>big shout not given, and KKR have gone for a review</b> That looked mighty close,  pitched on a length and was turning into Kohli, who played down the wrong line and is struck on the pads. But did it turn too much? No edge, so we'll have to wait for ball tracking. And the umpire is right, it was turning too much. It's missing leg, so KKR have lost their review"
"too full on the pads, flicked to deep midwicket"
"hurried on to him a bit off a length, Parthiv stays in his crease and defends off the back foot."
"another quicker one, but Parthiv saw that. Rocked back to pull forcefully, but there is a deep midwicket"
"getting some turn is Narine, but the line is a bit off. Pitches on middle and turns to leg, tucked off his pads in the square leg region"
"yorker first up, terrific ball and unfortunately for him, Parthiv gets an inside edge that runs down to fine leg"
"quick one at 143.3 kph, gets it to bounce up a bit extra off a length and hits Parthiv on the thigh, beaten on the pull"
"beaten on the pull again. Rises up to the rib cage, and hits Parthiv before rolling to slip. He tried to pull it again"
stays legside of the ball this time and slashes it to third man. Good length angling across him and bouncing near the ribs again
another short ball that rises up to Kohli's throat. Hurried him though Kohli connected with the pull better than Parthiv has. Didn't try to hit too hard and didn't time it perfectly. Deep midwicket is there to collect
"<b>shot</b> Parthiv is expecting the short of length stuff and he gets into position to essay the slash over point perfectly, times it well and sends it to the fence. 10 runs off the over, which is unfair refleciton on Prasidh's bowling"
worked off his pads to midwicket
"<b>juggled and caught by deep square leg</b>. Tossed up a bit, and it dipped on Parthiv, who wanted to go for the legside swipe. Only gets a toe-end that sends the ball swirling into the air. Rana runs to his right from deep square leg and holds on after juggling it a bit."
"<b>misfield by Gill at deep midwicket allows four</b> too short and Kohli rocks back to pull powerfully. It was straight to Gill who lets it through his hands. Didn't bend down enough, poor effort"
"good length, tapped to long-on"
"length ball outside off, doesn't spin much, he pats it to long-on off the back foot"
angled into the pads and flicked to deep square leg
"good length on off, blocked back to the bowler"
"good length on off, coming back in sharply. Nath wants to tuck it to the onside but it hits his pad and rolls towards the bowler"
"fuller on the stumps, Nath goes a bit across and flicks it to short fine leg"
"down the track and looking to go straight over the top, but Gurney saw him coming and shortened his length, Kohli ends up inside edging to square leg"
"loses his line a bit and way down leg, he'll have to re-bowl that one"
"slower ball, nipping in from around off, Nath waits for it and flicks it to short fine leg's right"
"oooh, lovely line. In the channel outside off and on a length. This one doesn't nip back in and Kohli ends up feeling for it, but it beats his outside edge"
"oh that's another loud appeal, but no reviews left for KKR. Nips in from a length outside off and hits Nath on the knee roll. Looked closer than the one they lost their review for (against Kohli)."
<b>fetch that</b> back of a length and Nath unleashes a fierce pull off the back foot that carries all the way over the midwicket boundary
"better length, in the channel, draws the drive but he gets a thick edge that goes to third man"
"back of a length, coming in from off, raps Kohli on the pads. Too late on the flick"
<b>outside edge goes for four</b>. Prasidh's not having any luck. Gets Kohli's leading edge. Good length on off and Kohli was looking to flick it across but gets a thick edge. No slip and he gets a four for it
"good length, driven to cover"
"good length, stump to stump, Kohli gets it high on the bat while pushing towards cover"
"back of a length outside off, Nath stays beside the ball and punches to deep cover off the back foot"
"back of a lenth and gets it to bounce a bit, but Kohli rides the bounce while slashing it to short third man's left, where Rana puts in a dive but can only get a hand to the ball"
"fuller, in driving range and Kohli goes at it hard ,but straight to short cover"
"digs it in short and Kohli goes for the pull but gets a top edge. One bounce to fine leg, with Prasidh doing well to move to his right quickly and field the ball"
well bowled. Saw him come down the track and bends his back to bowl a bouncer. Nath ends up trying to upper cut it but misses
"<b>beautiful shot</b> Kuldeep tosses the first ball up, Kohli is down the track and drives him straight back and finds the fence"
punched back again but Kuldeep fields
"<b>bullet</b> tossed up too much, ends up as a half volley outside off and Kohli drills it so hard that deep extra cover can't get to it despite the ball not being too far"
"tossed up leg and middle, Kohli sweeps - a shot he doesn't play all that often - to deep square leg"
"tossed up on leg and Nath reverse sweeps, but doesn't time it well. Short third man fields"
conventional sweep this time and deep square leg tidies up
"back of a length outside off, punched with force but there is deep cover"
"back of a length outside off, Kohli goes to slash it hard, connects only with air. Ball bounced over his bat"
"slower ball outside off, Kohli clips it to long-on. Didn't read it and didn't time it well"
"good pace, sharp bouncer and Nath was very late on it, trying to pull. Whistles past his helmet"
"that is that. The Nath experiment hasn't worked at all. Nath skies it in the air off a leading edge, trying to pick it up off his legs, it goes straight up in the silly point region. Russell seems to be settling under it but Uthappa is charging in from short cover too and snaffles it right from under Russell's nose almost. Luckily no collision with Uthappa showing some nimble footwork. Smiles all around from KKR"
"back of a length on the stumps, tucked to square leg off the back foot"
"<b>Moeen shows RCB what they missed by pushing him to 4</b> down the track and to the pitch of the ball, lifts this over long-on. Gets enough to beat the man's jump there"
"fuller, driven past cover"
"flatter on the stumps, turned to square leg off the back foot and he takes off quickly for a run"
stays in his crease and punches this to deep cover from his crease. On off and spinning away
"tossed up again, Kohli takes a stride out and drives it to long-on"
"ooh better ball, dips on him and spins away, beats his attempted steer."
"short, outside off, and he punches this towards sweeper cover and picks up a couple"
"short, and wide, and he punches this again, but cannot beat Gurney fielding at short cover"
"fuller ball, and he drives it back, and Russell dives away to his left and stops it. Has a shy at the stumps as well, and Kohli had to scamper back home.<strong> Excellent stuff!</strong>"
"short, and he swings this around towards long leg. Doesn't bother to roll his wrists, and <strong>doesn't need to!</strong>"
"steps down the wicket and turns a length ball into a half-volley, flicking it away towards deep midwicket. Picks up one, and wants two but has to turn it down"
"length, outside off, and he has a waft at that, but misses. Couldn't have been too far from the alleys denoting a wide, but good enough to pass through"
"wide of the crease, full ball on off stump, and he hammers it down towards long on"
"wrong 'un, goes past the outside edge as it slants across Moeen Ali, and also misses the off stump by a whisker"
"length ball, and he has slog-swept this, into the stands over midwicket. May have been the wrong 'un again, but bowled it too close to Ali's arc"
"wrong 'un again, down the leg side, and he swings this around to the long leg region"
steps down the wicket and drives a length ball outside off towards long off
"wrong 'un, that angles across him, and he goes back and forces it towards the sweeper cover fielder"
"length ball on the pads, and he flicks this away towards backward square leg"
"short, and he goes back and pulls this towards deep midwicket"
"tossed up, around off stump, and he slogs this down the ground towards long on. Goes off the toe-end of the bat"
"short, turns into him, and he whips it away towards deep midwicket"
"inside edge, off a length ball on the stumps. He was looking to smash this through midwicket, and it runs away to the fine leg fence"
"length ball, that he works around the corner towards short fine leg"
"flighted, outside off, and he slog-sweeps this over midwicket. Good shot, because he was taking on one of the bigger boundaries at the Eden Gardens"
"length ball, flatter, and he goes back and guides this between point and short third man. Uses the pace of the ball to send it to the fence"
"length, outside off, and he looks for the cut, but misses out on contact"
"flights this outside off, and it turns away. Moeen leaves this, but it is within the tramlines"
"length, that he lofts inside out, and it drops to Russell on one bounce at long off"
"tosses this up around off and middle, and Kohli punches this down to long off"
"length ball, and he punches it down to mid off. Takes on Andre Russell's arm, and gets there to the non-striker's end. <strong>Soaks up the generous applause from the Eden Gardens</strong>"
"length ball, jags back into him with the angle, and he fails to make contact with an attempted drive towards midwicket. Goes off the pads towards third man"
"short, and he has looked to go through the onside with a whip. Takes the top edge, and flies over short third man, and goes through one-bounce for four. <strong>Lucky Kohli!</strong>"
"short ball, and he comes forward looking to get this towards midwicket. Goes off the top edge, and lands just short of long on. <strong>Two in two, where he could have been out</strong>"
"short, and Moeen looks to flick this. Takes the top edge and flies over Karthik through to third man for four"
"short again, and this time he drop-kicks it down towards deep midwicket"
"flighted, outside off, and Moeen stretches and drives this gracefully through covers. Gets it wide enough to beat Dre Russ at the long off fence"
"moves across to get close to a ball outside off, and slog-sweeps this for six. <strong>Fifty for Moeen!</strong>"
"slogs a fuller ball outside off, down towards long on. One bounce and four. <strong>What clean strking from Moeen Ali!</strong>"
"length, and he whips this over long on, <strong>for six</strong>! The fielder there, Prasidh Krishna, was a few steps in, and saw this sail over his head. Could have caught it had he been by the boundary ropes"
"dropped short, and wide. Turns away, and he will have to rebowl this one"
"length, and slaps this over long off, <strong>for another six</strong>!"
"<strong>it has worked!</strong> Slides a slower ball, tossed up invitingly, across him, and Moeen takes the bait and goes for another big hit, but gets the top edge. It's Prasidh Krishna who grabs on, and Kolkata get a big break. What a knock from Moeen Ali, though!"
"slower ball, back of the hand, but starts way down the leg side. Will have to bowl this again"
"slower ball, short, and he goes up on his toes and punches this to point"
"slower ball, but too close to leg stump, and Kohli waits on it, moves a bit inside the line, and whips this away towards long leg"
"short ball, outside off, and he hits it hard towards extra cover. Calls for two, and gets it in the end"
"angles across him, and he crunches a square drive past point. <strong>Terrific shot</strong>, as Gurney had reverted to over the wicket for that ball"
"length, and he smacks this straight back past Gurney. Doesn't bother keeping this down, and it's a <strong>pretty big six</strong>!"
"full ball, outside off, and he squeezes this away towards point"
"short ball, and he biffs this towards deep midwicket"
"length, comes back into him, and he punches this towards long on"
"short, and he has lofted this off the back foot towards wide long on. Terrific bit of timing there!"
"length, outside off, and he goes back and cuts this towards deep extra cover"
"length, outside off, and he cuts this to point. Too fast for them to get any runs"
"length, turns away after pitching on leg, and he will have to bowl this again"
"length, turns into him, tucks him up for room, and Stoinis fails to get any ball on an attempted dab towards midwicket"
"short, outisde off, and he drags this towards deep midwicket. They have run hard, and made it, as the ball was thrown at the striker's end"
"short, and he has got a hold of this. Just lofts this, stand-and-deliver, over long on. <strong>Proper slog for these death overs!</strong>"
"outside off, and an extra cover drive, on bent knee. <strong>Ah, classic Kohli!</strong>"
"short, and he whips this towards deep midwicket, and will pick up two. <strong>Takes him to 92</strong>"
"full ball, on off stump, and he slaps this down towards deep midwicket"
"full, outisde off, and he drives this towards long off. Russell gets to it, but cannot stop it"
"full ball, outside off, and he drives this to extra cover. Won't get two that he desperately wants"
"short ball, and he swings this around to long leg, <strong>where Kuldeep Yadav makes a mess of his attempt to stop it</strong>! Overran the ball, as it spun away to his right"
"length, and he has picked this up, and deposited it some 12 rows back over long on!"
"length, and he lofts this towards wide long off. They go for just one run. <em>Kohli wants that century of his</em>"
"full toss, and he has flicked this away towards long leg. Kuldeep makes a hash of the attempted stop, and Kohli leaps in the air and takes off his helmet. <strong>Arms aloft...the king is back on top of his game</strong>! He's got there in just 57 balls, and yet it hasn't been his most fluent IPL century ever, surely?"
"length, and he has flicked this towards deep midwicket, where Shubman Gill comepletes the catch"
<b>dropped by Stoinis at first slip</b> Perfect outswinger - was Steyn ever away? (and why was he away) - and Stoinis clangs it. Flew to his right at catchable height. Steyn has a smile. Would have been the perfect comeback. Lynn had pushed at it with static feet
oooh now past the left-hander's outside edge. Length ball in the channel and Narine is feeling for it
"pacy ball on the pads and Narine tickles it very fine. No fielder there, so boundary. That came off the pad actually, so it's leg-byes"
"angled across, well wide of the stumps but inside the tramlines. 143 kph, left alone by Narine"
"good length on the stumps, pushed to cover and they set off for a quick single. Narine has to hurry but makes it"
"<b>Steyn has got his man this time</b>. That seemed to come slower off the pitch, though not sure if it was a slower ball by Steyn. Lynn pushed at it too early, and pops a simple catch to mid-off. Steyn is pumped, and the comeback does have a wicket in his first over, even if a wicket off the first ball was missed"
"<b>stand and deliver</b>. Narine steps away, clears his front leg and flat-bats it powerfully straight past the bowler"
shortens his length and uses his pace to get it to bounce at an uncomfortable height. Narine wants to slash but the ball bounces well above his bat
"another swing and a miss. Good length again by Saina going across. Narine was stepping away to swing for the fences, misses"
"backing away again to give himself room and pull through the legside, but Saini follows him and Narine ends up mis-timing his pull to midwicket"
"back of a length outside off again, Gill - everyone who wanted him at 3 must be pleased - rises up on his toes to pat it down"
"back of a length outside off, Gill wants to pull but ends up mis-timing to mid-on"
"Narine connects well on this one. Follows his strategy of giving himself room and this one is a bit fuller, so he's able to punch it powerfully through cover"
"and immediately Steyn shortens his length a bit. The back of length ball that is bouncing a bit has had Narine in trouble. He's stepped away to swing through extra cover again, but the ball beats bat"
action replay of the previous ball. Back of a length angling across. Narine makes contact with only air while clearing his front leg to go hard at the ball
"nails this one. Was expecting the short one and set himself up for it, Steyn's line was too straight, giving Narine more time to go back and connect with the pull"
"slashed for four at third man, but he wasn't in control entirely. Back of a length outside off and Narine clears the front leg again has a go at it, wasn't too far from third man but hit hard enough that he had no chance - either at catching or stopping it"
"good comeback with a slower ball, length outside off. Narine wants to go hard again but too early and doesn't connect"
"full outside off, driven from the crease but he can't beat extra cover"
"beauty. Pacy and in the channel, beats his outside edge. Gill was feeling for it, looking to punch"
"mis-field by Kohli at mid-off allows one. Full outside off, driven to mid-off, Kohli fumbles"
slower ball to Narine again outside off. he's got a one-track strategy of clearing front leg and going hard - either legside or offside. Ball beats bat that time
"<b>and Narine's iffy stay ends with a short ball</b>. Saini dug this in short, got it to rise up to his face. Narine with his front leg cleared, wanted to swat it towards midwicket, but he's too late on the ball and has taken his eyes off it too. Gets a top edge that loops up and settles into Parthiv's gloves"
"slashed hard, the outside edge flies at one bounce to third man"
"full ball outside off, driven gently to mid-off"
"good length on the stumps, he moves across and clips it to deep square leg. Great timing on that, and it's racing away, but Chahal sprints after it and slides and saves the boundary, pulling the ball in just before the fence"
"pacy one, shaping away a bit outside off, Uthappa comes on the front foot to defend, the ball takes a thick inside edge to square leg"
"length ball outside off and swatted past extra cover. Not exactly where he wanted to send it. He was aiming for midwicket, but was late on it, still managed to get a chunky meat of the bat behind it and the ball goes to the boundary"
"doesn't give him room this time, straighter on the stumps, patted back to the bowler"
"<b>Kohli almost clangs it but holds on at the second attempt</b> Gill hasn't looked comfortable during his stay, this is a yorker length ball outside off, he wants to drive it through the offside, but ends up toe-ending it. Flies towards mid-off, and it looks like it might be going over Kohli, but he sticks out a hand over his head and grabs the ball. Not cleanly and it bounces out, but he does well with great presence of mind to hold on to it near his waist"
"good length, steered to gully"
angled across him and Rana is happy to watch it go through
angled across again and Rana lets it go through again! They can't afford too many of those
"and this one is closer to off-stump, Rana wants to steer it fine, ends up missing it"
and <b>another leave</b>! Does Rana know the asking rate is above 10? He lets it go through outside off again
"too full in the slot, and he carves it over cover to find the boundary"
"good length on off, gentle pace, clipped to midwicket"
"fuller on middle and leg, flicked to deep square leg"
"back of a length angled across, dabs it down to third man"
"full outside off, he walks across and clips to mid-on"
"full on the fourth stump, pushed back to the bowler"
"length outside off, pushed to cover"
<b>lovely shot</b> too full outside off and he stayed in his crease to punch-drive it over cover. Great timing on that one
"too short and he wants to set himself up to pull it hard but mistimes it, bounces to long-on"
"pacier one, good length outside off, jabbed back to the bowler"
"swing and a miss. Siraj keeps this wider outside off, Uthappa is tempted into an expansive drive, but ends up missing it"
"fuller, punched to cover"
"lovely line, in the channel outside off and Uthappa is beaten on the outside edge, trying to punch the ball"
"fuller outside off, steered to gully and he sets off for a rash run. Sent back and the fielder misses the direct hit. Would have been gone if he had hit. Had almost given up trying to get back"
"slower bouncer, Rana has to innovate after setting himself up to bash through off and he tries to upper cut. Misses the ball"
"good length outside off, steered to backward point"
"full and angled across outside off, goes for the big booming drive through cover, but the ball sneaks past the outside edge."
"length ball on off, dabbed to third man"
"good length outside off, goes across and works this to backward square leg"
"<b>Shot</b>. That's much better. Full on the stumps, Uthappa gives himself room and executes a textbook extra cover drive, bisects the field"
"good comeback by Siraj, 138kph back of a length outside off and this track has bounce from that length. Uthappa stays in his crease to cut it but the ball goes over his bat"
"that's a bad ball. Tried the short one again, seeing that Uthappa has dealt with the fuller one comfortably. Uthappa moved across his stumps, this one flies down leg side and wide of Parthiv too. Five wides"
goes back to being back of a length outside off and Uthappa can't connect with the steer. Good carry from that length again
"oooh, just past the outside edge. For all the flack he's got, Siraj is doing well. Brings this into Uthappa and he plays inside the line, caught on the crease a bit. The ball goes past the outside edge"
gives himself room again but Siraj keeps it outside off and Uthappa can only carve it to third man
"spoils the over with a bad last ball, long hop that Rana picks up from outside off and pulls to the midwicket boundary"
"length ball, and he goes back and punches it with the turn towards extra cover"
"short, and he swings this around towards long leg. <strong>One-bounce four for Rana!</strong>"
"tries the reverse sweep, gets the top edge, but this has flown <em>just </em>over short third man's head, for four!"
"reverse sweep again. Set himself too early, and Chahal fired it a bit shorter, forcing him to go square towards backward point"
cuts a length ball away towards point. Has to refuse the single
"fired wide outside off, and turns further away. Will have to rebowl this one"
"wide outside off, and Uthappa goes for a reverse sweep, but misses. Should have been wide anyway, though Chahal contests the decision"
"fired flatter, and he gets it off his pads towards the square on the leg side. Refuses a single, and Rana has come way down the pitch. Patel's return is fired to Chahal, who cannot collect it. <strong>Reprieve for the non-striker!</strong>"
"length, outside off, and he has got the top edge as he looks to bunt this towards midwicket. It flies towards third man, and Chahal comes running in, but <strong>cannot complete the catch</strong>! Just lands short of him"
"length, wide outside off, and he slashes this over point. <strong>Good shot</strong>, nearly carried over the fence on the full!"
"length ball, slower, angles away, and he fails to make contact with an intended slog across the line"
"yorker, and he makes room, but can only hit it straight down the wicket towards long off"
"length, and he has picked this up, swung it towards backward square leg, <strong>where the catch is completed</strong>! Might have been a change of pace, scrambled seam in fact, and he ended up getting more of the edge of the bat. The intent was right, but he's been put out of his pain"
"length, angles across him and he dabs it down towards third man. That looks headed for four, but Klaasen comes diving away to his right and gets his hands to it. Seems to have done enough to get rid of the ball, just before his body hits the rope. A tough one to call. <strong>He might have just done enough to save two...</strong>"
"length, fired outside off stump, and he rifles this towards extra cover"
"length, towards leg stump, and he sweeps this fine. Gets it to the left of backward square leg"
"shorter, and quicker, and he bumps this towards backward square leg, to hand the strike back to Dre Russ"
"fired outisde off, and Russell lets it pass. Goes just beyond the tramlines"
"tossed up outside off, and <strong>he swings this inside out</strong>...it's that slashing shot of his, and it carries over extra cover. Seems to have hurt his shoulder and wrist as he struck that"
"wrong 'un, fired outside off, and stays within the tramlines. Russell leaves it"
"fired wide outside off, and Russell chases it, but misses out on contact. Would have been close to being called a wide, but he gets away with this"
"length, angles across Rana, who punches this towards backward point"
moves across to the leg side and slashes a length ball just outside off stump. <strong>That went like a bullet through the point region!</strong>
"short, moves into him, and cramps him for room. He tries to slash this away, but cannot lay bat on ball"
"short, and he has top-edged this. Klaasen runs in towards his left from fine leg, and <strong>grasses this</strong>! Fast ball, and he didn't know much about where it went, looking to go over long leg, but it fell somewhere between fine leg and backward square leg"
"length, angles across him, and he cuts this towards backward point"
"slower ball, outside off, and Russell cannot get to it. Waited for it, but it never really arrived. Sinks to his knees momentarily, as Saini completes a good over"
"length, and he cannot get this away. Drops it back towards the bowler"
"length, and he looks to slog sweep, but gets an inner edge. The ball trickles down towards Chahal to his left"
"tossed up outside off, and he drives this towards extra cover. Steyn stops it with his boot, and gets some support from his teammate in pulling the ball back"
"tossed up outside off, and outside the tramlines. Russell leaves..."
"length ball, and he gets the toe-end as he looks to swing this towards midwicket. It goes all the way over long on, though. Fetches this from outside off"
"tossed up, and he has gone <strong>straight, and far, and wide</strong>..."
"length, on off stump, and he <strong>has clubbed this over long on</strong>. Hat-trick of sixes, and KKR are making a fist of this. Can they pull it off again?"
"length ball, and he has hit this down the wicket past long on. <strong>Really</strong> well timed by Rana"
"length, moves away from him. Rana tries to make room by moving away to his leg side, and ends up needing to stretch to make contact. Misses..."
"length, and he has swung this over midwicket off the back foot. <strong>What an emphatic stroke to get to fifty!</strong>"
"full toss, outside off, and he has <strong>deposited this over midwicket again</strong>. Looks for a no-ball for height, but that hasn't been given"
"length, and he has got a hold of this too, but it goes on a bounce to deep midwicket"
"short, fast, and angles in to him, and he leaves"
"length ball, that he lofts towards mid off, and they take on Steyn's arm. He has a shy at the striker's end, but misses. <strong>Russell could have been gone</strong>!"
"short, and wide. Too wide, outside off, and Russell lets this go"
"short, and he backs away and slaps this past point. <strong>What a shot again!</strong>"
"length, and he goes inside out. <strong>That has gone a long way over extra cover!</strong>"
"slower ball, but wide outside off. Russell chases it, and misses out on contact, on one knee as well. Too wide, I'm afraid!"
"length, slower ball, outside off, and he has a swing...<strong>and he can miss too</strong>! Almost fell over...I think he wanted to cream this over to Dhaka!"
"length, and he has hammered this off the toe-end towards long on"
"length, outside off, and he has sliced this towards mid off. There's a direct hit at Russell's end as they go for the single, and he <em>just about</em> makes it"
"length, towards off stump, and he drives this but cannot beat cover, inside the ring"
"length, and he has hit this over long off. No more than a push off the front foot, on bent knee"
"length, and he has pushed this beyond Moeen Ali at short cover, and it is fielded by the sweeper cover fielder to his left. They amble through for two"
moves across and hits a length ball <strong>over long on for six</strong>! Rana is striking the ball well now
"fuller, angles across him, and he plays outside the line of this in trying to whack it over midwicket"
"length, and he goes inside out, and gets it over extra cover. One-bounce four"
"full ball, and hits him on the pads. Runs all the way down towards fine leg, but he wasn't playing a shot there, so no leg byes on offer. <strong>Good ball!</strong>"
"tries another full ball on the pads, but Russell walks across and it will be called a wide. <em>No margin for error on the on-side</em>"
"full toss, outside off, and he crashes this towards cover. <strong>Moeen Ali stops this! RCB inch ever closer!</strong>"
"short ball, and he ducks under this one. Well bowled. Russell probably thought this was going to go down the leg side, but it follows him and is a dot ball! <strong>Gold dust!</strong>"
"short ball, and he has struck this over midwicket for a <strong>huge six</strong>!"
"full, on off stump, and he has hammered this straight down the pitch over long off. Hits the sightscreen, as Eden Gardens rises to greet his <strong>fity...off just 21 balls</strong>!"
"yorker attempted, and he still drop-kicks this straight over the bowler, and just over long off"
"goes for a full ball, and Rana moves across to the off side. <strong>No wide given!</strong> Rana tries a sweep, but misses"
"full ball, and he gets an inside edge towards long leg. <strong>Russell takes the single and refuses the second</strong>"
"length, and he has <strong>hit this over long on for six</strong>!"
"full ball, and he looks to go over long off, but misses. <strong>That could be the game, right there!</strong>"
"length, and he smacks this towards midwicket. There's a throw rifled in at the non-striker's end, and he's walking off. Russell is gone, as Moeen Ali whips the bails off. <strong>What a knock from Russell here, this time in a losing cause</strong>"
"Rana bangs a length ball for six over long off, but <strong>RCB win the game</strong>"
