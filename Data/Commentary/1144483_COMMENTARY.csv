"Roy is onto the front foot and off the mark straight away, pushing through extra cover for a quick single"
"<b>Tahir strikes!</b> Faf's tactical twist has brought immediate dividends, but it's Bairstow who falls first. He lunges onto the front foot to one that grips and turns just far enough to kiss the outside edge on the way through to de Kock, and Tahir's off in celebration! Head aloft, arms spread wide, and no-one can catch him. Pure joy, and England are 1 for 1!"
"wrong 'un from Tahir, but Root picks it and presents bat and pad close together to keep it out"
"<b>inside edge</b> this time, and Tahir finds more grip on another googly. But Root puts bat to ball, and keeps it out"
"quicker, and flatter through the air and Root is half forward to push it back to the bowler"
and a tight end to the over as Tahir hones in on Root's off stump and a fourth googly in a row is tucked into the leg side
"there's no loosener from Ngidi as he finds immediate bite and lift outside off. But Roy does well to ride it, fending to point"
"sharp bounce once again from Ngidi, and a touch of seam movement back in to the right hander too, but it's nudged off the hip and down to fine leg for one"
"Root is up on his tippy-toes to get on top of another rising delivery from Ngidi, pressing it firmly to extra cover"
"fuller, and straighter, Root aiming his drive right at mid off"
"<b>laced through cover!</b> Ngidi aimed fuller still, but this came out as a long half volley, and Root was into position with minimalist grace to put it away"
"that's a better length from Ngidi, and there's a hint of inside edge as Root clips a seamer down to fine leg"
"full, straight and Root is forward to push a single wide of mid on"
"Roy sets himself for a huge hoick down the ground, but he doesn't get all of it and the ball ricochets off Tahir's boot, off the umpire, and into space for a single"
flicked straight of midwicket for one more
"too short from Tahir, but he's not punished for it as Roy's cut finds point"
"Roy stays deep in his crease once again, nurdling a single through square leg"
"swept this time, but now the shot finds short fine leg and it's another dot"
"tennis-ball bounce outside off as Roy thrusts out at it, the ball flying through the vacant gully region and down to third man"
"<b>beaten outside off</b> by one that holds its line outside off. He's been seaming them in, but this one just kept going outside off to beat Root's edge"
"this one does seam in a shade, and Root is back and across to defend to cover"
"<b>boom!</b> Too short from Ngidi, and Root reads the length nice and early to get himself into position to pull to midwicket. It's the long boundary, but there's a big gap to aim for too"
"<b>just short!</b> Ngidi aims fuller and wider, and Root has to stretch into a drive and can't keep it down. Fortunately for him, the ball lands just short of Duminy, who has been moved into gully"
"Ngidi keeps things tight on off stump to finish, and Root is content just to keep it out"
<b>too short</b> and Roy hops back to hammer a cut well in front of square
"Tahir loops this one up a little slower, and much fuller. Roy is forward to tap it to long on for one"
"and so Root goes for the reverse sweep, picking the gap nicely. But Rassie's after it, and hauls the ball in inside the rope"
"<b>swept hard!</b> An orthodox stroke from Root this time, and he's helped by some creaky fielding from Amla at short fine, who falls over the ball as it passes him but can't stop it"
"<b>chipped in the air!</b> But safe. It was a full toss too, and Root might have put this anywhere. Perhaps he was taken a little by surprise, and does at least manage to pop it <i>just</i> over a leaping Rabada at midwicket"
"speared in flat and fast to finish, and Root defends"
"too straight, and he's neatly clipped off the hip and through midwicket for a brace"
"rising off a length, on or around off stump, and Roy pushes him to midwicket"
"Ngidi's lost his radar with this one, offering a gentle leg-stump length delivery that Roy helps on its way down to fine leg"
"the riposte from South Africa's big quick is to dig one in halfway down, but the bouncer balloons up way too high and is called wide"
"sliced in the air through gully! Where is the fielder? Ngidi aims fuller, and wider, and Roy holds nothing back in the drive - but there's no-one there to catch it"
Ngidi finds that splice-jarring length and Root can't quite get on the front foot as he defends this one
"Root is one the drive once again, but Markram hares after it to keep them to two"
"<b>and he's punched down the ground!</b> Gosh, this is a lightning quick outfield. Rabada aimed full to start, but this was nothing more than a push from Roy. Once it beat the bowler, and mid off, it was four"
"Rabada pulls his length back to stop another drive, and Roy defends"
"shorter still from Rabada, but this one is aimed wide of off and Roy shoulders arms"
"another steepler on a fifth stump line, and Roy is at pains to pull his hands out of harm's way as he leaves well alone"
"Roy sets himself to drive again, but he's not quite to it and pokes his shot uppishly towards Phehlukwayo at mid off"
"indipper from Rabada, at a decent clip too - 90mph. But Roy is forward with bat and pad together to defend to point"
"Root is drawn into an injudicious prod outside off by a cross-seamed delivery from Ngidi that holds its line outside off, beating the bat"
"neat follow-up from Ngidi, a slower ball. It cuts in off the track. Root defending to leg with a hint of inside edge"
"<b>crisp!</b> Ngidi has found tennis-ball bounce, but Roy just stands up on this one - another cutter - and checks his drive, on the up, to collect four more"
"Roy is up on his toes again to spank this short one towards point, where Duminy parries and takes the sting out of the shot, so it's just the one"
"and now it's Root standing tall, and punching to cover. But he pings the field"
"Ngidi offers a little width outside off, but again Root picks out the cover fielder with his forcing stroke"
"shaping in towards off stump, and Roy is half forward to press to cover"
"and Roy <b>brings up England's fifty</b> with a neat little clip into the leg side, finding just enough room for a quick single"
"Rabada pulls his length back at 87mph, Root jumping to defend into the leg side"
"<b>short, and pulled!</b> Root has looked in absolutely top form on the pull today, and even though he was a little rushed by Rabada's pace he controlled the stroke and placed it just so to collect four"
"Rabada adjusts his line, outside off, and Root presses firmly to cover"
good awareness from the batsmen in the middle as Root pushes a fuller one towards Tahir at mid on and they sense the opportunity for a quick single
"and his line is just a little too straight to start, Root shuffling across to pick up two more through midwicket"
"that's a better line from Pretorius, in the channel outside off and Root punches defensively to cover"
whipped off his legs and down to fine leg for one more
"<b>massive swipe</b> from Roy, but it's a cross-seamed delivery from Pretorius and it beats the outside edge of the stroke"
"surprise bouncer from Pretorius, and Roy can't take full advantage as he pulls to fine leg for one"
"again it's short, and now it's Root who pulls out to deep midwicket for one"
"decent line angled into off stump, and pushed to cover"

"flicked off the pads, Root keeps things ticking along"
rising up onto the toes to thump into the off side once more
"<B>inswinging full toss!</B> That was a dicey delivery ... an inside-edge squirts through third man, that would have been pretty tight if he'd missed!"
"bending the knee, onto the front foot, pushed to mid-off"
stretching forward to push down the track
"hopping onto the back foot, fencing a lifter down to third man"
"leaning forward, crunched through the line, short cover intercepts another well-timed stroke"
"rolls the fingers on a full length outside off, and pressed up to mid-off"
"too short, too wide, <B>Roy doesn't miss out on those!</B> Slammed with disdain in front of square, a huge wholehearted pivot of the body, stiff forearms. Wallop"
"better length, tighter line, solid block"
"back of a length, pulled in front of square"
"nip off the seam, <strong>thuds into the unmentionables!</strong> Roy takes a breather at square leg as his reassembled parts drop back into place... he'll live, all in a day's work"

hustles onto the front foot
angled defence into the covers
"back of a length, <strong>that's supreme placement!</strong> A short-arm jab, just guided through the gap at midwicket, but with timing that purrs off the bat. England are beginning to warm to their task now"

"outside off, dabbled to third man with a late flick of the wrists"

"rolls the fingers on a full-length delivery, looking to clip through the gap at midwicket but can't create the angle"
"firm block back down the track, so firm in fact that the umpire is sent sprawling as Phehlukwayo gets a hand on the ball and deflects it towards his feet"
flogged across the line to deep midwicket
"<B>up and over!</B> Here goes Roy, with his trademark uppercut over the covers, sets his base, extends the arms through the ball, and dumps it to the rope with aplomb!"
"works the single to keep things moving, out to deep square leg"

"tucked to the leg side, <B>up comes Roy's fifty</b>... his fourth in a row in ODIs, and he's in some sumptuous form at the moment... EDIT: Actually, it's a leg bye. Stand down! Either way, that will be <B>drinks</B>"

"banged in short, a wild front-foot slap, <B>top-edge to the deep-set mid-off</B>, and there's the breakthrough! Roy will be furious with himself, the third time in four innings he's given it away when set for something special. That said, what a hand he's played after those anxious early exchanges..."
"outside off, Morgan allows himself a sighter"
"<strong>one sighter will suffice!</strong> Stretching onto the front foot, and <strong>leathered through the covers!</strong> The skipper means business!"
"open-faced steer and <B>Root is gone as well!</B> Rabada's length is ideal, just enough width to lure Root into an indiscretion, and his extra pace ensures he's not in control of the stroke. Duminy at backward point guzzles the chance in his midriff, and well ... it's game on again!"

"<B>no faffing around from Morgan!</B> Gallivanting out of his crease, a lofted slap over wide long-off!"

"floaty slower ball, Stokes gives it the big heave-ho... and fails to connect! He chides himself for missing out"
"goes for the reverse-pull - <b>slapped straight to backward point!</b> Stokes was ticking, but he's tocked his last for today! Throws back the head in frustration, though he walks off to a round of applause. A fine knock, but we may only know how good it was come the end of the day..."

"on the money once more, forcing de Kock to create the angle if he wants the run. Turns another leg-stump ball to square leg"
"flicked off the hip once more, this time finds enough of a gap to scamper the single but that's another tight over"
"on the back foot, flicked to midwicket with a late turn of the wrists"
"off-stump line, back of a length, pressed to mid-off"
"fuller length on the toes, clipped with intent but short midwicket's hands are true. England looking sharp in the field"
"too short this time, the slip has just been removed, and de Kock gets away with a <strong>calculated slash through third man</strong>. Buttler dived but never got close."
"clipped behind square, injecting pace on the ball with good wristwork, and Bairstow scoots round at fine leg to cut it off"
"leaning forward, pushed to mid-off"
"thumped with not too much power into the covers, more sharp groundwork to intercept"
rides the bounce outside off with<strong> silky-soft hands</strong>. Two slips in place but he undercuts them both
"tapped to the off side, tight line and length"
"slower ball from Archer, rolling the fingers at point of delivery and taking oodles of pace off a full-length floater"
<B>bouncer into the grille!</B> That was self-evidently not a slower ball! Amla climbed into the pull but that bit him like a cobra! <B>Proper pace from nowhere!</b> And out comes the physio to check him over
"outside off, full and fast, left alone with a shoulder of the arms"
"outside off, full length, met with a full face into the covers"
"tight to the hips, back of a length, offering no width whatsoever as de Kock is squared up and struck amidships"
"<B>this time he gets his width!</B> A shimmy to leg, to encourage Woakes to stray to the off, and he gets his cuttable slot-ball. Duly slotted to the fence"
"tighter line and length, de Kock reverts to solid blockage"
"up on the toes,<strong> fizzed through to the rope off the back foot</strong>. That's supreme batting, hanging on the leg stump, a touch outside his crease, and making Woakes think again about his restrictive line"
"full and into the toes, crunched to mid-on. A good tussle"
"back of a length outside off, punched to cover"
"full length cutter, eased through the covers for Plunkett to hunt it down in the deep"
"dabbed into the off side, open face to third man"
"sizzling through to the keeper! A <strong>91mph bouncer, </strong>, de Kock sways, hoping for the wide, but it's not forthcoming"
"<strong>an ambitious mow through the line!</strong> Loses his shape on impact, as mid-on tidies up"
"pulls the length back to the right-hander, who defends squarely in front of his stumps. It's a tussle out there!"
"tight to the legs once more, back of a length, clipped to square leg"
"on the back foot, flinched into the covers, can't find the angle to pierce the off-side ring"
"full length, cracked off the front foot to point. Nothing much in this pitch at present, but the shots aren't quite there for the taking"
"<B>excellent work from Roy at backward point!</B> Loose this time from Woakes, too much width on the back foot, but a stretch to his left stopped the runs"
"<B>elegance!</B> Bend that front knee, caress the covers as if they were made of satin."
"back of a length, wicket-to-wicket line. Patted back to the bowler. More cut-and-thrust in that over"
chopped to point
eased out to the man at deep cover
"<B>crunched through the covers!</B> Sweet timing, using Archer's pace as a weapon against him, lovely straight blade through the line!"
"<B>now that's a riposte!</B> Slightly wider line, extra bounce and nip off the seam, Markram is lured into a back-foot push with an open face, and Root at a wide solitary slip makes a sharp chance look simple!"
"very full, outside off, that's a lovely sighter for Faf, who places bat on ball and strokes a sumptuous four through the covers"
"shorter, into the ribs, stabbed down into the deck. Successful over for Archer"
"full face of the bat, vertical stance, eased to the on-side"
"on the pads, attempted flick, and a very loud guttural Afrikaaans 'Arrrgghhhhkkk!' rings across The Oval as he fails to make proper contact"

"back of a length, nurdled to the leg side"
"banging out a solid line, just back of a length, fenced to cover"
"banged in short, top-edged, Moeen steadies himself, <B>gone!</B> That is a huge scalp, and Archer is showing his value to this team from the outset. Lured the skipper into a pull, but the ball just kept getting big on him, spiralled off his eyebrows, and Moeen at fine leg had an age to contemplate his existence before pulling it off very coolly in the end..."
"tight line on a full length, stabbed down to the cordon off the line of off stump"
nurdled to the leg side
"<strong>that has utterly fizzed!</strong> Climbing viciously past the batsman, Buttler parries with an upstretched glove, and Bairstow swoops round to complete the intercept at slip"
"outside off, tight line and length, swatted to cover"
"on the toes, flicked to fine leg"
"leg stump line, met with a solid stab to mid-on"
"outside off, a slowly turning legbreak, straightening into a gentle back-cut to point"
"<B>got him, or has he?!</B> What on earth has gone on here? England think they've bowled him! It's flicked the bat on the reverse sweep from outside leg, <B>thumped the outside of the stump and triggered the zing bails</B> but the bails haven't come off, and the ball has gone for four!"

"South Africa, a touch chastened by that let-off, seem coolly intent for now to work the singles..."
"<B>well, hello, scratch that!</B> If it strays into the slot, it will be slotted! A booming full-faced monstering high over long-on!"
dabbed into the leg side
"tossed towards the blockhole, nudged to midwicket"
"<B>big legbreak!</B> Held back the pace that time, let it bite the pitch outside off as de Kock leant back for the cut and had to hastily adjust"

"<B>nutmegged!</B> A tough over for Buttler is made even worse as this one scuttles a touch outside off, eludes the edge and fizzes through his legs!"
"slog-sweep, good connection, gathered in the deep"
"back and across, into the crease, tucked to the leg side"
"back-of-a-length legbreak, tentatively forward to block"
tied down outside off by another lifter off the deck. Defended back to the bowler
"r-e-a-a-a-a-l-l-y slow through the air, dipping late in the crease, forcing vdD to make the running, and he opts instead for a determined none-shall-pass stab of the bat"
"fine bowling, tight, controlled, defended back to the bowler on a solid line and length. The rate is creeping a touch ..."
"on the back foot, knocked into the off side, another single to the cause"
"reverse-sweep, and <B>he's nailed that one!</B> That's the way to relieve the pressure, backward point dives but that was through him like a dose of something nasty"
worked to the leg side
"driven on the up, bobbles through to wide mid-off. If he'd timed that better, he'd have been in trouble..."
"fencing forward, a bit hungry-hippo-esque with back-toe firmly anchored in the crease"
"swept again, but can't beat backward point. England's spinners are going a decent job at the moment"
"swept down to fine leg, good connection and placement"
"rushed into the cut, beaten outside off. 'Ayeee-aah!' is the cry from QDK, which sums it up"
eased down to long-on

"floated up, dipping as RvdD goes for the reverse-sweep, nearly over-balances but gets it away square"
"beats the bat, and Buttler nudges off the bails... <b>They are going to check with the TV umpire</b>, though de Kock seems to have had his back foot securely anchored behind the line. Yup, no worries for the batsman there, on we go"
"floated up from round the wicket, steered behind point with an open face"
"flatter, close to the stumps and he attempts to force a cut, picks out backward point this time"
"floated up on the stumps, worked against the turn for one into the midwicket region"

punched through the covers coming forward
"golden arm strikes! <b>Short and flogged down the throat of deep backward square leg!</b> Plunkett does the job, England's middle-overs money-maker...

pushed through and blocked
"oh my... <b>Lofted straight to long-off!</b> Dumb from Duminy, and he's heading for the changing room, gifting a catch to Stokes, who ambled in a few yards and took it safely! Seems like the bat turned in his hands, maybe he was aiming squarer towards extra cover... But he's taken on Moeen and taken himself down!"
pushed through and tapped down
shortish and Pretorius is off the mark with a pull
"<b>this could be tight at the non-striker's end!</b> Yes, Pretorius is inches short...! Pitched up, 132kph/82mph and slapped towards deep extra cover, looks like Pretorius called him back for the second - but a good throw from Stokes left them struggling, Morgan gathered well and Robert's your mother's brother!"

"misreads the googly again, pinned on the back foot, not given - but England <b>review</b>, he was right back on his stumps and this could be close. Except for the fact it has pitched <i>just</i> outside leg! So we won't need ball-tracking, and <b>England lose their review</b>"

"short of a length around off stump, defended stoutly"
poked into the covers for a scamper single
"<B>Ben Stokes, that is absolute fifth!</B> Absolutely <I>leathered</I> through deep midwicket ... and Stokes somehow launched himself horizontally towards the rope, timing his jump like a mortar from its tube, and clinging onto a certain six, in his outstretched, reverse-cupped, right hand! My God, that is an utter, utter worldy! If Alisson got a mitt to a screamer like that in Madrid on Saturday and tipped it over the bar, we would be talking about it for years..."
tapped to cover
patted into the off side
tapped down the ground... the ground is in a post-nonsense state of shock ...
"outside off, flat-batted into the covers"

"decent line, back of a length, fenced to the leg side"
"outside off, on the back foot, Roy slips round effortlessly at point to gather. He's been immense as well today, to be fair"
"on the back foot, nudged to cover. It's the last rites out there now ..."

tapped into the covers
"banged in short, <B>pulled through the leg side and Morgan can't cling on!</B> He stretched high to his left, but did he fully commit? I suspect he may have had his hurty finger in mind there ... discretion is better part of valour at this stage of the match and tournament"
"middle-and-leg line, tapped back to the bowler in his followthrough"
"rolls the fingers on a full-length delivery, slides down the leg side"
nudged into the covers
"easy single to the off-side, the crowd are in sing-song mood now ... 'Moeen Ali' is the object of their chants for now"

pushed into the covers but straight at the man
"width outside off, a back-footed slap at thin air"
"<B>crikey, there's one for the memory banks!</B> A slower-ball from Plunkett, picked like the ripest of cherries, and plopped into the stands with a sublime followthrough for a fine crowd catch at long-on!"
"beauty! A cross-seamer, zipping over the bails via a thin deflection on the back leg"
"poked into the covers, a sprawling stop and a harum-scarum stretch for the crease"
"canny deflection, opening the face outside off, and a thick edge down through third man"
"short, slapped, <B>inches short of midwicket!</B>"
"on the hip, pings past the sprawling Buttler. South Africa still scrapping for the scraps..."
"<B>short again, pulled again, held at deep midwicket again!</b> It's Plunkett this time, stooping forward to cling on in both mitts. That was a solid connection, but the man was well placed and England's fielding has been the most composed aspect of their play today."
"<B>edged, gone, Stokes seals it!</B> A thick nick to slip, Joe Root puts the cap on an outstanding fielding display, reaching to his right to intercept, and England wrap it up with 10.1 overs to spare!"
