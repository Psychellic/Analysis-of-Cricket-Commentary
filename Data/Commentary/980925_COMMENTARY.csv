"length ball that shapes away from outside off, left alone"
punched off the front foot to backward point
"gets some lift off the deck again, Vijay plays it with soft hands to short cover"
"good, clean strike down the ground. Length ball angled into middle from wide of the crease, Vijay lofts it down the ground over mid-on. Nice, high elbow as the ball met bat. Extension of a defensive stroke. Flew off the bat"
tucks it towards mid-on for a quick single
"nicely behind the line of that incoming length ball on middle, punched to mid-on"
"lucky to get away with that. Angling into the pads, flicked well, but straight to short fine leg"
"drifting down leg, clipped into the gap at deep backward square leg"
"closes the bat face early, the ball shapes away late, gets a leading edge over the vacant gully region"
"nice and full on off stump, Vohra plays back to a delivery he could have lunged forward, defended nonetheless"
"not entirely off the middle, but a lucky break for Vohra. Looked to work it past midwicket, got a leading edge, just eluded the cover fielder"
turned to mid-on for a quick single
"drifting in from round the stumps, pushed to cover"
"flatter one on middle and leg, hit on the pad as he looks to work it wide of midwicket"
"drifter again from wide of the crease, Vohra way too early into the sweep, hit high on the pad"
"skids back in, but down leg side, good take by Uthappa"
"tossed up on middle, Vohra gets a thick inside edge towards deep midwicket. He looked to go a lot straighter"
"classic Vijay punch. Just a hint of width, and it was enough for him to find the gap between cover and point"
"nearly through. Played outside the line of the ball, perhaps for the turn when it straightened"
"extra bounce this time on middle, Vohra whips it uppishly towards deep square leg"
"stops on him, Vohra checks his shot at the last moment, lands short of Morkel on his followthrough"
"makes room to ease it over the vacant slip cordon, Morkel follows him and cramps him for room, Vohra somehow upper cuts it towards third man. The throw is parried off Uthappa's gloves and they steal and overthrow"
"excellent catch at deep midwicket. It was a length ball angling in, Vohra flicked it well over the infield, but it was almost as if he forgot there was a man there. Shakib ran around a few yards to his right, dived to complete a good low catch"
"slower one on middle and leg, 130kph, turns it towards square leg"
"crunching cover drive to start off. Couldn't have asked for a better delivery first up, could he? In the slot, and Marsh leans forward to essay a classic"
"drifting into middle and leg, whipped to deep midwicket, Vijay wanted the second, Marsh wasn't keen"
"shapes to cut, but the ball spins back in sharply to hit the inner half of his bat, rolls to midwicket"
gets to the pitch of the ball and turns it to long-on
"too short, and punished! Vijay is quick to pick the length, rocks back and slaps behind point. Pure timing"
"eased wide of square leg, slight misfield there by Umesh, but he recovers well"
"tossed up on middle, worked into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on. The boundary riders were late to get off the blocks. Credit to Vijay for making the second run a possibility"
nicely behind the line of that incoming length delivery on middle
"short, and pulled away in front of square. No chance for Shakib, who was running around from deep square leg. It was sitting up nicely for Vijay to play the stroke. It was in the mid 130s again, not enough pace to trouble a batsman of Vijay's class"
"slower bouncer this time, digs it in, Vijay is caught in an awkward position as he looks to fend, rolls off the bat handle to the off side and they pinch a run"
"looks to cut, realises there was no width there, bunts it to point with soft hands"
"looks to force that behind point, into the stroke a little too late, mistimed to the fielder there"
"too early into the pull, gets a bit of inside edge onto the body, they scamper through for a run"
"slow turn away from middle, slightly short, pushed to cover"
"lunges forward and eases it wide of cover, not much turn on that one"
"beaten by the one that drifts away, looked to drive, too early into the stroke. Umpires wanted to have a look for a stifled stumping appeal. Vijay's backfoot was in the air for a wee bit, but back in time"
"whipped to square leg, this one was pushed through quicker again"
"accurate stuff. This one was quicker on middle, pushed back to the bowler"
steps out and eases it down to long-off
"sharp turn this time, Marsh is taken aback by how much it comes back in, somehow bunts it to short third man for a quick single. Wasn't far away from the pad as ball made contact with the bat"
punched across the line to midwicket
steps out and plays it with the spin to long-on
"sweeps, but straight to short fine leg. Once again, Vijay was playing across the line"
"foxed by the wrong-un. Shapes to cut but the ball breaks back in sharply from middle and off, Vijay was cramped for room but went through with the stroke, missed it completely as the ball crashed into middle and leg. Chawla is delighted, and why not? Classic legspinners' dismissal"
leading edge towards point for a single. Bounce on offer on that occasion
"looks to turn it past the bowler, towards long-on, Narine is quick to get across and stop the ball"
"skids away quickly, Saha is beaten on the cut"
"this one spins back in, cut well but straight to Gambhir at point"
punched to cover where Shakib swiftly moves to his left to stop that
"punished this time, but there's a boundary rider in the form of Yusuf Pathan at deep point. Saha rocked back, opened the face slightly to put that past a diving Gambhir"
"sliding down leg, good take by Uthappa. Saha missed a faint tickle"
eased past the bowler to mid-on.
"tossed up delivery on middle, he gets forward and smothers the spin"
"steps out and drives, but a good stop by Chawla on his followthrough"
"didn't get underneath the flight, squeezed wide of cover"
"this one drifts across, punched to long-off"
"sweeps and misses, gets a top edge onto his helmet, ball rolls to the off side"
"punched into the gap at deep point, the fielder had to come around from sweeper cover to stop that"
pulled across the line to long-on. It was short but skidded onto him faster than he expected
steps out and works it past the bowler to long-on
"cramped for room as he looks to whip it wide of midwicket, deflects off the pad to short third man"
"first wicket for Narine since his comeback. This one was another skidder outside off, it wasn't that short, Saha shaped to cut but the ball kept a touch low, took the bottom edge as Uthappa, who got up with the bounce, pouched it on the second attempt. The ball bobbles out, and Uthappa may have held it against the grille of his helmet"
"fetches the sweep from outside off, struck towards Yusuf at deep midwicket"
"worked past short fine leg, Umesh had some work to do at deep fine leg"
"drifting down leg, Miller paddles it past short fine leg. There was no one at 45, was always going to be a boundary on this fast outfield"
"looks to work it with the spin, defended"
"skids across, but far too wide outside off"
punched back to the bowler
tucked wide of square lwg
"cracked off the backfoot, excellent stop at cover"
"too much width, this time he finds the gap at deep point. He gave it a proper thwack. Poor end to the over from Chawla"
"that is a body blow, Yusuf strikes off his first ball. Miller shapes to cut, but the ball kept coming back into him, was cramped for room, got a healthy deflection that Uthappa held onto quite nicely this time. Miller's poor form continues."
"fires one down leg, Maxwell lets it go"
worked off his hip to square leg
punched off the backfoot past cover
"floats it down leg, Maxwell wanted to play the slog sweep initially, but pulled out in the end"
"through with the pull way too early. The ball took ages to get to him, and missed it completely. Uthappa went up in a spontaneous appeal, but the umpire was sure there was no edge. Good decision"
turned towards short fine leg
steps out and works it with the angle wide of midwicket
"pushed through quicker on middle, pushed to midwicket"
gets underneath the flight and lofts it into the long-on boundary. Generated enough power as he stepped out and made contact
"steps out to work it wide of midwicket, is struck on the pad as the ball deflects to short third man. Shakib went up in a big way, but the angle would have taken the ball away"
"looks to play a reverse sweep, but was too early into the stroke. The slow turn on offer also somewhat prevented him from executing it properly"
"through with another reverse sweep, this one misses Uthappa too, fortunately for KKR, there was protection at short fine leg"
whipped off his hip to deep square leg
"steps out, can't get to the pitch, but dabs it with soft hands towards the man coming in from deep midwicket"
"swung across the line, toe-ends it towards deep midwicket"
"swept well, bisects the gap between deep midwicket and long-on perfectly. Both fielders were no more than 20 yards apart, but the fierce strike meant there wasn't much time for either to run around. Top shot"
"steps out and works it into the same region again, the boundary riders pressed into action.  Shakib hurls a poor throw at the bowler's end, they get an extra run"
"what have you done, Maxwell? He was hell bent on playing the reverse sweeps and the switch hits. Turned too early, showed well in advance what he wanted to do to the bowler. The ball was tossed up on middle and leg, he struck it well but picked out Piyush Chawla at cover. KXIP's slide continues"
"spins back into middle, punched to long-off"
"too short, pulled into the gap at deep midwicket"
"plays the delicate dab to short third man, Marsh's bat got stuck into the turf as he looked to get in, Uthappa collected the ball in front of the stumps and broke the bails before the ball lodged into his gloves"
"risky, but gets away. Not there for the pull, a touch fuller, somehow gets enough bat on it towards midwicket"
punched past the bowler to long-off
"pushed through quicker on middle, defended"
"punched into the gap between deep midwicket and wide long-on, good running between the wicket, some urgency"
"starts off with a slower one on off stump, pushed to long-off"
"poor ball, but lucky to get away. High full toss outside off, thumped straight to Russell at sweeper cover"
"too straight and onto the pads, flicked into the gap at deep midwicket, good roll of the wrists as ball met bat"
"punched to deep cover, it was another off-cutter from Umesh"
"would have been an outstanding catch on his followthrough. Marsh turns the bat face early as he looks to turn it to the on side, the ball was dying on Umesh, who almost got his hands on that one as he was diving to his left"
"have to say that's poor temperament from Axar Patel. Looks to go down town, but was done in by the slow off-cutter that grips on the surface, he can only manage to lob it high into the night sky, Suryakumar Yadav settles underneath that one and pouches it safely at mid-off."
"cracking stroke, shot of the night, if you ask me! Banged in short, he picked the length early, rolled his wrists over that to keep it low and hammered it into the gap between deep midwicket and deep square leg"
"another short ball, another pull, this time straight to Russell at deep midwicket"
"excellent bouncer on middle from wide of the crease, Mohit ducks under it"
"hops back, opens the bat face and bunts the short ball down to third man"
"excellent yorker from round the stumps, squeezed to point"
"the slide continues. This was banged in short, rolled his fingers across the delivery as well, Mohit shaped to pull but was too early into the stroke, lost control of the stroke eventually as the ball deflected off the glove through to Uthappa"
"whipped to square leg, it was going to be a risky single, Yusuf has a shy at the stumps at the striker's end, Sahu would have been gone had he hit"
"excellent bouncer on the body, Sahu looked to pull but was clearly beaten for pace, struck on the side of his helmet as he swivels back to pull, they steal a leg-bye through"
"looks for the yorker, turns out to be a low full toss, thumped to sweeper cover. There was never a second there, Russell fires a rocket throw to Uthappa who takes the bails off. Sahu, who turned for a non-existent second run, was more than halfway down the pitch even as his partner stay put at the non-striker's end. Marsh lets out a cry of anguish. He isn't too happy with the running."
"tucked towards the man running in from deep midwicket, easy two"
stands tall and plays it with soft hands back down the pitch
"rip roaring bouncer, but the speed gun just says it was bowled at 133kph. Abbott was hurried into his attempted pull, was too late on the shot as the ball zipped through to Uthappa"
"starts off with a short ball, pulled well in front of square, but straight to deep midwicket"
"makes room to go over cover, Russell follows him and bangs in a length ball, hit to mid-off and they scamper a run"
"low full toss, connects well and just gets it over the leaping Pandey at long-on. What a way to get to a half-century. Generated tremendous bat speed and power off the bottom hand as he made contact. Too good"
"hit towards point, straight to the fielder. A metre on side and it was four"
"clean strike down the ground. Slower delivery, but gets the length wrong. Too short, Abbott gave himself room, was winding up for the hit and made clean contact, the ball sailed into the boundary"
"hit towards Suryakumar Yadav who comes charging in, the misfield allows the second. In an attempt to recover quickly, he fires a casual throw at the non-striker's end which Russell fails to collect cleanly.  Lets the ball deflect off the stumps, by which time they sneaked in another. So what should have been one, turned out to be three. Preity Zinta, the KXIP owner, also saw the funny side of that"
"shapes back into middle and leg, tucked nicely off his pads, beats short fine leg. There was only one way that was headed once it beat the infield."
"too straight again, and another boundary. This time off the pad. Drifting down leg, Uthappa looks to get a faint tickle, but the ball races away off the pad. Fine leg was inside the ring"
"another one on middle and leg, shorter in length this time, worked wide of midwicket"
gets on top of the bounce and glides it down to third man to get of the mark
"short of length delivery on middle and leg, tucked wide of midwicket"
worked wide of midwicket to keep strike
"short and wide outside off, gets some zip off the deck, Gambhir is late on the cut, beaten"
hops across the stumps and whips it down to fine leg
"nips back in off the deck and hits Uthappa on the pad as he plays outside the line, Abbott ran across the pitch in an attempt to kick the ball onto the stumps, which he did, but Gambhir was well in"
"looks to pull, ball fizzes past his glove. Given wide since it was down leg. Healthy bounce on that occasion"
"straight to square leg, but they still get a single. Poor fielding there by Axar"
"punched, but straight to cover"
"width on offer and crunched between cover and the diving point fielder. He will pick those away all day. On this outfield, once it beat the 30-yard circle, there was no stopping it"
"drifting down leg, tickled to short fine leg, quick single taken"
"just over the leaping David Miller at mid-on. Length ball outside off, picked the length up early and went at it with a straight bat. Finger tips stuff. Good timing on that stroke nevertheless"
punched to short midwicket
"good wrist work again to pick the gap on the leg side, the man at deep square had to run around to stop that"
"mistimes the pull, but still gets enough bat on it to clear the infield. The ball rushed onto him, got big on him, but the good thing was he went through with the stroke. David Miller, running back from mid-on, did well to slide across to pull it back in just before the ball hit the advertising cushion"
"too short and down leg, helped over the keeper's head. Not where he intended, but gets the desired result. Uthappa looked to help it over fine leg"
"played back down the pitch, Abbott casually lets the ball go, not realising a run was on offer there, Gambhir is aware of the possibility and gets across quickly"
"lofted cleanly over cover. What flow of the bat. Silky, smooth from Uthappa. Just a hint of width and he made the most of it. Easily done"
"way too early into the pull, ball deflects off the helmet to third man"
"tight line this time, full on middle, played back down the pitch"
"imperious! So much of time, so much control. Picks the short ball early, gets a touch across and pulls it in front of square. Flew off the middle of the bat"
hops across and turns it towards deep square
"starts well, good length delivery on middle, Gambhir shows the full face of the bat and defends it back to the bowler"
steered wide of point
"deflects off Mohit's hand to Miller at mid-on, Gambhir thought it would go wide of the fielder there and took off for the run, was more than halfway down the pitch when he was sent back. Gambhir had given up. A direct hit and he would have been gone. Everything going KKR's way"
"slower delivery gone wrong, Uthappa looks to helps it over short fine, misses"
"that's a ferocious pull in front of square, one bounce into the boundary. Too short, and he dismissed it without much fuss."
"he's riding on luck here. This one swung away late, Uthappa looked to work it towards the on side, but got a thick edge past the diving Wriddiman Saha. Had there been a first slip fielder, it would have lodged right into his hands without him having to move an inch"
tapped towards point for a quick single
"gets across the stumps and sweeps the short ball on middle into the deep square leg boundary. Generates tremendous power when he sweeps. There was deep midwicket, but he had no chance"
"eased wide of short third man, Marsh slides across to stop, no chance of preventing the single though"
"dabbed to short third man again, mere eye contact and they were off for a single"
"whipped wide of Vohra at mid-on, Axar is too predictable here. Just firing them in"
leans forward and works it towards deep midwicket
"driven through the line to sweeper cover, the fielder in the deep was caught napping"
"starts off with a wrong-un which Gambhir picks off the hands, taps it wide of point"
"changes his bat grip, uses the pace and plays a reverse sweep past the diving slip fielder. Brave from Uthappa, mighty effective too. Sahu dropped his length purposely, but to no avail"
"eased wide of cover for an easy single, yet another fifty for Uthappa Applause from the dug out. <b> Third fastest fifty this season, off just 24 balls </b>"
makes room and cuts it straight to point
"this one spins back in sharply to cramp Gambhir on middle and leg. He was perhaps playing for the wrong-un, gets some bat on it, ball bounces over the stumps"
turned to deep square
""
"eased to Sandeep at short third man, he rushed in and dived, I don't know for what. As a result, couldn't fire the throw"
toe-ends a slog sweep to long-off
"uses the pace of Maxwell to delicately dab it past Sandeep at short third man. Wow, this is simply superb from Gambhir. Transferred his weight onto the backfoot and played it literally off Saha's gloves"
paddled to short fine leg
steps out and drives it down to long-on
gets to the pitch of the ball and works it down to long-on
"driven uppishly, down to long-off"
"a wicket, finally, and it has come about because of misjudgment. It was too full on middle, Uthappa went across to sweep, but got into a tangle. Missed it completely and he was struck plumb in front of middle. Easy decision for umpire C Shamsuddin"
eased to short third man to get off the mark
"beaten by the quicker one. Looked to squeeze it behind point, ball didn't turn, went straight on"
"cuts and misses, was short but lucky to get away"
gets onto the backfoot and turns it towards deep square leg
"sliding into middle and leg, nurdled towards deep square leg, the fielder in the deep was late to get off the blocks., Fires a good throw, but Gambhir was well in. Third umpire called for, but no real danger there"
"excellent use of the feet. Steps out, makes room to go inside out and lofts it cleanly, Axar does well at sweeper cover, saved two runs"
"looks to sweep, the pace did him in, struck on the pad. Maxwell appeals but it was sliding down leg"
"excellent cut shot. Too easy. Just a hint of width, he opened his wrists up even as he went onto the backfoot, guided it superbly behind point"
turned wide of midwicket
"spins back into middle and leg, played wide of square leg"
"punched to wide mid-on, Mohit gets to the ball but can't prevent the single"
"steps out and squeezes it into the gap at deep cover, didn't get it off the middle, the bat face turned in his hand as he made contact with the ball"
"outstanding stop by Marsh, throwing himself to his left to save four runs"
"one of the better catches you would see this season. Gambhir looks to turn it wide of midwicket, but the ball bounces a bit more than he expected, it was the googly, he turned the bat face early, and so the ball lobbed in the air. There was no one at midwicket, and so it looked like it would fall in no man's land. But Glenn Maxwell anticipated well and hared in, timed his dive to perfection. Stretched full length forward to pull off the catch inches from the ground. Ensured the ball was lodged in his hands safely even as his elbows hit the ground. Tremendous athleticism, but surely it has come too late for KXIP?"
played towards short mid-on for a quick single
"what punch! Stands tall and punches it between cover and mid-off. Miller gives it chase, but he had no chance"
"punched to long-on, nice sound of the bat as ball made contact"
"length ball, closer to the stumps, dabbed to the off side"
crunched to Axar at sweeper cover
"slower delivery off the back of the hand, lands it short, pulled to deep square leg"
"cut away into the gap, third man was too fine, and so they're easily back for the second. No pressure on the batsmen whatsoever"
mistimes a cut to point
reaches out to drive that to sweeper cover
gets forward and offers a dead bat
"hit hard, straight back to the bowler, good stop"
"not all that short enough to pull, still goes through with the shot, gets it wide of midwicket"
"works it into the vacant midwicket region and calls for two immediately, Saha does well to run across and keep it down to a single"
"beats him with a straighter one. This one drifts back in from round the stumps, Pandey plays for the turn and looks to drive, but the ball holds its line. Once he missed, it was headed to hit middle of middle. Muted celebration in the KXIP camp."
pushed to cover
"angled into the pads, worked to long-on"
chops one to point
steps out and eases it to long-off
pushed back to the bowler
"slower one on off stump, driven to cover"
"cuts and misses. Wasn't there for the stroke. It was too full, just zipped through after pitching"
"makes room to cut, it was the slower one, bunts it to point and takes off for a risky run, Miller fires a throw from point, Shakib dives but would have been out had there been a direct hit at the bowler's end"
"ramp shot! Slower bouncer from Mohit, both feet off the ground as he made contact, straight over the keeper's head. Excellent improvisation"
"full and tails back into middle, squeezed to midwicket"
"length ball on middle, worked to midwicket"
"fires one outside off, Shakib shapes to cut but lets go in the end"
slogged across the line to deep square leg
punched to long-on
"Vohra makes a mess of it at long-off. To add to KXIP's woes, it's a boundary too. Slogged, but not off the middle, Vohra was hesitant to move forward, but eventually did, and when he finally got down on it, missed it completely."
"looks to fetch the slog from outside off, can only get a top edge to short third man. Easy catch. Not needed at this stage, especially with victory within touching distance"
driven to long-off
"slapped past point, back for the second easily, a better throw from Vohra and he may have been in trouble. Yusuf turned at the non-striker's end with his back to the ball. Turned blind"
"helped into the fine leg boundary. Easy picking those. Had 'hit me' written all over it. Tried to camp him for room by trying to bowl into his rib cage, ended up drifting it down leg, helped on its way"
"thumped past the diving mid-on fielder. Tried to play the double bluff, but Yusuf was up to the task."
"short and wide, cut wide of point, a misfield gives them a single"
walks across the stumps and pulls the short one towards deep midwicket
"way too short, well over Yusuf's head"
"attempts a yorker, turns out to be a low full toss, flicked to midwicket"
"those are the winning runs. Back-of-the-hand slower delivery again, right in the slot as Surya just frees his arms and thumps it back past the bowler and the diving mid-off fielder. Has enough legs to cross the boundary"
