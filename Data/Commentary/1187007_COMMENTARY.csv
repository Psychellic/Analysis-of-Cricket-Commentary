"shortens his length a tad and pulls the line closer to off, and Agarwal defends"
"oooh there's the Philander skill with subtle movement and putting it in the spot. good length, outside off, and this one nips back in - but fortunately for Agarwal he got a thick inside edge onto pad on his forward defensive"
"good line and length again, defended into the offside"
"shaping away at 139 kph, but well outside off and easily left alone"
"and Rohit gets off the mark as an opener in Test cricket in style, driving on the up through backward point to one that was marginally short and outside off"

"brings the line closer to off stump, in the channel and on a hard length, Rohit lets it go"
extravagant movement away but it's very wide outside off and an easy leave
"good length again and in the channel, still getting the movement away, but can be safely left alone"
"fullish and outside off, lets it go"
"oooh, he was setting him up for the one that came back in. But Agarwal is equal to it and jabs his bat down, defending from the crease. Ball rolls towards midwicket off a thick inside edge"
"that is very skilfull from Philander. After nipping one back in, he moves this away and it misses the outside edge by a millimetre. Great line and length, pitches on off and beats bat"
"fuller, outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, and Rohit takes a few steps down the track and pats it back to the bowler"

"play and a miss! Length ball in the corridor that holds its line, and he has a poke at it"

"shape away, but the pace is just 127 kph and it's a bit too full, Rohit mis-times his drive to the bowler"
"length outside off, lets it go"
"that's a risky leave! Philander can move it both ways, and this one was coming back in from outside off and Rohit lets it go. It goes <i>just</i> over the stumps"
"bit of a tentative front-foot defence, not as firm a stride as earlier - perhaps Philander's movement has made him uncertain. Squirts it towards gully"
"length ball in the channel, this one moves away"
"and he continues to show his control, nipping this inwards. Rohit lets it go, this is a more comfortable leave with the ball going well over the stumps"
"length outside off, doesn't rise too much, Agarwal pushes it firmly square by opening the face of the bat. Good timing and it races through point, but the outfield has been pelted by rain so it'll stop before the boundary"
"back of a length in the channel, stays beside it and punches to point"
"<b>outside edge flies between third slip and gully!</b>. Can't fault the bowling or the field placing there, three slips and a gully there, but the batsman is fortunate. Was trying to clip that off his hips, it takes the outside edge and flies through"

this time he does pull his length back but Agarwal steers it away
quicker one outside off
defended solidly on the front foot

good looking straight punch down the ground to a fuller one outside off. Didn't try to hit it too hard

goes back to defend a ball tossed up around off and middle
"slants one across him, and he plays this with soft hands. Runs off the edge, and goes well to the right of first slip, and runs away to the third man boundary"
"slants another across du Plessis, who presses forward and gets it towards point. It's to the left of the fielder, and that enables them to go through for a single"
"flighted, and he drives this with the turn towards deep mid on. Du Plessis, interestingly, was waiting for a long time before taking off"

"big turn, as it pitches around middle and goes down the leg side. Didn't miss the inside edge, or leg stump, by much"

"tossed up around middle, and he has launched into this one, but got <strong>more height than distance...</strong> It's good enough to just about hit the skirting at midwicket on the full, though"
defends a length ball around middle and leg
taps away a flatter ball fired at his pads
"strays down the pads, and Elgar turns this around towards fine leg. Just needed to get some bat on that, and that was enough for the ball to race away..."
"tossed up, around leg, and he looks to whip this around the corner. On the bounce, and into the hands of forward short leg"
"he has absolutely <strong>smashed</strong> this one! Tossed up a touch more, around middle and leg, and he takes on long on, and ends up clearing him quite easily with a full-blooded swing down the ground. Hits this flatter than most, and does so by keeping his bat at a slight tilt. There was no intent to go for anything less than six, though!"
"fullish length, slants into du Plessis, who defends this towards mid on"
"<strong>SHOT!</strong> Full, angles into du Plessis, and he just allows the angle and the pace of the ball to work for him, and whips this between short midwicket and mid on. It races away for four"
"fuller, wider of off stump, and he drives this towards mid off. There's a hint of reverse swing on offer, but the lack of pace on the pitch is also apparent, giving the batsmen enough time to adjust"
"changes his length, and the pace, with a slower off-cutter along the middle of the pitch. Du Plessis stays rooted inside the crease and defends"
"length, swings in a touch from outside off, and he is nicely behind the line of this to defend"
"<strong>rears off a length, and surprises everybody!</strong> Was no different in origin as the previous ball, just on a good length around off stump, but then pitches and moves away viciously, with some extra bounce to boot. Du Plessis was shaping to defend this, but was forced to move away to get his body and bat out of the way. There was a bit of bounce and some movement, doubtless, but again not at an alarming pace"
defends a length ball around off stump
"<strong>is that a drop?</strong> Length ball, around off stump, and Elgar pokes a bit at it, and gets the outside edge, and Saha cannot hang on to it. It was a decent chunk of the bat, and also didn't go to slip"

"fires this along the angle into du Plessis from around the wicket. He presses forward to defend, and it runs along the ground off the inside of the bat"

Ended up getting underneath it and got a top edge. Pujara, in all his slow-mo bustling glory, took it side on and made sure to hold it as he went to ground. A memorable innings from Elgar has ended.

"<strong>WICKET NUMBER 350 FOR ASHWIN!</strong> Tosses this up wide of off, and gives some supreme revs on this one. De Bruyn shapes to cut this away, but finds the ball dipping late on him. He's committed to the stroke, though, and ends up playing it off the inside edge on to his stumps. Ashwin lets out a celebratory roar - he now <b>joins Muttiah Muralitharan</b> as the only men to have reached 350 Test wickets in just their 66th Test. Take a bow!"

"length, and he presses this towards point"
"<strong>GONE RIGHT THROUGH HIM!</strong> This pitch is playing some tricks now, though this was well directed from Shami. A length ball, and keeps quite low, and Bavuma tries to adjust, but cannot bring his bat down on time. Goes right through him, and he topples over as he loses his balance. South Africa are unravelling now. They need a hero or two"

"wide of the crease, and slants it down the pads, and all he has to do is get some bat on it. Does so with a wristy flourish, sending it speeding away to the fine leg fence"
"length, and he presses forward to meet it right in front of off stump"
"DISMISSIVE! Flights this outside off, and he skips down the wicket, a little to his right to get closer to the pitch of the ball, and then swings this high, wide and handsome over wide long on"
"<strong>off the glove, but safe!</strong> This turns sharply, and bounces from a length, and he shapes to play a defensive push. Takes his bottom hand off, and the ball skews off his gloves, but beyond forward short leg"

"<strong>OH, HE'S DONE HIM IN!</strong> Faf du Plessis has been leaving a number of balls around off and just outside, and that's where this ball from Shami starts. There's a sharp movement back in after pitching, though, and it comes shooting right back and takes off-stump with it. Du Plessis can only look in disbelief, and then begins to drag himself off the square. Shami goes off in celebration, arms spread wide open. India can probably begin to get their first sights of the final leg of this effort"

Pitching around middle and leg, no bat involved and hit the batsman on the back pad in front of off. Would have gone on to hit the off stump. Three reds and that's <b>a pair for Philander</b>"
"<b>almost an action replay of the last ball</b>. Length ball on the stumps, spinning away to beat the bat and hits the back leg. <b>Up goes the finger but Maharaj wants to review this.</b> Once again no bat involved, hitting the back leg around off and middle and it's <b>umpire's call on the stumps</b>, would have clipped the off stick. So the original decision stays. <b>Jadeja on a hat-trick</b>"
