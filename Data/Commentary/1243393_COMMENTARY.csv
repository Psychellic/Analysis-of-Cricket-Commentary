"hits the hard length again, but a bit straighter, and Rohit able to turn it off his hips into the square leg area. Quick single taken"
"zips past the outside edge of Dhawan this time, pitches on leg and moves away. Wood's got it to move both ways this over. Dhawan keeps bat close to bat as the ball goes past"
"length on leg stump, tucked to square leg. Loud and early call of 'NO' because the fielder was swooping in on it"
"rapped on the pads first up, but not given. They don't review. Length ball, moves across Rohit, might have just pitched outside leg, and perhaps hit him a bit high too"
"fuller on leg stump, clipped off his pads to deep square leg"
"back of a length outside off, steered to third man"
"full on off, bit of swing for S Curran across Rohit, twirled off his toes to midwicket."

"good length, keeps it in the channel and is still getting it to nip away, left alone again"
"back of a length outside off, opens the face to steer to third man. 145 clicks"
"good line and on a hard length, moving across Dhawan. He can let it go safely because even though it's close to off stump, it'll sail over the stumps"
"<b>through him</b>. Wood brings this one back in from a hard length outside off. Dhawan looking to cut it, and the ball moves into him, don't think he was expecting that. Goes under his arm and to the keeper."

"full outside off, and going away with the angle, left alone"

"<b>moves away again</b>. This one is bowled fuller and wider outside off, Rohit shapes to drive it through off but checks his shot and allows the ball to go past. Wasn't full enough to drive"
"back of a length on off, tapped to cover. The fielder's rushing in and they quickly decide there's no quick single to be had - wisely so."
"he's copped a blow on the right glove. This one straightens off a hard length on middle stump and Rohit is squared up trying to defend, the ball bounces more than he thought it would. <b>he's actually worn it on the forearm, near the elbow</b> as he couldn't get bat up in time. Speed on that one was 148 kph."
"fuller on the stumps, angling into him, defended towards point with an angled bat"

"back of a length, keeping it tight on off, Rohit was looking to tap it softly and run but the ball bounces down to the slips"

"fuller and wide outside off, moving further away, left alone"
"good length on the stumps, he's looking to punch this through mid-off, gets an inside edge onto pad"
"back of a length on a fourth stump line, Dhawan cuts it from close to his body but can't beat point"
"<b>nails the cut this time</b>. Shorter from Wood, he still kept it right outside off but Dhawan was in perfect control, rising up with the ball and cutting from close to his body, middling it and placing it through cover"
"<b>and now he brings out the drive</b>. Wood went fuller outside off, maybe because of the last ball, and Dhawan powers a drive through extra cover, with minimal foot movement."
"back of a length on the stumps, tapped softly beside him for a quick single"
"<b>dropped at point</b> but difficult chance. Rasping cut to a short and wide ball outside off, and Roy flew to his left and got a hand to it, but could only block it, not catch it. He was quick to release it to the keeper, and Dhawan had to scramble back"
"fuller and well clear of offstump, left alone"
"length on middle and leg, tucked through square leg"
"fullish on off, comes on the front foot and drives to mid-on"
"wider outside off and very full, he gets down low to try and drive it but can't connect. Looked like a slower ball, with S Curran having rolled his fingers over the ball"
"full on off, punched very firmly to mid-on's left, who does well to dive and stop"

"driven on the up, imperiously over cover. On a driveable length and Rohit stands tall, frees his arms and doesn't bother to keep it down because it's in the gap"
"<b>gorgeous</b>. The last time he got this pristine timing to a straight drive in this over, it went to a fielder. Now it's a bit straighter and no fielder is getting near that. The ball Rolls Royces to the straight boundary"

"back of a length outside off, had to crouch a bit low to try and cut it but the movement away beats him and he can't connect"
"and beaten on the outside edge again. Still stuff happening, even though it's the 13th over. Appreciable extra bounce from a hard length as Rohit is coming down the track, but the ball goes through"

"back of a length outside off, tapped to mid-on"
"<b>outside edge goes past the lone slip</b>. Dhawan coming down the track again, the elder Curran does what his younger brother did and bangs it in shorter. Dhawan left feeling for it as it moves away too. Takes a thick edge to slip's left and third man fields"
"length all tucking him up, patted back down the pitch"
"good length, moving away a tad, pushed towards cover"
"comes down the track again, but this was also on the shorter side so he can only work it off his pads. Does well to keep it clear of fine leg and gets two"
"short ball down leg, and he swivels to pull this fine from chest height. Gets a bit of a top edge but that won't matter because he's kept this very fine and he'll get the boundary"

"much fuller and nipping away outside off, Dhawan pokes it down to third man off an outside edge"

"slower ball, dug into the pitch and keeps it wide outside off, makes Krunal create all the power he needs while slapping it to long-off. Bit of an angry exchange between Krunal and T Curran as he comes to the non-striker's end. Not sure what the issue was, but Krunal looks steamed up."
"<b>boom</b>. that's powered over long-on. He was leaping up to try and get it, but it goes half a foot over. Full toss on leg stump and he uses bottom-handed power to smack this flat, hard, but high enough."
"too short and going down leg, swivels and pulls to the deep square leg boundary"
"almost a yorker, was caught on the crease trying to punch it away, gets an inside edge to fine leg"
"back of a length on the stumps, was looking to clear his front leg and pull but it hurries on to him - 148.5 kph - and he can't connect. Goes to short third man off his thigh pad"
"<b>Krunal might be run out at the non-striker's end here</b>. No he's dived back and made it just over the line. fuller on off, flicked it aerially to deep midwicket. Not timed so the ball doesn't go over the boundary. Krunal was turning for the second but was sent back by Rahul."

"length straying on the pads, tucked through midwicket for a couple"
"<b>huge appeal</b> for a caught behind. They're not going for the review. Peachy little ball by Prasidh, getting it to jag in from back of a length. YJB going for the on-drive leaves a big gap, the ball sneaks through, flicks the thigh pad and goes to Rahul. That noise probably caused the excitement."
"way down legside, tried to crank up the pace, 142.4 kph, and that's too far for Rahul to reach with his dive to the left. Five wides"
"fuller outside off, driven crisply to mid-off"

"length ball coming into him, flicked to midwicket"
"and Bairstow's found his range.Too full and that's bang in his hitting arc, comes on the front foot and swings it over long-on"
he's just picking his spots. Prasidh keeps it too full and Bairstow comes gleefully on the front foot and drives over cover.
"<b>and he goes again</b> Four lofted drives in this over, and it's not yet done. Krunal chases after it at long-on and tries to pull it in, but it's hit the boundary. Fuller again, he goes harder at that, gets it off the inside half of the bat but meaty enough that it flies over mid-off"
<b>two runs off a ricochet of a direct hit</b>. airstow drove straight to Hardik at extra cover. They were looking for the single and Hardik had a shy. No one backing up
"<b>oooh tight call on wide</b>. Roy moves across, well across and the ball goes past him on the legside. Might have flicked his thigh pad if he had stayed where he was."

"length ball on the pads, flicked over midwicket. No timing on it, but he clears the in-field. The ball gets pulled in after a chase"
"shorter and wide outside off, he hammers it through cover, and it needs another bit of good fielding to stop it. Shreyas Iyer dives to his left to stop it. <b>Uh oh, he's hurt his left shoulder too, making that stop</b>. The ball was travelling at bullet speed past him, got his hand stretched out and dived to his left, managed to slow it's progress considerably. Saved two runs, but he seems to be in a lot of pain."

"flat and quick, length ball around off, punched to cover"
"<b>just clears mid-on</b>. Slightly short and he opens up his stance to pull, gets it on the toe-end but hit hard enough to go over a leaping mid-on fielder. Brushed Bhuvneshwar's fingertips"

"full swinging into him and Bairstow simply shows the full face of the bat to drive it straight back past the bowler. A little too full but when a batsman is hitting these balls so effortlessly, you have to wonder what a bowler can do."
"<b>crashed through cover</b>. There's a man at deep cover but this was hit so hard that he couldn't get to his right in time. A bit short, he gets a free swing of his arms outside off and thumps it"
