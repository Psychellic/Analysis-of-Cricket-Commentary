"drifts a short of length delivery down leg, Rohit hops back and whips this off his hip to the fine leg boundary."
"gets a <b> leading edge </b> as he looks to turn it square, fortunately for Rohit this one lands safe. On the bounce to short midwicket"
"slips this length ball down leg, past the thigh pad. Wide called and rightly so. Wayward start."
tucks this towards the man coming in from deep square
lifter that Dhawan negotiates well by getting on top of the bounce
"<strong>beaten by a ripper!</strong> Banged in short, angling away, Dhawan looks to upper cut but is beaten for pace and cramped for room. <b> West Indies opt for a review. And they lose it. </b> No deviation, which means no spike. The review was Pooran's alone, even though the bowler wasn't convinced."
beaten on the drive by a length ball that nips off the seam. Lovely from Oshane
"wayward as he slips a full delivery down leg, pitched outside leg and swung back in further to beat Rohit's tickle"
"gorgeous on-drive to a full ball that swings back into middle, hit straight to mid-on"
"full and swinging back in, Rohit walks across looking to flick this behind square but is late on the stroke. Ball rolls off the pad to the keeper"
"goes shorter this time but the line is again outside leg, wide."
"much better, draws him forward by angling this across, Rohit gets well forward and covers the line to defend back"

late inswing but from outside leg. He's struggling for rhythm
"driven firmly but straight to mid-off, no timing as Rohit immediately looks at the bat's bottom"
cramped for room as the attempted dab past slip rolls to the keeper
"driven straight back past the bowler, mid-off and mid-on converge o stop that"
<strong>strong wrists and that nonchalant whip!</strong> Takes a step across and allows the length ball to slide in as he picks this over midwicket. Class
"gentle dab into the off side as they scamper a single, even as point swoops in"
cramped for room but he somehow manages to get besides the line to defend back and scamper a run. Mid-off couldn't have stopped that because he was a tad deep
runs this down to third man
"<strong>uppercuts perfectly this time!</strong> Missed playing this shot in the previous over, not this time. Arches back, uses the pace and deflects it wide of the keeper. Third man too square"
lofted over extra cover! This is magnificent. By no means a half-volley but he trusts his form and the surface. Glorious
flicks this dipping full toss on the pads to deep square
"the bowler can wonder all day if he did something wrong there, but the answer is not really. Length ball, slanted across towards offstump and Rohit lifts this over mid-off. Held his pose for the cameras too. He's roaring already"
dabs this away-going length delivery into the off side
eased down to long-on
"steps out and flays this wide of point, third man comes around to cut that off. 13 off that over"

"length outside off, pushed to mid-off"
"steps out, the bowler follows him and Rohit gets an inside edge onto the pad as he tries to whip it square"
<strong>gift of a delivery and picked away!</strong> Full toss on leg-stump and Rohit gleefully accepts that as he flicks this over deep midwicket. An attempted slower ball gone wrong
on the pads again and he flicks this towards deep square for a couple

"slower length ball on middle and leg, punched to long-on"
scorching drive to sweeper point
mistimed drive to long-off
"angles one into middle and leg, worked to long leg"
"slower ball done wrong, slips this too far wide outside off"
"deflected gently past short third man. Used the pace very nicely. Dhawan's go-to stroke for boundaries have all been behind the wicket today. Not surprising considering he's struggled a bit for timing, perhaps a consequence of easing himself back into international cricket after an injury"
whips this down to long-on
"through with the pull even before the ball arrived, deflects off the thigh pad to short third"
"driven firmly on the up to deep point, the throw is on target but the keeper is way too casual and misses it on the bounce, they get <b> one for the overthrow </b>"
"backs away and squeezes this yorker-length delivery past point. Dhawan's bat split as he made contact. <b> New bat, please </b>"
"dipping slower ball again, works this from outside off towards deep midwicket"
"sliced over point, acres of open space there. Deep cover hares across to his right to cut that off"
"<strong>full, straight, angling in and bowled!</strong> A struggle it has been for Dhawan for large parts. Looking to hoick this behind square, across the line. Missed it completely. Death rattle."

slaps straight to cover

"looks to run this past short third man but can't, good effort there"

punched straight to cover.
driven down to long-off to bring up a half-century! <b> His 17th in T20Is </b>
driven all along the ground to deep point
"<strong>tough chance put down at deep midwicket</strong>. Rohit doesn't quite get the elevation on this slog sweep and ends up hitting it flat. This travelled real fast, good work to get there but couldn't hold on. Cottrell the man"

eased down to long-on
"top-edges this sweep to deep backward square, no timing."

"hit on the right elbow as he plays this whip even before the ball arrived, <strong>he's wincing in pain</strong>"
"dug in short, pulled to deep midwicket"
"sliced high in the air, cover fielder Hetmyer back-pedals and takes this superbly. The ball was swirling high for a long time. Held his composure and took it well. Rohit was looking to pull in front of square off the frontfoot, had to fetch it from a long way outside off."
"snorter of a short ball, Pant sways out of the way but this has been called wide for height"
"driven beautifully through extra cover, scorching timing"

steps out and uses his bottom-handed power to whip this over midwicket. Bullet hit that beats wide long-on
dabs to short third man for a quick single
tucked to square leg
eased to long-on
gentle dab to short third man for a quick single
"<b>he's steered it straight to third man!</b> Short ball outside off, just below the shoulder, seemed to be caught in two minds on what to do with it, and ended up top-edging an attempted glide. Good pace on the ball from Oshane, and it carries straight to Pollard on the boundary. That's that for Pant then"
"short ball again, but doesn't rise quite as high, Manish clears his front leg and goes back to pull powerfully, but can't beat the man inside the circle at midwicket"
"another short ball, bottom edges the pull and the ball trickles to wide mid-on"
"persists with the short ball strategy, and it's paying dividends too. Kohli unable to get a hold of that trademark forearm-power pull, mistimes to deep square leg"
"back of a length, Pandey was backing away expecting a short one again, but this one was well bowled and seamed in, he ends up jabbing it into the offside"
"and back to the short ball, Kohli connects well with the pull, pleasing sound off the bat. Didn't try to hit too hard though and there is protection at deep midwicket"
"expansive extra cover drive, but Cottrell had taken the pace off a bit so Kohli had to manufacture his own. The placement was good though, so they pick up two. Quick running"
"<b>it's time for the Cottrell salute</b>. Perfectly executed yorker on middle stump, Kohli wanted to whip that through the on side, but the ball snakes under and sends the stump cartwheeling. And Cottrell's doing his thing of course"
"yorker on leg-stump that time, tails in fairly late, Krunal able to get his bat down and clip to mid-on"
"he's sticking to that full line aiming for the yorkers. Doesn't <em>quite</em> nail it then, but Krunal isn't sure of the pace, which Cottrell is varying well. Ends up wristing it towards square leg"
"back of a length on the stumps, Pandey clears his leg again and thwacks it to deep midwicket"
"length ball on off, and seaming in a tad, takes the pad and rolls away to the onside. Half appeal by the bowler, but the umpire's not interested"
"length ball, dug into the pitch and grips a bit, in the channel. Pushed towards cover"
"goes for the yorker, but ends up as a low full toss. The late movement in the air defeats his attempted flick, and it takes a thick leading edge to go to deep extra cover"
"lost control of that one, ends up as a high full toss, he takes his top hand off the bat and jabs it to long-off"
"dug in short of a length, but it's from the spot in the pitch where there isn't much bounce, and Keemo's probably taking the pace off as well. Pandey has to wait for it and then slobbers it to deep midwicket"
"fuller on off, in the slot and driven to long-off with a big swing of the bat. Not timed perfectly though"
"back of a length, turns his fingers over the ball again, uses his wrists to turn to deep square"
"length ball on the stumps, he stays beside it and opens the face at the last moment to try and run it past the man at short third man, but the fielder gets to it"
"tailing into him again, ends up as very low full toss on leg stump. He wants to whip it away but doesn't connect, takes the pad to short fine"
"<b>got him!</b> wonderful by Cottrell. Pandey tried something different by dancing down the track, and Cottrell put some shoulder into it and bowled it short. It ends up getting big on Pandey, whose attempted pull only results in a top edge that is smartly held over his head by the keeper"
"tightly run two, but Jadeja makes it. Full ball on leg, twirled away with his wrists. The man was very deep and Jadeja spotted the opportunity for a hard-run second and took it"
"<b>run out chance missed by the keeper.</b> Jadeja misses the flick and it trickles to the keeper. They set off for a run, and the keeper lines up and has a shy - if he had hit, Krunal was miles out"
this time he's expecting the full ball tailing on leg and moves across to get this in the slot to flick nicely to deep square
"<b>wallopped!</b> full toss on the pads and Krunal flicks it powerfully , carries well over deep square leg"
"<b>take that</b>. That is a shot that can demoralise a bowler. Full ball on off, and he goes deep to loft this straight back, over long-off"
"slower ball works, length outside off and Krunal misses the cut"
"another slower ball, goes for the wide yorker. Krunal has a thrash at it by stretching his bat out and toe-ends it to long-off"
"<b>nailed it!</b> What a finish this turning out to be. Keemo misses his length again, full toss on the stumps and Jadeja's powerful forearms send the ball soaring just over the deep midwicket fence. Hit the rope on the full in fact, bisecting long-on and deep square"
"wide yorker again  and well executed that time, Jadeja can only flat bat it to mid-off. But it's been a fantastic final over for India"
"fired in from around the stumps, defended"
"flatter and a touch wide, outside off, beaten as he looks to slap this. Called wide"
chops this cut into the off side
beaten again as he looks to ease this past short third man
punched straight to extra cover
swing and a miss. Looking to belt this over long-on but swing too early
forces this straight to cover point
"length ball on off, punched to mid-off"
"flicks the pad as Pant fails to grab one cleanly down leg. Wide called, that's a poor call. Bhuvi isn't impressed"
"he's taken this superbly off his own bowling! This was a check-jab from Lewis as the ball stopped on him, may have been a slower ball from Bhuvi, lobbed in the air. On his followthrough, Bhuvi quickly changed track, put in a full-length dive and took it superbly"
tucks this gently to square leg for an easy single
"full toss outside off, driven straight to cover"
"top-edge, skews over the slips. Saini was back-tracking from short third man along with Dhawan, both didn't get anywhere near the ball, lucky break."
"slapped past mid-off, sublime! But Krunal hares across from long-on to cut the ball back in"
mistimes this pull to square leg
driven with the spin to cover point
"shapes to pull but the ball skids through to hit the thigh pad, rolls to short fine leg"
slaps this straight to cover
"beaten by a quicker one, sliding down leg. Hit on the pad as he looks to pull"
"got him! The middle stump is rattled. Steps out to hoick over the leg side, didn't get to the pitch. Poor shot under the circumstances from an experienced campaigner"
"full on the pads, worked to midwicket"
"looks to force this through the line, gets a thick inside edge onto the pad"
"beauty! This is a peach. Leaves him late, climbs on the batsman as he tries to defend"
tucks this gently into the leg side
"hops back to whip but this one takes a while to get to him, turned back to the bowler"
driven on the up to long-off
gentle dab into the off side as they scamper a single
"drilled back past the bowler, this is a super strike! Overpitched from Khaleel. Right in the slot to belt that away"
steered down to third man
"sways out of the way of this short ball angling in. Looked to upper cut, then decided it was too close, wasn't far from his gloves"
"driven firmly on the up, but straight to cover point"
"firm push to mid-off, in comes a rocket throw at the bowler's end but misses."
"full on the stumps, driven to mid-off"
"stunning shot, flicked it off his pads, almost Lara-esque with a flamingo leap of one leg and picked the gap beautifully. Good length but on the pads"
goes straighter that time and is steered from the stumps to third man
"too full, walks across to push-drive it but is angry with himself because he didn't place it well. Straight to mid-on"
"good length on off, jagging back in and he jabs it towards point"
"<b>smacked</b>. Errs in length a bit, too short and Powell is quick to pounce on it, swivels and pulls this to the fine leg fence"
"tight line and length, in the channel and not short enough to pull or full enough to drive. He stays in his crease and punches to mid-off"
"picked up the length well that time, stayed beside the ball and steered it fine from back of a length, but third man has enough time to clean up"
"<b>smoked</b>. What a shot that is. Too full on off, but the execution is breathtaking. Front foot out, swings through the line to loft this straight back over long-off. So good to see, and holds his shape in the follow through"
"shortens his length and Powell glides it to point. They think of a single, but it's Jadeja there swooping and quickly decide against it"
"bouncer outside off, misses the hook"
<b>stunning</b>. Powell is bringing out his repertoire. Another full ball and he drives to the extra cover fence. Went in the air but in the gap. That shot had both power and timing. Powell's playing a valuable innings here
"back of a length going across him, he stays inside the line and punches through cover"
"back of a length, but kept it very straight, not giving him room to free his arms and he pats it back towards the bowler, to his right"
"<b>inside edge goes for four</b>. Full ball on off, Powell was aiming to go straight, but it takes the inside edge to the fine leg boundary. Unfortunate for the bowler"
"<b>and now the outside edge goes for four!</b> Fortunate favours the Powell, not so much the Saini in the last two balls. Keeps a tight line around off on a length, Powell is late on it and gets a thick edge. Eludes the keeper and goes too fine for third man"
"carefully played down to third man, watched the ball right onto his bat - after those two edges"
"digs this into the pitch and it doesn't quite come on, he's a bit early into the pull and bottom edges to short midwicket"
"<b>get a ticket for that ball because it's travelling places</b>.  Floated up on the stumps, he goes down on one knee and sends this waaaay over deep square leg with a slog sweep"
"flatter on the stumps, pushed into the offside for a single"
"quicker one from around the wicket, stopped a bit and opened him up turning across, manages to jab it down towards the bowler"
makes some room by clearing his leg and slaps it through cover
"down the track, beaten in the air, and it takes the outside edge but swirls safely and bounces where point would have been before trickling to the man on the fence"
<b>diving stop by Krunal at fine leg</b>. Too short and Pooran rocked back to pull this fine. Krunal ran hard from deep square and put in a full length dive to save two runs
"fired in around the wicket, pushed away for a single"
"flatter and well wide of the stumps, Pooran tries to cut it but it sneaks under the bat"
"flat and outside off again, this time Pooran is successful in nailing the cut, but there is ample protection in the deep"
"flatter and shorter, Powell whips it to long-on"
"quicker one outside off, he misses with the full-blooded drive"
"stays in his crease, waits for the ball and clips through midwicket"
"oooh, that kept a little low. Too close to cut and he doesn't connect"
"fuller, pushed to extra cover."
too far down leg and he'll have to re-bowl that
"<b>valiant attempt by Kohli but he can't hold on to the catch</b>. Powell was getting impatient, had a cross-batted thwack at it, takes the top edge and swirls away from Kohli at cover, who has to run back and put in a full dive but can only get fingertips"
"fuller, tried to swing it over the legside but inside edges to the pad"
"length ball, another off-cutter that he's rolled fingers over, punched off the back foot to mid-on's left"
"length ball, stump to stump, he plays with bat close to the pad to drive to cover"
"full toss pushed very wide. Was on the line, but it's given a wide. Krunal isn't too happy"
"quick and flat on the stumps, jabbed to point"
"slows it up a bit that time and gives it more air, mis-times his clip through midwicket"
Pooran was expecting this wide of off and walks across to slap this through cover. Kohli runs across from wide mid-off and intercepts with a dive
quicker yorker takes him by surprise and he can only gets his bat down hurriedly to dig it back out to Krunal
"no room to free his arms and the pace is being varied, so he can only steer it to point"
"well that was coming. It was either going to be the ball going out, or the batsman. This time it's Powell who wins the battle, rocking back and showing the power in his hands by short-arm jabbing his pull over deep midwicket. A mite too short from Krunal allowed that shot - a rare loose ball he's bowled."
"fuller, punched to long-off"
"back of a length, slower one, he waits for it and whips it to deep midwicket with soft hands. Thinks about two but settles for one, but that's enough to raise a fine <b>fifty</b>"
"going across him, ends up full on the sixth stump, Pooran tries to drive on the up but misses. Half appeal by Pant due to a noise, but that was bat hitting ground"
"too short and Pooran nails the pull from outside off, sends it to wide long-on"
"<b>bullet hit</b> and it's a no-ball too! Too full outside off and he launches into a fierce drive down the ground, along the turf. Saini has over-stepped so <b>Free hit</b> coming up. Wait that is not due to over-stepping, it's because only three fielders were inside the circle! That's poor."
"good ball on the free hit, yorker on leg stump. He was looking to give himself room, but it sneaked under his bat and between his legs"
"nicely bowled slower one on a length outside off, swing and a miss from Powell"
"moving across, and Krunal saw him but bowled too wide of off and it's a wide."
"goes for the reverse sweep, again well outside off but he was moving across and it hits his body and rolls away"
"<b>Manish Pandey makes the pop up boundary catch look coolly nonchalant</b>. Pooran gave it to old heave-ho, feeling the run-rate pressure no doubt but got it a bit high on the bat. Still might have had enough to clear most fielders at long-on - but not Pandey. He stays <i>just</i> inside the rope, holds on to the ball, is overbalancing so throws it up in the air, steps over the rope, steps back in and completes the catch as if he's out for an evening walk. Stunningly done"
"quicker one, a bit short, Pollard surprised by it, jabs it away towards point"
"fuller but strays on the pads, and is flicked to deep midwicket off the front foot"
"<b>nailed right in front</b> But Powell has gone for the review. Don't think he'll survive it. Well bowled, drawing him forward, dipping on him and drifting, pitches and straightens to ping the pad. His bat is coming down beside his pad, no inside edge, and that is three reds. Krunal has struck a vital blow. End of a fine innings by Powell, though he had no business taking that review"
"<b>misfield by Bhuvneshwar at the point boundary</b>. Did all the hard work in getting there, but couldn't stop it cleanly and the ball rolls over. Not a great ball to finish, gave Hetmyer room to rock back and slash it away, well timed too - but it should have been stopped"
"starts off with a quick and flat one, stump to stump, jabbed back"
"<b>Pollard power!</b> goes on the back foot and absolutely leathers this straight over, one bounce into the fence. No regard for the ball stopping on the pitch - he has the power to over come that"
"quicker one, Pollard wanted to send this to New York, but misses it"
"oooh, that <em>just</em> eludes a diving Jadeja. Stopped a bit and turned, Pollard wanted to punch, ends up hitting uppishly to Jadeja's left, and to long-off eventually. Just past his finger tips"
"and now Kohli has a near-miss! Too short and pulled, but Kohli is at midwicket, and he manages to stop the ball but it bounces before he gets to it, going sideways"
"turned to short fine, ends up as a tight over after that first-ball four"
"smart bowling, saw him back away and pushed it well wide of off, but within the tram lines. Hetmyer doesn't connect"
"flayed off the back foot, uppishly over cover but there is a man there and they can only get one"
"flat and outside off, <b>misfield by Saini</b> at cover inside the circle allows the push to go through"
