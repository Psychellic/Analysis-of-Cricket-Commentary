"length ball on the stumps, turned to short fine"
<b>beautifully timed</b> short ball on the stumps and Parthiv is on to it in a flash. Rocks back and swivels to pull this. Pinging sound off the bat as the ball travels well over deep square leg
"length ball, and Chahar's consistently finding swing. AB was pushed on the back foot and pushed it back. It drops short of Chahar"

"a bit too short and outside off, turning away, slashed to deep point, where the man from the cover boundary runs around to collect"
"<b>Faf catches it at the long-off boundary</b>. Right at the edge of the boundary too! AB was coming down the track and Jadeja shortened his length a bit and possibly gave it a rip. It spins away from AB, who gets a toe-end while trying to go over the top. Faf stays still at the boundary and catches it over his head. Didn't move his feet and it's safe"
"shorter and quicker, swatted to midwicket off an under-edge"

too short and Watson is quickly on to that. Rocks back and pulls powerfully for four to square leg

In the corridor and with the late swing, Watson is tempted into the expansive cover drive, but can only edge it. The ball's travelling but Stoinis does well to hold it with both hands above his head."
"<b>full, fast and bye bye Raina</b> Make that four wickets in the Powerplay for Steyn. This is an inch-perfect yorker at 144 kph. Raina's bat is coming down an eon after the ball's got there and his stumps lie shattered. Steyn is pumped - and what a sight that is."
"full outside off, and driven to cover"
pushed into the offside

"gets this to swing in to him now, and it's jabbed to mid-on"

"<b>oh my that's a high full toss, but not a no-ball</b> Caught Faf by total surprise. Pacy ball but comes full and is just about waist high. He reacts hurriedly by taking his top hand off the handle and squirting it to third man"
full but down leg and that'll be a wide
"back of a length outside off, he was giving himself some room to flay it to the offside, but misses"
"<b>oh my word how has that missed</b> Shaping away from him and in fact <b>it shaved the stump</b>. At 141 kph, but the bails stay nailed on. Faf's lucky day. He was square up and missed it, should have been bowled, but he's still there. Umesh has a wry smile"
"full on off, driven to mid-off"
full on the stumps and clipped to midwicket off the toe end
"that's a poor ball, strays on the pads, nicks them and goes fine for four leg-byes"
"<b>Akshdeep runs into AB, but AB still holds on to the skier</b> Faf tried to pull that, but it wasn't short enough to swat across the line and he just gets a top edge. It goes steepling high, AB runs in and has settled under it at a short mid-on position and catches it. Akshdeep is running in from midwicket and collides with AB, who merely jogs off with the ball in hand as if he didn't feel a thing."
"full and fast outside off, Jadhav is happy to let it go through"
"down legside and Parthiv is going up in appeal. Think it flicked pad perhaps. But Kohli has gone for a review. And yes, it flicked the pad. No bat involved there. So RCB will lose a review."

"good length on a fifth stump line, nicely out to the pitch of the ball to steer to third man"
"shaping away from him again, back of a length outside off. And he shoulders arms"

"good length outside off, pushed to point off an open face"
and there's the bounce Umesh can extract. Rears up off a length and Jadhav is forced to get on his toes and pat it down from above waist height

"<b>dolly to de Villiers</b> good length outside off and Jadhav went for a cross-batted heave. Didn't have the room to play it, wasn't the right length either. Gets a top edge that loops to AB at mid-off for an easy catch."
"slashed past point and into the boundary. Full outside off and Dhoni perhaps instinctively went low to cut it. Gets it more aerial than he would have liked, given CSK's situation, but well wide of point"
"full and straight, almost yorker length, homing into him, turned off his toes to midwicket"
"full outside off, punched to mid-off. AB's lurking there so they don't even consider the single"

"angling into him on a length, he goes back and punches this to the bowler's right"
down the track and gets to the pitch of the ball to pat it back. Negi fields and Rayudu has to scramble back to his crease at the non-striker's end

"back of a length and he was coming down the track, pats it towards cover. Kohli runs past the ball while rushing in and allows the single"

"<strong>beauty!</strong> Length ball, drifting on middle and leg, and spinning past the batsman to beat the outside edge. <b>Parthiv is quick to take the bails off</b> and they are going upstairs. Rayudu lifted his back foot but did it come down in time? It's touch and go. Numerous replays, and it looks Rayudu might not have got his foot down in time.
