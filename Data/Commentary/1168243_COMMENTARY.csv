"flights it now, outside off, and overpitches. Kohli puts it away easily, drives with the follow-through over his left shoulder, and finds the wide long-off boundary"
"oh no. That's such an unfortunate way to go. Full again, and Kohli drives it straight this time, with a lot of power, and the bowler dives to his right and gets his fingertips onto the ball, just about grazes it on its way to the stumps at the other end. Vijay dives to try and regain his ground, but he's just short. A really unfortunate end to a superb innings, he deserved at least a fifty here"

"and he's gone first ball! Perhaps not short enough to cut, or wide enough, and it hurries through off the pitch. Dhoni rocks back and only manages a thick edge that is gobbled up brilliantly at slip by Usman Khawaja falling to his right. He wouldn't have had much reaction time there"

"<strong>an edge</strong> but it just falls short of Carey! It was wide, he tried to late cut and got a thin edge but the slowness of the pitch saw it not carry"
"good length, angled into the pads, he gets a thin inside edge, onto pad and rolls away for a single"
"<strong>Bowled him around his legs!</strong> Slower ball off cutter, it pitched outside leg, Kuldeep shuffled across his stumps trying to glance it fine, he missed and it crashed into the exposed leg stump! Four for Cummins!"
"good length, top of off, Bumrah plays a rock solid forward defence to a huge roar from the crowd"
"shorter ball, he backs away and pulls firmly to deep midwicket"
"<strong>chopped on!</strong> This was full and wide of off, he reached away from his body to drive, got a thick inside edge and dragged it back onto the stumps! India bowled out with 10 balls left!"
"135kph, swinging way down the leg side, miles down and called <strong>wide</strong>"
"shorter into the hip, 141kph, he's back and tucking this off the hip down to fine leg to get underway"
"full on the pads, 135kph, he glances this easily off the pads wide of fine leg and they get an easy two"
"137kph, good length, nips across the left-hander, he drops the bat and hands inside the line to let it go through to Dhoni"
"139kph, shorter length, steep bounce, he's back and knocking this down with control, well played"
"good length, angled across the left-hander, 139kph, he's letting this go"
"clipped very fine for four! This was too straight, swinging down leg, he shuffled back and across and tickles it fine. Nicely done for the first boundary of the chase"
"outswinger, swinging far too wide outside the guidelines and called"
<strong>beaten</strong> fending at a sharp outswinger that leaps away from back of a length but it was well wide. He didn't need to play
"short and wide, he tried to cut but could not reach it was so <strong>wide</strong>"
"good length, outswinger, 135kph, he's happy to leave this alone wide of off"
<strong>play and miss</strong> driving at a good length ball leaving him off the seam way wide of off. Again feeling for the ball well wide
"there was the inswinger and he spots it, clipping it nicely from off stump with the angle pinging it through midwicket, Jadhav has a long chase and slides to haul it in"
"full swinging away, he's caught on the crease, squared up, defending towards point"
"good length, angled across him and he's happy to leave this alone wide of off"
"142kph, good length, fourth stump line, he's back and across and defending firmly to cover"
"140kph, swinging well down the leg side. There's some swing there for Shami and Bumrah"
<strong>he's away with a glorious drive on the up through cover!</strong> Will that break the shackles? It wasn't a half-volley but he got a trademark big stride and drives inside out past cover and away for four!
"beaten again, fending away from his body. It was back of a length and shaping wider of off"
"good length, fifth stump line, shaping away, he's back and across and punching to cover"

"what a delivery! Angled in, shaping away sharply, he waves at it with no footwork and <strong>misses</strong>"

"shorter length, he plays an pull shot, flicking fine to long leg to rotate the strike"

"good length, angled into the top of off, he's half-forward defending on the front foot"
"<strong>edged for four! </strong>Some fortune now for Finch! Good length outside off, he drives hard on the up, gets a thick edge and it flies well wide of Sharma at slip, through where second or third might have stood and it runs fine of third man"
"back of a length, nipping away, he opens the face and glides it with control to third man"
"142kph, back of a length, fourth stump line, he's back and across and defending with a broad bat to cover"
"shorter length, he's back and working this to square leg"
"shorter length outside off, he's up on his toes and punching firmly and nicely but straight to cover"
"139kph, pushed well down the leg side and called <strong>wide</strong>"
"140kph fuller outside off, he drives but his weight is back a touch, and he mistimes to mid off"
"good length, angled into off, he's half forward, just getting the bat down in front of pad and pushing it to mid on"
"shorter length on off, he's back and across and clipping this wristily to forward square"
too short and he pulls this with ease up and over square leg! He's so quick to seize the length and just help it on it's way in languid style!
<strong>beaten</strong> all ends up by 118kph slower ball! Just missed off stump! Wow. He was completely deceived by the dipping off spinning slower ball
"he walks at Bumrah, it's fired into the pads and it rolls off the pad fine, Dhoni knocks it down with the right hand but they get a leg bye"

"good length, turning in from outside off, he just gets into line and knocks it with the turn to the gap at square leg"

"tossed up, on middle, he defends on the front foot"
"pushed through flatter and quicker, he's back and defending"
half-volley on the pads and he sweetly times this but picks out square leg. A couple of metres either side and it was four
"slower ball angled down leg, he flicks this wide of fine leg with supreme timing! He just turned the wrists and it raced away to the rope wide of fine leg. Too straight from Bumrah"
"fuller length outside off, he mistimes a drive back to the bowler"
big <strong>flash and miss</strong> driving on the up outside off. It was nowhere near full enough but he swung hard at the width offered and it shaped past the edge

"140kph, good length, angled in, he presses forward and defends to cover"
"short drag down wide of off, he's back and cracking a cut straight to the man at point"

"tossed up on leg, he clips this neatly to wide long on for one"
"darted in full, he presses forward and defends back to the bowler"
"drifting down leg, he glances this fine and it races away! Drifting too far and Finch does well to tickle it fine for four"
"fuller outside off, he drives to cover but can't beat the man"
short on the hip and he's back and flicking this away with ease behind square and finds the rope! Too easy.
"full and wide of off, he plays a nice square drive out to deep point"
full toss and thumped down the ground! He climbed into this smoking it back past the bowler straight of mid off! He stood and admired that shot
"cutter outside off, he chops this towards the wide gully but can't beat the man"

"tossed up outside off, he pushes firmly on the front foot to cover"

"tossed up on off, he tucks it to midwicket"
fired quickly down the leg side and called <strong>wide</strong>
"slightly shorter, he's back and working this from off stump through square leg between the two sweepers in the deep, they call two straight away and get it"
this is down leg and spinning down further and called wide
"<strong>slog sweep over midwicket into the crowd!</strong> This is Aaron Finch at his best! Into the arc, he's down on one knee and smashing this 83m with the spin over midwicket and way back!"
"looped up outside off, he steps forward and defends"
<strong>beaten</strong> by the wrong un. Did him cold. Well bowled. He played for the stock ball and it spun sharply past the edge
<strong>LBW appeal</strong> but not out. He tried to sweep and got in a tangle but got hit outside the line of off
"dances down but doesn't pick the wrong un until late, he thrusts the pad at it to knock it down"

"darted into middle stump, he defends on the front foot"
"shorter length outside off, he's back and forcing straight to cover"
tossed up very full and he defends on the front foot smothering the spin
"slightly shorter and wider, he gets back and chops a cut into the gap, there's an appeal for LBW as it hit the back pad first but it was miles outside the line"
"<strong>LBW!</strong> He's out sweeping! Finch asks Khawaja about a review but decides against. It was tossed up on off, he gets down on one knee to sweep square, misses, gets hit on the front pad in front of off stump as it's spinning back down the line and the umpire's finger goes up!"
"looped up outside off, he steps out and defends smothering the spin"
"tossed up on middle, he gets forward and defends on the front foot"
"short and wide, he's back and mistiming a cut shot to cover"
"tossed up, he drives to cover"
"round arm, shorter, outside off, he tries to late cut and chops it down"
"<strong>caught at cover off the leading edge!</strong> What a mistake! This was looped up on off, Khawaja lazily gets forward and closes the bat face early trying to work against the minimal spin, gets a thick leading edge that flies in the air all the way to cover and Kohli takes the simple catch!"
"tossed very high outside off, he waits and drives nicely to long off"
"darted in outside off, he gets forward and opens the blade to run it through backward point, using the pace and placing it nicely in the gap for two"

"drifting in to off stump, he steps forward and defends"
"shorter length, he's back and punching firmly down to long on"
"very round arm, he clips it with the spin from middle stump but can't beat the man at midwicket"
"round arm, almost underground, he's back and punching it in the air flat towards long off but it lands well inside the circle and safely"
"shorter on leg, he's back and forcing down to long on"
"slower and drifting away wide of off, he sits back and waits for an eternity to cut it fine past backward point for a couple"
tossed up slow just outside off. Marsh props forward and realises he's not really close to the pitch of it. Adjusts nicely with his hands to push into the cover point region
"flatter, stays back to try and cut, maybe. Has to adjust since this turns in sharply towards leg stump and cramps him for room. Punches into the covers instead"
"down the track now, clips this middle-stump ball with the turn to the right of midwicket"
"quicker, stays back to a length ball and punches to short extra-cover"

"tossed up slow just outside off, lets it come on and dabs to the left of Kuldeep at backward point"
"dangled up slow, gets a tiny bit of drift away from off stump. Handscomb presses forward, lets the ball drop, and drives to long-off"
"back of a length close to off stump, stabbed to backward point"
"fuller now, driven towards mid-off and short extra-cover sprints to his right to intercept. Replays suggest it was the knuckle-ball"
"shortish outside off, punched to deep point"
"fullish, slanting across to off stump and then it holds up on the pitch a little as Marsh comes forward to drive. Looks like the offcutter. Waits and eases it with an open face to deep point"
"in the blockhole on off stump, looks like there's a bit of late tail in as well. Handscomb just shows it the full face and punches firmly past the right hand of Shami, tumbling in his follow-through to try and stop it"
"length ball, fourth-stump line, lets it come on and steers to third man"
"flat, angling into off stump, goes back and defends into the covers"
"fuller now, on off stump, gets forward to clip to long-on"
"full, a bit of flight outside off. Clipped with a strong bottom hand to long-on"

"flat length ball just outside off, goes back and across to block it back to the bowler"
"back of a length outside off, gets nicely behind the line to punch to long-on"
"slower one, fairly full on leg stump. Closes his bat face early while looking to flick, and sends a leading edge running away through point. Seemed to grip the surface and turn like an offbreak too"
"back of a length on off stump, defended towards mid-on"
"ooh, good ball. Hits the seam on a good length in the corridor, and gets the ball to bounce a little extra. Beats Handscomb's attempted angled-bat drive"
"length ball, fourth-stump line, Handscomb plays a checked drive to deep point"
"slower offcutter on the pads, nurdled away into the backward square leg region. No bat on it, umpire Dharmasena suggests - must have just gone off the pad"
"length ball angling into off stump, stays slightly leg-side of the ball to push to the left of extra-cover"
"beauty. Dangled up slow outside off and it dips to make Handscomb reach out in front of his body to defend. Then it rips past his outside edge - massive turn out of nowhere. Dhoni whips off the bails and appeals to the square-leg umpire, but I think his back foot is firmly planted behind the crease. They check with the third umpire, and it is"
"full on off stump, gets on the front foot to clip to long-on"
"full, pitches on off stump and spins past the inside edge of the attempted flick. Not much of an appeal, it looked to be going down leg"
"fullish outside off, defended into the covers"
"huge appeal, and it's given! Sharp turn once again, from just outside off, and Marsh goes on the back foot to flick. Spins too much for him to middle it, and Dhoni does spectacularly to catch it down the leg side after the ball grazes his inside edge"
"tossed up full on off stump, driven to long-off"
"back of a length outside off, punched to the right of deep point"
"back of a length offcutter, spins past the front pad and down the leg side as Handscomb sits back to try and flick"
"fullish outside off, gets forward to ease a drive into the cover point region"
"length ball outside off, Maxwell plays a sliced drive to backward point - I love the way he uses his hands to manipulate where this particular shot goes, but on this occasion he only finds the fielder"
"back of a length close to off stump, shuffles across and punches firmly back to the bowler"
"slower yorker, dips down late past Maxwell's attempt at jabbing down on the ball, beats his inside edge, and <b>only just misses off stump</b>."
"shortish now, in the corridor. Maxwell gets on his toes to punch towards cover"
"flat length ball slides on with the angle, towards leg stump. Handscomb goes back to try and punch square. Cramped for room, he punches straight to extra cover"
"stays back again, jabs this out to backward point"
"a little slower, on off stump, stays back to open his bat face and steer to deep point"
"fullish on middle and leg, defended back down the pitch"
"ooh, well bowled. Comes forward and looks to drive to long-off. Ball doesn't pitch as full as he thinks, and goes on with the arm. Plays it back to the bowler off the inner half of the bat"
"a touch short, goes back to cut but the ball holds up off the surface and he has to adjust, wait, and stab to backward point"
"massive turn. Goes back to a length ball, looking to work it with the spin. There's way more turn than he expects, though, pitches on off stump, raises a cloud of dust, and smacks him on the thigh pad"
"tossed up slower, stretches out to paddle it gently into the fine leg region"
"tossed up on off stump, swept once more to fine leg"
"nicely flighted, dips onto a good length on off stump. Maxwell waits, reads the wrong'un off the pitch, and pushes to extra-cover"
"another wrong'un, and Kuldeep beats Maxwell and causes him to overbalance. MS Dhoni appeals for a stumping... Nah. He lifted his back foot momentarily but he jammed it back down quickly. Lovely delivery, floated this wider than the previous one and Maxwell reached out for it, unsure which way it was turning"
"fuller now, on middle stump, clipped down to long-on"
"length ball angling into off stump, clipped into the leg side and midwicket dives right to stop it"
well bowled. Length ball straightening slightly after angling in towards off stump. Stays back and gets opened up slightly while punching into the covers
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump. Gets on the back foot to push towards mid-on, who's deep enough to allow a scampered single"
"back of a length, angling in towards middle stump. Stays leg-side of the ball to try and manufacture a single into the off side, but extra-cover moves quickly to his left to cut it off"
"full, close to off stump, gets on the front foot and drives straight to cover point"
"back of a length, angling into the top of middle stump. Clipped watchfully to midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, gets a good stride forward to drive but can't beat extra-cover"
"back of a length outside off, punches it away but without too much power, and backward point moves a few steps to his right to stop it"
"a string of dots, Maxwell looks to force it, and Kuldeep gets a bit of inconsistent bounce off the surface to get his man. Shortish, maybe not short enough to pull, and he exposes his stumps as he opens up to do so. Keeps really low and sneaks under his bat to crash into middle stump. India have slowly built some pressure over the last few overs, and the wickets have duly followed. Big, big moment."
"back of a length, pitching just outside off. Worked with the turn through square leg"
"tossed up slow outside off, stretches out to paddle it fine"
"back of a length, wrong'un, turns from leg to off. Stays back and whips to deep square leg"

"back of a length, angling in towards top of off. Blocked back to the bowler"
"back of a length close to off stump, gets back and across to defend into the off side"
"length ball on off stump, and Vijay does very well to dive to his left and stop the ball at mid-off. A crisply timed drive, amounts to nothing"
"fullish slower ball outside off, gets half-forward again and defends gently towards short midwicket, lets the ball hit his bat"
"back of a length close to off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and jabs it into the point region"
"beauty. Tossed up invitingly outside off, Stoinis barely gets a stride in to defend and ends up pushing at the ball, a long way in front of his body. Creates a big gap for the ball to spin through, and only the extra bounce saves him"
"fuller now, clipped gently into the on side"
"tossed up slow outside off, reaches out again for a tentative push back to the bowler"
length ball spinning in towards off stump. Presses forward to defend into the on side
"and he's immediately in action, Kohli the fielder, throws himself to his left after Stoinis presses forward and finds himself nowhere near the pitch of a big-spinning, bouncing stock ball, bat and pad close together. Pops off the outside of his pad, doesn't look like an inside edge, and Kohli can't quite reach it anyway"
"fuller now, driven to sweeper cover"
"fired in flat on middle stump, presses forward and blocks into the on side"
"a little slower, this length ball outside off. Turns away after stopping on the track. Stoinis opens his bat face to ease it behind backward point"
flat length ball straightening towards off stump. Good use of the bottom hand to shovel this standing sweep towards fine leg
"flat length ball on off stump, stays on the back foot and punches to short extra-cover"
"again, stays back to a length ball and punches it to short extra-cover"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump, goes back and flat-bats to long-off"
"floated up slow on off stump, driven to long-off"
"back of a length outside off, hardly any bounce. Makes a bit of room and punches towards extra-cover, where Dhyawan makes a driving stop"
"back of a length again, punched to extra-cover"
"tossed up extremely slow, angling down leg. Paddled away nice and fine to pick up a couple"
"ooh, Dhoni <b>nearly manufactures a wicket out of nowhere!</b> Again it's slow, again the line is leg-stumpish, and again Handscomb looks to paddle. Off the glove, and Dhoni started moving to the leg side as soon as he began shaping for that shot. He's in position, but he's unsighted and has to react with pure instinct, and the ball pops out of his gloves. Excellent anticipation there"
"wider outside off this time, and the ball keeps low to sneak under the attempted sweep"
"flat, angling into the pads, nurdled gently into the square leg region"
"flat, angling towards leg stump, and Handscomb sweeps it away firm and hard to the backward square leg boundary"
"full on off stump, driven to long-on"
"full on leg stump, moves his feet away from the line to drive to long-off"
"flat and full, angling into off stump, clipped to midwicket"
"flat length ball sliding on towards off stump, cramps him for room and he blocks to midwicket"
steps out but with Jadhav bowling so slow - and slinging it through so low - Stoinis can only knock it back where it came from
"good length ball outside off, beats his back-foot push as it curves away in the air"
""
"<b>keeps so low</b> and Stoinis is just about able to whip it to midwicket. Jadhav's line - always attacking the stumps - is so dangerous on slow, unevenly bouncing pitch"
tries to work it away to fine leg but misses making contact
"short and wide, but even then, the lack of pace off the pitch means his cut shot only finds cover"
"turns it towards square leg, searching for a single, but it's not there. Only the wide off that very quick over"
"stays back to a good length ball, backing his skills with the cut shot, but even still he only escapes chopping on."
"goes for the sweep the moment Jadeja's line is on the stumps, wanders off the pad behind square leg"
steps out to turn a full delivery on the stumps into a full toss and thumps it down to long-on
"premeditates the sweep and that allows Jadeja to hang the ball outside the off stump, looking to beat the batsman and set up a stumping. No such luck, even though he does beat the batsman"
sweep again and this one too is outside off - but the key here is Handscomb doesn't premeditate. He only reacts. He knows the ball is on a length. He knows he can get under it and hammer it away to the square leg boundary
"another measured sweep to end the over, single to square leg"
goes back to a length ball that sneaks through at ankle height on middle stump. Manages to clip it away into the leg side
"again he's on the back foot, again there's hardly any bounce. Just outside off this time. Makes room too, to cut. Can only jab it into the covers with a straight bat"
"tossed up slow on leg stump, lovely use of the hands to reverse-paddle it into the fine third man region"
"slow flight once again, outside off. Dhoni sees him shape for the reverse-sweep and moves a couple of steps to his right. And that enables him to deflect the ball away into the point region, off his pad. Could have gone really fine, possibly for four, otherwise"
"length ball close to off stump, punched firmly back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, makes room, and that's driven away brilliantly off the back foot, to the left of extra-cover. Didn't bounce much at all, but he watched it all the way and managed to swing freely through his shot"
"length ball, a bit of late swing in towards off stump. Shapes to drive through the off side initially. Checks his shot and it rolls to mid-on off the inside half of the bat"
"full on middle stump, and that's a super shot from Handscomb, who's really showing off his 50-overs chops here. A step forward, and then he uses his wrists to flick it up and over midwicket"
"what a glorious bit of fielding this is. Shami shortens his length slightly, gets it to tail back in slightly towards off stump. Handscomb presses half-forward, chops to the right of backward point, and calls his partner through for a quick single. Mistake, because who's the fielder at backward point? Ravindra Jadeja. He swoops onto the ball like lightning and hurls down the stumps at the non-striker's end with a fiercely powerful, flat no-bounce throw. What an incredible fielder he is. Handscomb was really hurrying, but no batsman is quicker than the ball"
"back of a length outside off, slapped to the sweeper at deep point"
"very full, almost in the blockhole, on middle stump. Gets his front pad out of the way and jabs into the covers"
"back of a length, drifts down leg. Can't connect with the tuck off the hip"
"length ball on middle and leg, and that's timed beautifully, clipped to the right of midwicket. Deep square leg has to run a long way to his right to stop that"
"flat, shortish, offers up some width, and Stoinis is really playing him well here. Steps back and across and slaps it between cover and extra-cover. Wrong line to bowl without a sweeper back on the fence"
"flat length ball outside off, ends up leaving the batsman off the pitch - just carries on with the angle of drift. Slapped to extra-cover"
"back of a length outside off, stabbed out to deep point"
"back of a length close to off stump, goes with the arm. Punched to short extra-cover"
"comes in with the arm again, cramps him for room as he goes back and across. Manages to punch it down the ground for a single to long-on"
"dangled up super slow outside off. Stoinis is in position to reverse-paddle about two days before the ball arrives, and even Dhoni is in place, anticipating as always. Middles it nicely and picks up two well behind backward point"
length ball angling in towards off stump. Gets half-forward and clips to mid-on
"shortish outside off, nice wristwork at the top of the bounce to play that to the right of backward point, but Jadeja moves so quickly and throws himself at the ball, saves a couple more runs for his team"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump, punched back firmly to the bowler"
"ooh, big angle in from Bumrah. Stoinis looks to stay leg-side of the ball and punch into the covers, only manages a thick inside edge into his pads. Rolls away slowly, square on the off side"
"back of a length, nipping in towards middle and off and cramping Carey for room. Defended towards short extra-cover"
"short, a bit of width, but deep point is in place and all Carey gets for his nice-looking cut is a single"
"tossed up slow, turns from middle to off. Looks to sweep fine, but can only get some glove on it, and it rolls harmlessly for a few yards and stops"
"bit of an appeal for lbw as he presses forward to defend this googly, bat and pad close together. Looks like pad first, but they don't review - not sure if it struck him in line"
"wide stock ball, reaches out to stab it into the point region"
"tossed up slower and closer to off stump, swept away to deep square leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, makes room and cuts it straight to backward point"
"looped up on middle and leg, too full for the full-blooded sweep. Manages to drag it to deep backward square leg, off the bottom half of the bat"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump, uses his wrists to whip it from off stump towards long leg"
"full outside off, Stoinis plays a checked drive to short extra-cover"
"length ball outside off, straightens off the seam to beat Stoinis' angled-bat drive. No footwork at all"
"back of a length close to off stump, keeps a touch low. Defended into the covers"
"back of a length, angles this one sharply in towards leg stump. Extra bounce too, and Stoinis, looking to hurriedly jump and flick, is hit on the thigh pad"
"length ball close to off stump, stays back and eases the ball to the right of extra-cover"
"shortish, spins away from off stump, rocks back and cuts it fiercely, behind square and a long way to the right of Vijay Shankar at sweeper cover. Big effort from the fielder there - a long sprint and a sprawling dive, but he can't quite keep it in"
"again a touch short, this time the cut goes straight to backward point"
"shot! Tossed up on off stump, and it's the stock ball. He clears his front leg and gets down low to slog-sweep it firmly, along the ground and against the turn, to the midwicket boundary"
"short again, the amount of turn he gets forces him to reach for the ball, however, and hit it straighter than he'd strictly like. Slapped to the fielder at sweeper cover"
"shot! Australia needed a big over, and they're getting it against Kuldeep Yadav. Sees some flight and jumps down the track to launch this high and far, with the turn, over long-on"
"tossed up full just outside off, too full to drive firmly, just about jabs it back to the bowler"
"shortish, cramps him with the angle in towards off stump. Chopped away to third man"
"back of a length, and some movement back in off the seam to beat Stoinis' inside edge as he looks to punch through mid-on/midwicket. Hits him on the back leg, and Shami goes up in appeal, but it's probably going over the top of the stumps, and definitely missing leg too"
"full, angling into middle and off, clipped to long-on"
"back of a length, again gets some late movement, this time towards off stump, to cramp Stoinis. Pokes it into the cover point region to pick up one"
"short, sits up outside off, may have been the slower one. Pulled to deep midwicket"
"low full-toss, tails in towards leg stump. Punched to long-on, shows the full face"
"and he starts with a short ball dragged down outside off stump. Stoinis is seeing them very well here, and he cracks it away to the point boundary"
"back of a length, turns in towards the hip, worked away to deep square leg"
"he's conceding runs, but with Kuldeep Yadav a wicket is always round the corner. Wrong'un, floated up wide of off stump. Too full to sweep, and Carey only manages to drag it onto his stumps off the bottom edge"
flighted ball pitching on middle stump and sliding on with the angle. Props forward and defends into the off side
"short outside off and Coulter-Nile slaps it up in the air, into the gap to the left of long-off"
"flighted ball on off stump, Coulter-Nile goes for the big heave with the turn, and he doesn't connect all too cleanly but lands the ball in the gap between long-on and deep midwicket. Kuldeep ends with figures of 3 for 54."
"back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face to steer towards third man"
"bowled him! Not the best shot from Coulter-Nile. He's been going after everything, and this is particularly risky, making room to try and cut Bumrah. That wicked angle does the rest, and there's no bat involved as the ball sneaks through and knocks back middle stump"
"full, angling in towards middle and leg. Keeps his pad out of the way and blocks it back to the bowler"
"lovely delivery, and there's a big appeal for a low catch behind. Dhoni thinks it's out. They're taking this upstairs, and the soft signal is out. Length ball angling into a fourth-stump line, and it straightens off the pitch. Cummins pokes at it, gets a thin edge, and Dhoni, falling forward and to his right, takes this low chance as cleanly as possible. Bumrah is turning it on here"
"back of a length, and again he angles it into the corridor and gets it to jag away off the seam. Lyon pushes at it and fails to put bat on ball"
"ooh, again he gets it to straighten, this time from a fuller length and an off-stump line. Lyon is half-forward, and again he pushes inside the line, but gets a vital thick edge that sends the ball rolling down to third man"
"full on off stump, clipped away to deep midwicket"
"back of a length close to off stump, stabbed to Jadhav at backward point. No run was available, and they weren't going for one, but Jadhav throws to the batsman's end anyway. Would have been okay if the midwicket fielder had backed up properly, but Rayudu fumbles and Stoinis gets back on strike"
"back of a length, nips back into off stump to cramp Stoinis for room. He simply blocks it back to the bowler"
"back of a length, and that's a super shot. Fifth-stump line, so not a particularly bad ball, but he waits, and uses his wrists brilliantly to open his bat face slightly and carve it to the left of the diving backward point fielder"
"back of a length, a little wider, chopped down to third man"
"in the blockhole on middle stump, some late swing in as well - he's been getting the old ball to do that right through - and Lyon juuust gets his bat down in time to flick to long leg. Stoinis refuses the single, he wants the strike"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, gets a nice stride in and defends it back down the pitch, solidly. Bumrah lets it run, willing Stoinis to take the single as mid-off ambles towards the ball. No way is Stoinis taking that single"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended to extra-cover. Stoinis is doing the Dhoni thing here, rightly. The asking rate isn't all that steep even now"
"in the blockhole, angling in towards off stump. Opens his bat face and squeezes it out to backward point"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked solidly into the off side"
"well, there's little he can do about this. The Bumrah special, angling into the corridor, pitching on a good length, straightening away, beating the outside edge as Stoinis presses forward, looking for a push into the off side"
"back of a length, angling into off stump. The one ball you might presume Bumrah might bowl. Stoinis shuffles across and nudges it away into the backward square leg region to retain strike. Once we know which way the result goes, this over could assume a lot of meaning in hindsight."
"back of a length, angling into middle stump. Looks to make room to hit through the off side, can't find it. Punches it back to the bowler"
"back of a length, angling into middle and leg. Steps across this time, whips it in the air, juuust out of reach of Kuldeep diving to his left and backwards at square leg, brings up his fifty"
"length ball on off stump, shuffles across again to clip through square leg. Takes the single now, leaves Lyon three balls to keep out."
"short outside off, makes a bit of room and slaps to deep point"
"sees Stoinis looking to manufacture room and bowls a back-of-a-length ball angling into leg stump and cramping him for room. Swiped down to long-on, not much power on it"
"full-toss, angling marginally down leg, and Lyon swings at it and gets a critical bit of bat on it. Fine leg was back, but he was too square, and this absolutely flies over the turf and gives him no chance"
"big appeal, and it's given! Immediate review too. Nowhere near short enough to pull, and not full enough to loft over mid-on, and he's caught between the two. It's angling in towards leg stump. Misses, and it hits him on the back leg. Looked out on first viewing, and it still looks out now. Let's see what ball-tracking has to say. No bat on it. Umpire's call on leg stump, and Stoinis has to walk back dejected. An excellent innings, he's kept Australia in it right up to now. And they still just need one big hit, even if it's Nos. 10 and 11 at the crease"
"length ball on off stump, makes room and jabs into the point region. Backward point dives right and gets a hand to it, but it rolls away from him and they can run a second"
"in the blockhole, and it's all over! He played a lovely innings at No. 5, and now he's bowled a great over under pressure. Full, straight, aiming at middle stump, and Zampa, making room to try and carve it away through point, fails to connect"
