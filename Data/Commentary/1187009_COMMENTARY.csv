"length, outside off, and a touch of swing away, as it beats Agarwal who stretches and looks to poke at it"
"slants into him, and he he plays it with the angle down towards long leg. There's some work for the man down their to get to his right, and they are able to pick up two"
"length, outside off, and this one dies on Klaasen behind the wicket. He picks it up after a bounce"
"fuller, and he brings his bat down in time to guide it to the left of point. Dane Piedt there, cannot get down on time to stop this from going to the boundary. <strong>Some away swing for Rabada again!</strong>"
"swing away from a good length just outside off, and he leaves"
"down the leg side, well collected by the keeper"
"fuller, swings away, and Rohit defends"
"a touch shorter, angles into him, and he rides the bounce and plays it to the right of square leg. They nick a single comfortably"
"length, outside off, and Agarwal leaves. The ball rises consistently after passing him, forcing Klaasen to collect it high over his left shoulder"
"length, outside off, and Agarwal defends this towards point"
"length, outside off, nibbles away, and he has a tentative poke at it but eventually lets it pass"
"length, and comes back at him with some good bounce. He gets on this toes and defends this towards gully"
"<strong>oh, what a beauty!</strong> This goes like a swift leg-break. Pitches on a good length just outside off, and then moves away, beating Rohit as he looks to defend from the crease"
"length, outside off, moving away, and he leaves"
"length, jags back into him, and there's a muffled lbw appeal. Possibly jumping over leg stump, though. Well over, in fact!"
"length, and he defends this back down the wicket"
"length, moves away and goes past the outside of the bat again. <strong>Terrific bowling in this particular over thus far!</strong>"
"length, outside off, and he lets it pass"
"length, but wide enough outside off stump to allow the batsman to let it pass"
"length, outside off, going on with the angle, and Agarwal leaves. Wasn't too far off the off-stump, but he was happy to let it pass"
"length, outside off, and he leaves. The ball swings away and lifts on its way through behind hte wicket"
"length, outside off, and beats a defensive prod. Dies on its way through to Klaasen. <strong>Signs of variable bounce inside the first 15 minutes!</strong>"
"length, swings away outside off, and he leaves"
"down the leg side, and he can't lay any bat on it"
"length, moves in from outside off, and Rohit defends. This was delivered at <strong>147kph</strong>"
"length, outside off, and he leaves as it swings away. This was <strong>140.4kph</strong>"
"shorter, and he rides this nicely as it angles into him. Runs it along towards where a short fine leg might have been. Gets an easy single, as Klaasen has to move across to his left to stop this"
"<strong>slightly streaky, but four!</strong> Good pace and bounce as it squares him up from just outside off. He has a poke at it, but is able to guide it through the area between gully and second slip"
"length, nips back and strikes him on the pad as he plays from the crease. Healthy bounce on this, and also possibly slipping down leg stump. An appeal, but not with any great degree of conviction"
"<strong>this has gone through to third slip and been taken!</strong> Draws Agarwal forward with another ball swinging away from a length, and Agarwal, who had poked at a few of these, is forced to play at it. It dies on its way through to Elgar, but he takes a good, sharp catch low to his right. South Africa have that vital breakthrough, and this is India's lowest opening partnership of this series yet"
"length, outside off, and it beats Rohit, and just goes past his off stump as well. Another ball that keeps low! Wry smiles all around from the visitors' camp"
"length, outside off, and swing away from Rohit, who leaves"

"just a  bit shorter, movement away, and Rohit wants nothing to do with this"

"length, outside off, and he lets this pass"
"length, jags back and strikes him on the pads. An appeal, but South Africa realise the bounce that Rabada is getting might have taken it just over. <strong>Good ball, though!</strong>"
"fuller, swings away, and Pujara leaves after having a good look at it"
"length, nips back in, and he presses forward to defend"
"length, outside off, swings away, and Pujara leaves"
"length, outside off, some bounce, and takes the toe-end of Pujara's bat as he looks to get up on his toes and ride this bounce. It goes along the ground to third slip"
"fuller again, but just down the leg side. Pujara eyes an opportunity to whip it away for runs, but is beaten by the sheer pace. Rabada realises his plan is a good one, but the execution just lets him down"
"length, just outside off, and Rohit defends straight back down the wicket"
"shorter, and Rohit hangs back to defend this with a dead bat"
"shorter, wider, and Rohit <strong>takes the bait</strong>! Has a waft at it, but misses out. Goes through to Klaasen, who picks it ahead of first slip"
"fuller length, but wide of off stump. Some good swing away, but Rohit can afford to leave this. Bowled at <strong>135.2kph</strong>"
"length, outside off, and left alone. Dies on its way through to the keeper again"
"length, but outside off, and this time Rohit is able to get it between gully and point. <strong>Not entirely intentional</strong>, but he did play it with an open face of the blade. Ngidi just trying a bit hard to get Rohit to play outside off, and the one time he does, he gets four!"
"length, on off stump, and Pujara drops it dead at his feet"
"length, outside off, and he leaves"
"this one nips back in and strikes him on the pad. Loud appeal for leg before, but not given. <strong>South Africa review this!</strong> The replays look good for the visitors, in fact. It's not a great stride forward, and there is no bat involved. It hits Pujara on the back pad, and it is out, for sure!"
"short, and <strong>well-directed</strong>! Fast, and angles into him. Kohli, who looks to press forward initially, has to bend and get out of the way"
"swings away from a good length outside off, and Kohli leaves"
"length, and Kohli defends from the crease as the ball goes on with the angle into him"
"back of a length, shapes into him, and he defends after getting on top of the bounce"
"shorter, and he gets on top of this and punches it wide of cover. Glorious to watch, though he couldn't get it past the imaginary 30-yard circle"
presses forward to defend a length ball outside off
"length, nips back in, and he defends"
"slightly shorter length, outside off, and he presses forward to defend this. Runs it along the ground towards gully. This was a better line, attacking the stumps a bit more"
"back of a length, on off, and he defends"
"fuller, swings away a touch, but Rohit does well to cover the movement and defend this"
"<strong>is that another for Rabada?</strong> Given out leg before, but Rohit has reviewed immediately. What a gorgeous ball, though! But it has gotten an inside edge. That is all that could have saved him! Good length, shaped back in a touch, and did beat him for pace and movement, but got a healthy nick back on to his pads"
presses forward to defend a length ball on off stump
"looks to go fuller, but ends up delivering a low full toss on middle and leg. Rohit whips it away, but well fielded by a man at a short midwicket position"
"length, outside off, nipping away and lifts on its way through to Klaasen. Rohit leaves, but that was another really ball!"
"<strong>oh, a beauty!</strong> Another sharp leg-break, that pitches around off and then moves sharply away. Rohit is squared up completely, and just thankful that this has fizzed past his outside edge"
"length, outside off, and he stretches forward to defend this"
"fuller, but down the leg side, and Kohli has no problems in getting some bat on it to whip it along to fine leg. <strong>Off the mark in style!</strong>"

"length, outside off, and Rohit defends"

"shorter, <strong>bowled at 144.6kph</strong>, and Rohit gets behind this to defend"
"length, around off, and swings away. Rohit leaves"

"full on the stumps from wide of the crease, punched to mid-on"
"hint of a mix-up in the running, <strong>Rohit may have been in trouble</strong> with a direct hit from point. Just a tap, the throw was lobbed. Hamza the fielder"
"floated full outside off, this keeps a touch low but Rohit is right behind the line in defence"
"back of length outside off, left alone"
"hits the deck hard but the length is down leg, brushes Kohli's thigh pad as it bounces through to Klaasen"
"touch of discomfort as this rises towards Kohli's hips, tucked behind square. Replays confirm <b> Kohli was rapped on the glove there </b>"
"pulled imperiously! Short outside off, Rohit swivels and hammers that in front of square. Not a full-blooded pull, more a slap. Superbly done"
"shall I play, shall I leave? In the end, jabs at the ball as it rolls to gully"
<strong>beaten on the inside edge</strong> as he pushes at this full delivery outside off
delightful timing as he flicks this wide of mid-on
"touch full and just outside off, good leave"
uncharacteristic from Kohli! Beaten by a full delivery as he's <strong>sucked into a drive</strong>. No feet from Kohli there
"<strong>absolute magic from Nortje for his first Test wicket!</strong> Got two deliveries to move away, and this one comes back in. Length is full, Kohli plays outside the line and is struck on the pad. Dare I say, that's plumb. <strong>Kohli reviews</strong> but it will stay as umpire's call as replays confirm this would've hit the outside of leg. Kohli is gone and India are in trouble now. Umpire's call will stay."

"stretches to meet a fuller bal on his pads, and defends it back down the pitch"

"length, on the pads, and he can tuck this away towards long leg"

Banged in short at the head of de Kock, he is cramped up for room and caught in an awkward tangle. De Kock looks away and helplessly fends at it. The ball balloons off the glove and Saha pouches it behind the stumps"

"slower through the air, angling into middle stump, Faf defends"
"angles a full delivery in from wide of the crease, defended back"
"draws him forward with the length, neatly defended"
that's a <strong>freebie down leg</strong> and Hamza flicks this uppishly to beat fine leg. Easy pickings
"flicked again, tried to keep it down but couldn't. Nadeem with the chase from midwicket and he does really well to hare behind that and tumble across to stop that. Saved one run for his side"
"this is an absolute beauty! Faf cannot believe it! The length does the trick again. Length and thereabouts, but lands it on the seam around middle and off, the ball swerves a wee bit and then nips away to beat Faf's outside edge as he looks to defend forward and hears the stumps rattled. Absolute peach, a delivery Umesh will want to look at over and over again."

"skiddy length delivery outside off, defended from the crease"

eased wide of cover for a quick single
"pushed to mid-on for a quick single, Umesh with the throw but he was just a split-second late to react. Direct hit would've been close"

"shorter, and he rocks back and drives it to long on"
"length, straighter, and he whips it away towards deep mid-wicket. Shahbaz Nadeem misfields as he goes over from square leg to field, and that allows them to come back for the second"

"goes back to defend this, it is driven towards cover. There's a direct hit at the non-striker's end, but Hamza had been sent back in good time"
"slides on, goes in quickly, and strikes him on the pad as he stretches forward. Impact may have been outside off, though, and that dissuades them from going for a review as it was not given out"

stretches forward to defend a length ball around off
"presses forward to defend one fired towards leg stump. Not able to lay bat on it, but not give. <strong>India have reviewed this, though</strong>. Doesn't seem to have any bat on it, but the line might have taken it down leg. And that's how it is. India lose a review too"
"<strong>he gets his man anyway!</strong> Similar ball to the previous one, fired in from wide of the crease, and Hamza, who has preferred to stay on the back foot, goes back yet again, hoping to get enough room for a pull or a flick. The ball speeds on, beats his bat, and goes on to hit leg stump. Jadeja lets out a roar in approval, and Hamza's elegant resistance comes to an end"
"fuller, and he presses forward to defend this"
"length, turns away sharply after pitching around off, and he runs it off the outer edge towards point"
"length, angles into him, and takes the inner edge of the bat onto pad and falls at his feet as he stretches to meet this"
"<strong>Nadeem gets his first wicket!</strong> Flights this a bit more, pitched around middle and leg, and Bavuma skips forward to defend, but the turn on it takes him by surprise. Bounces past his outside edge and he's hopelessly spreadeagled as he realises this is heading straight into Saha's mitts, who makes no mistake. No need for the third umpire on this! Nadeem celebrates this, as he must, because it was a carefully laid out trap. Spinners sometimes need to keep the one that turns a bit more up their sleeve, and that's exactly what he has done in this little spell!"
"sharp turn from over the wicket to the left-hander, aimed at hte rough, and also takes a puff of dust as it comes through to him, but he moves out of the line and allows it to hit him on the pads"
"first runs off Nadeem, and first runs for Linde. Aims this at the foot marks outside off, and it doesn't turn as much. Linde can go back and run this down towards third man"
"hangs back and cuts away a short ball around off stump. Poor length, and duly punished. Klaasen gets his first runs, too!"

"tossed up, around off, and he stretches to defend"
presses forward to defend a length ball
"length, a bit slower, and he allows this to come to him before defending"
"length, outside off, and he presses forward to defend. <strong>India are excited about a potential caught-behind as Saha collects!</strong> Jadeja wants a review, but silly point tells him not to. Possibly the sound of bat hitting ground"

"allows this to turn into him, and he drops it with a dead bat"
"length, around off and middle, and he defends with bat and body close together"
"length, darting down the leg side, but he goes back and allows it to come into him. Defended towards the on side"

"just back of a length, and he goes back to punch this towards extra cover"
"<strong>another top delivery from Jadeja!</strong> Tosses this up around off and middle, with a beautiful bit of drift. Klaasen comes forward, but doesn't have the perfect straight bat to defend. He's looking to perhaps poke this towards mid-wicket, but it pitches, fizzes past his bat and strikes the top of off. The dream delivery for a left-arm spinner!"
presses forward to defend a length ball around off
"fired in quicker, and doesn't turn as much. Goes off the inside of the bat as Piedt looks to press forward and defend. Runs away towards square leg, and Jadeja and the fielders have smiles on their faces"
"looks for a flatter ball, but strays down the pads. Runs off the pads towards fine leg"
"length, just outside off, and he goes back to defend this"
"length, and he stretches and then sweeps this away towards deep backward square leg. Good shot, but can be dangerous given Nadeem is aiming for the rough outside off"

beaten as he wafts at a length ball outside off. Hardly carries to Saha again
"rooted to the crease, ball angles in, beats him for pace and thuds him low on the left pad. That is plumb, would've crashed into leg stump."

sharp turn but Rabada is well forward as he defends
skids back in from around the stumps but sliding down leg as it strikes Rabada high on the pad
confidently driven to mid-off
"<b> Umesh with a direct hit! </b> Rabada thumped hit to mid-off, Umesh with a diving stop but he recovers quickly despite the half-stop and fires a throw on the bounce at the non-striker's end. How heartening it is to see an Indian fast bowler display this kind of athleticism and rocket throws. South Africa are folding very quickly."
"drifting into middle and leg, Nortje gets well forward and defends"
"<strong>quick bouncer. Rip roaring bouncer!</strong> Angled into his ribcage. Nortje somehow manages to get out of the way, this one hits him on the right shoulder. Steep bounce from Shami. Uff"

"fired full on the stumps, defended"
"steps out to hoick across the line, saved by a thin inside edge onto the pad, luckily it also didn't lob to silly point"
"has it come off the inside edge again? Lobbed to gully. Saha certainly seems to suggest so. Ashwin initialy went up for an lbw. We're told it's an lbw appeal. If that's the case, it was sliding down, I reckon.Yes, ball tracking confirms as much and <b> India lose their review </b> They have none left."
"struck on the pad again as he plays all around it, drifting down. Big appeal but the trajectory and angle was similar. Would've missed leg"

"Umesh removes Linde, and that's one swish outside off too many! Length ball, well wide of off, and Linde takes the bait in looking for a booming drive. Flies off the outside edge and goes waist-heigh towards Rohit Sharma at second slip, who makes no mistake. Umesh Yadav has a wide grin on his face as he celebrates this dismissal. He's been India's best bowler in this innings, and has the numbers in the wickets column to show for it"

"<strong>GOT 'IM!</strong> What is it about Indian new ball bowlers and their first over in this Test? Umesh Yadav bounds in, and sends de Kock's off stump cartwheeling with a perfect length ball just around off and middle.

"shapes away from a length, outside off, and he shoulders arms"
"<strong>Shami gets in on the act too now!</strong> Perfect length, and just straightens after being angled in. Like a quick leg-break, and Hamza is just a touch late on it.

That's the end of Faf du Plessis for this tour, one that began with a defiant innings from the lower-middle order in Vizag, but ends in a whimper!"

"<strong>smacked on the helmet!</strong> Elgar immediately is on the ground, Indians rush towards him to see if he's alright. The physio rushes in. <b> They've called an early tea. </b> Wonder if he'll continue to bat. He's holding the right side of his head, just above the ear. He seems shaken. Coming back to the ball, this was banged in short, 145kph or thereabouts, Elgar took his eyes off the ball and is hit just above the ear on the helmet. He looks dazed and is still sitting pitch side even as the Indian players slowly start to trudge off for tea."

driven but straight to Kohli at cover
"<strong>excellent catch from Saha!</strong> This kept low,  de Bruyn was looking to step out but then decided to change his shot because Nadeem cleverly shortened his length. Now, de Bruyn looks to cut but gets an under-edge that Saha pouches superbly because he stayed low."
"<strong>he's caught and bowled under the most extraordinary circumstances!</strong> Ngidi sees this tossed up delivery and swings this across the line, so hard that Nortje at the non-striker's end has no time to react and is smacked on his left wrist as the ball pops up. Nadeem is alert to the possibility of a rebound and grabs this easy."
