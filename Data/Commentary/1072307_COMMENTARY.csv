*approx"
"angled across from over the wicket, good length and left alone"
"oh, big shout for lbw second ball to Stoneman, caught falling across his stumps... pitched outside leg? Umpire Marais Erasmus shakes his head. There was certainly some inswing for Hazlewood"
"full and gets him on the front foot, Stoneman clouts a drive straight to cover"

"good length, shaping on off at 142kph and defended"
"touch straighter from Starc, 145kph but nudged calmly to leg for Cook's first run of the day"
"blimey, that's a beaut of a ball! No chance of Stoneman getting anything on that, fired in and then seaming, rising like a hellbeast from the deep, past the outside edge as the batsman is completely squared up"
"flings this on to the pads and Stoneman clips it fine, runs away for four"
"four more, Stoneman clubs past square leg... Starc seems to be striving for the lbw but he's been put away a couple of times, as happened in the second innings at Adelaide"
"and another, crumped through point! Confident stuff from Stoneman, who lashes it square coming forwards. Adrenalin pumping"
banged in on a length and left alone outside off
"length on off, 143kph but Cook covers it and shows a straight bat"

"full, 146kph from Starc, Cook nearly loses his footing but squirts away a glance wide of fine leg for two more"
"full and fast, 149kph and <b>trapped in front!</b> No review from Cook, he knows that was plumb... Starc finds his line and sends a searing attempted yorker into the pads, no big innings for Cook in his 150th Test (at least for now); too slow to get the bat down and his lean series continues"
"pitched up, full and tempting in the corridor, left alone"
"closer to off stump, 146kph and zipping through as Vince again leans out and watchfully shoulders arms"

"dug in short, Stoneman takes his bottom hand off as he fends and keeps the ball down... and this has actually broken his bat handle! That's the second stick of Stoneman's that has needed replacing in this series"
sliding down the leg side as Stoneman flicks at it
"banged in, rising towards the eyeline, jabbed in the air towards point - <b>but it falls short again!</b> That came flying off the shoulder of the bat, no idea where it was going. Stoneman being given a torrid working over here"

"tight line, length delivery but it's well judged and left alone"

"fired in straighter, clipped off the inside edge on to the pads"
"attacking the stumps, Vince isn't quite so comfortable playing this but he manages to poke it away to safety"
"fullish length, sliding into the pads, worked in front of square without timing"

"short, that's an awkward length, Stoneman gets in a bit of a tangle once again but manages to drop the ball at his feet"
"bouncer, wide of off stump, Stoneman ignores it and Paine couldn't lay a glove on the ball either - the WACA bounce of old, four byes bringing up the England 50 to contented Barmy Army gurgles around the ground"
pitched up and neatly dabbed into a gap coming forwards for one
"full of a length, Stoneman is forward again and clipping through the covers"
shuffles across and lets the ball go

 getting full value for them"
"dug in short and outside off, Stoneman throws his hands at the ball, and watches it zip past the outside edge"

"back of a length and angling into middle, defended back"
"much fuller and slanting in on off, 140.1ks, played back to the bowler again"
"There's the (fatal) cover drive from Vince and he nicks it off with six minutes to go for lunch. Good length and hung up outside off, Vince can't restrain himself from having a crack at it. He wafts away from the body and feathers it behind to Paine. Vince loses his patience, Hazlewood reaps reward for keeping his patience"
"full and zipping through outside off, 147ks, left alone"
"another full tempter, bends back in sharply from outside off, finishes just outside off, Root isn't tempted"

"on the pads and clipped towards miwidwicket, quickly tidied up in the field"
"short ball, at the batsman - <b>takes the blow on the side of the helmet!</b> Yowch, that's going to leave a ringing in the ears, though Stoneman is able to walk away and take off his lid unaided. The stem-guards popped off, as they often do, but the protective gear absorbed most of the impact, I think"
"banged in, helluva ball for Stoneman to face straight after that blow to the head, he fends into the air... but now <b>Lyon drops it leaping forwards from point!</b> Really tough chance coming in as the ball died but he got the hands there, couldn't hold on!"
"length outside off, 144kph and defened. Steady"
"dug in, a genuine bouncer, flying through as Stoneman weaves out of the way"

"gottim, <b>tickled down the leg side!</b> Root fails to calm the roiling waters as Cummins gets him again, 146kph and it <i>just</i> flicks the gloves on its way through as he looked to turn off his hip! What a way to go, a huge breakthrough for Australia"
"round the wicket, hits a length and Malan defends"
"yeesh, that's practically turned Malan into a pretzel! Short and rearing at the throat as he jerks the head out of the way, almost bending over backwards to evade it"
"yip, beats the bat again! Good length and rising sharply as it holds its line, Stoneman not quite committing"
"dug in, 138kph and this time he ducks successfully"

"short, over the stumps, tapped down back towards the bowler"
"angled in with the arm, 146kph and tucked to the leg side from back in the crease"
"ripping bouncer, Stoneman throws up the hands and is beaten... or is he? <b>No, there was a flick of glove on it!</b> Paine took a leaping catch and Australia quickly <b>reviewed</b> Erasmus' not-out decision, with Aleem Dar determining that a ripple on Snicko was evidence of contact. Erasmus has to reverse the call and up goes the finger, Stoneman's gutsy knock is over! That was a snorter, unlucky for the batsmen on several levels"

"short but not enough width to free the arms, YJB chops it down towards backward point"

"<b>A direct hit could have had Malan at the striker's end</b>. Warner swoops down on the ball at short cover but fails to throw the stumps down. Back of a length on off, tip and run. Risky... and England get away"

"sliding onto leg stump, forward and blocked back"
"Did the carry to Bancroft at forward short leg? The reactions of the Australian fielders suggest it probably din't. Tossed-up offbreak and dips on leg stump, this is a full-blooded flick from Malan. Bancroft, it seemed like, was make taking evasive action rather than going for the ball"

"back of a length, super ball and it's through him again - <b>but did it kiss the edge?</b> Paine's reaction was the giveaway, as he took a tumbling catch, looks like it flicked the back leg... Very similar to a couple of Malan's dismissals in the series so far against Cummins"

Looked like he might have been across outside off, plus height may be an issue with the WACA bounce - but let's see. No bat involved, so it's on to Hawk-Eye: which has impact 'umpire's call' and the ball going over the stumps. So Malan survives and <b>Australia lose a review</b>"

"good ball, length pushed across outside off, Bairstow's feet don't move and feels for it away from his body. Things already happening with the newy"
"another outside edge! This one flies down to third man. A full delivery, at the stumps, Bairstow aims to work it through the leg side and the it skims wide of gully. Not a chance"

gets inside the line of a back-of-a-length ball and plays to midwicket

"length, 143kph and pushed down into the off side"
"crashing into the pads, Malan stuck on the crease... Erasmus shakes his head, Starc looks anguished! Was it sliding down? Australia go for the <b>review</b>, though it seems more in hope than expectation; yes, replays quickly show that Malan was standing on leg, it hit him <i>just about</i> in line, but would have missed the timbers according to Hawk-Eye - so <b>Australia lose their second review</b>, and they won't get them back, either"
"good length in the corridor, comes across and leaves alone"

"back of a length, 136kph, defended on off stump"
"lovely stroke, not all that full from Cummins but he steps across and times it beautifully on the up, outruns the fielder to the rope"

"pitched up and clipped to square leg, no run there"
"there it is! Takes the short ball and swings it down to fine leg, <b>Bairstow has his fourth Test hundred</b> and first in the Ashes! An immaculate knock, fully justifying his promotion to No6, and it's helped put England well on top"

forward and taped to cover
"tossed outside off, blocked to the covers again"
"It takes a terrific catch from the sub fielder - Handscomb - to end a terrific stand. Malan dares to step out and hit against the break over wide mid-on/midwicket. He is nowhere close to the pitch of this offbreak and ends up skewing it to backward point, where Handscomb judges it expertly and completes a sprawling catch - horizontal to the ground. The fifth-wicket stand ends at 237 - 18 shy of the <a href='http://stats.espncricinfo.com/england/engine/records/fow/highest_partnerships_by_wicket.html?class=1;id=1;type=team' target='_blank'>all-time record for England</a>"
"sprayed on the pads, glanced fine on the leg side"
"feisty bouncer, ducks under it"
"<strong>Just like that Australia have plucked out two wickets in four balls</strong>! Cummins runs in hard, hits the pitch harder, and bounces out Moeen. This one bursts from a back of a length outside off, Moeen stays leg side of the ball and has a flirt at it. He winds up gloving it behind to Smith at wide-ish second slip"
"dug in on middle, sails over the left shoulder of Woakes to the keeper"
"back of a length, hurtles in to <strong>ping the glove</strong> and wander away to the right of short leg"
"shortish and down leg, Woakes gets out of the way"
Cummins has Woakes hopping and skipping. He rushes the batsman for pace and forces him to fend to leg
"good length and outside off, no shot"
full and hung up wide outside off - wider than a set of stumps outside off - Bairstow flashes an outside edge past second slip. The ball streaks away to the third-man boundary

"rising ball outside off, Woakes rises with it and pats it down"
"back of a length and arrowed down leg, the batsman shuffles inside the line but does not make contact with a glance"
"Woakes splices an outside edge to the third-man boundary. Short and climbs outside off, Woakes has a crack at it and sends it flying past the right of second slip"
follows the short stuff with a much fuller ball. Woakes is concentrating as his assured footwork suggests. He presses right forward to negotiate it
and now Cummins pushes him back with a short ball on middle. Fended away to the leg side

"dug in short and angling in just a shade outside off, YJB bails out of the hook"
"back of a length on off, punched off the front foot to cover"
"back of a length and straighter in line, tucked to deep midwicket"
"pitched up and outside off, right up Woakes' alley. He leans out and creams a drive through the covers. So easy on the eye"
Cummins runs in from long leg dives forward to snap up a smart catch. Good change-up from Hazlewood: he follows up a very full ball with a shorter one on the hips. Woakes shapes for a flick-pull but ends up flapping a catch to the man in the deep. Make that three wickets in five overs
"dug in on middle, Overton camps back and fends it off"
"good length ball on middle, he covers up in defence"
"Starc returns and floors the middle stump. This is pretty full - not quite a yorker - and jags back in. Bairstow aims for a leg-side flick, but doesn't account for the inward movement. The ball takes the inside edge and rattles the stumps. England have lost four wickets in six overs. Nonetheless, excellent innings from YJB"

"back of a length, angling away from over the wicket, ducking away past the outside edge"
"Broad backs away outside leg and exposes all three stumps. Starc goes outside off, Broad hits it over the top. Lifted over extra cover. Lyon chases, Broad takes three and exposes Jimmy to Starc. Not a great idea from Broad"

"straight one to start off, at a length. Defended comfortably on the back foot"
"<b>it looks like Anderson has trapped him</b> right in front of middle stump. It's been given. It's also been reviewed. Slightly fuller length ball from the last one, nips back in a touch. Marsh sitting on the back foot and he's beaten on the inside edge. The reviews shows no edge...and tracking tells us that's clipping the top of the stumps for what will remain an <b>umpire's call</b> and that is an abrupt end to Marsh's innings"

"<b>another review.</b> Smith is hit on the pad in front of middle, just like Marsh. There were a couple of sounds. Umpire's said not out...there's no bat on the replay. And ball tracking says that's hitting! Decision overturned. A good review from England. Anderson was unsure, because of the sounds I reckon. Smith was playing down the wrong line as this one straightened from a middle stump line. He was right back in the crease as he is wont to do. England hitting the right spots this morning. Smith's highest score will read 239. An epic ends"
"back of a length, slanted across off stump. Poked into the covers on the up"
"length at middle stump, bunted uppishly towards short midwicket"
"and it turns out that man is a catching fielder too. One that Starc almost finds. Lifts this length ball on the up, and it lands short"
"full, swinging in at leg stump. Inside edge and onto the pad as his head falls over during the attempted flick"
"<b>oh dear</b> Starc has messed this one up. Paine's blinded - he's just taken a big inswinger on the pad as he's looked to flick. It's flown towards gully as England make the appeal. Starc's called for the run, then realised there's no chance. Paine's halfway down when he gets the call for no. A bit of an empty stare between the batsmen before Starc decides it'll be him who takes the fall. England have a mere walk to clip the stumps at the striker's end"
<b>nearly another run out</b>. At the non-striker's this time. Paine drops this length ball in the gully region and takes off. The fielder can't hit the stumps

If anything saves him it'll be that. There's no edge...and it's missing! Big stride, helped by where he started this shot, helps him make that review straight away. This is swinging in and climbing over leg stump. Good review"

"<b>he's holed out and they've declared.</b> Anderson goes full just outside off, Lyon clears the front leg and heaves for midwicket. Not quite the connection he hoped for. It's gone high and it's wobbly, but Moeen Ali is smart as he gets under it at mid-on"
"short and way down leg side, Cook won't go after that"
"back of a length on leg stump, a bit of climb. He gets on top of it and glances to fine leg"
"good length, very late - and very little - swing away from off stump as he strides forward. Thick outside edge dribbles wide of gully"
"good length at off stump, defended on the back foot"
"back of a length on middle stump, a hint of shape away but it skids through off the pitch. Clips it off the thigh guard to deep square"
"oh close. Starc goes very full, in at off stump. Cook looks like he's anticipating this to away from him. Plonks the front leg across nervously and narrowly escapes being beaten on the inside edge"
"short and wide. Hunting for some movement inwards, but this slants across and is left alone"
"and this time it's the batsman hunting for the inswinger. This hits a crack at an off stump line. He's covering his off stump and looking to defend, but it nips away and dies on the keeper after beating the outside edge"
"good length at off stump, defended on the front foot"
"short ball rising in the corridor. On his toes to attempt a short-arm pull, beaten on the inside edge"
"<b>got him!</b> Elementary corridor bowling. He's taken it away from the crack, he's gotten it to rise, he's offered the pull and he's kept plugging it in. All in a span of five balls. Stoneman's thinking about a lot already and that leads to a lazy push at this length ball slanted across him. No feet, bat away from the body, taken by Paine"
"very late forward defence. This is in the channel too, at a length. He bunts it into the turf in the direction of the slips"
full and straight again from Starc. Honing in at middle stump. Cook offers no feet as he defends very very late in front middle stump
nicely done. This is length and into the pads and the timing is exquisite on the flick. Races away to fine leg's right
"back of a length and down leg side, through to the keeper"
"good length and shaping in to the corridor, left alone"
good length at off stump. No feet once more as he closes the face and drags this wide of mid-on
"back of a length at middle stump, defended on the back foot"
"back of a length in the corridor, lifting inwards, left alone"
"good length outside off, left alone on the angle"
"back of a length, in the corridor. Left alone"
"oh hits the crack. Hazlewood is dangerous on this kind of a wicket. This one stops on Cook at a middle stump line. Anxious prod, into the leg side"
"and now he takes it away from a similar line. Cook looks to defend on the back foot, beaten on the outside edge"
"length at off stump, Cook leaps to defend off the outside half"
"good length at off stump, defended very close to the body, into the leg side"
"the get-Vince ball. Full, wide, juicy outside off. He leaves it alone"
"beauty. The Vince-drive next ball. This is full too, but a lot closer to him outside off. He's nicely on top of it with a half-stride, lets it come on and punches with balance to get this through extra cover"
"back of a length, climbing outside off. Left alone"
"full and wobbly, just outside off. But once again, he's very close to the ball as he defends"
"full and shaped in to middle stump, but defended late and solidly to mid-on"
"back of a length in the corridor, feet rooted in the crease as he hangs the bat out in search. Beaten on the outside edge"
"compensates by playing slightly inside the line next ball. It is, of course, in that channel outside off. Thick outside edge threatens to run to the third man boundary but Smith sprints and keeps it in with a backhand flick"
"nicely timed flick, but he's found Shaun Marsh's lunge to the left at square leg. A bit of shape into the pads there"
"length outside off, left alone"
"back of a length at off stump, defended on the back foot"
"back of a length at off stump, defended to midwicket off the inside half"
"full and into the pads. Angled bat comes down late, no feet. Squeezed to fine leg. Head falling over into the off side"
"good length and into the pads, with the angle from wide of the crease. Easy put away. Uses the pace, uses the direction, whips it fine"
"angled in at the pads again, wide of the crease. Thuds into the thigh guard as he looks to flick"
"full outside off, driven straight to mid-off"
"another glorious stroke through the covers. Waits for it to arrive again, and punches this length ball frim under his eyes. Text book, etc."
"full outside off, defended solidly on the front foot"
back of a length skidder at off stump. Leaps up as this stays low. Pushed to mid-on
"short ball outside off, drags it through midwicket with an aerial pull shot that teases mid-on but ends up beating him comfortably"
"<b>lunges with his right hand out</b> in his follow through and hangs on low! Cook's gone! As feeble as he's been all <strike>innings</strike> series. A full ball at middle stump, probably sticking into a crack. Stops on him a touch. But he's moving backwards, no weight going into the ball at all as he closes the face to push this through the leg side. Comes off the leading edge and it's a sharp catch"

"in the channel outside off, Vince shoulders arms"
"full, 124kph and tailing in a fraction, punched firmly to mid-on who pulls off a good diving stop to prevent any runs"

"Hazlewood plugs away on a demanding length, Root blocks"
"touch short of a length, Root cracks a back-foot punch towards cover"
"honing that immaculate line outside off, 138kph and deflected down towards backward point"
"dabbed down into the off side and Root wants one to get going, it's a footrace with Nathan Lyon, but he's home as the throw fizzes just wide of the stumps"
"oh, big shout for lbw! Jagging into the pads as Vince plays around it, that mischievous crack nearly doing for another batsman... heading past leg, though, thinks Erasmus and Australia don't challenge"
"touch shorter and wide of the stumps, Vince gets down out of the way"
"Marsh continues, puts the ball on Root's hip and he nudges it down to fine leg for one"
"length ball, comes across and taps it away"
"dug in but that's a pretty tame bouncer, 129kph and Vince swats it away and bisects deep square and fine leg for four"
"full, wobbling in a touch as he clips off his pads but straight to midwicket"
"full and slapped past mid-on, all timing as he rolls the wrists on it and he'll get be four more, that'sh sheckshy batting"
pitched up outside off and he checks a punch into the covers
"pitched up on off stump, Root covers it"
"length, Root presses forward, gentle push through the covers but the ball skitters and slides away as Warner throws himself after it into the rope"
"short of a length, rising over off as Root stays back and defends towards his toes"

"touch back of a length, Root dabs into the covers but sends Vince back"
"126kph just back of a length on off, prodded to extra cover"

"short, chopped into the covers on the back foot"
"starts on a good line around off, slightly short and he defends from the crease"
"into the body, 135kph and worked down towards square leg"
"shortish, Vince blocks playing back, it bounces down a little too close to the stumps for comfort but doesn't roll back as he ushers it away"
"cor, lovely stroke, oozed through through the covers on the back foot, slightly angled bat but right out of the middle, gets another boundary"
"tighter line, 139kph and he defends down into the turf"
"edged but he plays with soft hands, the ball skitters low and wide of the slips and he'll get four more"
"edged and taken at slip, <b>Lyon strikes with his first ball!</b> Smith had to readjust quickly to take the catch after it flicked Paine's gloves but he holds on - still plenty going right for the captain - and Australia dance around gleefully, another failure for Root and perhaps Engand's best chance of salvation has to drag himself off the field. Root was looking to be assertive, tried to drive and got done by one going straight on"

Malan covers the line and blocks

"hint of outswing from a full length, this is good probing from Cummins"
stabbed into the off side with a tight and compact back-foot block

"probing away, outside off, and defended again"
"looped up, Vince gets his head right over the ball to stab to short leg"

"short, and wristily pulled into the leg side"
drawn forward
"fizzing down the leg side, and crashes into the pad flap as it bursts seemingly off a crack. That utterly flew!"
"wow, feel the heat! This one explodes past Vince's visor as he sways inside the line"
"yorker, and a speedy one. That's a fine double-whammy, but Vince is equal to the task"
"squared up on the back foot, walks into a defensive push back down the pitch"
forward and pushed to cover
leaning out of the crease to defend again
sharp footwork to wrap his defensive stance around a middle-and-leg line
"advancing to meet the (lack of) spin, met with another straight bat"
"tossed up this time, Lyon appears to want the caught-and-bowled! Did this come off Malan's boot and into Lyon's hands? It seems nothing more than a polite enquiry, and sure enough, there's nothing doing there. On we go"
driven into the off side
"attacking the stumps, defended with feet rooted in the crease"
"outside off, stabbed into the off side"
"leaning forward again, poked back down the pitch - 20 deliveries without a run for Vince"
"short, Vince sways inside the line. Too wide to be a threat, but good pace all the same"

forward and blocked back down the pitch
"back of a length, tapped into the covers for another single"
"dancing down the track, and clipped to long-on"
dabbed down to third man
"forced firmly off the back foot, Vince is in his Brisbane first-innings zone. How England need him to stay in that moment!"
another over seen off. Confident from Vince
"full length, straight bat"
fired out wide of the off stump. No stroke
"tight line, blocked out to the covers"
full length and loose from Malan! An inside-edge fizzes out to square leg
"forward again, defended"
"full and wide, swinging from the hand, and Malan once again drives off the inside edge into the leg side. Starc isn't entirely on top form but he's asking some of the right questions"
chiselled into the leg side
worked around the front pad
"head over the ball, leaning into the covers"
"forward once again, and pushed down the ground"
"on the back foot, and beautifully caressed through the covers, like the first day your daughter meets her new pet kitten. Brings a tear to the eye"
"there he goes, picks the gap on the leg side to reach his second fifty of the series. And fair play, in a gruesome situation, he has played with serenity and fluency"
"round the wicket, head over the ball to defend"
"angled defence, played late, head over the ball, into the covers"
squared up on the back foot
"round the wicket once more, very full and nearly a leading edge as Vince closed the face at point of impact. Hazlewood gathers with a growl in his followthrough"
"round the wicket again, speared into the stumps, blocked to point. Again, impressive time in his defensive play"

blocked on the front foot once more
"nudged into the leg side, more good footwork from the left-hander"
"still round the wicket, good off-stump line"

tucked off the toes
"full and threatening, but well watched on the back foot"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"yorker-length, well dug out from round the wicket"
"<B>absolute snorter!</B> Angled in, pitched on middle, bit off the turf like a legbreak. Plucked out the timbers! Think Steyn to Vaughan at Port Elizabeth in 2004, it was a very special ball to end a valiant knock. No disgrace in getting out when well set this time for Vince. That was a beauty"
"going for the magic ball again, but this time it goes where the angle intended it, way down the leg side"
fizzes past the edge
on the spot once more
"ooh, clear signs of late swing on that ball. Hazlewood just getting it to reverse a touch"
watchful in defence. As he has to be...

"round the wicket, defended on the back foot, and blocked back down the pitch"
"full face of the bat once again, gathered at cover"
"banged in short, hauled into the leg side"
fired down the leg side. Wrong line but can't fault the pace or effort
tucked into the gap
"speared into the toes, that's another fine and threatening delivery"
"beautiful balance, flicked supremely off the toes, with precisely the shot that Vince had envisaged before his off pole went tumbling"
"another attempted flick to leg, less firm in contact as Starc aims a touch fuller"
"outside off, no stroke offered"
"well dug out on the crease. England are waving, and drowning"
"a checked drive, and that has fizzed off the middle, through long-off! Shot"
"banged in short, and crashed through midwicket with a fluid pull. Those are two mighty strokes..."
"full length, defended on the crease"
"short again, crushed through midwicket. Perfectly nailed"
"short and wide, a beautiful wristy cut from Malan, who is using the grim situation to his fullest advantage. Time to have a go!"
solid in defence to complete a stout over

solid block
"wide of off stump, squeezed into the covers"
"up on the toes, another tremendous strike, full face, lovely timing, all the way to the cover boundary"
"outside off, and left alone"
solid defence
no way through as Malan defends from the crease
"back of a length, seems to keep a touch low as Malan stays watchful and dabs to cover"
"looped up, worked into the leg side"
blocked away to complete the over
"hits the seam, sliding down into the pads"
"a bit of nibble towards the cordon this time, well watched in defence"
"yorker! And a big appeal as Bairstow is pinned on the toe, but that's surely swinging down"
"a touch of swing, but merely swing straight into the middle of Bairstow's cover drive! Another classy shot in adversity."
"on the back foot, and punched to cover"
"squared up on the back foot, but safely poked out to gully"
"round the wicket, defended on the back foot"
"tight line outside off stump, patted back down the pitch off the back foot"
"bouncer on middle and leg to start, Malan sinks below it"
continues to test the middle of the deck and Malan is quite happy to avoid the pesky bouncers
a third bouncer in the over - and that's one more than you're allowed in Test cricket.
<b>keeps low</b>! Hits a crack on a good length area outside off and decks away from Malan's poke. He wears a wry smile. What else can he do?
"shortish and outside off, pushes to cover. That's one done. 69 more left. Gulp!"
"<b>good to meet cha, off stump</b>! Hazlewood tunnels under the bat, with a little help from the pitch as the ball straightens add keeps rather low after pitching."
"shortish on off stump, Moeen covers it well"
"fine shot, leaning into the pitched up delivery and gently tapping it down the ground. Full face of the bat, coupled with a good stride forward pays dividends"
"full and outside off, Moeen doesn't care for it"
"<b>taken at second slip</b>?! Actually, hold fire. The umpires come together and suggest it hasn't carried with the soft signal. For Moeen, this would have been a terrible little bit of deja vu. He is once again caught in the crease against a rising ball. He pokes away from his body, gets a thick edge and goes to second slip. Smith dives forward, trying to get his fingers under the ball. He doesn't take it on the first try, but snaps up the rebound well enough. We are looking at tons of replays. And we need conclusive evidence that it has carried to overrule the on-field call, which is not-out. Aleem Dar doesn't believe he has it and Smith is utterly peeved with that decision"
"shortish on off stump, defends."
"punches a short ball from around the wicket through the covers, and the timing is good enough to beat Warner chasing it"
drops his wrists and ignores the bouncer
"another bouncer - a pretty wild one, Malan has to be 10 feet tall to stand a chance of thinking about playing it"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"shortish and outside off, covers the line quite well"
"another short ball, this one targeting the badge, Malan spurns the advance"
"that's probably hit a crack and soars straight at first slip! Hazlewood bangs away on a length outside off, looking to produce such moments of madness. But even he wouldn't have expected that to happen. Somewhere Harmison's saying 'Happens to the best of us, mate'"
"fuller delivery on off stump, blunts it well"
defends a good length ball on off stump
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
that's easy. That's where he wants it - 70 overs of the ball on half-volley length outside leg. Simple little glance to the boundary
"full on off stump, Malan's defence is in fine order"
"bouncer from around the wicket, doesn't interest Moeen"
"continues the barrage, Moeen ducks under it"
"straightens after pitching, does this short ball, and Moeen does extremely well. Doesn't commit to his shot too early, and softens his grip on the bat to make sure the ball goes straight down onto the off side"
"that's excellent. He's wasted a few bouncers but this is fast, and it's aimed at his rib cage. Moeen is forced into taking evasive action"
"short again, Moeen lets it sail over him"
back of a length on off stump and Moeen's right behind it
on the pads again and Malan flicks it down to long leg
"<b>direct hit would have had Moeen</b>! A quick single to cover soon becomes an untenable risk with Warner getting to the ball so very quickly. Turns around, flings the throw but it doesn't hit the mark"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
pulls the short ball off his visor to deep midwicket
defends a shortish delivery a shade outside off
good leave! This pitches on a good length on off stump and Moeen trusts it to go on with the angle across him
firmly behind the shortish delivery on middle.
"beats him for pace as the 138 kph delivery, angled into his thigh pad from around the wicket, hits the target despite Malan's attempted flick"
"forces him to duck this time with a short ball on middle stump. It's that awkward height too, around the chest area"
"<b>decks in off the crack</b> and pins Malan on the body. He is all set to leave the ball, considering it pitched a fair bit outside off. Ends up getting a bit of a rude shock"
"he's looking for that crack, snaking all the way down the pitch outside off. Malan does not let that play on his mind as he gets in line with a back of a length ball and pushes it past short leg's right"
"140kph, full, fast and a shade outside off, Malan plays late and glides it to point"
"full and outside off - and it swings into the left-hander too. Moeen does well to block it, playing as late as possible."
"gets across to a shortish delivery cutting in off the deck this time. Bruised heel or not, he's still a huuuge threat. Moeen negotiates it well though, with a nudge to midwicket"
"<b>big swing</b>, into the left-hander, at 142 kph. Moeen falls over as he tries to flick and gets struck on the pad. Half an appeal for lbw, but that snakes too far"
"140 kph, simple plan from the scary fast bowler. Bowl full and look for swing. Moeen drives well to extra cover"
"lovely strike, leaning into the drive and sending the 141 kph, pitched up delivery to the right of Warner. Good dive stops any chance of runs"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
tosses it up from around the wicket and Malan gets inside the line of the ball to drive back at the bowler
"steps out of his crease and clips the good length ball past the left of short midwicket. 'Caaatch,' a fielder cries, but it's actually played quite well"
gets him forward and defending to a fuller delivery outside off
"bat in front of pad, and a long stride forward to meet the flighted delivery on middle and leg"
gets to the pitch of the fullish delivery outside leg and turns it through midwicket. England doing this well. So far
"full on middle, Malan keeps it out"
too much swing and that's not good for a ball that is already heading down leg. Paine can't do much about that. Not at Starc's pace
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> as Starc pulls off the ball he has been looking for. Full, curling in and making the batsman fall over as he flicks. There is actually too much movement for this to be out"
digs out a near yorker to mid-on
"back of a length and outside off, Moeen taps it to mid-off"
flings down a good length ball but that slingy action he has takes the ball wider of off stump than he means to target. Moeen has a straightforward leave
"big swing into Moeen, but he seems to be waiting for those. Delicious flick to long leg."
gets nicely forward to smother a good length ball on off stump
strides out of his crease to meet a flighted delivery on leg stump and clips to mid-on
pushes it through - flat and quick - on middle. Moeen moves back and he's right in line with the stumps. Has to get his bat down to survive and he does
"good length ball outside off, lets it go"
lovely long stride to get to the pitch of the ball and a straight bat follows through
"a quicker, but fuller delivery on middle. Moeen won't be fooled by such tricks. He felt he had let England down earlier in the series. He is batting like he means to make it count now."
"full on middle, Malan works it over Bancroft's left shoulder at short leg"
"full on off stump, Moeen is solid again"
"fullish on leg stump, Moeen turns it to midwicket. Good stuff. He's playing late. He's concentrating on keeping a straight bat. Backs-to-the-wall goodness"
"full and outside off, but as enchanting as the drive looks, it goes straight to mid-off"
"there's the bouncer. It's taken some time, but out it comes at 141 kph, angled into Moeen's body and keeping that leg slip and short leg in play. Good work from the batsman to avoid it. Even better work from the wicketkeeper not to"
full and slides down leg. Moeen can't connect with the flick
nudges a flighted delivery on leg stump to mid-on
plonks a straight bat down on a good length delivery searching ruefully of the outside edge
gets down the pitch and turns a flighted ball on leg stump to midwicket
"gets the ball to dip just enough that Moeen, looking to drive away from the body, gets a little outside edge. Goes along the ground though to point"
"full and outside off, defends"
shimmies down the pitch for a solid defensive shot on middle
short of a length and slung from around the wicket across the left-hander. Malan leaves
gets an inside edge as he tries to drive a full length delivery. But it is tinged with some venomous inswing. Could easily have had him lbw because it pitched on middle and straightened
punches on the up the length ball outside off
a full delivery keeps rather low as it slides down leg and it sneaks past Paine diving to his right.
"yorker on middle, Malan is clued in to such tactics and protects his stumps well"
"full on leg stump, deflects it to long leg"
"<b>some turn</b> but it is slow enough that Malan, originally looking to play down the ground, can correct his shot and glide it to backward point"
"good length ball on middle, keeps it out"
steps out of his crease and drives in sedate fashion to long-off.
"lunges forward, keep to get to the pitch of the ball on middle, as he defends"
defends a tossed up delivery on off stump
"forces his wrists down on the ball, which is a little flatter than the previous ones."
pitches it up on middle and Malan is able to keep it out
on the thigh pad and Malan nudges it down to long leg
"fuller delivery looking for the stumps, Moeen doesn't let the happy union take place."
might be glancing off the pads to the wicketkeeper. Australia's quicks aren't getting the pace off the pitch as they did previously
"peels away to the extra cover boundary. A touch too full and a bit too wide and Moeen leans into the shot, looking picture perfect"
"<b>ripper</b>! Hits the deck sharply and rags away off the seam to beat Moeen, who is standing up tall. His efforts to make contact are in vain, but the good thing is that he doesn't follow the ball."
"gets down the pitch a touch too soon, allowing Lyon to shorten his length and quicken his pace. Hit on the pad while defending"
turns a fuller delivery outside leg down to long leg
stays back to a good length ball and defends it well enough.
"that's close... and Chris Gaffaney rules out the lbw call. There is inside edge as Moeen comes forward to defend a good length ball outside off, but is it before the ball hits the pad? Replays suggest it is so that is a top call from the ump"
"does him second time around! This looks a smidge quicker than the last ball, but everything else is the same. Pitches on a good length just outside off and slides on with the arm. Moeen plays for turn, gets beaten on the inside edge, struck in line with all three and walks off knowing not to review."
"over the wicket, lobbed up full on off and he flicks it off his front pad for a single to deep midwicket"
"hits a length, looking for a little jink'n'jive off the deck, Woakes defends stoically"
"touch short, 136kph around off stump, jumps across and defends"
"slightly back of a length, 138kph outside off, jabbed down towards backward point"
"full and pushed into the covers, nicely timed by Woakes and it gets away from the in-fielders, Lyon does well to chase it down before the rope"
"dug in short, Malan continues to happily let the short ball go over his head"
"dug in ad the ribs, 138kph and he fends it away behind square on the leg side"
floated up outside off and tapped into the covers
"gives it some air, drifting in and tapped back down the track"
"tossed up, slightly wider and he strokes it along the carpet to extra cover"
"pushed through on the stumps, Malan saunters down and clips wide of Lyon but mid-on comes across"
"quicker ball, on the stumps and worked neatly to the left of mid-on for one"
"pushed trough, defended on the back foot towards gully"
"short and pulled, pirouettes on the spot and chops it down fine wide of the keeper... <b>that's Malan's fifty</b>, he is almost single-handedly keeping England in with a shout here"
"genuine bouncer now, really awkward line towards the armpit, he was about to take on the shot but decided against it very late and does well to get the bat and gloves out of the way"
"short ball, hit on the body playing back, right smack on the hip! That's going to hurt but they still scamper through"
"pitched up, 140kph on off stump, solidly pushed away"
"ooh, good ball, length and straightening a fraction off the cracks, Woakes gets squared up as the ball hits the splice of the bat"
"good length, firmly bunted back past the bowler but mid-on cuts it off"
"looped up around middle and off stump, Malan leans on his blade to block"
"skidding on, touch low outside off and he chops down on it"
pushed back down the track
lobbed up around off stump and Malan covers the line
pushed through and steered square moving across his crease for one
"four for Woakes, deftly done on the back foot, going deep and using the pace on the ball to skedaddle it wide of slip and away to the rope"
"length ball around off stump, defended coming across"
"fullish length in the channel, lets this one go"
"ooh, that's a teasing line, rising outside off and even the chaste Malan is tempted into a flirt"
"short ball, climbing high and slightly leg side, ignored"
"good length, 137kph aiming for the cracks, Malan chops down on it back in the crease"
"banged in, again too much height on the bouncer to trouble the batsman"
"round the wicket, Woakes comes across his stumps to defend"
"good length on off, shows it a straight bat"
"dug in, Woakes is back on off stump and defends towards his toes"
"bumper, 137kph but the line is unthreatening, wide of the stumps and he leaves it well alone"
"woof, that's the swerving toe-crusher Starc is looking for, maybe just a touch too full and Woakes manages to get a leading edge on it"
"slung in low, 140kph and defended moving across on off"
"Hazlewood probing away, defends a length ball"
"slanted across, back of a length and Malan shapes to pull but the ball gets big and he adjusts late, dropping the hands safely out of the way"
"oh, that's a jaffa, full and gets him feeling for it on middle and leg, nips across and beats the outside edge... Too good!"
"plays back, rapped on the pads, Hazlewood belts out an appeal... Erasmus is unmoved but Australia call for a <b>review</b>. Was it high? Maybe pitched outside leg...? He was deep in the crease, the ball struck pad first, then the inside edge; but crucially, it has landed outside leg stump, so he survives! Would have hit the top of off... <b>Australia lose a review</b>, too"
"length, whistling behind the pads as Malan flicks and nearly tickles through to the keeper leg side"
"yaargh, another beast from Hazlewood! Not much he can do about those, searing through off a length... Superb over but no reward for Australia"
"pitched up and me gets forward well to ping a drive through the covers, won't quite go all the way for four"
"length, played from the crease, poked square for a single"
"over the wicket to the right-hander, 136kph and leaving Woakes as he hangs back and leaves"
"hammered in short, down the leg side as the batsman flinches away"
"too straight, on the pads and Woakes eases it away crisply through midwicket for four"
"short ball, 138kph but not getting up all that high as Woakes jumps and fends to cover"
"on the stumps, worked to leg"
"short and leg side, Malan swishes at a pull... <b> and gloves through to the keeper!</b> Erasmus puts up the finger and Malan walks! What a way to go, though credit to Hazlewood for the thorough frisking he gave Malan in the previous over. Saw the leg-side half-tracker and wanted to put it away, execution was wanting and Australia move a step closer to #ReturningTheUrn"
"oh, beats him first ball, superb length and it darts past the outside edge as he plays without foot movement"
"fiendish length, 135kph and nibbling as Overton fishes at it again"
"hits a length, doesn't get up much as he stays in the crease and blocks"
"full, sliding into the pads, there's a muted appeal... but that was missing, deflected behind square and they take the leg bye"
"slammed in short, Overton hangs back and plays inside it"
"short, rising like rocket fuel, he crouches well down and almost ends up collapsing on his front... Suspect he's getting a few twinges in the chest area, at the memory of Adelaide"
"banged in and, well-directed at the collar bone but Overton manages to defend it down, did well there"
"short ball again, blocked solidly from back in the crease"
"full now, Overton punches an on-drive and Starc can't quite cut it off, cops it on the side of the head as the ball ricochets away for a couple of runs"
"round the wicket, ripping bouncer from Cummins, it's just a fraction high and Overton manages to weave out of the way again"
"oof, nipping in off the cracks, hits the pad above the knee roll and deflects into the leg side"
"fired in full and straight, creeps through a touch low but Woakes blocks it steadfastly"
"prodded into a gap for one - the England 200 is raised, to the enjoyment of the Barmy Army, at least"
"good length, aiming for middle and off stump, Overton lines it up"
sliding down the leg side as he flicks and misses
fired in straight and Overton skims it off his pads for one more to fine leg
"banged in and fended away, low to leg gully... <b>but Lyon can't hold on!</b> It actually hit him right on the tip of the fingers, looks like it ripped a nail, too. Fast chance, just above the grass, very tough"
"short again, this time he rides the bounce"
"at the body, shovelled away and <b>over the leaping fielder at leg gully this time!</b> Warner, I think, put in a good effort but it was well out of reach, despite the dive"
bouncer from round the wicket and Woakes lets it sail over his head
"another bumper, rising high and it's ignored again"
"length, leg side and Woakes misses with a poke as it flies through to Paine"
Overton gets across on off and defends
"full, 137kph and Overton reaches for it on the drive, keeps the ball down and length of bat behind the shot, it easily runs away for four"
"sliding down leg, 135kph through to the keeper"
"shot and clubbed over point, Overton taking the positive approach and he guides it up and over the fielder - four more, brings the deficit under 50"
"good length, straightening as Overton plays across the line - <b>and well taken low at gully!</b> Hazlewood has his five-for, Overton is extracted by another excellent delivery, although he helped out by closing the face, looping deflection off the shoulder of the bat and the Aussies erupt again!"
"good length, 139kph jumps into line and defends on middle and off"
angled in and worked off the hip for one
"banged in short and Broad throws up the hands, <b>gloved through to the keeper!</b> Make that one wicket away! That's another good bouncer, Broad pretty much raises the white flag, there was a noise as it touched the glove and Cummins gets in amongst 'em. The Ashes are almost in Australian hands once again..."
"dug in, nasty bouncer, <b>strikes Anderson on the side of the head!</b> England are being <i>pounded</i> into submission... Although the Australians are quickly over to check he is okay. Anderson tried to get the hands up but he wasn't quite quick enough and the ball slammed into the helmet, around the ear. Going to need a minute to compose himself"
"hustles in and fires the ball down halfway, Anderson is well back and fiddling at the ball, doesn't get anything on it"
"more short stuff, around chest height as he fends and is beaten... Cummins thought he heard an edge, but it's a lone appeal"
"dug in at the rubs, 138kph and turned safely down towards leg gully"
"good length and nipping back, clips the edge as Woakes prods - but the chance loops <i>just</i> wide of short leg"
"back of a length outside off, tapped towards point"
"shortish, wide of the stumps and Woakes dabs it down into the covers"
"over the stumps, 134kph and Woakes gets in behind it"
Woakes gets across and defends
"bouncer to finish, Woakes hooks blindly and top-edges over the man who's just come in... swirls away and trundles off for four. But it keeps Anderson on strike"
"short outside off and he jumps back, pokes it away through point, they'll get one there - Anderson up to the safe end"
"dug in again, Woakes sways underneath"
"oh, so close! Just past the outside edge as Woakes stays back, bowled across him from round the wicket and a whisker away"
"another bumper, he crouches underneath"
""
"bangs in the bouncer, Woakes ducks... <i>and sets off on a run!</i> Paine collects and has an underarm shy at the stumps, but misses! Smartly done, in the end, and Woakes will keep the strike"
"round the wicket, full and looking to blast out the stumps, Woakes just manages to chop down on it"
"fullish, straight line and met with a solid punch, mid-on is a little deep but he doesn't bother trying to run"
angled in with the arm and tucked to the leg side
"short at the body, Woakes hops and rides it with a flick through square, they take the one on offer"
"banged in from over the wicket, doesn't get up that much and he defends"
"searing yorker to finish, 142kph but the line is outside off and he bunts it away"
"full, comes across and flicks to leg, in the air but it's wide of mid-on and lands safely, they won't run there"
jumps into line and defends into the covers
"hits a length, shoots through low but Woakes it equal to it"
short of a length outside off and Woakes angles the bat and guides to backward point
"short ball, Woakes tries to ramp, <b>but can only feather through to the keeper!</b> Job done, England have been rumbled and <b>Australia have reclaimed the Ashes!</b> They're into a huddle, jumping up and down as the WACA screen broadcasts the news, for the last time in contests such as these, that Australia have won and recaptured the urn!"
