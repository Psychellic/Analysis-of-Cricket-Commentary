short outside off and Dickwella ramps it to third man. Reaches the fielder after two bounces
offcuttter towards off stump and he works it to leg for one
"<strong>lands right in between the keeper and a running third man</strong>. Dickwella went a fair bit to the off side to try and scoop that fine on the leg side, he did get enough bat on it and it went hight too, almost on the off side and the keeper ran back but couldn't get it"

"87kmh, well outside off, Dickwella waits and helps it towards short third man"
"<strong>dropped by Sodhi on the last ball of Santner's spell</strong>. It could have been the big wicket of Mendis.

"angling in towards the leg stump, goes down on the knee again and slaps it behind square in the gap. Four more"

turns it away too much outside off

"flighted and full on middle, he swings across the line and gets one towards deep backward square leg"
"slower as usual from de Grandhomme, it's full too so Mendis slams it back over the bowler's head towards the on side and beats long on. It's the <strong>50 partnership</strong>"
"<b>absolutely middled for six</b>! Too full again, Mendis goes down on a knee and tonks that right off the middle of the bat to send it flying high on the leg side for a big six"
"nearly in the block hole, digs it out to long on for two"
"low full toss outside off, driven straight to cover"
"<strong>misses the direct hit</strong>, Ish Sodhi. Mendis swiped the slower ball to short fine leg and went for the single, not sure if Dickwella would have made it if Sodhi had hit"
and he ends the over with a reverse scoop that helps the ball very fine on the off side. Innocuous delivery sent for four
"<b>superb catch in the deep from Guptill</b>. The slower ball was in the slot for Mendis, he picked it up and lofted it high on leg, but Guptill judged it very well to stay inside the deep midwicket boundary and even dive backwards to grab it with both hands"
outside off and he slams it through the covers for one
"hurries on to Shanaka at 134kmh, maybe he expected the slower ball, and pulls it to square leg for one"
"he backs away, Southee follows him with a slower delivery and Dickwella gets a single towards mid on"
"short again to Shanaka, he pulls it behind square this time for one more"

excellent end to the over with a yorker that Dickwella also did well to scoop out towards long-on and they get two quickly
"just about stays inside the wide line, that legcutter knuckle ball. Shanaka swings and misses"
"closer to the stumps this time, Shanaka whacks it to leg but Guptill runs to his left to keep it to two"
"dipping and slow yorker just outside off, helped to short third man"
"he walks towards off and Southee pitches it further away, Dickwella slams it down to mid off"
"<strong>looks like Guptill lost the ball in the lights</strong>. Shanaka pulled the just short of length and it was in the air for a bit on the leg side, Guptill ran to his right from deep midwicket but suddenly lost the ball. Not much damage because deep square leg was around"
"tries to swing again, but gets a leg bye off his body and keeps strike"
"slower ball nearly in the block hole, he chips it down to long-on not so hard so that they can come back for the second"
"back to 131kmh, Shanaka charges down and hammers that low full toss right over the long-off boundary for a six!"
<strong>direct hit</strong> from Seifert sends Dickwella back. It was right in the block hole and the ball sneaked through the gap between Shanaka and the stumps. They went for the single and Seifert got the stumps
"just over <strong>long-on</strong> for six! Rance went for the block hole and was slightly inaccurate with the wobbly seam, Udana is accurate though and accurate enough to loft that just over long-on's right arm"
"bigger this time and clears long-on easily. Slower ball on off stump, he tonks that again, this time it's a cleaner hit and long-on can't even try this time around. The crowd erupts"
"he swings for the full toss again, gets a leading edge towards long-off for two. Oh hang on, Southee throws the ball to the keeper who slips before collecting the ball and they concede an overthrow too"
"full and swinging away, bates the bat as Guptill feels for it, the crowd goes up and Malinga follows but the umpire's finger doesn't"
"length on middle this time., Guptill makes a little room and defends"
"full on the pads, clipped wide of mid-on for one, the timing was good but couldn't get it wide enough"

another really full one swinging away as the batsman pushes at it and is beaten outside off
"another full one, Seifert doesn't seem to be picking Malinga at all, feels for it tentatively and is beaten by the away swing again"

"off break from around off, turned to midwicket with the spin for one"

"full and that late away swing on view again, Seifert was squared up but saved by the leading edge"
"another yorker, picks it up early this time and squeezes it away towards square leg for a couple"
"slower ball, very very full but way down the leg side, Seifert picked it up really late and tried to help it along but couldn't get enough bat for more than one. On the stumps and he may have had Seifert given how late he spotted thew slower ball"
"length outside off, punched into the covers off the backfoot, they take off with the shot and could have been close with a direct hit"
"off break, short around off, turns back in appreciably and keeps a little low as Guptill helps it along for two"
more spin but down the leg side
"full around off, it was nicely tossed up, Guptill picked the right ball for the slog sweep but top edged it as it bounced a little extra, it nearly popped out of the hands of the fielder in the deep but he held on on the second attempt"
"off break around off, pushed to the leg side and CDG looks for the quick one, nearly run out without facing a ball"
turn and bounce as he tries to work it with the spin but can't get any bat on it

"length around off, swatted to long-on for one"
"full and swinging away slightly, he jams his bat down on it but can't do much more"
"length outside off, pretty flat, looks for the sweep but misses"
"<strong>wicket second ball for the debutant!</strong> Not the best delivery he'll bowl, it was short outside off, but he probably meant to push it wide with Seifert looking for the sweep first ball, went for the cut this time but only managed an edge to the keeper. The mounting required rate was always going to bring the spinner into play"
"length outside off, Taylor looks for the cut but it's not nearly short enough, chops it away to the off side"

fullish around off and drilled down the ground for one
he walks down and across and tucks the full toss on leg past short fine leg for two
"<strong>a beamer</strong> called a no ball! Looks like the ball slipped out, he apologised straightaway as the ball went high and down the leg side. One warning for Rajitha"
the free hit is dispatched for a six! He took a step down again and converted it into a low full toss and lofted that over long off
walks across this time and flicks the ball to short fine leg
"full toss around off, Taylor does well to nudge it around to the leg side in the gap for two"
"goes down the leg side and it beats the fielder for four, 17 from the over! It was a poor delivery, going down leg and Taylor did well to tickle it so fine that it beat a diving Dickwella at short fine leg"
"turning in from well outside off, worked away behind square on leg"
"the legbreak is too short, it's in Taylor's zone and he rocks back quickly to pull that over the deep midwicket boundary for six"
"smacked for six more! This one was an offbreak, outside off and Taylor picks it quickly to hammer that with the turn over deep midwicket"
"fuller delivery, Taylor tries to dispatch that too but will have to settle for one on the leg side"
"tight line outside off with the legbreak, de Grandhomme goes deep in the crease and helps it down the ground"
"<strong>dropped at deep midwicket by Shanaka</strong>! Taylor went for the slog sweep again, he didn't connect so well this time and Shanaka was there in the deep but the ball popped out and then he tumbled. How expensive is that?"
starts with a poor line down the leg side
full around off and drilled through the covers for one
"slower length delivery on the stumps, he works it to leg by closing the face of the bat, cleverly using soft hands and gets two"
and again: slower length ball around off worked to the leg side with fielders in the deep and they get two more
slower one on the pads this time and flicked for one
"bit too short and de Grandhomme has dispatched that to the wide long-on boundary! Is that four or six, the third umpire is checking. Looks like the ball has just touched the ground while landing and before touching the boundary triangle. So it's a four"
"over the covers this time and this one looks like a <strong>flat six</strong>! Pitched up outside off, the batsman stays still until swinging hard and using the wrists to smash that over the covers and in the gap"
"cheeky leg byes down the leg side, unlucky for Sri Lanka. It was full and going down leg and Taylor just managed to get his pads on it while trying to tickle that fine"
"full toss on middle, happily tucked to leg for one"
"<b>right through him, bowled with a yorker</b>! Malinga has done it, the breakthrough ends this rapid stand. De Grandhomme was looking to work the ball to leg but it dipped, swung late and hit the base of middle and leg stumps"

"bit of flight outside off, Taylor pushes into the covers and there's no time for a run"

plants his front foot across this time and helps the ball to leg for one
swings against the turn with a slog sweep and misses it completely as the ball turns away
"slower ball on length nearly beats the bat, except for the wafer-thin inside edge that just misses the stumps and runs towards the fine leg boundary. Three more for NZ"
"full toss, top edge, skier, and <strong>Taylor just escapes</strong>. Taylor didn't quite hammer the ball there, it went really high on the leg side towards square and Shanaka had a tough job - to run backwards and dive. He did all that but couldn't make it"
more towards the stumps this time and flicked to leg for one
"in the slot, Mitchell swings on the leg side and he gets the distance to get six. It was a slower delivery, maybe Mitchell expected it, and he lofted it well over midwicket"
"good reply, it's nearly in the block hole and Mitchell gets a single to long on"
"low full toss, Taylor goes across a bit and flicks it away with his wrists to use the pace of the ball and place it right in between long on and deep midwicket. That's another 17 from the over!"
"nice and tight around off stump with some turn, punched down to long on"
too full outside off and driven straight to cover but there's a fumble and they scamper across for one
drives the dull delivery down to long for one more
"full around off, driven softly and straight to cover"
"<strong>swipes completely across the line, he's been given lbw, Taylor reviews</strong>! The ball turned after pitching for sure and struck him right in front of the stumps. The question is if it pitched in line because there's no edge. Here's ball-tracking: pitches in line, hitting in line and rattling middle stump"
"ends the over with a googly, beats Santner's bat outside off"
goes across on the off side and pushes the wide delivery into the covers
pushes the low full toss outside off down the ground to long off and they sprint back for the second
"angling in this time, worked to long-on now but only time for a single on this occasion"
"big appeal for lbw as Mitchell misses the flick after going cross, the tock is clicking and Malinga goes for the review. Has it pitched in line? Udana bowled full from over the wicket, Mitchell was hit in front of leg stump. Waiting for ball-tracking.....<b>pitched outside leg</b>"
"over long-on for six and Santner has silenced the crowd! Pitched up, right in the slot outside off and he lofted that down the ground with a big swing of the bat to beat the fielder"
"closer and fuller towards off, Santner drills it down the ground and calls for two immediately. They get two"
"horrible wide down the leg side and that beats the keeper too, that's <b>five wides</b>. That could have slipped out of Malinga's hands <i>after</i> drying the ball so much before the over started"
"slower ball on length outside off, Mitchell swings big and misses"
"short of length, slammed down and reaches long-on after a bounce"
"tight delivery on off, he gets a thick edge towards point and they come back quickly for the second as the throw comes in at the bowler's end"
"low full toss around off, pushed down to long off easily for one"
"full delivery, Mitchell doesn't want those singles or quick doubles, he has clubbed that over long-on's head for a six! It wasn't in the block hole, it was in the slot for him outside off and he made full use of it"
"drama all around - almost a yorker, Mitchell pushes it down and comes out of the crease, Malinga stops the ball with his right foot and then throws it back at the stumps but it hits Mitchell's back on the way and Malinga appeals. Phew, Mitchell didn't change his direction so no it's not out"
"slower ball outside off, Santner misses despite swinging, they go for the bye and manage to make it because the keeper doesn't get the direct hit"
"beats Mitchell outside off this time, slower ball from the back of the hand this time. Kusal collects the ball and rushes to the stumps"
"on the stumps, worked to the leg side and they hurry back for the second as the throw goes to the bowler's end and <b>New Zealand have won by five wickets</b>"
