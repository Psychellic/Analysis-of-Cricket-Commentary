"round the wicket, bangs it down on a length around fourth stump, Burns dead-bats it solidly down into the turf"
"pitched up in the channel, holding its line at 81mph/131kph and left alone"
"grunt of exertion from Roach as he pushes this a little straighter, tapped towards midwicket"
"no stroke from Burns, that's flicked the pad on the way through, <b>a very tight leave</b>... and West Indies choose to <b>review</b> in the first over! Was it coming back enough? Hit him outside the line, but he wasn't playing a shot, and it's... <b>umpire's call</b> on impact! So no dice, although West Indies will keep their three reviews"
"oh, and we've lost the feed. It's all too much for Sky's cameras... Dot ball, reports Mikey Holding"
"sounded like bat on ball that time, still no pics. Too much excitement, it seems"
"back of a length, hammered in and veering leg side as Sibley shuffles across and leaves alone"
"back of a length, rising to smack the thigh pad as Sibley lets it go... Heading leg side again"
"<b>cracking line</b>, Gabriel trundles in like a siege engine and gets the ball to straightens just a touch, past the outside edge"
"<b>timbeeeeeeeeeeeeer!</b> Off stump is pegged back... Oh how we've missed that sweet, sweet sound! Dom Sibley perhaps wasn't so keen to get acquainted with it, but a poorly judged leave sends him back for a duck. No one to clap him off, either. The previous one had nibbled the other way, this one he let go only to hear the fateful gurgle as Gabriel brought it in with the angle. Lovely bowling"
back of a length in the channel and Denly lets it go
"dug in, this kicks a touch as Denly pushes forward and jabs down defensively to the off side"
"pitched up, lets this go outside off"
"length ball, defended coming across on off"

"pitched up, Roach searching for that late away movement, defended stoutly enough"
"flung full leg side as Burns flicks crabbily, <b>and we have our first run</b>... Maybe off the pad, but still"
shortish outside off and Denly raises his bat out of the way
"full length, speared into the toes, tapped into the gap at square leg and England double the score"
"well, that's ambitious! A back-foot wipe, across the line, aiming over mid-on, but he rather spliced that pull and the ball dribbles to the fielder"
angling into the stumps on a very full length. Solidly blocked into the off side
"<B>huge late inswing, and Denly almost loses his poles!</B> A similar non-stroke to Sibley's, curling in wickedly, keeping low too, and almost eluding Dowrich as he flung himself down the leg side. Yikes!"
"a more circumspect prod back up the wicket, as Denly gets right behind the line to defend"
worked into the gap with soft hands. Living a touch dangerously in that over!
"very full, very straight, firm in defence once more"
"wide of off stump, Denly leaves as the ball curls back in, but his timbers are never in danger"
"dangly and wafty outside off-ty! That's a lovely line from Roach, bursting off the seam and through to the keeper, but Denly chased it with stiff wrists and almost paid the price ..."
"wider line, another leave, gloves thrust high in the air"
"firmly forward, pressed through the line and into the covers with head over the ball"

"speared across the left-hander, who sizes up the angle and leaves well alone"
"<B>nibble and bounce!</B> Good ball from Gabriel, hitting the seam, and exploding high through to the keeper. Burns left it well enough in the end"
"thumps the pad, and that would have splattered all three.... but way outside leg stump, barely an appeal"
"a similar line, on the legs, Burns leans inside the line, and flicks confidently through deep midwicket for <B>the first boundary of the summer!</B>"
"very wide of off stump, heading wider, but Gabriel gets away with it. This is proper cricket after all"
"zippy line and length, outside off, through to the keeper"
"nip off the seam, back into the pads. Denly grunts as he wears it in the midriff"
another tight leave as Roach angles the ball back in from a fourth-stump line. That's a probing area
"on the back foot, punched on the up, back through the line, and taken on the splice as Roach finds some extra zip once more"
"another judicious leave, striding to the pitch and leaving well alone"
"<B>that's a humdinger!</B> Dowrich flings it high, convinced there's a nick, but that was all late seam movement, jagging supremely around a hard-handed forward block. Lifting off the deck, beating everything. Lovely bowling"
"over the wicket, dipping in towards the toes, fenced out to point"
dabbed to the leg side as Gabriel strays onto the left-hander's pads
"right up to the bat, tapped off the hips, out to midwicket and they hustle the quick single"
"thumped into the deck, Denly turns turtle to let the ball whizz over his shoulder"
"another zippy bouncer, this is good aggression from Gabriel, who's just beginning to feel limber after his stop-start spell"
"<strong>width and thrashed!</strong> You have to put those ones away! Gully was in business for a moment, but the ball hurtled beyond his reach, away through wide third man. Denly's first four, and England move into double figures"
"leaning out of the crease, nudged to the leg side"
"fully forward, leaning out to meet the pitch, and pressed to cover"
"round the wicket, wide line to the leftie, no stroke offered"
"outside off again, rising off the deck, no stroke once more"
"cheeky outswinger on a very full length, Burns threatens to drive but lets it go outside off"
"dabbed into the covers, propping forward to meet the outswinger"
"awkward bounce from a full length! The angle into the right-hander cramped Denly for room, and he's forced to limbo as he wears the lifter on his gloves. Sharp!"
"left alone on a wider line, that's a confident leave after the scare the previous ball."
"<B>flogged through mid-on!</B> Denly unfurls that short-arm jab of a pull, not especially short but he rocked back early, committed to the stroke, and nailed it very straight, past the flailing fielder"
"<B>driven, and edged!</B> A fourth slip would have swallowed that! A hard-handed drill on the front foot, maybe the juices flowing a touch too quickly, and Gabriel gives him a murderous look as the chance flies safe"
"wider line, no danger of chasing that one"
head over the ball in defence. Dead-batted back to the bowler
"outside off, no stroke as Dowrich gathers"
"shape off the deck, and through to the keeper with another comfortable leave"
"round the wicket, four slips and a gully wait, but that's too wide to tempt an indiscretion"
"sliding down the leg side, Roach is straining a touch now, as he nears the end of his sixth over"
"fuller and straighter, blocked off the back foot, down the leg side"
a good finish to the over
that's a warm-up delivery. Sat up nicely - length on middle and leg and Burns works it very nicely off his hip as this races to the square leg fence

"hint of inward movement off a length on middle, solidly defended"
"floats this full across the left-hander, this one holds its line and Burns squirts it to gully"

"leans into the drive very nicely, laced between cover and point. Got nicely to the pitch to play that"
"short of a length delivery on the body, tucked behind square on the leg side"
squared up a hint by the length but he negotiates it nicely
<strong>surprised by the bounce!</strong> Denly takes his bottom hand off the bat grip hurriedly in trying to play that. This one jagged away quite a long way
"good delivery again, pace, bounce and carry from outside off to the keeper as Denly leaves"
right besides the line as he defends
"gets half forward because of the length and defends, the ball rolls to the leg side off a thickish inside edge"
"full and swinging away from outside off, left alone"
"that's a screamer! Uppish but wide of Campbell at backward point. Width on offer, Burns crashes this away. He loved that thumping sound the ball made as it hit the middle of the bat."
"steered nicely, good stop in the gully"
jams his bat down late at this full delivery slanting away. Stifled appeal but the sound was of the bat hitting the turf as the ball passed Burns
right on top of the bounce as he defends into the off side.
nicely forward as he pushes this full delivery to cover
"length ball on off, defended with soft hands"
"<strong>genuine edge, doesn't carry to the cordon!</strong> Feeble push from Denly, Campbell dives to his right at third slip to stop that"

"floated full, there for the drive if he wanted to, but Burns is happy to leave"

"closes the bat face early trying to flick, squeezes this off a leading edge that rolls to the off side"
"cracker! Leaves him late, Denly squared up as this <strong>beats the edge</strong>"
"slides back in a long way, tucked between midwicket and mid-on, Gabriel brings his boot out to stop that. Little clumsy but no damage done"
"beautiful from Holder, that is where you want to be bowling all day. Full, nibbling across, hoping Burns has a poke but he lets it go. Happy to not bite the bait because that is what Holder wants him to"
"slants one across, doesn't offer a stroke. This is good bowling."
"<strong>'confusion, confusion. Do I poke, do I leave?'</strong> By the time Burns decided, the ball had rolled off the toe-end to the slips as the bat was on its way up"
"shorter and angling away, left alone with a fair degree of conviction"
nice balance as he works this leg-stump half-volley to mid-on. This time Gabriel bends down to field that
"skids off the pitch to hurry him into the short-arm jab, <strong>smacked on the hip. Ouch</strong>"
"nice and full on the fourth stump, defended back"
where did that come from? Superb yorker but the angle meant it was sliding down leg. Denly just about managed to jam hit bat down to get a thick inside edge onto the pad. <b> Bowled at 90.3mph </b>
goes full on the pads and Denly clips it calmly towards square leg
"whoosh, <b>that's gone through!</b> Short of a length, 86mph/138kph, Denly was looking to pull but it rocketed through past the flailing bat. Licks"

"length ball, 85mph/137kph around off stump, defended"
"pushed through wide of off stump, good length and Burns ushers it by"

"full on the pads, 83mph and Denly latches on, <b>skelping it through midwicket for four!</b> In the air for a bit, but well in front of square leg and away"
"<b>stumps splattered!</b> Gabriel does it again, nip-backer from a good length, 90-plus mph and <b>that's a bingo!</b> Slightly loose forward defensive from Denly, and the ball ripped through the gap to make a mess of the woodwork behind him.

"yikes, left again, <b>hit on the back leg</b>... think it was high, maybe <i>just</i> outside the line, too. Probing start from Kemar, once he found his line"

"big stride, the line is tighter but Burns again shoulders arms"
"fuller length, 87mph/139kph and met with the full face of the bat to punch neatly through mid-off for a brace"
"flung down full, there's a couple of noises as the ball thuds into the pad... was it heading leg side? West Indies call for a <b>review</b>, and this could be close. No bat involved, was just the toe scraping the ground, and Burns had moved right in front of his poles. <b>Hawk-Eye has it smashing leg stump!</b> Gabriel gets his third, England on a wobble. Test cricket, how we've missed you!"
"full and straight, <b>90mph/145kph</b> and dipping towards the pads again... half an appeal, but maybe heading leg side. Don't think he got bat on it. Gabriel motoring right now"

fullish outside off and met with a solid block towards extra cover
pitched up and again punched into the off side coming forwards. <b>Clocked at 91mph/147kph</b>
"short and pulled, <b>battered through square leg and that'll run away!</b> Not middled, a hasty-looking shot, but one that will ease the nerves, I should think. Captain Stokes up and running"

"goes wide and pushes the ball in, worked around the corner for one"
"round the wicket, good length on off, defended coming across"

"back of a length and largely holds its line outside off, no shot. The ball dies on its way to the keeper"

"good length and targetting off stump, played back to the bowler"
"back of a length and much wider of off stump, nothing doing from Crawley"
"Holder goes wide of the crease, short and darted in at off stump. Safely negotiated off the back foot"

"Holder hits a hard length, the line is outside off. Crawley is late to withdraw his bat. Spliced away...but does not carry to the cordon"

Not given out lbw, but Holder opts to challenge the on-field not-out decision. This looks close. Beats the inside edge and thuds into the pad in line with middle. Impact in line, hitting leg stump. Crawley has to go and another fine review from Holder and WI"

"fuller and sliding in at off, played back to the bowler off the front foot"
"<strong>top delivery from Holder</strong> and he finds the outside edge. The WI captain goes wide of the crease, tricks Pope into believing that this is coming in with the angle. Instead, it swerves away against the angle. A crease-bound Pope is opened up, pokes at it and snicks it off to Dowrich. England five down"

"<b>got him at first slip!</b> Hasn't landed too many in troublesome areas, but this will do nicely from Bess - a loopy, enticing full ball that curves deliciously away from Hope after starting outside off. Hope has the front foot out but the ball goes on and on, away from him, and he has a big flap at it away from the body. Goes straight on off the pitch and it's a thick edge that floats up gently for Stokes. Just as a cloud comes on..."

"length outside off, pushed through a little flatter this time. Gets forward and jabs it to deep point"

"length ball wide outside off, left alone"
"length and in at the stumps. Slow-ish surface, so he can whip this to square leg's left off the back foot"

"short of a length in the corridor, drops the arms again to let that go"
"short in the corridor, more dropping of arms to leave. Decent technique, that"
"length and getting him on the front foot. It dips in late, but solidly pushed into the covers on the front foot"
"nicely put away. Looking very organised so far, Brooks. Big stride to reach this full ball outside off and he nails the gap between extra cover and deep point with a firm drive"
"and again! Deep point moved straighter, but Brooks beats him again. This wasn't quite as full as the last one and he had to open the wrists late as he went against the turn. To the left of extra cover and four more"

"length on middle stump, whipped through vacant midwicket"
"short of a length outside off, left alone"
"<b>stung in the forearm</b> as he looks to sway away from this short one. As we've seen all match, it's not easy to judge the short ones. This comes in off the pitch and hits him on the right arm, just under the elbow. He's alright by the looks of it"

"sweetly timed again. Length outside off, nicely behind the line to punch into the covers"
"<b>swiped fine again.</b> Dropped short and just outside off, but once again the natural angle is into him. So KCB leaps into the off side once more and this is more of a pull to beat fine leg's dive to the right"
"<b>Brathwaite reviews just in time!</b> Been given lbw trying to flick into the leg side off the back foot. My first thoughts were he was outside the line when struck. Another regulation angled-in delivery from Stokes...<b>and DRS says that's umpire's call on both impact and wickets.</b> Tracker has it clipping middle and off. Close, close margins but England have the breakthrough. Brathwaite trapped playing across the line. Might consider himself a tad unlucky, but he's set this innings up nicely for his team"

Maybe Brooks thought it was worth a squirt, considering the umpires' performance so far, but seemed to be a fairly obvious edge. England have a much-needed breakthrough"

"fired down o the stumps again, Holder flicks this insouciantly through square leg and ambles the single"
"short ball, top-edged... <b>Stokes gets his man!</b> Holder swings a pull shot down the throat of fine leg, and England knock over another, a wicket that will expose the tail. Well taken by Archer, stooping to complete the catch, and that's a small slice of <i>rewengé</i> for the England captain"

short and comfortably allowed to pass outside off
"length at off and he nudges another one with confidence, into the off side for a single. No strike farming required yet"
"<b>steers it wide of second slip</b> and West Indies have 300. Savvy stuff from Alzarri. This is short and up in the corridor, but not a tall order for him. He's already on top of that bounce and merely has to open the face to find a huge gap"
"short of a length just outside off, tapped through vacant point this time off the back foot"
"<b>slashed over the slips this time</b> and the lead is now in three figures. This has annoyed Stokes no end, I'm sure. Another short one outside off, too close for the cut, but he's thrown the bat at it and got it over second slip"
"<b>cleaned him up.</b> Tell you what, as long as we're drawing parallels with the Brathwaite wicket - this one is about what it would have looked like if his pad hadn't got in the way. Alzarri on the back foot as this nips in and hits the top of of middle and off. Stokes stares him down, don't need to say a lot when you've comprehensively beaten someone. <b>That will also make it 150 Test wickets</b> for him"

"more third man related agony for Stokes. Short of a length in the corridor, allows it to come on and steers it into the ground to beat second slip"
"<b>strangled down leg side, and he walks!</b> Short of a length at a leg stump line. He skips into the off side to make room for a swish down leg. Gets a thin edge and Buttler's still got it in his legs to jump across and grab that. Dowrich came in at a time where one wicket could have pulled England back in. He's more than done his part since. Superb innings to start off the Test series for him"

"length on off stump, defended down the pitch"
"wow, another fantastic delivery. Gabriel's hit the straps straight away. Wide of the crease to angle that in and then take it away off the pitch as he scrambles to defend in the corridor"
<b>and now it comes back in</b> and catches him on the thigh as he tries to leave for the wide line. Deflected between keeper and slip but that will be a dead-ball and the runs won't count

<b>just past off stump.</b> Any deja vu enthusiasts here? Short of a length ball nips in as he shoulders arms

full and into the stumps. Gingerly poked towards square leg from deep in the crease
"full and in at middle stump, defended into the leg side"
"<b>edged</b> but he was playing with soft hands and this is well short of third slip. Length outside off, apprehensive push at it with half a stride"

"full and into the corridor again, left alone this time"
short of a length in the corridor and he gets the bat out of the way very late to let this go
"<b>oh is that a missed opportunity?</b> Certainly carried to Dowrich, who flying down the leg side once again. Got one hand to it but couldn't hold on. But was there bat on that? Roach seemed very interested."

"<b>cops it on the glove.</b> Wide of the crease, gets it to cut away from middle stump, square him up, and climb onto his body"
"ah, that'll be good for the confidence. Length ball at the pads, nicely onto the back foot to whip this to fine leg's left. Superb effort from that fielder though, sprinting and then sliding to his left to stop the boundary. Roston Chase the man"

"touch short outside off, Wood stabs in front of point and they jog an easy one as cover trots across"
"short and wide and Archer guides a slap of a cut shot behind square, backward point does well to get a hand on it and prevent four"

"dug in short outside off stump, Archer taps into the covers"
"plugging away, Archer gets into line"
"<b>flashed through the cordon!</b> Bounces a bit more as Archer flays a cut, <i>just</i> out of reach of the diving Hope at gully. Went very fast off the outside edge"

"dug in short, 80mph/129kph and Archer swings a pull away to fine leg"

"short of a length, works this behind square on the leg side"
"got him, <b>nicks a cut to the keeper!</b> Wood throws his head back in disgust, gone attempting to hack Gabriel over the off side, probably done for pace. Think he knew the short stuff was coming and attempted to hit his way out of trouble... simple stuff works for West Indies"

"pitched up, looking for the stump-bursting yorker, defended stoically"

"<b>clubbed over midwicket!</b> Archer takes on the short ball with aplomb, means the West Indies requirement will now be 200-plus"
"bouncer, Archer pulls again, <b>there's a sound through to Dowrich!</b> Given on field and although Archer <b>reviews</b> I think Gabriel has his five-for here - yep, just wasting a bit of time, really, clear contact with the glove on its way through.

"length and just outside off, defended from deep in the crease"
"length and curving outside off, left alone"
<b>appeal for lbw</b> as he yorks him on leg stump. Can't get bat on the attempted flick. England think long about the review but it looks like they think he was struck outside leg. Good decision too. West Indies get two leg byes
"length and just outside off, has a push and is beaten on angle"
"short of a length across the corridor, hangs the bat inside the line to let that pass"
"short of a length and pushed wide outside off, left alone"
<b>past the outside edge.</b> Length ball slammed at an off stump line and cutting away from him as he gets forward to defend

"length at off stump, defended into the covers"
"short of a length at the body, defended down the pitch"
"short of a length, wide outside off, left alone. <b>Hang on, Campbell has just hobbled off.</b> A broken toe, suspected. Remember he took a yorker on the foot from Archer first ball.

"<b>plays it on! And the match is on.</b> Tentative from Brathwaite. This is a length ball that swerves into the corridor. He's behind the line - and outside off stump, so now threat of lbw - but it's a loose attempt at a defence. And he can only manage to play it on off the inside half of the bat. Jofra has shown up for England today. He has his first wicket of the match"

"<b>that looks plumb!</b> Archer keeping it simple, keeping it full, keeping it curving in at the stumps. Brooks looks to drive on the rise for the initial line, and is woefully beaten and trapped right in front of off stump. He doesn't review that"
<b>yikes.</b> Too short. And it climbs over both the batsman and the keeper
"<b>beaten on the drive.</b> Ohhhh boy, Archer is well and truly in the batsman's mind now, because this is a straightforward driving delivery in the corridor and he's cemented to the crease as he takes it on"

<b>88mph yorker at leg stump.</b> Watchfully poked into the leg side
"length and just outside off, gets forward and taps into the covers"
"length on middle stump, defended off the back foot"
nicely put away. Hope's looked nice and positive. Gets to the pitch of this outside off and opens the face very late to beat extra cover to the left
full outside off and leans in for another gorgeous drive. Can't beat wide mid-off this time
"<b>oh yes.</b> Three top-quality drives from Hope. Full and asking him to drive outside off again, so clearly a plan from Anderson here. But Hope is up to it, not allowing this to move too much. Right to the pitch of it to get his weight onto that and go to extra cover's right this time"
<b>late swing away</b> and Hope leaves. Tight margins here between these two. Anderson invites the drive again but gets a lot more bend out. Hope thinks of the drive and withdraws late

"full at middle stump, pushed to mid-on off the front foot"
length and swung in at off stump. Defended down the pitch

"<b>through him with a beaut!</b> Lovely in-dipper from Wood, wide of the crease and about 88mph. That's loose from Hope, looking to drive for the line and on the up outside off. The ball cuts back into him, catches his thigh and then knocks into the stumps"
"short of a length just outside off, punched into the covers"
<b>that looks very close for lbw.</b> Given not out but there was hardly a stride from Blackwood as he was pinned in front of middle. Going down leg? Seems like the umpire and England both agree. No review. That came in on a good length and he overbalanced trying to turn it into the leg side
"length outside off, bat-padded into the turf"
"length on middle stump, clipped to midwicket's right and wants the run. He's sent back"

"length and just outside off, defended off the back foot"

"length outside off, blocked down the pitch"
"<b>big appeal for lbw and Stokes reviews the not out decision.</b> Chase caught on the back foot, deep in the crease, from a delivery that turns in a long way from outside off. He was looking to smother that. Struck above the flap on his back leg, about an off stump line. No bat on it...<b>ooooh and that stays umpire's call.</b> That was hitting the top of middle stump according to DRS. Very very close and the bowler might argue that should be given"
"length outside off, blocked on the front foot"

"floated up full outside off, Blackwood props forward to defend again"
"<b>gets away with a thick outside edge!</b> Stokes was moving early as Blackwood shaped to cut, went to his right and could only get fingertips on the ball as it flew to his left!

"<b>got him!</b> Oh Jofra, you beauty. This is what he's in the side for. He's created this wicket with the <i>perfect</i> bouncer. There is realistically nothing Chase can do as it climbs up from short of a length and heads straight for his face. It's a whippy bouncer, not too short, but very steep. So there isn't time to sway away. Only to instinctively follow, get your hands up and hope that it dies into the pitch. In this case, it lobs straight off the gloves and Buttler grabs an easy one. That's West Indies' most reliable fourth-innings batsman gone. He's done quite a job, but this will put some pressure on the visitors. What a match. What a bowler."
"length and in at the stumps, tickled into the leg side off the back foot"
"short of a length outside off, neat bit of timing on the back foot punch, but backward point dives to his left and gets a hand on it. Parries it behind slip, so they get the run"
"full outside off, tapped back to the bowler"
"length outside off, blocked on the front foot"
savvy from Blackwood. Short of a length delivery skids on outside off and he waits and watches before dabbing this wide of first slip with a horizontal bat
"short of a length, turning into off stump. Punched to midwicket off the back foot"
"<b>oh gorgeous.</b> Overpitched outside off, nice transfer of the weight onto the front foot and a lean movement of the bat for a drive to sprint past mid-off, to his left"
"short of a length and turning in at off stump, watchfully defended"
"<b>gotta sprint.</b> And he makes it at the other end. Short of a length, into the body and he drops it into the leg side with soft hands. Midwicket swoops down at that but is beaten"
short and in at the chest. Arches back and stabs this into the covers
<b>beaten on the upper cut.</b> Blackwood gets a word from his partner to rein it in. That was short and wide and there was a third man in place
<b>another mean bouncer.</b> 88.8mph and rising up at the throat after pitching at an off stump line. Rises above that and fends it into the leg side
<b>got him on the floor this time!</b> And he has words to boot! This is spicing up nicely. Bouncer at a middle stump line and Blackwood has done everything to avoid it
"short one is too short this time, and he sways away easily"
"<b>big shout for lbw</b> but he looks to be struck outside the line. Bess has convinced Stokes to take the review. More of that tasty dip from Bess outside off. Dowrich is beaten on the inside edge trying to drive with a closed face. Struck on the back thigh...<b>impact is umpire's call.</b> Marginally outside off, DRS thinks."
nicely to the pitch this time and good wristwork to get it well to sweeper's left. Full ball outside off and he jammed it square on the off side
"full outside off, dead-batted down the pitch"

"short at the chest, gets leg side of this and pokes it into the off side"
"short of a length at the hips, deflected to the keeper's left off his thigh"
"<b>taken at first slip but Dowrich has reviewed immediately.</b> Short ball rising in the corridor, Dworich rising with it t try and deal. Ends up taking his eyes off the ball but it looks like he's got away with this. Was taking his bottom hand off, and this one has gone straight off his right elbow. Another nasty bouncer from Archer"
"short at the ribs, leaping up again but manages to drop this between short leg and leg gully this time"
<b>another questionable upper cut</b> attempted. Makes connection this time but also seems to withdraw from the shot. It's well short of third man
"<b>gets the full toss away</b> to the square leg boundary. Attempted yorker - was a good idea, coz Dowrich is still pinned deep in the crease as he faces this ball. Just about tickles it. Square leg had come in"
<b>past first slip to bring up his fifty.</b> He's had his luck but Blackwood did all the hard work that was required of him in the last session. Gets forward this time and defends with soft hands. Wouldn't have carried to second slip
"length outside off, defended on the front foot"
"full on off stump, patted out to mid-off on the front foot"
"elegant. Anderson strays onto the pads, overpitched and there for the flick. No one at square leg and Blackwood nails the connection on this"
"length and skidding on low outside off, defended to point off the back foot"
length and jumping up as he leans in to try and defend this. Manages to diffuse it and gets the bottom hand off
"length and just outside off, punched into the mid-off region"
"bouncer dug in too short and down leg side, left alone"
short of a length and cramping him with the angle. Bit late on that tap back to the bowler
"<b>just wide of gully!</b> If one person was capable of getting that on this ground, it was Stokes, but it's a touch too wide to his right. Again, Blackwood is uncertain as one climbs in the corridor. Looking for the upper cut, but had to adjust as this didn't rise. It went off the lower half of the bat. Third man cleans up"
"more controlled cut this time, nicely on top and hitting it into the floor. Short ball was angling into him and he had to arch backwards to open up the off side"
"length at leg stump, clipped to mid-on's right"
"length and in at off stump, solidly defended on the front foot"
"length in the corridor, blocked into the off side"
<b>get outta here!</b> That is pumped! Full outside off and he keeps the front leg out of the way and creams this straight over James Anderson. Imperious from Blackwood
"<b>bat-pad situation it appears.</b> Lbw turned down, and no review. That was an inside edge onto pad as he looked to turn and incoming delivery into the leg side. Was deep in the crease too, going across the line"
"length on off stump, defended off the back foot"
"length and down leg side, can't get bat on the attempted glance"
length and into middle stump. Turns it to midwicket with a closed face off the back foot
"length at middle stump, gets on top of that, bunts it to square leg's left off the back foot"
"gets a yorker first up, the new bat. Manages to jam it out towards mid-on"
length and into the pads. Literally. Bobs into the leg side where short leg is no longer there
<b>beaten.</b> Upper cut turns to attempted ramp as this short one keeps tailing into him. Sways back but there's too much pace on this
"length at middle stump, defended towards mid-on and he's down the pitch looking to steal a run. Funnily enough, it's the non-striker, looking backwards, who makes the good call to send him back. Mid-on hits the strikers stumps, just in case"
length and slanted in at middle stump. Solidly behind to defend this into the leg side

"<b>drills it straight to mid-off!</b> Oh no, Jermaine. Misses out on a second Test century and gifts himself the tension of being in the dressing room as West Indies look to wrap up a win that he has set up for them.

Mean bouncer from Wood, around the wicket, and he drops the bat as that heads for the helmet. He's on his feet, thankfully. Wood checks to see if he's okay and gets a nod. The doctor's checked him as well and has gone off now. Not sure if a concussion test was done in that short a period. Those rules still apply, remember. For now, Campbell goes on."
