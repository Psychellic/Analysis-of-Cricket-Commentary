"147kph, wide yorker, he miscues a square drive backing away, getting it into the off side"
"<strong>ramped to fine third man!</strong> Lovely shot. He backed away to the short ball, angled the bat and just upper cut it fine, using the pace and third man has no chance"
"140kph, full on leg, he misses out, getting an inside edge onto pad and it goes back to the bowler"
"short slower ball, outside off, he bunts it to the gap at cover-point"
"121kph, short slower ball loops over the head of Carey, tight but not called wide. That was a fair call"

"clears the front leg, and tries to heave it, he miscues through midwicket and they sprint back for a tight two"
"<strong>hammered forward of cover-point!</strong> He got a slower ball wide of off, and he slashed it hard forward of the man on the rope and beat the fielder!"
"left-arm over the wicket with a tight leg-stump line to the right-hander, solid in defence, up to mid-on"
"<B>massive inswinger and Vince has been castled!</B> Shades of Starc to Brendon McCullum in the World Cup final 2015, looking to drive but nowhere near the ball, and huge jubilation for the Aussies! Wow, what a start! If England thought they could shake off their nerves with belligerence, they've got another thing coming!"
"outside off, and this one nips off the seam away towards the cordon"
"up on the toes, punched with stiff forearms into the covers"
"ploughing a tight line across the right-hander, nip away from the bat once more as Root leaves alone"
"<B>short, wide, chancy!</B> It was confident enough in the end, but a touch tentative on the cut as Root placed the ball past a leaping Maxwell at backward point. England are up and running ..."
"<B>jeepers, that's a good leave!</B> Outside off, nipping back in, skims past the off stump with good carry! Starc hitting the seam from the get-go"
"wider line, 147kph, which isn't too shabby, nips away as Bairstow leaves alone"
"<B>wristy from Bairstow</B>... not quite to the pitch, not quite timed either, but plinked through the gap in the covers with an open face and lots of momentum"
"fuller length outside off, Bairstow brings out the kitchen sink and scuffs a wild drive on the bounce to third man"
"<B>whoops, can't bowl there to Root!</B> Swinging on a leg-stump line, ever further past the stumps, Root places bat on ball and tickles it fine through the finest of fine legs"
"a calm leave on a fuller length outside off. It's been a bit skittish from England so far, but no further chances..."
"pops from just back of a length, angled across Bairstow who is anchored on the back foot, wary of the inswinger. Beaten outside off"
"solid, full face, defending on off stump with a loud 'no!'"
"attempted pull, whistles into the midriff"
"<B>perfect timing, meeting the inswing with a clip off the pads</B>. Full face on contact, clean through long-on"
"solidly forward, defending on off stump"
"tight into the pads, Bairstow loses one hand on the bat as he attempts to deflect off the hip"
"driven, loosely, and<strong> passes the inside edge!</strong> Tentative and extravagant from Root, very hard hands, and too late on the stroke too"
"stiff-limbed once more, as Root fences this off the front foot into the covers"
"<B>there's the inswinger again!</B> Pace, length, inswing, it's a stunning triple whammy, and though Root thinks of the review, he knows it is utterly plumb! He was simply late on the stroke once again, even though his entire set-up had been primed for it. These are very, very dangerous signs for the world No.1s!"
"banged into the hip, Morgan shuffles across his crease"
"<B>loose from Morgan!</B> Staying very leg-sided in order to free up the drive, but there was big late outswing to the left-hander, and it zipped past the edge!"
"cramped on the pads, speared across the left-hander. A wicket maiden!"
"outside off, through to the keeper once again"
"<B>tentative from Bairstow!</B> Another poke forward on off stump, paralysed by fear of the inswinger, and nearly allows this to wriggle down into his crease"
"there is the inswinger, but it's on the pads. Can't clip it fine"
fired past the leg stump
"width, and an attempted slash through the off-side, but can't connect properly"
"<B>fierce from Morgan!</B> Skipping to the pitch like a frisky spring lamb, and <B>plundered through long-off!</B> Intent from the skipper! Wolf in lamb's clothing"
"anchored to the crease this time as Behrendorff finds extra nip outside off, and leaves it alone"
"back of a length, tight line, poked into the leg side with a closed face"
"<B>Bairstow at his best!</B> Seizing on the half-volley outside off stump, and simply extends his arms through the line of the ball, from a solid base. No stopping that!"
"back of a length, tighter line, that's excellently left"
"inswing once more, but Bairstow is alive to it, waiting deep in his crease and nudging to the leg side"
"<B>banged in short, Morgan climbs into the pull but that's a top-edge!</B> Cummins steadies himself inside the fine-leg rope, and this innings is in tatters now! The surprise bouncer reaps its rewards. England's fabled depth is going to be tested once again!"
"another left-hander meets the outswinger with a tentative push. Gosh, this is getting lively"
"driven off an inside edge, back down the pitch"
"driven, without conviction, meeting the full length, just a touch of inswing taking the ball away from the meat of the bat"
"pressed with caution into the off side, meeting one that shapes back into the right-hander with hard hands"
"on the back foot, defended back down the track to the bowler"
"<B>skims over mid-off!</B> Aaron Finch on a stepladder would have swallowed that! Bairstow planted the front foot, walloped through the line, really high on the bat and crowbarred to the rope with a huge slice of fortune!"
more solid in defence now... another over survived by the skin of England's teeth
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"back of a length, leg-sided, fended to the on-side off the back foot"
"on the back foot, tapped to the off side, watchful in defence"
outside off and through to the keeper
Stokes advances and is <strong>beaten outside off!</strong> Half an appeal from Carey as the ball skims through
"a skimmer outside off, Stokes rocks back to pull but can't connect. Cummins opens his account with a maiden to crank up the pressure ever more"
"fenced off the back foot, into the leg side"
"<B>a flat-footed mow!</B> Keeps low to beat the waft, but that was loose either way"
"<B>pounded off the back foot!</B> Bairstow's cover driving, off front foot and back, can be sublime. Back of a length this time, and piercing the covers like a high-pitched screech"
"pulled, firmly, off the back foot. Gathered at square leg"
"back of a length, outside off, solidly blocked into the off side"
"nip off the seam on off stump, Stokes rides the awkward bounce as he removes his bottom hand in surprise"
"squares up on the back foot, presenting a full face of the bat to see off the off-stump lifter"
"nurdled off the legs, dead-batted to short midwicket"
"rooted on the back foot, full face of the bat in defence once again"
"<B>supreme clip off the legs!</B> This is becoming a fine innings from Bairstow, capitalising once again on a slightly awry line, and that races down the slope to the Tavern stand"
fenced to midwicket once again but without the timing
"firm in defence, that's the Powerplay done and dusted. Australia's 'phase', you have to say!"
"tight line, back of a length, jabbed down into the pitch as Stokes is briefly caught in two minds"
"<B>more surprise for Stokes as this one pops!</B> Plays it well enough in the end, but there's nip off this deck for the tall seamers"
"<B>emphatic from Stokes!</B> He's off the mark with a Morgan-esque shimmy and slam, freeing the arms for a wild slap through the covers. Three steps down the pitch"
"Behrendorff gets straight back onto that awkward popping length. Stokes defends with the inside half of his bat, on the back foot"
"another advance to the pitch, Behrendorff hauls his length back by a yard and forces a defensive block into the covers"
"deep in the crease this time from Stokes, no attempt to disrupt the length this time, so Behrendorff drops it on a sixpence and lets the pitch do the rest. Blocked. This is a thrilling mini-duel"
"there's one of those singles, chiselled off the pads, behind square"
solidly forward in defence
"<strong>ooh, loose .</strong>... back of a length, an attempted chop through point but this hops over the swishing blade"
"cut, firmly, to Khawaja at deep backward point. Good running brings them back for two"
"outside off, no stroke this time"
"banged in short, but that's a confident controlled pull from Stokes, rolling the wrists on impact and steering it down to deep backward square"
"back of a length, turning gently away, cut off the back foot to deep cover"
"<B>extra bounce and Stokes nearly chops to point!</B> Identical to the Warner dismissal in the first innings, more pop and grip outside off, and surprising the left-hander on the cut. But this one squirts to no-man's land"
"on the back foot, clipping with the spin to long-on"
"reverse sweep, well intercepted by Smith, still crouching at slip"
fenced to the off side
"on the pads, nurdled with the spin to square leg"

"on the legs, tucked to midwicket, looking for two but it's not on this time"
"solid in defence, on the back foot"
"good leave outside off, bending back into the right-hander but on a wide enough line to ignore"
"<B>Bairstow holes out to deep midwicket!</B> That's a flaccid finish to a fighting knock, climbing into the pull but beaten once again by the extra bounce from the lanky Behrendorff! Cummins is lurking back on the rope and England are ever deeper in the soup!"

"fuller on off, he drives on the up back to the bowler"
"144kph, short into the ribs, he pulls but is hurried, getting it down to fine leg"
low full toss <strong>edged along the ground wide of slip</strong> and Behrendorff makes a good sliding save on the rope to save two
"drifting down leg, he tickles this fine with the angle and Buttler runs brilliantly to get three"
<strong>beaten on the inside edge!</strong> This gripped and bounced through the gate and over the stumps and Carey couldn't glove it cleanly. They get a bye
"flatter and it slides on low, he's back and jamming the bat down"

"122kph, good length outswinger, he defends with firm hands to cover"
he skipped down to a 126kph cutter and was taken on the pad it rolls to midwicket. Stoinis appeal for LBW. It's not out. But after some lengthy conversation Finch <strong>reviews!</strong>. He was miles down the track and outside the line. Impact was well outside the line. Terrible review from Australia
"<strong>Smith misses a run out chance! Buttler was cooked!</strong> It was full, Stokes got if off the pad, it rolls towards midwicket, Buttler is slow to respond to the call, Smith pounced moving forward and underarmed flicked as Buttler dived, Smith missed but Buttler was short!"

"130kph, he charges and backs away, cutting a length ball through point"
"<strong>caught at deep square! What a catch from Khawaja on the rope!</strong> Buttler can't believe it!

"<B>that is too good!</B> It was going to take something outstanding to dislodge Stokes, and Starc serves it up with an impeccable off-stump yorker, tailing back in wickedly as it zeroed in on the base of the pole! He kicks his bat away in disgust, but he's done everything he can to keep England alive ..."

"<B>edged and gone!</B> Moeen's shocking run can't end today, a perfect response. Tightened the line and length, nipped off the seam. met the outside edge of a hard-handed push and Carey swallows the catch!
