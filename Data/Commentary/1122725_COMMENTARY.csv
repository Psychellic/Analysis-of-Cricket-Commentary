"gone! Well, the break seems to have done some good to Sri Lanka. A wide length ball, on the shorter side of a good length. He's been getting out in that region quite a lot lately, and he reaches out and steers the ball straight to gully. He's planted his front foot half-forward, nowhere near the line of the ball, and just stuck his hands out at it"
"full, close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
down the track and he absolutely hammers this full one back at the bowler. Hits his hands and hits the stumps at the other end before rolling down to long-on.

bottom-hand wallops a tossed up ball off middle stump back at the bowler.
"<b>pins him lbw! But he's reviewed</b>. Right then. This is a skidder, pitching on off stump, short of a length, forcing Kohli to go back and try a flick through midwicket. The problem for him though is the ball seems to rush him, beats him, strikes the back pad on the knee roll. Three reds come up on the replay and Kohli walks off with 15,934 at his homeground standing up for him"

jumps away outside leg to punch a shortish delivery outside off through cover
punches to long-on the back of a length delivery turning sharply into him
"a little bit of room and that's all he needs to exploit a gap at third man. Waits and waits and waits and having seen the ball do its bit, he plays the perfect late cut"
"got him first ball and it's a beauty. It's as if Shami didn't even miss the previous Test. Brute from around the stumps, angles this short of length delivery back in, this one nips away ever-so-slightly off the seam to square him up, and the poke wobbles away to Saha who makes no mistake. Kotla roars. Dream start."
what's he doing? Looks to play a full-blooded T20 type swipe-pull. Beaten. <strong>Have Sri Lanka come out deciding they want to get out of Delhi ASAP? </strong>
the length ball skids through to hit the top part of his bat as he defends. Shami working up excellent rhythm and pace already.
"angles in a length ball on middle from wide of the crease, de Silva is late on this defensive stroke as the ball thuds into the pad off the inner part of the bat"

"back of length outside off, punched to cover"
"this is a 142kph length ball that nips back in to hit Dhananjaya on the box as he shapes to play a short-arm jab. He's in some pain. <strong>Ouch, that should hurt</strong> but he's is own man. Can't get assistance for that on the field"
"zippy length delivery but this is around the fifth stump, left alone"
"good leave this time, knows where his off stump is as he watches this length ball thud into Saha's gloves"
"feels for the delivery without any feet movement, this delivery angles back in to hit the pad off a thick inside edge"
Saha collects this in front of his face. Too good for Dilruwan. Invites the drive by pitching it up but he's late on the drive. <strong>Beaten comprehensively</strong>
this time he's solidly behind the line of this short of length as he defends
rooted to the crease as he defends this full incoming delivery to the off side. Once again not sure whether to play forward or back
"wafts outside off at a delivery that has some width, beaten for pace"
uppish but just past Ishant's reach on his followthrough. Checked his drive at the last moment. Plenty happening
"rapped on the pad again but <strong>he's been saved by a thin inside edge.</strong> according to umpire Nigel Llong. Now, <b> he's not allowed to actually make the signal </b> because that could influence the bowling team over a potential DRS call. As replays confirm, there was no inside edge here and this would've crashed into the top of middle and leg. India were perhaps influenced by Llong's signal. This ball clipped the front pad first and then deflected to hit the back pad."

"he's a dead duck because he's hit below the knee roll. India on fire, Ishant on fire. This one is pitched on length, comes back in off the seam to beat the inside edge and hit him on the back leg. This would've crashed into the top of off stump. Consulted with his partner over a review before deciding to walk off."
"good delivery first up. This is on the fuller side, Mathews caught on the crease as he defends"

"played down the wrong line, but somehow manages to squirt this length ball to the off side"
<b> dropped at second slip by Shikhar Dhawan. </B> What's worse? The ball has hit the helmet so Sri Lanka get five penalty runs. This was going towards Pujara's right at first slip at a comfortable height but Dhawan went across him to grab that and ended up fluffing it. Was going straight down Pujara's throat.

"<b> Kohli puts one down at second slip this time. </b> What is happening? He grabbed at that and Ishant can only kick the turf in disbelief. Another length ball outside off, Mathews pokes at one away from the body. This one flew at a comfortable height. No excuses for dropping that."

"looks to work this behind square, ball bounces high to hit the thigh pad"
"what a review from India. Jadeja was convinced this was hitting the stumps but wasn't sure if this was over the three-metre line. Kohli went for it and as it turns out, height and line wasn't in doubt, as was the distance from the stumps. Once Jadeja shortened his length, Dilruwan looked to pad it away as he stepped out but was struck in line in trying to do that. Wicket against the run of play for India. <b> The impact was apparently 2.99m from the stumps </b>. A small fraction more and he would've been not out. Done in by a fine margin."

"works it with the spin to deep square leg, 50 partnership up"

five overthrows. Rohit comes in from point and fires an unnecessary throw at the striker's end. This was a gentle little dab into the off side
sways out of the way of this short ball outside off
"two men gave it chase. Neither Ashwin nor Jadeja could get there. Too straight on the stumps from Ishant and he was in fine balance, even though the bat face turned just a little, there was enough on that as he whipped it to the midwicket boundary"
"guess what? Finally an edge induced by Ishant has been taken behind the stumps and it's an absolute corker of a catch from Saha. Length outside off, well outside infact, Sadeera has a poke at it and gets a thin edge that flew low to Saha's right. The key to making the catch possible was anticipating the possibility of an edge, which Saha did so he moved as the ball took the edge and managed to pull off a <b> one handed stunner </b> inches from the ground. Ishant rewarded for his persistence."
"excellent short ball angling in, but he dropped his hands and watched it go."

"and it's a forgettable debut. Thick inside edge off the pad to short leg. Jabbed at the delivery, the drift and revs on the ball did the trick for Ashwin. So, Roshen Silva has waited a long, long time to make his debut and has to walk back when his moment has arrived. All the elements of a typical Ashwin wicket. Overspin, drift, bounce. Superb to watch."

"rip roaring bouncer on the body, Sandakan was ducking for cover even as the bowler released the ball. Hung his bat out but no damage done. Excellent from Ishant."

"given! Joel Wilson thinks it's pad before bat, and it looks mighty close. Dhananjaya's reviewed this... With good reason. It's bat first.

"they were so close to walking off for light, they just about continue and look what has happened. Karunaratne, in trying to shut shop, and defend has got faint nick to a topspinner from Jadeja, excellent catch by Saha. Clear edge, Karunaratne was confused because the bat hit the pad at the same time there was a nick, but Sri Lanka would've lost a review had they decided to go upstairs."
"fired full and straight, Lakmal gets a good stride forward and blocks"
eased with the spin to cover
"Jadeja turns around to appeal without realising he's bowled Lakmal. This was drifting in full from wide of the crease, Lakmal was tentative in his forward prod and got some bottom edge as it rolled on to the stumps."

The ball drifted in and spun away sharply from the rough, this one bounced as well. Mathews made the cardinal sin of driving at that, got a thick edge that flew to Rahane's right but he's got excellent hands, which begs the question: why doesn't he stand there for the fast bowlers? Jadeja's persistence has paid off."
