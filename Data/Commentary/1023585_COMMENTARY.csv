and he has struck first ball. Poor shot selection from White as he gets down to sweep this fuller ball. It's a bit tricky from that angle and it does not drift away as much as White anticipates. Makes no contact on the sweep and gets hit on the pad and the umpire raises his finger. Question was if it was missing off-stump because of the angle. Replays show that it would have just about clipped off-stump. An inch outside and it would have missed

"clumsy effort from Andre Russell at deep square leg. It was another short ball but wide outside off this time. Bravo fetches the pull from outside off and the ball nearly carries to Russell.
