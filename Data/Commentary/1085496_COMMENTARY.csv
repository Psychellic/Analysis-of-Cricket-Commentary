"wow! Back of a length outside off, climbs into this and slams it on the up  over mid-off. That ball was climbing, but he's gone through the line with no half-measures and lifted it easily"
"good length, raps him in front of middle stump as he tries to whip one into the leg side. Appeals loudly, he thinks this is out, the umpire probably thinks it's pitching outside leg. Not given"

"full at middle stump, reaches out and slogs this into the leg side. Didn't connect - got the inside half - but Imad is providing enough pace to them at the moment. This finds the square leg boundary"
"full at middle stump, pushed to long-on off the front foot"
"<b>got him! Lewis has found square leg.</b> This wasn't a great ball. Short and at middle stump. Perhaps kept a tad low and perhaps beat him because of the pace on it.

Malik has it covered with his feet, but he's hopping at the last moment because he is close to the boundary. In the end, it goes through this hands"
"bouncer, goes for the pull again. Once again, it looks glorious, but he hasn't middled it. It lands safely to Malik's left on the square leg boundary"

"back of a length at off stump, punched to covers off the back foot"
"who is this guy, where has he been? Another gorgeous looking shot from Walton. This one is good length, angled across the off stump but he has watched this so nicely. And he is so well balanced. Stands his ground and sends it on the up over the long-on boundary"
"slower ball, cuts away slightly from off stump, he checks his waft and defends into the off side"

"<b>top edge lands safely.</b> He tosses it up again, this time it's turning away as Walton tries to find the long-on six again. Top edge, goes high and falls between cover and long-off who are convering behind the umpire"

"good length, flat at off stump, punched to covers"
"<b>Shadab has Walton caught at long-on..</b> Walton looks good and he's powerful, but his game plan was obvious and Shadab is a good spinner. He teases that powerful swing of his, by tossing it up at middle. But this one dips on the batsman and spins away, so Walton can only drag it off the toe of the bat to Malik, who is calmer this time, and safer too. Easy catch."

"good length at off stump, forward defence off the outside half"
"good length, fired in flat, steps out and swats across the line, cops it on the pads"
"good fielding by Rumman. Samuels steps out again, this time he's to the pitch of the ball and slams it powerfully past Imad at knee-height. That ball was travelling but Rumman is across to his right from long-off and puts in a slide to stop it"

"back of a length at middle stump, punched to long on off the back foot"
"he's down the track again. Not to the pitch once more, has to offer the pad once more"
not sure who got played here. Samuels' running down the pitch makes Imad push one full and wide outside off to try and induce a stumping. But this time Samuels is to the pitch and punches it to the extra cover boundary
"full and angled into the pads, catches them too as he closes his eyes and his head falls into the off side on his attempted flick"

"<b>Jason Mohammed will have better days than this.</b> Good bowling from Hasan. Kept bringing it back in against a batsman who was looking to steal singles through the off side. Ultimately, he's tried to open the face and drive through the covers at this full, inswinging delivery that shatters the stumps via the pads"

"good length, angled across off stump, Samuels clears the front foot and reaches out for it. Opens the face, gets the bottom of the bat and gets it over the point boundary thanks to Wahab's pace"
"oooooooo hammered! Similar ball, similar shape from the batsman, hangs back, makes room, but this one is bang out of the middle of the bat and lifted on the up over long-off"
"<b>oh dear, what were they thinking?</b> This is full at off stump, he drives it on the up to Hasan's right. He sticks out his hand and stops it. It rolls a few yards away from the pitch on the right and for some inexplicable reason, batsmen around the world keep 'brain fade' alive and kicking. They try to steal a run. Hasan already has the ball as the non-striker is starting the run. He merely has to turn around and underarm that back to remove Simmons"
"<b>and now that's three wickets from Hasan's last three balls.</b> That inswing is his weapon and he's used it to good effect once more. Samuels, with the inertia of the sixes he hit last over, has made room again and is poking away from the body. But that's a big gap and enough for Hasan to knock the top of the stumps off a good length"
"good length at off stump, gets behind the line and dabs it to point"
"walks across to cut out the swing, and whips this full ball at off stump to midwicket"

"back of a length, spinning away from off stump, pushed wide of long-on off the back foot"
"perfection from Shadab. Good length, drifting and dipping at middle and off. Pitches, spins quickly past the outside edge as he pokes at it with no clue"
"back of a length, skids low outside off and he slaps this behind point classily. Sweeper runs to his left and puts in a slide"
"walks at him, meets the full slower ball right under his eyes and tucks it with soft hands in that awkward region between the two deep square fielders in the deep on the leg side. Good batting from the captain. He's looked proactive."
"full at off stump, driven to long-off"
"<b>Rumman stands halfway down the pitch, arms folded behind his back without a word. He must have been a good student.</b> This is at a good length at middle stump, Pollard rooted to the crease once more as he pushes away from the body. Breaches his defence and slams into the stumps. Feet, eyes, bat not congruent at all with that and Rumman's trademark celebration tops it all off."
"full at off stump, mistimed drive straight to covers"
"good length at the pads, nips down the leg side slightly. Catches the front pad and rolls to Sarfraz's left"
"Shadab is carving a highway past the right-hander's outside edge. Good length, dip, pitch, turn, beaten"
"<b>and that brings this.</b> Pushes it slightly fuller this time. Big man Holder's eyes light up as this is closer to him. Goes at it, tries to hit over midwicket. Gets a top edge that hangs up harmlessly a few yards in front of long-off who makes no mistake"
"back of a length at middle stump, this one goes straight on. Brathwaite watches closely from deep in the crease and glances it to square leg"
"Yep. Back of a length, climbs past the outside edge"
"full toss at middle stump, he lifts it over the bowler and <b>Shehzad does brilliantly at long-on.</b> This is bouncing and bobbling on the floor as he puts in a dive. But he adjusts his hands for the bounce last minute and parries this to long-off"

"outswinging yorket at off stump, jammed into the covers"
"back of a length at the mid-riff, backs away and slices to sweeper cover"
"oh good ball. Unfortunate. This is full at off stump, he gets very late <b>reverse swing</b> away from the right handed who has tried to flick this. Leading edge flies between backward point and short third man"
"low full toss, but it's a slower ball and he has to reach away from his body to tap this to short third man, who also seems to be beaten by a slower ball as he fumbles"

"yorker at leg stump, flicked straight to square leg"
"low full toss, tailing in at leg stump. Clears the front leg and punches this between long-on and deep midwicket. That ball is racing away towards the boundary as those two fielders converge on it. Deep midwicket puts in a dive eventually and long-on backs up"
"this is the Brathwaite we were commanded to remember not so long ago. Good length ball at middle stump, stands his ground, watches it closely and that is a perfectly executed slog over midwicket. Not a single blemish in that shot, and that's not something you say about a slog."
"good length, wide outside off stump. Not a great length, but there's enough pace to beat him as he reaches out and tries to bunt it through third man"
"this time, he knows what the line is going to be. He's still not reached it, but he's closer to this wide ball outside off. Thick outside edge flies to the third man boundary"
"wow, you don't want to hear that sound as a bowler. Back of a length at off stump, hangs back and bludgeons this wide of long-off"
"low full toss at off stump, once again this is right out of the middle. A slice. But straight to sweeper cover"
"<b>Wahab takes a wicket at the end of a painful spell.</b> If length won't do it, pace will. This is back of a length, angled in at leg stump and smashes it down comprehensively as Narine searches for room to slap it on the up"

"inswinging yorker at off stump, can't get under this, squeezed out to long-on"

"back of a length outside off, swings wildly across the line, beaten again"
"and at long last, he goes for the single. Walks across the stumps, pushes it past Hasan who dives to his right. Brathwaite was running since yesterday."

"good length at middle stump, defended back to the bowler"
"good length at off stump, driven on the up, past Pollard at covers...who digs his knees into the outfield as he tries to pull this back at the boundary. And misses. That will be four. <b>Pollard is down outside the boundary line. His left knee is hurting and the medical team is out quickly.</b>"

"good length, it's that angle again. This time it's an inside edge before it thuds the pads"
"<b>just clears Narine at mid-on.</b> This is a slower ball outside off stump, good length. He's picked the variation and uses the turn off the pitch to lift it over mid-on on the up. Safe shot to attempt"

"another slower ball, this one is full at off stump, driven firmly to mid-off"
"full at leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
"good shot. Poor ball, but good shot. Full and down the leg. Gets down on a knee and ramps it over short fine leg with good shape"
....aaaaaand repeat. <b>This time it's six.</b> Full at leg stump again but this time he has more swinging room in front of his pad. Utilises it and lifts this one over square leg

"good length at off stump, drives on the up with soft hands to steal a single at mid-off"

"short and wide, cut away easily to sweeper"
