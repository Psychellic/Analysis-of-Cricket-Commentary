"steered over the diving Maxwell at point, down to square third man. Richardson had to move to his left this time, comfortably back for the second run"
"stands tall and spanks this wide of point. Got on top of the bounce, used the width and let his timing do the rest. Superb from the skipper. Sri Lanka couldn't have asked for a better start. Gets their fans going, the flags are out"
"helped along to fine leg. Did he get some bat on it? Yes, a very faint one onto the thigh pad. <strong>He was hurried for pace</strong> first up."
"slants a short of length delivery across, left alone"
full on the pads and Dimuth nearly flicks this into the gap past the diving square leg fielder. The ball slows up near the boundary. Excellent wrist work

"much fuller and straighter, squirts this into the off side"
"pulled! This is even better. Right off the middle. Into the gap between midwicket and square leg. Short square boundary that side and at the moment, there's just one winner in this battle. Magnificent approach to the chase. Can Sri Lanka sustain this?"
driven back but Starc stops it with his boot on his followthrough. Was timed beautifully though

beaten as he looks to slash this with a closed bat face. <strong>Lucky to not get an edge.</strong>
gorgeous! How good does he look when he looks to play proper cricketing shots? Not a half-volley by any means but he plans half-forward and laces this into the gap between cover and point. Ball slows down towards the square boundary

hops back and tucks this into the gap at square leg
"Richardson bowled, Dimuth defends, but one of them attempted this delivery in half-heated fashion. Replays confirm Dimuth wasn't entirely read. Dead ball. So he'll rebowl that? Okay, umpire says it's a legal ball as the batsman ended up facing it"
"on the pads and he's clipped this wide of short fine leg. Easy, very easy. Nothing more than a warm-up delivery. <strong>Help-me-on-its-way welcome drink</strong>"

This time, there's an overthrow from Finch and they get five (four overthrows). It's all going Sri Lanka's way so far. Kusal threw himself in desperation to complete the run, but not sure even that dive would've saved him if it was a direct hit."

"pulled across the line, not timed all that well but he'll come back for the second"
"dismissed from his presence! Banged in short, Perera wallops this pull in front of square. Raced away to the fence. Tired delivery from Richardson, not going to help bowling such lengths in the mid-130s. Cracking stroke that has forced a new bat on its way. The Sri Lankan fans in the stands are loving it, absolutely loving it."
"beaten, extra bounce that time. Looked to run it down. Richardson and Carey think there may be something here, right on the edge and <b> Finch reviews with two seconds on the clock. </b> Let's see if there is a spike there. Replays come back with a straight line, which means there is no spike and Kusal can continue batting. <b> Not out and Australia lose a review. </b>"

width and he slaps this to deep point
