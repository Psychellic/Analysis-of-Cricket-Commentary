"off the mark immediately, nudges an away swinger from middle towards short midwicket"
"just short of Dhawan at first slip. Boy, banana swing from Bhuvi. That's exciting. A tentative poke from Vohra as the delivery deviates away from off stump, nearly had his man"
"on the pads, and clipped away behind square leg. That's adding insult to injury, isn't it? He's strong in that area."
opens the face of the bat and eases the short ball behind point
"back of length delivery on middle, tucked towards midwicket"
"on the shorter side again, this one outside off, Vohra dabs it behind point"
"beauty, first up. Full and outside off, this one holds its line, Vohra was late on the drive"
"beaten for pace by the short ball this time. It was climbing onto him on middle and leg, he pulled and missed. Good carry on this pitch"
"shot of the tournament! Wow, that one has sailed over cover. Overpitched, and Vohra planted his foot forward and simply extended his arms to get the elevation, the ball sailed over the ropes. Difficult to play that shot but he made it look ridiculously easy"
pushed off the backfoot to short cover
mistimes the slower delivery to mid-on. Went through with the pull a little too early
"full and swinging back into middle and leg, Vohra misses the tickle, deflects to Naman Ojha behind the stumps"
"the slips were taken off, but it doesn't matter. Vijay chases a wide delivery, gets a faint edge which Naman Ojha gleefully accepts. Have to say it was a poor shot. There was no conviction whatsoever. Just a feeble push and he's paid the price."
"he gets this one to shape away. Floats it around the length area on middle, Marsh watches it through to the keeper"
"play and a miss. Too full for him to attempt a flashing cut shot, didn't miss the edge by much. The ball nipped away sharply again. Things are happening with the new ball"
another awayswinger that starts around legstump and ends up around the fifth or sixth stump outside off. Banana swing. Marsh shoulders arms
"he was ready for it this time. Too full, errs just a little in length. It was full and had the width for Marsh to lean forward and crash that past cover. Power, placement, timing - everything perfect"
"too straight this time, flicked away off his pads to deep square leg"
"tossed up on middle, pushed to cover"
"lucky to get away with that short ball. Marsh makes room and slaps it straight to point, Morgan was alert"
driven with the spin to mid-off
"swept hard, but straight to short fine leg. A metre on either side of the fielder and it was four"
"superb stop off his own bowling. Vohra is yorked, squeezes it back towards the bowler, who dives to his right to prevent the single"
"fires a full delivery down leg, good take by Ojha"
"juicy full toss on off stump, Vohra toe-ends an attempted loft towards mid-off"
"bowls the heavy ball on middle, Marsh is hurried into the pull, mistimes it wide of the midwicket fielder"
"too full and sliding away, Vohra slices the inside-out stroke over cover point"
"uses the pace of the bowler and angles it down to Mustafizur at third man, excellent running between the wickets. Marsh had just turned when Vohra was halfway down the pitch for the second. Vohra was running to the danger end"
"buffet bowling, Geoff Boycott would say. No one behind square on the leg side, and he bowls a short ball on middle and leg. Vohra was ready to play the pull, used the pace to execute the stroke"
"muscles the pull in front of square, one bounce into the midwicket boundary. You can't bang the ball in at 130 clicks and expect to get away. Poor bowling"
whips the slower off-cutter on middle to midwicket
"gives him the charge and misses. Looks to back away and go over cover, deceived by the cutter, didn't miss the outside edge by much"
"another cutter, another slog across the line, another miss. This one goes on the bounce to Naman Ojha"
"superb stop off his own bowling, it was played back down the pitch, Mustafizur perhaps surprised Vohra with his instincts, fired a throw at the striker's end too, but it was wide"
"top-quality bowling, not sure how that missed the off stump. Rip-roaring yorker just a centimeter outside off from wide of the crease, Vohra jammed his bat down to keep it away, but missed"
"slower one on middle, pushed to cover, Vohra takes off for a run that was never on as Dhawan swoops in like a hawk and hits direct at the striker's end. Vohra dived, but the bat popped up after hitting the turf. Moments like those can lift the side. The pressure of four dot balls got to Vohra, a promising innings has come to an end. Dhawan may be short of runs, but you have to say that was worth its weight in gold. He's already made a contribution without making a run yet"
"drives and misses. It wasn't there for him to play the shot, got his bat to the ball half-heartedly. <b> Wicket maiden for Sunrisers </b>"
mistimes a drive wide of cover
"bunted to cover, there's a bit of grip for the spinners here"
"drops it with soft hands towards point for a quick single, Tare, a regular wicketkeeper, was a touch late to react"
"drifting into middle, punched to long-on"
"short outside off, pushed to sweeper cover"
"can't pick the gap on the off side again. Too short, sat up nicely and he crunched it straight to cover"
flicked wide of midwicket for a quick single
"length ball on middle, works it wide of Warner at midwicket"
"poor ball, and punished. Too short and down leg, he swivels and pulls it behind square. Mustafizur at fine leg would have hoped for a breather, but had to dash 20 yards to his left to try at stop that. In vain"
"width on offer, crunched to Morgan at deep point"
"Morgan was moved to deep point for Marsh, and the ball is crashed into the region where he was stationed in the previous delivery. This was short and wide, the fierce cut was nearly stopped at deep point, but Morgan pushed it over the ropes as he tried to pull it back in. Full marks for the effort though"
driven to mid-off for a quick single
"skidder on middle from round the stumps, pushed to point"
"gets underneath the flight and lofts it cleanly over long-on. The power of Shaun Marsh to the fore. Not much turn there, which allowed him to swing through the line"
"drops it short, and Marsh nearly plays it off the keeper's gloves to pick the gap between point and short third man. Superb timing. Used the depth of the crease to good effect there"
whipped from outside off towards long-on
punched back to the bowler
"too full and outside off, he mistimes the drive to long-off"
"back of length delivery on off, pushed to cover"
"outstanding catch by Naman Ojha. Miller's attempted cut has resulted in him getting a thick edge, which Ojha dived to his right to pluck it. He was airborne when the ball lodged into his gloves. The ball bounced more than Miller would have liked. His poor run this season continues."
"yorker on middle, squeezed to fine leg. He somehow got a bat on it, would have been very close had he missed it"
misses the dab towards third man
"cramped for room as the ball breaks back into him, through to Naman Ojha as Marsh misses the cut shot"
"so there won't be an M&M show tonight. It happened against Gujarat Lions, it has happened again tonight - both batsman falling in the space of a few deliveries. It was a short ball on middle, Maxwell went inside the line and helped  it on its way to fine leg, where Mustafizur dived forward to complete the catch."
"sliding into middle and leg, tucked to fine leg"
"what a way to get off the mark, stylish drive towards sweeper cover. Leans forward and punches it into the gap with a slightly opened bat face"
hops back and turns it to square leg
"squared up by the late nip away from middle, point fielder is in business to stop that defensive shot"
"pulled, but not off the middle, straight to deep midwicket"
"back-of-the-hand slower one on middle and leg, nurdled to square leg"
"into the blockhole from wide of the crease, squeezed past the bowler"
"makes a bit of room and eases the short ball towards point, he looked to bisect point and short third man"
"he's nailed that, but one bounce to the man at deep midwicket"
"quality stroke from this pugnacious batsman. Short, wide and he unfurled a superb cut shot. Hit it late to place it behind point"
hops back to wrist it to midwicket
"steps out to hit through the line, struck well, but Henriques is up to the task on his followthrough"
"boom! Marsh's eyes light up as he sees the flight. Steps out and swings clean, probably got it off the toe end of the bat but it still had enough power to carry all the way"
"put down by Bhuvneshwar at point. It was a tough catch, you have to say. Too full, Marsh sliced it towards point, but the ball was swerving away from a diving Bhuvi. All he managed to get on the ball was his fingertips"
gets forward and bunts one to cover
"fires a full one down leg, keeper fails to collect it cleanly, they scoot through for a run"
"makes room and cuts that into the gap at deep point, Warner hares across to his left to mop that off"
"nearly yorked himself, dug back to the bowler"
"on the fuller side again, Marsh eases it down to long-on"
"starts off with a length ball on middle and off, defended off the backfoot"
"driven firmly to mid-off, Naik at the non-striker's end was flirting with the possibility of a run until he was sent back and had to face a fiery throw. He was airborne, a direct hit and he was gone"
"and the magician has delivered again! Marsh is completely foxed by the off-cutter as he pushes outside the line, misses it and is struck on the flap of the pad. Was it too high? The umpire didn't think so. Warner is the first to run up to his bowler and give him a big bear hug and a high five. Big moment, this."
"lucky to get away with that. Axar couldn't have asked for a more challenging first delivery. Toe-crushing yorker on middle, somehow jams his bat down in time to keep that out, quickly pinches a run"
"Naik is too early into the drive, failed to account for the off-cutter again, beaten!"
"gives him the charge to swing over mid-on, misses again. No prizes for guessing, it was the off-cutter again."
"short ball outside off, punched to the left of sweeper cover"
"flicked uppishly, but lands short of deep midwicket. It as a half-hearted stroke from Axar. Slowness of the surface?"
"swings and misses. Too full and well outside the wide line, Naik tried to reach for it and hit it over cover"
gets a thick inside edge towards square leg
"the right intentions from Axar. Sees it short, it was sitting up nicely too, and pulls it, but one bounce to deep midwicket"
dabbed with soft hands towards point
"what a shot to raise the 100! Looks to vary his pace by bowling an off-cutter, but Axar had decided he will have a swing at that come hell or high water. Luckily for him, it was in his arc to swing through, and he generated enough power to launch it over the sightscreen"
"yorker-length delivery on middle and leg, gets a thick inside edge towards midwicket. The bat face turned in his hand as he made contact"
"steps out to hit that over long-on, can't lay a bat on it. He's been trying to give him the charge and loft over the infield for a while now"
"right into the blockhole, Naik has done some damage to his bat as he keeps that out. There's a chip in the toe end"
"chance for a run-out at cover, but they somehow got through. Dhawan decided not to throw, perhaps he thought it was pointless considering Mustafizur wasn't at the crease"
"full and on the pads, flicked to Dhawan at deep midwicket"
"Naik is clearly tired of giving the charge. This time, he tries to slice it over point. End result? Beaten again by the off-cutter"
hit hard towards long-off
"yorker-length delivery outside off, squeezed to cover"
"too early into the pull, hit on the thigh, they get a leg-bye off the deflection to short third man"
"Axar is showcasing his batting skills when his team needs it the most. This one was a length ball angling across, swung his arms freely to muscle it over long-on. That sailed into the stands, would have been six anywhere. The cross-batted swat, if you can say"
toe-ends another swipe to long-off
"angles in a low full toss on middle and leg, played towards deep midwicket"
"struck hard, but Warner's slide and stop at long-off has saved them three runs. The release and the powerful throw completed a magical piece of work on the field"
"slower one on middle and leg, swept to short fine. He had to wait and wait before making conntact"
"swings leg side, the ball flies off the face of the bat to sweeper cover, Warner was at it again, this time towards deep cover. He was going towards his wrong side, and that allowed the batsmen enough time to complete two"
"struck hard, Warner in business again at long-off"
"swung across the line, the ball was tailing into middle, squeezes it to deep midwicket"
"looks to clear long-on, but didn't get underneath the ball, rolls to long-on"
"full and angling into middle and leg, hit straight to long-on. Looks like Naik is tiring"
"drilled towards long-on, where the ball bursts through Deepak Hooda's hands and into the long-on boundary. It was struck really hard, Hooda didn't have much time to move there."
"can't find the gap at sweeper cover, Dhawan comes around to stop that lofted hit"
"top work by Tare at point, cleverly done by Axar who squeezed it with an angled bat there"
"plays a Shahzad-like helicopter hit, so much effort for a single"
"glorious shot. He was lining himself to go over cover, and Bhuvi played into his hands by floating a juicy full toss outside off, he got down on one knee and slapped it into the gap at sweeper cover"
flicks the low full toss towards deep midwicket. Raises the 50-run stand
"he made it look ridiculously easy. This one was skewed high into the nightsky over mid-on, Henriques was running back, but didn't lose sight of the ball as he covered good ground, kept his composure and focus even as it swirled in the air for a long time, before completing the catch. He wasn't on the move when the catch lodged into his bucket-like hands. Mighty impressive. Another wicket for Mustafizur"
"swings and misses. This was fast and furious, close to 140 clicks, late on the attempted carve over cover"
"spears in another near-perfect yorker, squeezed to long-on, Axar wanted the second, but was sent back. A direct hit at the bowler's end and he was gone"
"drilled towards wide long-on, didn't seem like he middled it"
"high full toss made even more higher by the fact that Dhawan was three paces down the pitch when he swung at it, Dhawan comes running in quickly to prevent the second"
"full and swinging away from off stump, eased to third man, the ball sped off the face of the bat"
"shapes away from the length area on middle, dabbed to point"
"shapes away from outside off, was there for the drive, but Dhawan let that go instead"
"crunching cover drive. Too full, just the right amount of deviation for Dhawan to free his arms and place that between the two fielders"
"hops back and runs it down to third man for an easy single, looking a lot more comfortable at the crease."
and that man at cover point is in business immediately
mistimes a drive to cover
"pulled towards fine leg. Was hurried into the stroke, got it on the upper half of the bat"
"back of length delivery that slides across the face of the bat, Warner goes deep into the crease and punches it to point"
"late on the shot, the ball nips back in sharply to take the edge and roll towards third man.  Bounced over his waist on that occasion"
"nearly chops it back onto the stumps. Drives, but played outside the line of the ball, the inside edge bounced over leg stump. Dhawan realised it was a mistake and quickly played a shadow stroke to show himself how it ought to be done"
"width, and punished. Free swing of the arms to crunch that past cover point. Generated tremendous bat speed as he made contact"
"don't bother about that, for Warner has nailed it over wide long-off. This was too full and swinging away, he got down on one knee and swatted it away. Made it look easy"
"shapes away from leg stump and finishes on off, Warner gets forward and defends it with a dead bat"
"good stop by Sandeep on his followthrough, is getting the ball to swing away late"
"what a shot that is! Warner on the charge. This one was too full, once again in the arc for Warner to swing through the line. He went through with a straight bat and it carried all the way into the second tier"
"plays the cross-court forehand this time, both his feet up in the air as he pulled it into the gap at deep midwicket, recovered well to complete the run and had enough time to hare back for the second. Incredible!"
"whipped behind square, just using the bowler's pace to ease it into the gap. Poor from Sandeep Sharma"
"tucked away behind square towards Axar Patel. He wanted to play it in front of square, but was pushed back because of the extra pace. That one was bowled at 141kph"
goes back into the crease and angles it down to square third man
"dismissed from his presence, and how! Wonder what is the use of trying to test the bounce of this surface. Warner was ready for the pull, picked the length early and smashed it into the gap between mid-on and square leg"
bunts it down to third man
"looks to dab but is too close for comfort, just about manages to play it on the bounce towards the keeper, who fires a wide throw at the bowler's end. No one was backing up at mid-on. So what was to be just a run is now five. It simply sums up the mood in the KXIP camp. Disbelief, frustration."
"width, and smashed! He hasn't learnt, gives Warner all the time in the world to rock back, free his arms and slap that  behind point. Raining boundaries here"
"floated outside off, jabbed to point"
punched with the spin wide of cover
"makes room, and bang! Maxwell darts it short, Warner was well outside leg stump as he swung through the line and blasted it over wide long-off. Can you imagine that being hit off the backfoot? Wow"
"and more runs! This one was a touch fuller, but Warner still manages to use the depth of the crease to cut that behind point. Incredible"
"slows it down nicely this time, gets a bit of grip and turn, Warner is beaten on the lofted hit. The third umpire is summoned to see if Warner's backfoot was dragged back in as the bails came off. He's in"
"Maxwell and Naik appealed thrice, each of it a vociferous one. Then they pleaded, but the umpire is unmoved. Almost a carbon copy of the previous delivery. Warner looks to go over cover, but is beaten in flight as the ball beats the outside edge. Maxwell has a wry smile on his face. The smile of a man who knew it wasn't out"
turns the length ball on middle towards square leg
"looks to go over midwicket, gets a thick inside edge towards wide mid-on"
"closer to the stumps this time, defended with soft hands to the leg side"
dabbed down the pitch towards the man running in from short cover
"Ganguly-esque. A packed off side field, but he still manages to pierce the gap. Class batting! He wanted to go over cover, but saw Mohit take the pace off the ball, and quickly readjusted to direct it between cover and point."
"ball gets big on him this time, fails to ramp it over the keeper's head"
"back of length delivery outside off, punched to cover"
"bludgeoned past the bowler. It was short, and it was a rocket pull. Bowler and umpire were in danger and had to take evasive action if they didn't want to get a bruise on their body. Dhawan tried to put his hand out but pulled out"
uses the width to reach out and steer it down to third man
"Dhawan into the act, times the pull well, but straight to deep midwicket"
"pulled behind square, straight to Manan Vohra. <B> 50 off just 23 balls </b> 27th IPL fifty for him"
"short and way outside off, Dhawan is disappointed that he missed out"
stands tall and punches it to long-off
"dishes in a short ball well over Dhawan's head, that's one bouncer for the over as well"
"this one deviates back in from outside off, bunted to the off side"
"closer to the stumps and on middle, played back to the bowler"
"tight line, not much room to free his arms, pushed to cover"
"squeezed between cover and mid-off, went after that one but didn't get it off the middle"
swung across the line towards long-on
"well disguised slower delivery on middle, played with soft hands"
"width on offer, but can't pick the gap. Warner struck that well, but straight to point"
"pulled, and pulled well. Sandeep Sharma was no more than a few yards away from the ball at wide long-on, but he gave up as soon as it landed on the lone practice strip in the deep"
"gets it wrong, around the seventh stump outside off, some exercise for the umpire"
"arches back and bunts it down to Mohit at third man, the fielder took a couple of seconds to release the ball, by which time Warner was through with the second"
"cut away, but straight to point"
"even the mishits are not finding the fielders. This one got big on Warner as he looked to pull, skewed it towards a sliding David Miller at long-on"
gets to the pitch and strokes it over the infield to Vijay at deep cover
"nips back into middle and leg, defended with soft hands"
picked off his pads towards fine leg
nurdled behind square on the leg side as they jog across
"mistimes a drive to long-on, got it off a thick inside edge"
"relief for KXIP. Warner was through with the lofted hit but the ball got stuck in to the surface, which perhaps affected his execution. The bat face turned to skew the ball towards Miller who took a comfortable catch at long-on."
"chaos, confusion and a wicket. Bonus for KXIP. Tare hit it to mid-off and took off for a single when there wasn't, Dhawan didn't move an inch as the throw from Miller was properly collected by Naik who broke the stumps down at the striker's end. Tare's desperate dive came after the stumps had been broken. Lack of communication. Not sure if Dhawan and Tare have batted together at all previously"
driven with the spin to long-off
"gets back into the crease and pulls it to wide long-on, off the mark immediately"
"drifting into middle and leg from round the stumps, tucked towards short midwicket"
"firm drive, but a good stop at extra cover"
"doesn't take long to bring out the late cut, but Mohit Sharma is caught napping at short third man, gives away a run when there was none"
"pushed through quicker on middle and leg, whipped off his hip to deep square"
"gets a thick inside edge onto the pad as it lobs in the air, Sandeep, on his followthrough, was late to go for the catch. Opportunity missed"
gets forward and defends
"slash and a miss. Went for a square drive off the frontfoot, but the bat was miles away from the ball. Played outside the line"
"mistimes a drive to mid-off, Dhawan is trying to crunch there here"
driven on the up into the gap at sweeper cover
"pulled, but not off the middle, lands on the bounce to Vijay at deep square leg"
"not much a bowler can do if your fielders let you down. It was pulled well, but Vohra at deep midwicket seemed to have done everything except stop the ball. He slid, slipped, got his hands on the ball, but couldn't stop it"
goes back into the crease and pulls it to deep square leg again
"Morgan's turn to come to the party. Gets on top of the bounce and pulls it in front of square, past mid-on. What timing"
slashes that one to third man
"slower one on off stump, pulled across the line to long-on"
"full and closer to the stumps, defended back using a straight bat"
"slower bouncer on middle and leg, Dhawan top-edges the pull, but the ball lands short of fine leg"
tucked to midwicket
"width on offer, crunched to Vohra at sweeper cover"
"wow, he has rolled his wrists over the ball to play that pull behind square. As it turned out, he smashed that. Can't bowl short and get away by bowling in the mid 120s"
""
"Dhawan gets Dhawan. This was short and was sitting up for Shikhar to play the pull, the only problem was he was too early into the stroke as the top edge was pouched by Naik. The knock should give him confidence going forward though"
"short on middle, pulled to deep square leg"
"grip and turn from middle, driven with the spin to long-off"
"poor ball, fires it way outside off, Morgan lets it go"
"rapped on the pad as he looks to play across the line, but the ball pitched outside leg."
uses the pace of the bowler to bunt it to short third man
"flicked into the gap at deep midwicket, the two boundary riders there thought the other one was going for it"
"floats it full on off, nips away off the seam, pushed to mid-off"
driven on the up towards Miller at wide mid-off
"much better delivery. Lands it in that channel where the batsman isn't sure whether to play forward or back. Morgan looks to play a cute little dab, but is beaten as the ball skids off the deck"
slapped towards Vohra at sweeper cover
"clean strike, and that has carried all the way. Unimaginative from Rishi Dhawan. Floats another length ball outside off, Morgan dances down the track, creates a bit of width and then swings through as the ball sails over long-off"
"lands it short, he rolls his wrists over that one to pull it to deep midwicket"
"slower delivery on middle stump, punched to long-off"
"another attempted slower ball, this one slips down leg, goes on the bounce to the wicketkeeper"
"this one's a ripper, the batsman had to sway out of the way or try to pull in less than a split-second. Umpire thinks it was way over the batsman's head"
"free flow of the bat to drive that towards deep cover, Hooda's bat swing has been impressive. He hasn't looked to play the big shots, sensible"
wrists it down the ground to long-on
"can't get too predictable in this format, it doesn't matter how many runs are left. There was no one at deep midwicket, and Morgan picks that gap as he swings the slower ball into that direction. One bounce into the boundary"
"it was nothing more than a short-arm jab, but Manan Vohra threw himself to his right to take a good low catch at midwicket. Morgan can't believe it, but has to go. Had it beat Vohra, that would have screamed into the midwicket boundary"
"spears in a yorker from wide of the crease, squeezed to short midwicket where Miller picks up the ball and throws the stumps down at the non-striker's end in one motion. Hooda was casually strolling down the pitch, and has paid for it. Even a lunge in the end couldn't get him back in. Unnecessary"
driven hard to wide long-off
"this one's a slider on middle from round the stumps, tucked to midwicket"
driven inside-out with the spin to long-off
gets to the pitch of the ball and drives it to deep cover
"casually done, but very effective. Chips down the track and flicks it with the angle over midwicket. Make that three in a row for the Orange Army. This has been a comprehensive win"
