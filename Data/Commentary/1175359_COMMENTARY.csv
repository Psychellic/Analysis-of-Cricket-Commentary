"a bouncer this time from Kulkarni, on middle and leg but it's too high and has been called a wide"
"slower length ball around off, Gayle pushes it towards mid-off and sets off, a fumble there by Samson means he makes it easily, and that's <strong>4000 IPL runs for Gayle</strong> - the fastest to reach there"

"back of a length, 142kph, angling into middle stump and denying Agarwal room as he tries to create some. Dabbed gently to backward point"

sees Agarwal backing away to make room and follows him with a slower short ball at his chest. Jabbed down the ground to mid-on
"he was denied width all through the previous over, and now Stokes gifts him acres of it. Fullish and wide, and he gratefully slaps it away to the right of backward point"
"shorter, closer to off stump, dabbed to backward point"
"full slower one angling into leg stump. Stokes delivers from past the vertical and creates this sharp inward angle, and that, coupled with the lack of pace, makes Agarwal's lofted hit go weakly in the air, on the bounce, to the right of mid-on, off the inner half of the bat"
"shortish on off stump, jumps back and across and punches crisply with a straight bat to the left of midwicket. Lovely timing"
"looks for the wide yorker, I think, ends up sliding it a lot wider than intended, and Gayle leaves it alone"
"back of a length, angling away into a fifth-stump line. Stops on Gayle a little as he shapes to slap through the covers, and he ends up dragging it back to the bowler"

"back of a length outside off, and Gayle puts it away cleverly, waits on it and dabs it late and dabs it fine. Third man is back, but he's too square to be able to cut this off"
"lucky. Digs in a short offcutter and Gayle, who was stepping out premeditatedly, is surprised, ends up playing something between a pull and a flick, and sends a top edge looping over the keeper's head"
"back of a length outside off, slower ball again, waits and chops it away through point"
"length ball on off stump, and Agarwal, staying leg-side of the ball, lofts it high and clean over extra-cover"

"another dart angling down leg. Gayle looks to sweep and gets a bit of thigh pad on it, rolls into the short fine leg region"
"gone, one Karnataka player gets another. Length ball on off stump and Agarwal goes for the big loft down the ground. Gets a touch too much underneath the ball, I thought, so he gets slightly more elevation and slightly less distance than intended. Kulkarni takes a great catch at long-off, jumping backwards with his arms up over his head, and he cups it with both hands even as his back foot lands perilously close to the boundary cushions. Does really well not to step on or beyond them even with his weight going backwards"
"tossed up outside off, stretches out to drive to long-off"
"back of a length on off stump, keeps a little low and Sarfaraz blocks it back to the bowler"

"length ball on middle and off, clipped to deep midwicket"
"slower ball, shortish, angling away into a sixth-stump line. Left alone, and the umpire signals wide - tight call, I thought"
"slower short ball, offcutter, loses a lot of pace as it angles away from off stump and it's on its way down when Gayle flicks it through midwicket"
"shot. Third man is fine, and Kulkarni bangs in a short ball that rises to shoulder height close to off stump. Sarfaraz makes room and uppercuts it, a long way to the right of that fielder"
"shortish, angling into the batsman's hip. Tucked away to long leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, stabbed with an open face to backward point"
"slower length ball angling into off stump, takes a big step back and across and late-cuts to third man"
"shortish slower ball, angling into middle stump. Keeps a touch low too, and Gayle does extremely well to generate power on this leg-side whip. Samson, sprinting to his left from deep square leg and throwing himself at the ball, can't quite stop it from running past him into the boundary"
"quicker length ball on the stumps, jabbed down the ground, past the stumps and to the right of long-on"
looks to create room and Stokes makes him reach for the ball with a quick short one that skids past his attempted  slash
"and Gayle whacks it back, over the wicket at the other end. Short slower one outside off, and he clears his front leg and absolutely hammers it back, forcing the umpire to duck hurriedly"
"short, wide, and that's excellent placement, reaches out and cuts it away to the left of the diving fielder at short third man. Wrong length and line to bowl with that fielder in the circle"
"shortish, just outside off. Takes one step back and across and times the pants off a short-arm jab to bisect deep midwicket and long-on"
"wow. This is close to the blockhole outside off stump, misses it by a few inches maybe, and Gayle, who's taken a big step back and across to shorten the length, lofts it high and straight, back over the bowler's head and into the sightscreen to bring up fifty. Just stands there and watches it soar, what a shot"

"length ball on middle and off, jabbed back to the bowler from the crease"

"overpitched, lots of width, and that's a lovely wristy drive, drilled to the right of extra-cover and beats long-off easily with all that power"
"a bit slower and wider outside off, and that's another superb shot. Stretches out and gets down low to sweep it, bat coming down from a high, wide backlift - just as you're coached while learning the sweep - and spanks it along the ground to the square leg boundary"
"a bit closer to the stumps, swept down to long leg"
"fired in flat, angling slightly down leg. Looks to sweep and misses, is hit on the pad to provoke a half-appeal from Gowtham"
"flat again, on leg stump, and he nurdles it to the left of midwicket to pick up one"
"fuller on the stumps, Gayle takes his front leg out and hits it towards midwicket"

"length around off, dabs it towards short midwicket and sets off for a quick single"
"slower length ball around off, Gayle clears his front leg and smashes it over the bowler's head for a maximum"

"short of length around off, pace offered this time and Sarfaraz gets his timing right on the pull, four to midwicket"
"fuller around off, Gayle's method is simple, clears his front leg and smashes it over long-off, his fourth six of the innings"
"fuller this time, following the batsman and managing to sneak this through his legs but Buttler misses as well, bounces to his right and races away for four"
"almost a repeat of the first ball, but Gayle doesn't middle it this time, a thick outside edge though flies towards third man fence for another boundary"
"slower one gone wrong, full but way too wide outside off"
"length ball around off, doesn't matter for Gayle, he knows where to dispatch it, over the bowler's head for another boundary"
"Gayle is furious with himself. Tripathi keeps his calm at deep midwicket boundary. Was a short one outside off, Gayle went for the pull but doesn't get the distance on this, Tripathi times his jump perfectly, both feet in the air when he pouched it. A big, big wicket"
"length ball on the pads, looks to tuck it away behind square, misses but will get a leg-bye"
"fuller on the stumps, drives it towards long-on and is off the mark"
"length outside off, shuffles before getting down on one knee to sweep it towards deep midwicket"
"flatter, length outside off, goes back and punches it towards extra cover, a tumbling stop"
"length ball on the pads, chipped away towards wide long-on for a couple, Sarfaraz is down on the ground after the ball hit him near his stomach. A direct-hit and he would have been out there"

"short of length around off, a short-arm pull towards the right of deep midwicket"
"a full toss following the batsman who was shuffling in his crease, hits it towards extra cover in the end"
"a bouncer this time, following Pooran who sways away from it. Excellent bowling this from Archer, mixing it up well"
"a slower one this time, length ball, following the batsman. Pooran goes for the pull but ends up playing it too early, misses"
"length around off this time, pulls it towards deep square leg for one"
"fuller and wider outside off, Pooran was looking to back away and in the end can only watch it go through"
"one-bounce four, fuller but much closer to the batsman this time who lofts it over extra cover, Archer from sweeper cover sprints to his left but cannot get there in time"
"a slower bouncer, Pooran is deep in his crease and looks to pull it away, misses but the umpire reckons it's too high"
"slower one again, this time a length ball on the stumps, pulls it towards behind square for one"
"fuller and wider outside off, looks to go over cover but ends up slicing it behind point but gets a boundary nonetheless"

"fuller on the stumps, digs it out towards long-on for one"

"another slower one but down the leg side, goes for the sweep but ends up skying it towards fine leg, the fielder sprints in, puts in the dive but it falls short, fails to get his body behind and concedes three, Stokes is not impressed"

"length ball on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"

"fullish outside off, gets on the front foot for a push to cover point"
"length ball, angling away from off stump and allowing the batsman to free his arms, and Rahane flows forward for a lofted chip over extra-cover. Excellent timing"
"four more, perhaps the best shot of the lot. Not as full this time, angling across to off stump, and Rahane transfers his weight forward into a straight-bat push that accelerates quickly over the turf and beats mid-off diving to his right"
"full and flat, angling onto the pads, and Buttler tickles it away fine, quickly past the right hand of the diving short fine leg fielder, Gayle"
"flat again, on the stumps, hangs back to punch to long-on"
"goes back to a length ball angling into off stump, defends into the covers"
"no real turn, looks like the attempted legbreak angling into middle and leg. Goes back again to clip into the square leg region"

"again that skiddy pace, angling into off stump and straightening slightly. Stays back to punch to mid-off"
"length ball angling into off stump, Rahane presses forward for a straight-bat push to mid-on"
"shot. Full, just outside off, and Buttler plays a straight-bat punch that hangs in the air briefly but finds the gap to the left of mid-off"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"shot. That's lightning footwork, because he was shaping to move across his stumps, but he waited and waited and only made his move an instant before Shami released. He sends down a back-of-a-length ball angling into the stumps, and Buttler scoops it away fine, well to the right of short fine leg"
"length ball on off stump, punched firmly back to the bowler"
"back of a length, gets it to straighten off the pitch into a fourth-stump line. Was looking to play that towards mid-on or midwicket initially, and ends up sending a thick leading edge towards backward point"
"back of a length on middle stump, punched to long-on"
"not short enough to pull from outside off, and it skids through a little low. Drags it without power to midwicket, off the inside half of the bat"
"back of a length on off stump, makes room and punches to extra-cover"
"googly, pitching just outside off and perhaps a little slower than what he's been bowling so far. Clears his front leg and clubs it with a lot of bottom hand, past the bowler and to the right of mid-off"
"back of a length, top of off stump, makes room and slaps to cover point"

"on the shorter side of a good length in the fifth-stump channel, and Buttler, standing still and looking to thrash an angled-bat drive into the covers, is beaten by the pace and extra bounce"
"a bit fuller, on off stump, and it might have been a slightly off-pace delivery. Yup, slower one. Buttler goes for the lofted drive, and slices it high off the outside half of his bat, manages to land it beyond the reach of extra-cover turning and running back"
"back of a length, angling into middle stump, whipped towards midwicket"
"slower one, angling into middle and leg. Closes his face early on the flick and sends a leading edge towards long-on"
"short, wide, freebie. Buttler slashes it away, up and over backward point"
sees Buttler looking to make room and follows him with a full ball. Driven to extra-cover
"short, hip-high ball angling into off stump. May have cramped another batsman for room, but Buttler swings his left leg out of the way and in the process generates plenty of power through his hips, which he complements with the power of his bottom hand to swat it down the ground, to the left of mid-on"
"looks for the wide yorker, and ends up bowling a wide, low full-toss. Buttler does well to reach out and slice it away between backward point and short third man"

"follows up the slower ball with a cross-seam full-pace ball that skids off the pitch from a shortish length outside off, and beats Buttler's attempted back-foot jab"
"into the blockhole now, jams his bat down and digs it out, back towards the bowler"
"after three excellent deliveries in sequence, he bowls a half-volley just outside off, and Buttler drives it crisply over mid-off to bring up yet another half-century. He's been churning them out ever since he began opening. These are his last seven IPL innings: 67, 51, 82, 95*, 94*, 39 and now 51*"
"bowled him! Carrom ball, straightens towards off stump and skids off the pitch. Rahane was looking to stay leg-side of the ball and steer this down to third man. Ended up playing inside the line and the ball crashes into off stump"
