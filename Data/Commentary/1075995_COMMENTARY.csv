"stays back and flicks a quicker one, skidding in on leg stump, through midwicket"
"pins him in front, Billings is basically beaten for pace by Imad's arm ball. What a way to start for Karachi! Pitches it on a good length and benefits from the ball skidding on, cramping the batsman for room, and considering he starts playing down the wrong line, he is done in."
"another quick delivery coming into the right-hander, at off stump, Haddin just about keeps it out"
rushes down the track and hacks the full delivery through midwicket
"goes wider of the crease and seeing that Haddin makes some room. The good length ball ends up outside leg stump, and yet it is played with a straight bat into the off side"
"there's a little bit of cat and mouse going on already. Haddin's moving outside leg may have tempted Imad to bowl this wide of off stump, but the batsman simply stands, winds up and goes bang over midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, Smith works it off his hips through midwicket"
"that's the slower ball, but it's direction is a little off, wanders down leg. Haddin moves across to try and pull it behind square leg, but is through with the shot too early"
"full and outside off, Haddin goes after it, looking for a boundary down the ground. Comes up with a whole lot of nothing"
"waits on the back foot now, knowing after that big hoick and miss the bowler will adjust his length. Runs it off the open face to third man"
looks to slog across the line of a ball angled across him and gets an inside edge towards midwicket.
"seems to come back in after pitching on middle and leg and Smith plays all across it, beaten for pace and the movement. Flick and miss"
"finishes the over excellently. Smith wafts at a fuller delivery outside off, looking to smash it across the line again, and is beaten on the inside edge"
"strikes it sweetly into the covers, but Azam puts in a diving save. Funny how balls on leg stump, flat and quick still end up there"
"full and into middle and leg, Haddin swings it to mid-on"
leaps back away from the line of a flat delivery outside off and cuts to cover
allows the dart to come to him on leg stump and flicks it past midwicket
"goes for the slog sweep, seeing a little more flight on this 98 kph delivery on middle and leg. Ends up missing it altogether"
"mistimes it, and he's gone! Imad makes it known to everyone at the ground, having tossed up a delivery onto middle and leg and despite Haddin coming down the track, he can gain little advantage. Chips a simple catch back to the bowler. Well, they end up simple after you feel the ball on your thigh and clutch at it to make sure it doens't drop to the ground. What a spell this is turning out to be"
"excellent fielding at short fine leg. Bhatti, the new man in. This could well have been a boundary. Usman starts his spell with a short delivery down leg and Smith just tickles it around the corner. But Bhatti throws himself to his right and keeps it to a single"
"now his line shifts way outside off, and Misbah simply shoulders arms"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives towards mid-off"
"tries to short-arm pull a back of a length delivery from leg stump, but it skids into him too quickly to make any connection"
"still too cramped to get the big shot away. Khan bowls short and outside leg, his left-armer's angle through makes it go across the right-hander and Smith is hitting against that angle. The ball skidding doesn't help his cause either"
nudges off his thigh pad behind square leg to regain the strike for the next over
"tries to put off the left-arm spinner with an early movement away towards the leg side, but then he's back in line with the stumps to defend a good length ball into the covers"
"is long-on in play, it's Pollard moving back, right to the edge of the boundary, but it lobs over him. Smith gets a good chunk on this length ball outside off and belts it down the ground"
"flatter, quicker, on off stump, defends"
rocks back to pull and this rapid delivery on middle and leg is hit to midwicket
"misses the sweep - that ball was there for the shot, length, and gave him enough room to swing the arms- but it goes right over off stump into the wicketkeeper's gloves."
"more slog sweeps, this time it's a worse shot because the length is too full and it's cramping him for a free swing of the arms. Inside edge on the pad"
"that's onto the roof! Small ground, yes, but it doesn't need to be for Smith to hit sixes. Picks an overpitched delivery on off stump, comes forward and smashes it over long-on"
"shortish and outside off, cut to deep point"
takes a length ball and drives to cover
"defends a good length ball with an open face, but point is quick enough to stop any thought of a single"
"does well there the bowler, pulling his length back seeing Misbah charging at him. The batsman then dabs it into the covers and takes  a single"
"this is a mis-hit and deep cover <b>drops him</b>. Usman Khan the culprit. There is a little more turn off this delivery, Smith swings against it and gets a leading edge. The fielder rushes in too quickly, and therefore has to leap back at the last minute, his hands over his head to try and tack the catch. Poor effort"
"lots of spin, so much that Misbah nearly loses his balance while trying to cut"
"belts it to long-off, it's not often that he plays with the turn into the off side, but it's not like he loses any power"
"oooh, turning square. This is a good length ball that makes Misbah reach out to try and block and his outside edge is beaten by a massive margin."
"attempts to come down the track, but the bowler fires it in short and wide, Misbah slices it to point"
"tries a lap sweep, but the slower delivery trumps him. He doesn't have the pace to work with and in trying ot make the pace himself, he overhits and misses"
"shortish and outside off, slices it to short third man. Top first over from Usama Mir. Only two runs."
"basically yorks him, outside leg and Smith manages to dig it out."
"full toss on middle and leg, swipes hard and pulls it long and clean over midwicket"
"wide outside off, tries to cut and gets beaten"
"touch wider again and spinning away, cut to sweeper cover"
comes down the track and there is a lot of room outside off which gives him the chance to free his arms and crash it straight down the ground for a big straight six
comes down the track and goes over mid-off as he tries to clear the in-field
"gets down to reverse sweep very early, telegraphs his intent and the bowler lands it on a fullish length and the ball spins sharply to strike him on the pad but the impact was probably outside off"
shuffles across and works it to short third man
"length ball on off stump, tries to pull but there is not enough room and he gets cramped as he skews it off the top edge towards short fine leg. Wicketkeeper runs back and snaffles it"
"fuller ball on middle and leg, bends forward and blocks into the off side"
"short of a length on middle and leg and spinning away sharply, pulled away off the backfoot between deep midwicket and long-on and the call is for two straight away and they take it comfortably"
"short of a length ball on off, spinning away, cut out to deep point"
plays it beautifully. He loves pace on the ball and Amir provides a lot of it with width as well. Watson knows third man is up and so he simply places it past his right and to the boundary
"now for his power, taking a length ball outside off and smacking it down to long-off"
"slogs looking for the leg side, but somehow ends up sending a back of a length ball, well outside leg, to third man of all places"
"looks for the yorker, bowls cross-seam as well, Watson tries a flick and mistimes the ball to deep square leg"
"big sound as the ball passes bat, but umpire Illingworth knows that's bat hitting ground. Misbah tries to flay a full and wide delivery past point but fails to do so"
"full, fast and straight, Misbah plants his back leg outside off and tries to swing it away. Beaten. Watson tries to pinch a leg bye, but Misbah knows it is the last ball of the over and he doesn't want the strike in the form he is in. Sends his partner back"
"a lot slower through the air is Mir, and Watson, going for a lap sweep, gets a little deflection into the off side."
"spreads his arms and takes in the glory. Misbah is a magnificent player of spin and Mir has done him in by bowling it slowly and by concentrating on making the ball turn. Tossed up delivery, draws the batsman out of his crease, he goes for a big hoick, mistimes the shot and ends up chipping a catch to long-on running in"
looks for a sweep as Mir tosses the ball up and drifts it into middle and leg. Fails to make a connection
"now this one, pushed through outside off, turns massively to beat the cut shot"
"smacks across the line through the straight midwicket boundary. This is pure power. And Islamabad need a lot more of this, even if it doesn't look especially pretty"
pushes a shortish delivery outside off through point
length ball at 144 kph wanders down the leg side. Watson goes for a heave into the leg side but can't connect
"this is the slower ball, moving across the right-hander, Watson sets up for the slog and misses again"
pulls it over the long leg boundary. For a second it seems like he is beaten for pace as Amir goes for a bouncer on middle and leg and makes it climb up towards the batsman's throat. But Watson swivels on the back foot and powers it away
"142 kph, spills a wide down the leg side as Watson aims another slog"
it's length and it disappears. Watson plants his front leg down the line and simply flicks the ball on his pads away over the long leg boundary.
looks for the wide yorker and Watson muscles it down to long-on
"full toss on middle, Imran swings blind and misses with bat, but does get a painful blow to the body. Can't bother about that right now, he has to get across to the other end and put Watson on strike"
"full, wide, but it's not quite within the tramlines. And Watson, leaving the ball, collects a run for his team"
"looks for the yorker outside off, Watson inside-edges a biff to long-on"
"goes for the blockhole, finds it and Watson can only drill it down the ground for a single. Oh wait, they're coming back for the second. This is going to be tight. The throw is a bit wide. Sanga has a lot of work to do, collects it cleanly and then dives headlong onto the stumps and Watson's gone"
"oooh, Sanga's in the spotlight again, but this time he can't quite pull it off. Has to leap up to try and take the outside edge but it's too thick. Lobs off his glove and to the boundary. Asif slogs at a length ball and is lucky"
"in looking for bonus runs, Islamabad are losing a few wickets. Asif belts a length ball to the midwicket boundary, but he can't clear it. Malik is down there, right on the edge, doing well to keep the ball in play and then choosing the right end - the bowler's - to effect the run out"
"edged and taken. This is full, and just outside off, Asif looks to smoke it over midwicket but only ends up feathering it through to Sangakkara. Everything going wrong for Islamabad"
ping into the blockhole and Shadab can only squeeze it towards point
"full and straight, Sami launches it down to long-off, they look for a second run, off the last ball of the over, that's fine, and Pollard's rocket throw catches him short at the keeper's end"
pierces the gap to the left of point as he reaches out for a full delivery outside off
"looks for the yorker on middle and leg, digs it out"
"caught at the third man boundary and the danger man's gone. Looks to heave a length ball on off stump over the leg side but ends up with a thick outside edge that goes so very high in the air. Mohammad Sami gets under it, making sure to keep his eyes on the ball, and moving with it as it swirls in the air and finally takes it with both hands. Excellent technique"
"oooh, that's close. A direct hit from point nearly catches Babar short. He gets up off his feet to ride the bounce of this short delivery outside off, but then looks for a single when there isn't one. The fielder at point causes some excitement with his dead-eye throw but it amounts to nothing"
"short ball, Babar is into the pull a touch too early and gets struck on the back"
"back of a length and outside off, Babar swings across the line towards square leg and makes no connection. Might have done better if he'd upper cut that"
"shortish and outside off, Sanga taps it into the covers and gets across to the other end"
"short-arm jab to deep midwicket, and it simply flies away. There really isn't much room to free the arms, or even width to do so but he has timed it superbly. Oh and what's more, it's a no-ball. Wait the umpire's jumped the gun. The foot landed behind the line and then slid"
"length ball on off stump ,Sanga goes for a wild swing and gets a thick outside edge towards third man. Point runs back to take the catch but a batsman can't get out like that off a free hit"
pummels it over mid-off. That's about as authoritative as it gets. He takes a length ball and hits through the line. Magnificent timing
"hammered over square leg. It's all in the wrist. He shuffles across onto off stump, waits on the back of a length to arrive and then whips it away. This is an unbelievable shot"
"there's the hat-trick of boundaries. The easiest of the three, considering the ball is short and wide. Babar gets back and across, and smacks it through point"
"back of a length on off stump, with some pace off the ball, Babar defends and is displeased"
"he's yorked him. Sanga has no answer to this top-notch delivery. Seriously, a ball coming down from around 10 feet in the air, looking to singe your toes? Unplayable. Goes under the bat, beat him for pace and makes him look like an amateur"
"climbs on Malik, this short ball, aimed at leg stump. The batsman only just fends it away"
"makes him hop with a shortish delivery on leg stump at... 128 kph? Anyway, Malik nudges it to long leg"
leading edge as he squares the in-form Babar up with a back of a length delivery seaming across the right-hander.
"back of a length on off stump, taps it down just to the right of the pitch and pinches a single"
"full and outside leg, he flicks it through midwicket"
"gets a little turn off a flat and quick delivery outside off, Babar goes for the cut but mistimes it to cover"
"makes the ball straighten after darting into leg stump, Babar nudges it through midwicket"
"comes off slowly off the pitch and Malik, hanging back, is able to drag it from outside off stump through to midwicket with his wrists"
"backs away to the leg side, the bowler follows him, but his length is poor. In the slot for Babar to wind up and swing his arms through the line and pick up a boundary at cow corner"
flicks through midwicket for a single
shifts back to handle a short delivery on leg and works it to deep midwicket
"tosses it up outside off, drives along the ground through the covers"
"lays into a cover drive and then stands and admires. A shade overpitched and it is dealt with, and how. Pure power, generated from the wrists again"
"jumps back, reading the length to be short, and punches through cover"
"this is the googly and Malik reads if off the pitch. He was back and across, looking to push it into the off side, but adjusts with a flick past mid-on"
"straight down the ground. Sees the ball tossed up, loves that it gives him the room to free the arms and then simply flat-bats it over long-on"
"quick, short, and just outside off, Babar hangs back and pulls to the right of long-on"
"goes inside out over point. This is full, fires it towards leg stump, Malik manages to get it up and over the infield"
"good length ball on middle and leg, he nudges it past long leg"
"caught at short third man. Malik stays leg side of a full delivery outside off and is done in by a little bit of turn. So instead of the ball taking the middle, it skews off the outside edge"
"big turn as Bopara stays back to a full, quick delivery outside of and tries a late cut."
"shortish and outside off, cuts it to the sweeper"
gets inside the line of a fuller delivery on leg stump and drives to cover
"he looks for another yorker, but it comes off a low full toss, which Bopara flicks to the long leg boundary. No bat though, all pad"
"back of a length offcutter, which pitches and veers away sharply past the right-hander's reach"
"what a throw! This is sensational from the fielder at point. Shadab Khan runs in quickly, cutting the angle and what looked like a simple dab for a single results in a wicket. Bopara hesitated, then had to run around Irfan the bowler and all that made him short of his crease"
"they chance Shadab's arm again! And it's Karachi's best batsman, he puts in the desperate dive and would have saved himself had it hit. So much happening off a dinky little tap to point"
hangs back to the short ball on off stump and guides it to point
"goes full on off stump, flicks it through midwicket"
"short and wide, Imad cuts powerfully to the man at deep point"
on the pads and Babar flicks to square leg
"comes down the track, but gets a toe-end to the flick and finds midwicket"
"drifts it down the leg side, Babar refuses to play and his team collects a wide"
back over the wicket and Babar pulls a short delivery from outside off to long-on
thumps a flat delivery through the covers
inside edges a cut back to the bowler. Ajmal gets away with an over full of short balls
"length ball, moving across the left-hander, Imad tries to hit it too hard through the covers and is beaten"
"comes down the track, gets it high on the bat and it is almost a catch at deep square leg. Billings is the man haring in, moving towards his right as well and then puts in a dive as well. But he had no chance. Credit to his athleticism that he even made it look like a chance"
"short and wide outside off, Imad cracks it to deep point"
"full on middle, Babar finds the gap to the left of long leg with a flick of his wrists again. Brilliant cricket."
leg cutter deceives Babar as he shuffles across and pokes tamely outside the off stump
"uses soft hands and pats the ball just to the left of the stumps for a quick single. Point does well running in and underarming a throw at the stumps to try and catch Imad short at the keeper's end, but there's no one backing up. Overthrows"
"short and wide, Imad flat bats it to long-off"
"a little turn off a good length, Babar swings into the leg side, gets an inside edge to long leg. Shadab Khan keeps it to three. Such speed off the turf"
"slower through the air, but the length is still short and the line is still wide. Imad slaps it to deep point"
"shimmes into the leg side, Ajmal follows him, Babar flicks it to long leg"
