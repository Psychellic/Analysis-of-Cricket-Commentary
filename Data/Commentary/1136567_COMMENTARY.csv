"very full and angling in, defended"
"good length and holds its line on off stump, Rohit negotiates it carefully"
"<strong>Deepak Hooda drops it!</strong> Sandeep hits a hard length on middle, cramps up Rohit for room. He goes for a pull, instead skies it in the air.  Three men converge on the ball, neither call, and Hooda runs back from midwicket, stretches his hands only to shell it"
"good length and attacking the stumps, blocked"

"full and outside off, patted into the covers"
"even fuller and outside off, Rohit frees his arms and laces a drive through the covers. The ball fizzes away to the boundary"
"Shakib dives forward from square leg and pouches a low catch to dismiss Rohit Sharma. Another failure for him as Mumbai Indians' opener. This was short, skiddy, and attacking the body, Rohit is cramped up. This isn't a full-blooded flick. He chips it in the air and watches Shakib take a sprawling catch"
"First runs in the IPL for Lewis. He launches it into the second tier beyond fine leg. This was a poor ball. Short and sliding outside leg, he picks it off his hips and swivel-pulls it away"

"flat dart, Kishan ventures a reverse-sweep and does not make contact. Off the thigh pad and rolls away between the keeper and slip. <strong>The tracker confirms it pitched outside leg</strong>"
<strong>Sandeep at mid-off drops a relatively simple chance.</strong> Pops in and pops out. Rashid unfurls a wrong'un that slides away outside off. Kishan dares to step out and slog. He only top-edges it hiiiiigh into the night sky. It drops down and Sandeep drops it
another fast wrong'un from Rashid. Lewis picks it off the pitch and jabs to cover
"back of a length on the hips, worked away to midwicket"
"Sunrisers have their man finally. Back of a length and angling away outside off, Kishan looks to slog it away against the angle and across the line. Another low-percentage shot. This time he skies it to deep third man, where Yusuf Pathan slides on his knees and completes a sharp, low catch despite being blinded by the floodlights"

overpitched and outside off - right in Lewis' swinging arc - he drills it away between the bowler and mid-off. Rasping drive
"good length on middle, Lewis manufactures room and slices it in the air over mid-off. Williamson runs back from mid-off, dives, then swivels around swiftly to stop the ball from the reaching the boundary. Excellent work from Williamson"
"Kaul strikes twice in his first over. He hits the top of off stump and leaps for job. He <strong>brings out the knuckle ball</strong>, Lewis has no clue about this variation. He is early into his leg-side swing. Kaul cleans him up"

SRH challenge the on-field not-out decision. <b>Another knuckle ball</b>, hits the back pad in front of middle as the batsman plays across the line early and misses the ball altogether. It would have crashed into middle stump. Umpire Nandan eventually reverses his decision"

"good length and cutting away outside off, past the outside edge? Kishan goes up for an appeal. Mustafiz isn't  convinced. Not given by the umpire. It prompts <strong>another review from Mumbai</strong>. Breaks away sharply outside off and bounces in the channel, Williamson attempts a late cut but the ball gets big on him. He feathers it behind. UltraEdge detects a <i>tiny</i> spike. No woody sound, just a little spike, and it's enough to overturn the not-out decision. Former Sunriser Mustafiz strikes"
