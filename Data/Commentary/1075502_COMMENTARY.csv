bowled him! Morkel strikes first over the chase and it's the big wicket of Tamim Iqbal. This is tremendous stuff from Morkel. Comes from really wide of the crease and angles it into Tamim. Tamim keeps his bat well inside expecting it to go with the arm outside off but the ball cuts in to shatter off-stump
"<b>huge appeal for a leg before</b>. Not out says the umpire. Du Plessis briefly calls for a conference and they decide against the review. Back of a length, sliding into the left-hander and hits the front pad as it drifts in to beat the attempted flick. Would have comfortably missed leg"
"another shout for leg before, this time it looks closer and is given. The angle is into him again but Mominul does not bother reviewing. I think that's the right call because it would have been umpire's call if not for hitting leg stump on the full. Movement in the air, comes in sharply and Mominul is not entirely sure of this one and plays all across that one. Bangladesh two down without a run. Does this seem too familiar?"

Soft, soft innings from Bangladesh"
