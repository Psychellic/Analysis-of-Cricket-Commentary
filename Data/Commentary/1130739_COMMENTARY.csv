good take by Dickwella. Anamul has had his share of chances but he still backs himself to hook this short ball despite the complete lack of room.

good length and jumps past the outside edge as <strong>Tharanga chases after this</strong>
"slow, short cutter outside off, Tharanga flashes at it and under-edges it, the nick does not carry through to Mushfiq. Mashrafe begins with a maiden"
"Mashrafe gives Nasir another over, and he rewards his captain with the wicket of Kusal. This is a poor shot to be honest. Straight ball on middle from around the wicket, the batsman jumps down the track, gets too close to the pitch, and has a big whoosh at it. Kusal only collects thin air while Nasir rattles the middle stump and celebrates"
"turning offbreak on off, pushed with the break to long-on off the front foot"
"on a length and outside off, presses forward and drives straight to mid-off"

"short, wide, slashed to deep point. And Mashrafe has overstepped"

"full on middle, Tharanga has a short stride as he pushes to cover"
clipped off the pads to midwicket
turned off the hips to square leg
"<strong>Mendis is struck flush on the helmet</strong>. The back flap on the helmet gets detached. What a nasty blow! Good to see Mendis shake it off and laugh it off. Tharanga and Mendis punch gloves. Short, zips off the pitch, and rushes the batsman for pace"

"Mashrafe, into his seventh over, puts Mendis out of his misery. He couldn't find the gap, he couldn't hit over the top, he was peppered by a volley of bouncers and even copped a jarring blow on the helmet. His hamstring probably wan't in great shape either. Mendis now dares to step down the track and launch it over the bowler's head. Mashrafe smartly pulls his length back and a drop in pace also foxes Mendis and he eventually simply chips it in the air to mid-off. Nineteen runs off 34 balls at a strike-rate of 56 in a 321 chase? Not good enough I'm afraid"

"<b>huge appeal for caught behind from the bowler</b>. But no support from anyone else. Slower short of a length delivery, cuts in off the deck to his the high part of the back pad. Saifuddin is convinced there's an inside edge. Rahim doesn't think so. Could they have opted for the review? No inside edge but lbw could have been close"
"oh, that doesn't matter. Because Chandimal has been run out. Punches it away to long-off and sees a regulation single.Just doesn't account for the sharp, powerful throw from the deep. Shakib charges in and swoops down to fire a direct throw with a stump to aim"
""
"<b>just over Rahim</b>. Short of a length, a slower offcutter and Gunaratne tries to swat it away with, what do you call that, a half pull? It's a nothing shot really and gets a top-edge that gets over Rahim behind the stumps"
