<b>boom</b> straightaway a maximum. Invitingly tossed up googly outside off and Rohit takes a stride forward and languidly leans into a lofted off drive that carries over long-off
"length, closer to off stump, defended on the front foot"
"wrong un that strays on the pads and is too short, and Rohit simply picks it off his pads to get a boundary to backward square leg. Only had to beat the man inside the circle"
"tossed up on off, comes on the front foot and pushes to cover"
"drifts on the pads again, Rohit comes forward and nudges it through midwicket"
"length on the pads, tucked to square leg and they rush through for a quick single. <b>Rohit dives to make his ground</b> and he's in before Buttler's collected the throw and broken the stumps. So Rahul off the mark after two successive ducks."
"straightaway getting the ball to bounce more. back of a length outside off, Rahul shapes to defend, the ball hits the bat high."
"back of a length again, pushed to point staying beside the ball. Only 132 kph that time"
"nicely cut away to point's left which allows Rahul to get another run. Too short outside off, well hit but not placed wide enough of the man at point"
"there's the 90 mph ball, but it's on a length and moving in, ends up on the pads. Rohit misses the flick, but gets a leg-bye with the ball rolling into the legside"
"bouncer now, sharp one outside off. Rahul was shaping to play but quickly decided against it, swaying out of the way and dropping his hands"
"<b>peachy</b>. Back of a length outside off and Rahul stands tall to punch through cover. His first boundary of the series, and what a fine one. Vintage Rahul."
"full on off, 144 kph to start with, driven to mid-on with a straight bat"
nipping in sharply and caught him on the crease. Inside edge saves him. 149 kph. whew. Length ball that jagged in and Rohit inside edged onto pad. Would have been dead in front otherwise.
"back of a length coming in again, he tries to whip it off his pads, but doesn't connect. The ball rolls into the offside off the thigh pad and Rahul is alive to the quick single, calls Rohit through for one"
"length on off, squirted to the bowler's left. 147 kph"
"fuller on off, punched back to the bowler's left, who fields on his follow through. Another 149 kph."
"back of a length outside off, punched nicely but straight to point. Ends with a 145 kph one, which means the slowest ball of this over was the first one at 144kph."
"back of a length oustide off, on a sixth stump line. That's a slower ball, 119 kph and doesn't bounce much. Rohit wants to cut but doesn't make contact"
"back of a length at normal pace - normal for Archer ie at 143 kph - and Rohit rocks back to pull to deep square leg's left. Not quite off the middle, came off the bottom half of the bat"
"crisp looking shot, but straight to cover. Fuller outside off and he drove firmly enough to draw a fumble from Stokes and get a single"
"<b>and he takes the caught and bowled this time</b>. Slower ball does it, 125 kph. Rohit too early into the punch back down the wicket, just pops it in the air straight back to the bowler. In the last game, Archer had dropped a similar chance. He's not going to drop two dollies in back to back games. Beaming smile as he grabs it."
"<b>Suryakumar Yadav has begun his international career with a six!</b> Whoa. Short ball on leg stump, moves inside the line, one leg off the ground as he pulls over fine leg. That's like a childhood dream, batting in front of the mirror."
"length outside off, punched to backward point and a loud, early call of 'NO' for the single."
"length ball straying on the pads, flicked to fine leg"
"squirted in the air for a bit, but drops well short of point. Fuller outside off, goes for the drive, gets a thickish edge"
"<b>imperious</b>. That's a 148.5 kph ball back of length outside off, he just stands tall and punches through cover as if he's been doing this for 20 years."
moves inside the line as Wood goes down legside. That'll be a wide.
"tried the ramp but missed. Short ball outside off, wanted to send it over the lone slip, but doesn't connect"
"length on off, tapped to cover. 'Only' 143 kph. Slowest ball of the over so far."
"short ball, doesn't bounce as much and cramped him a bit as he was looking to move inside the line. He manages to crunch a pull shot from around waist height to deep square leg"
"back of a length outside off, wanted to punch it away, gets an inside edge onto pad that drops down near him. They take the quick single"
"length ball going down legside. He'll have to rebowl that. A bit unfortunate for CJ. That went off the thigh pad, so shouldn't have been a wide."
"too full and legstump, flicked off his pads to the backward square leg boundary. Rahul moving nicely now, and getting his timing back too."
"length outside off, he keeps bat close to body and punches with authority through cover"
"<b>skilfully done</b>. Full ball outside off, and he just allowed it to glide off his bat by opening the face, bisects the field perfectly, between point and short third man."
"length outside off, stands tall to punch, but gets it off the end of the bat and it bounces back to the bowler"
"launches into a full-blooded cover drive to a full ball outside off, but Stokes at cover moves quickly to cut it off"
"length ball outside off, gets nicely on top of it to cut it through point. There's a fielder back there"
"floated up on middle and spinning away, tapped to long-on"
"tossed up on the stumps, Rahul goes right back and wrists it through midwicket"
"<b>full toss taken full toll off</b>. Top-edged the sweep but he placed it well. Went down early to sweep, seeing there was no fine leg, and got it on the full. The top edge didn't matter because he had placed it well"
"<b>Shot!</b>. Down the track to a googly, gets to the pitch of it and hits inside out over extra cover. Drool worthy execution. Ice-cool confidence in pulling it off too."
"flatter on off, punched to long-off"
"length ball down legside, and he'll have to rebowl that."
"gentle tap to the bowler's right, coming on the front foot. Hit very straight but with great timing. Long-on is not very straight, has to run to his left to clean up"
"risky single but Sam Curran doesn't collect cleanly at midwicket. Tapped it with soft hands and took off, Curran came charging in, and tried to pick up the ball and flick to the stumps, didn't pick it up cleanly"
"slower ball on the stumps, a bit early into the push that plops back to the bowler"
"<b>caught at mid-off</b>. Gave himself room to try and extend his arms but Stokes followed him and denied him room. Rahul still went through with the shot, looking to loft over mid-off. Didn't pick the slower ball, and the bat turns in his hands as the ball loops tamely to the fielder."
"fuller outside off, whipped to long-on"
"<b>elegance</b>. Driven on the up, standing tall, through cover. Beats the in-field, beats the man who's sprinting to his right from the point boundary. He's just come out and timed the ball to perfection from the get-go."
"inside edges an attempted steer onto pad, as the ball rolls into the offside"
"googly, he comes forward and misses the flick that he was looking to hit fine but the ball takes pad and rolls away before being pulled in just before the boundary"
"hung in the air a mite, with Kohli coming on the front foot to drive, but not quite getting to the pitch, hitting to cover"
"<b>googly gets him</b>. Kohli was looking to be aggressive against Rashid, danced down the track, doesn't get to the pitch and possibly didn't read the googly either, going for a big swing down the ground and the ball zips through between the gap. Easy stumping for Buttler."
"fuller on off, defended to cover on the front foot"
"quicker on the stumps, stabbed to cover from the crease"
"back of a length outside off, moves across and uses wrists to whip it through square leg"
"fuller outside off, launches into a cover drive, but straight to the cover fielder"
"fuller on the stumps, gently pushed to mid-off and they take the quick single"
"slower ball, fuller outside off, tried to move across and work it through midwicket but a bit too early into the shot"
"angling into him on the stumps, another slower ball, he's once again a bit early into the shot, punches to long-on"
"length on the pads, tucked to deep square leg. Bairstow doesn't pick up cleanly and concedes an extra run"
"slow yorker, off-stump line, whipped to mid-on with lots of wristwork"
"round the wicket, back of a length, poked to the off-side for the quick single"
"rolls the fingers on a back-of-a-length cutter, wide line but flogged straight at mid-off"
"another slower ball, back of the hand this time, and SKY whips it up and over the bowler's head, plugging short of long-on"
"quicker delivery, fuller length, wide line from round the wicket, Pant can't connect on a drive"
"cracked from the top of the bounce, out to Malan on the cover boundary Jordan gets out of that over well, another tight effort to crank up the pressure on India"
"back of a length, looked like a googly, but skidded on a touch, clipped to deep square leg off the back foot"
"<strong>that sounded sweet, and it was!</strong> Down early into position, picking the legbreak, and clouting a sweep through square leg"
"back to the googly, and driven on the up to long-on, he scuffed the shot a touch but Pant recognises there's two there because the fielder is a long way back"
"wide line, flat and clumped to deep cover"
"back on the stumps, and flipped to the leg side"
"<B>cut firmly through backward point!</B> A fifty <strike>on debut</strike> in his debut innings for Yadav! Too wide from Rashid, and crashed hard to the rope. Mumbai Indians are injecting this line-up with all sorts of intent!"
"back of a length, too wide from Stokes, and <B>Pant smears the pull through long-on!</B> Lots of lovely bottom hand, power to the max!"
"slower ball, Stokes rolls the fingers on a cutter, a cramped clip to mid-on ensues"
"low full toss, but gets away with it, flicked out through midwicket, as Stokes serves up another slower ball, but the sweeper tidies up"
"<B>pounded through the covers!</B> Pant is pressing the accelerator now! Stokes goes wide and full, but there's too much pace and that's meat and drink for the young'un's swishing blade!"
"much tighter line, and punched with a high elbow back to the bowler"
"slower ball, on the legs, Pant doesn't really pick it, but places enough bat on a stab to leg to scamper off for the single"
"<B>welcome to the game, Sam Curran!</B> Down on one knee, premeditated the full-length inswinger, and duly swinging it high over the leg side, sweeping majestically over fine leg!"
"<B>he's gone for it again, and Malan clings onto a fine low grab!</B> Wow, that's some ticker from Curran to be fair. Backed his best ball, in spite of the treatment he got first time, and this time SKY can't get the elevation on his sweep. Malan is perhaps slightly finer, and stoops well to gather. We've got a third-umpire review ... <strong>and this might get over-turned</strong>. Malan's grab seemed to be in the heel of his hands as he fell forward, and it's feasible his fingers weren't under the ball in the final take. The on-field signal is out, so the benefit may stay with the fielder, as this is taking an age... <B>It's out!</B> The third umpire rules that the TV evidence is inconclusive ... and well, it's a coin-flip on that count. But what a superb (not-)debut innings it was!"
"<B>well, that'll set the right tone!</B> A walloped cover-drive, right in Iyer's slot, and pounded to the rope!"
"jabbed to the off-side, and they swipe the single"
"half a pull, round the corner for another single"
"<B>back of a length, and battered high through third man!</B> That was an all-action over! Curran is kicking himself for offering too much width. Six overs to post something hefty, and that over helps no end, in spite of the wicket"
"round the wicket, hard hands on the drive, straight to mid-off"
"slower ball, very well disguised, wide line and back of a length, and Pant can't time his cut/drive into the off side"
"cracked with intent into the covers, but Jordan is serving up another canny over of variation here, can't quite line up the pace of the ball"
"<B>extraordinary!</B> French cricket from Pant, feet in concrete, and wrists like steel! Plinked high and handsome over the leg side!"
"wellied to long-on, as Pant winds into a pull and cloths it on the bounce to the fielder back on the rope"
"full length, into the toes, clipped urgently to deep midwicket. One shot in anger, but overall, a very tidy over from Jordan"
"thumped hard back down the track, tight line and full length"
"wide yorker from Wood, or pretty close to one. Good delivery, as Iyer slams an open-faced drive to the cover sweeper, and gathered with a slide"
"short, and slammed out to the leg side, where <B>Curran makes a hash of the gather at wide long-on!</B> Poor effort, the ball was travelling, but you'd expect him to get his body behind that one"
"attempted mow through the line, but that's inside-edged to long-on, and Iyer groans in frustration, Wood aiming full and wide again"
"another whip to the leg-side, Wood is bowling a decent over here, no wriggle-room for the batsmen to free the arms"
"<B>good finish to the over from Iyer!</B> Width again, but this time it's met with a cleverly angled bat, deliberately stabbed through third man. A dent in Wood's figures, but six an over after three is perfectly healthy from him"
"<B>planked through the line!</B> That's superb from Pant, not a whole lot wrong with the ball, but it was sufficiently in his arc to have a full go, through long-off"
"<B>bowled him!</B> Silence in the already empty stadium! Fuller, straighter, a hint of movement back into the left-hander, and Pant, feet rooted once again as he trusts his hands to get him out of trouble, can't connect and loses his middle stump in exchange! Very timely wicket for England"
"slower ball outside off, on a full length and wide line, pressed to cover"
"on the back foot, slower ball again, dabbed to the leg side, and an easy two with the field set back"
"whipped to backward square, picked off the pads for another single"
"<B>slow bouncer</B>. Such a cunning weapon, straight as a die, Pandya lines up the pull and has to settle for a tap to the leg side as the ball never arrives"
"<B>on the legs, and flipped into the dug-out!</B> That's a quality start from Pandya, inside the line, trusting the bounce, and getting underneath his uppercut of a pull"
"back of a length, angled bat to pick off the single to third man"
A swing through the line as Jordan aims for the tramlines and beats an ambitious mow. Well bowled
"<B>lumped back over the bowler's head!</B> There's value for the shots tonight when you hit through the line, a length ball, slotted straight down the ground"
"<B>Inside-out over the covers!</B> Wow, that's utterly pinged, not desperately wide, nor missing his length by much. But Iyer strode to the pitch, and slammed high and hard to the rope!"
"aims full, that's not a bad option, on the wide line again, Iyer walks across to drill to the leg side, and settles for the single to midwicket"
"a shimmy at the crease, making room to leg, and drilling a full-length drive to extra cover"
"very wide on the crease, banged in just back of a length, and slammed from so deep in the crease, over the covers, and <B>inches out of the reach of Morgan, running back</B>"
"back of a length, banged through to the keeper. Wheels from Wood again, and a priceless dot ball"
"another rapid back-of-a-lengther - <I>only</I> 124kph on that occasion, but Pandya can't connect on his slash over cover"
"<B>what a blinder from Stokes in the covers!</B> Pandya steps back for a slap into the off-side again, he gets better contact on this one, but the ball is almost past Stokes as he flings himself backwards to his left, and snatches in one hand! There's another check for a bump-ball as he fell to turf, but nope, safely in his fingers. A big wicket"
"<B>a boundary to finish the over!</B> That's excellent, opportunistic batting, opening the face first-ball, using the pace and fizzing through third man! Wood's work is done, another red-hot effort"
"on the toes, flicked out to deep midwicket, and <strong>straight to Malan on the rope!</strong> Huge ccalp early in the over. Iyer had done a fine job, but he can't finish it off. That 190 hope is fading now"
"slower ball, flogged high towards long-off, but plugs before the fielder can reach it. Well bowled again"
"<B>tickled through third man for a crucial four!</B> Round the wicket from Archer, very full length, not a lot wrong with the ball, but a dangled bat and a dab past the keeper"
"<B>caught at third man this time!</B> Sundar wanted to use the pace for a ramp over the ropes, but the pace wasn't quite there that time. An open-faced steer to Rashid, right back on the rope, and that was like catching practice ... but <B>hang on, has Rashid stepped on the rope?</B> He's pretty far back, with his heel raised at the moment the catch is taken... could be another soft-signal situation here. It's out on the field, and not a lot of hard evidence that he's touched the boundary sponge. Yep, Sundar has to go! No movement in that frame-by-frame analysis. On we go"
"slower bouncer, wide line, and <B>given as a wide</B>. That's marginal, but yep, just over head height"
"<B>very full length, and pongo-ed through wide long-on!</B> Wow, he made contact with that one alright! Power and placement through the field"
"very wide, and a full toss too... Thakur could have left that and got it again... instead, he's toe-ended it into the covers for one more single. A decent effort from India, but this pitch looks more full of runs than its predecessors"
"outswing first up, in the channel, left alone"
"closer to off stump but still movement away, defended solidly to cover"
"length on off, punched to cover"
"fuller on off, goes for the big drive, mis-times it to mid-off"
"goes to drive this length ball in the channel, gets it on the end of the bat and it bounces down and to the keeper. They're thinking of a single but don't take one, Pant hits the stumps direct too"
"length ball, bounces a bit higher than he expected I think and he pats it to midwicket. <b>Maiden over</b> to start for Bhuvneshwar."
"fullish on leg stump, tucked to deep square leg"
"It is the short ball, nicely done by Hardik quick one outside off. Roy goes for the pull but is late on it, whistles past his helmet"
"length ball angling into him, clipped to midwicket. 8 balls without scoring for Roy."
"backing away, Hardik bowls it full and into him, he manages to clip it to long-on to get off the mark"
"backing away, he keeps it on a sixth stump line making Buttler reach for it, he slaps it to mid-off"
"backing away again, and Hardik keeps it on a fifth stump line, Buttler swats across the line half-heartedly - can't connect because the ball is out of his reach. Excellent bowling by Hardik"
"made as if to back away but stayed put, Bhuvneshwar bowled one on the legside - maybe because of that trigger movement - and Roy flicked it off his thigh pad to the square leg boundary"
"this time Roy does give himself some room and Bhuvneshwar follows him again, tickled to short fine leg off his thigh pad"
"<b>boom</b>. Buttler's away. Bhuvneshwar's been targetting the leg-stump line this over, and this is on a length, Buttler plays his pick-up shot full of power to send it soaring over square leg"
"swats a miscued pull to deep square leg's left. Back of a length, slower ball, Buttler moves into position to pull but the ball isn't as short and the pace is not there, doesn't time it well. but in the gap"
"<b>leading edge caught at mid-off</b>. Massive wicket. Slower ball again at 115 kph, Buttler's too early into his flick off the pads, and the ball swirls up high. Rahul getting under it, seemed to lose it momentarily but then does well to grab it."
"seaming into him first ball and struck on the pads. Bowler's belting out an appeal but no review. That was going down leg. The batsmen are thinking about a run but Bhuvneshwar has the presence of mind to rush down even while appealing and collect the ball, throw down the stumps at the bowler's end. Malan was well in though. Replays show that was inside-edged onto pad."
"length ball on the stumps, tucked through square leg"
"<b>inside edge goes for four</b>. That's also 1000 runs for Roy in T20Is, though he's fortunate with these runs. Was rushing down the track to try and swat this away, gets an under-edge that goes past the stumps and past the keeper, very fine."
"<b>direct hit results in an overthrow run</b>. Length ball, punched to mid-off from the back foot and they set off for a quick single. Good effort by the fielder to pick up and throw down the stumps quickly, but that results in an extra run"
"<b>outside edge goes for four</b>. Backs away to make room and swings mightily through the line. Was aiming over cover, the ball squirts off the outside edge to go to the third man boundary"
"back of a length on the stumps, slaps a pull shot to long-on"
"length outside off, steered to third man"
"length ball on middle and leg, tucked to midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, doesn't bounce as much. He goes to pull but the ball goes under the bat"
"nails the pull this time, but didn't try to hit it too hard. controlled it and kept it down to a short ball on middle, there's a fielder at deep midwicket who collects"
<b>that's come off the back of his bat after he had completed swivelling for the pull!</b>. That was a slower than slow bouncer by Hardik - 91 kph only. Roy had completed his pull and it hit the back of the bat to roll into the offside
"<b>dropped by Shardul Thakur at short third man, but great effort</b>. Hardik feels he should have gone for it with two hands. Tough one. Slower ball back of a length outside off, Malan tries to steer/ramp it away. Shardul leaps up and gets a hand on the ball, but it doesn't stick."
"and no proper connection once again. Goes to pull, goes hard, but gets an under-edge that bounces to the keeper. Roy flings his bat in the air in frustration after the over ends."
"speared in full, he makes room and drives fluently, but can't go past cover"
"length ball on off stump, pushed through quicker, punched to long-off"
"<b>nicely done</b>. Spotted the length was fuller, moved across, went down on his knees and picked up the sweep from leg stump to find the boundary at backward square eg"
"slightly shorter and he rocks back to pull it. Hits it hard but not with the best timing, giving Iyer at deep midwicket enough time to run to his left and stop it"
"<b>bang</b>. That's a shot of authority. Too full outside off and he takes a step and a half forward, and swings his arms through the line to lift this over long-off"
given width outside off now and he lays into that one to crash it through cover. Bumper over for England.
"back of a length on the stumps, stays beside the ball to punch through cover. The fielder in the deep has to run to his right and collects it just inside the boundary"
"good bouncer, on middle stump. He was backing away to try and ramp it, but doesn't connect"
"<b>lifted over long-off</b>. Full ball on the stumps, he gives himself a tiny bit of room and gets underneath it, times it really well to lift this high and all the way."
"back of a length on the stumps, he was backing away to try and steer it fine, can't connect. Shardul thinks there's a feather but he's the only one appealing."
"slower ball back of a length, and he's copped it in the midriff, too early into the pull. didn't read the change of pace and shaped to pull it"
"another slower back of a length ball, this time outside off. Malan again pulls and connects only with air"
starts off with a short one that sits up and is slugged across the line but Roy can't time it too well and it rolls to midwicket. Roy's furious with himself. Thought he should have got 5 more than he did for that
"quicker, length on the pads, nurdled to long-on"
"length ball, leg-break turning away, Roy stays beside it and absolutely thrashes it through cover, but some good balance from Rohit at the boundary, who runs to his right and picks it up in front of the boundary"
"<b>stumping appeal</b>. Malan beaten there but he hadn't dragged his foot over the line, so <s>he's safe</s>. Uh oh, maybe he isn't. Was the foot grounded is the question. Okay it was. Googly by Chahar, pitched on off and spun away, beating Malan."
"leg-break on leg stump and spinning past the stumps, Pant collects but that's a wide"
"<b>googly bowls him around his legs</b>. Malan went for the reverse sweep, wasn't in great position given the length, had to stretch for it almost. Makes no contact with the ball and his stumps are knocked out of the ground."
"leg break has him feeling for it outside off. pitched on a sixth stump line, Bairstow coming forward to defend, and the ball spins past his bat"
"<b>Sundar can't get down in time at point</b>. Kept this wide outside off and Roy did well to cut this late. The fielder was moving to his right and seemed to dive late, as the ball went past him. Hardik not happy with that"
"length on the stumps, slapped to long-on"
"another slower bouncer, he has not read it, swivels to pull and is too early, the ball thuds into his ribcage"
"length on off stump, punched to long-on"
"<b>caught at deep midwicket</b>. That's a Mumbai Indians dismissal, bowled Hardik Pandya, caught Suryakumar Yadav. Banged in short, this time at normal pace, and got it to rise above the shoulder. Roy went for the pull, didn't quite nail it, and SKY at the boundary takes a few steps forward and gobbles it up. Another dismissal in the 40s for Roy."
"greets him with a slow bouncer, 118 kph. Dug in very short, but Stokes couldn't do much expect duck under it, not having read the pace of it"
"back of a length outside off, cuts fiercely but straight to cover"
"quicker, slightly short, on the stumps, goes inside the line and tucks to midwicket"
"length on the stumps, punched to long-on"
"was giving himself room so Sundar bowled it into him, worked off his pads through midwicket"
inside edged that forward defensive onto pad. was defending outside the line to a length ball
"fuller on the pads, flicked off his toes through midwicket. Stokes pushes for the second. The throw is wide of the stumps so they make it safely"
"back of a length, flipped from a leg-stump line, and <B>Stokes has to scamper as the shy comes in!</B> Nope, he got there fine in the end"
"back of a length, bashed hard into the covers off the back foot, but can't force his way through"
"<B>Stokes has a gallop, and gets away with a scuff to deep midwicket!</B> Down the track, right at the bottom of the bat with his wallop across the line, and that's a really tough chance in the deep, on the half-volley, and through his clutches!"
"reverse-sweep, not timed, in the air, but in the gap too at backward point"
"quicker delivery, flatter and tighter line, Bairstow rocks back to cut into the covers"
"back of a length, leg-stump line, Stokes is deep in his crease as he pushes to midwicket"
"round the wicket, and <B>that's moshed through long-on!</B> Stokes is falling backwards as his bat heaves through the line, getting himself deeper in the crease to leather it as straight as possible. Power in the shot!"
"attempted smear to the leg side, down on one knee, and bobbling off the pads for Pant to gather with a hopeful appeal"
"heaved to leg, as Stokes loses his shape on the leg-side hoick... the ball's not quite where he wants it to be"
"attempted reverse sweep, pitched outside leg as it thumps the knee-roll"
"flicked to long-on, walking into the stroke as Washington finds a tight line and length again"
"<B>blatted into the stands!</B> That's better from Stokes! This time it is truly is in his arc, and he doesn't need to lose his shape to impart any power through the launch over deep midwicket"
"back of a length, as Bairstow swings into the legbreak and heaves it to wide long-on"
"skiddier line, met on the back foot with a tuck to mid-on, another single"
"Bairstow launches into the slog sweep to a full length on leg stump, but can't make proper contact"
"back of a length, zipping through, Bairstow rocks back to pull and lumps the ball through Chahar's grasp in his followthrough"
"<B>whoomphed through the line, and high over the bowler's head!</B> Lots of air on a big back-of-the-hander, and that just dips into his arc, as Stokes got under the shot and dumped it into the sightscreen"
"big googly to finish, turning out of Stokes' reach as he lines up a cut, and he grimaces as Pant gathers"
"yep, sure enough, first ball, he plants the front foot and flogs with the spin to deep midwicket. Not got hold of it, but the intent is plain..."
"<B>clawed through the leg side</B> and out of the reach of square leg! Good from Bairstow, deep in his crease and pivoting into the offbreak"
"<B>smooshed over deep midwicket!</B> Bairstow goes with the spin once more, and that's dumped over deep midwicket! This is becoming the big over that England, and Bairstow, needed..."
"wider line, but <B>it makes no difference</B> as Bairstow drops to one knee, and utterly nails a violent pull through wide long-on!  The fifty partnership is up off 29 balls"
"Bairstow tucks the single to the leg side, and contemplates a job well done in that over"
"on the back foot, and drilled to deep cover. Stokes keeps the strike, as 18 runs come from Sundar's last over"
"<B>back of a length on leg stump, and clubbed behind square!</B> Big start for Stokes, cracking down on the stroke, through backward square. Runs flowing now for England"
"leg stump line, Stokes rocks back into the crease, taps into space at midwicket, and Bairstow's scampering makes two out of nothing. Impressive running"
"<B>inside-out and over the covers!</B> Stokes is right at the party now, kneeling into an uppercut of a drive over the ropes! Shot"
"on the back foot, flicked to the on-side, and an early call of no as Bairstow ponders the second"
"<B>Bairstow's given it away!</B> That's a huge moment for India to strike, outside off, a bit of a nothing cut into the off-side as YJB was caught between two or three shots. A top-edged slap to point, and that's a glimmer... can they make it a full-blown opportunity?"
"tossed up on the pads, tucked to the on-side, and that's the end of a tough but very important spell from Chahar"
"very wide line, and Morgan threads a cut through the grasp of point, out to the cover sweeper"
panned out to the point sweeper once more. Morgan climbs into the wide line with another measured cut
"<B>down the track, and Stokes has flogged that through wide long-on!</B> Iyer seemed to be two metres from the ball but never got close to it. That was power and placement on a galloping pull!"
"wide line again, Stokes toe-ends his back-foot drive into the covers, just the single this time"
"Morgan walks across his stumps, and Bhuve fires in a beautiful yorker, just skimming past leg stump, and rightly, that is not a wide, as he had walked so far across the crease"
"thuds the pads on a very full length, that's a good end to an important over. Bhuve has one more..."
"slower ball, first ball, and <B>Stokes has slapped it to long-off!</B> Superb bowling from Thakur, trusting the cutter that caused him such bother in the second game, and once again, he can't get enough bat through the line. A simple catch, and the pendulum swings again!"
"<B>two in two and India are surging now!</B> Another outstanding offcutter, Morgan tried to go up and over, but he clothed the shot, no pace on the ball as the bat came through the line, and that's a simple waist-high take!"
"another cutter, on a middle-and-leg line from over the wicket, and dabbed to cover to avert the hat-trick"
<B>flashed through the covers!</B> That's a powerful and timely blow for England's flagging cause!
"back of a length, outside off, Jordan can't connect on the cut"
"banged into the pitch, Jordan connects on the pull out to deep midwicket, but the sweeper hurtles round. That's a huge over for India. Two wickets, and both the set batsmen"
"banged in short, down the leg side, Curran swings into a pull, and probably misses out there, as fine leg gathers... but <B>England steal an overthrow</B> as Pant can't gather the return"
"banged in short, and thumped in the midriff as Curran swings into a pull"
short and a top-edged pull to the leg-side!
"back of a length, skids into a pull and can't connect on a swing. Pandya is doing the job superbly here. England are thrashing rather wildly"
"whistles a bouncer through to the keeper... Curran looks quizzically, but that wasn't above head height"
"<B>through a flat-footed wipe, and Pandya has finished it off!</B> That wriggles through everything, bat, pad, inside-edge, down into the timbers. India are surging towards a series leveller now!"
"very full length, crunched to long-on, but with no great timing"
"that was in Archer's arc, but his hopeful wipe to the leg-side found thin air. Another slower ball"
"booming outswinger, we'll have that again"
"flashed high and hard into the off side. More height than distance, and plugs in the gap between two fielders"
"another cutter, toe-ended to the covers once more"
"out comes the yorker, right up to the toes, and punched down to long-off"
"<B>crashed into the gap in the covers!</B> Bhuve speared it out wide as Archer advanced, and that was toe-ended, effectively enough, over the rope!"
"an under-edged wipe, Pant springs to the leg-side to cut off the deflection. That was close to the base of the stumps"
"<B>pumped through long-on!</B> It's not a six, but it's straight enough to elude the two men back on the ropes! That gives England something to work on. Just in Archer's arc, on that occasion"
"<B>banged into the pitch, and Archer has launched it!</B> Uh oh, Jofra's found his IPL range, and this is getting a little squeaky! A rifled pull, high over midwicket! 12 off 3..."
"banged in short again, but <B>too short!</B> Archer doesn't bother throwing the bat at that one... and out comes the umpire's signal"
"<B>wide again!</B> Oh my... Thakur is determined to keep the ball out of Archer's arc... and he's overcooking it! He barely hits the cut strip, and it's 10 from 3..."
<B>Archer has broken his bat on a flog through the line!</B> That was right off the toe... and all the pace comes off the ball as the batsman cross for a single to cover
"<B>back of a length, Jordan holes out to long off!</B> There was a huge cry of 'yeah!' as that shot went up, but it was an Indian voice, as Jordan can't get enough bat through his drill over the covers, and England's challenge, wides aside, is cooked..."
"<B>Archer swings and misses, and the series is tied!</B> Length ball outside off, in the slot but even Archer in this mood can't manage a nine. England's challenge ends tamely"
