"similar line, similar result - but this is the googly, and it's <b>given!</b> Rashid gets his man, although Bavuma decides to <b>review</b>, which looks optimistic on the replays. Skidding on rather than straightening and Bavuma was all at sea trying to play it, beaten past the inside edge and Hawk-Eye has it smashing the top of middle and leg stump. There's a brief delay, with the batsman told to wait by the boundary edge - Aleem Dar, the third umpire, seemed to want another look at whether there was bat involved. But the conclusion is no, nothing on it, off you go Temba!"
"thuds into the front pad, <b>gone first ball!</b> Googly again, van der Dussen missed it by a distance... and after some deliberation, Shaun Geroge's finger goes up! Looked a bit leg side, but South Africa don't have a review after Bavuma's failed use of the DRS a moment ago. But <i>again</i> there's a hold up, van der Dussen told not to leave the field... and then he signals for a review! England don't like this, they're saying SA don't have one left, but the umpires have called for it... <b>and Hawk-Eye shows the ball missing leg stump!</b> Roars from the crowd, van der Dussen gets a reprieve after all!"

"<b>pongo!</b> Picked up off the pads, and dumped on to the grass banks...! Almost a lazy flick from YJB, but all timing as he launches the ball through the thin Highveld air"

"shortish, tapped down into the off side"
"banged in short, 134kph/83mph, <b>swung away through backward square leg!</b> Thoroughly trashed on the pull again, and SA have problems"

"<b>good ball from Hendricks</b>, hits the seam at 136kph and does him past the inside edge, bit of a waft from Bairstow as he looked to swing through the line"
"pitched up, 141kph/88mph outside off, <b>belted down the ground for four more!</b> Roy had to do a little jump at the non-striker's, nutmegged by the ball as it <i>travelled</i> to the rope at long-off"

"on the stumps, driven back towards mid-on without timing"
"bit of inward movement as Bairstow throws the hands... <b>squirted to midwicket!</b> Breakthrough for South Africa, and it's Sipamla who stops the rampaging Yorkshireman.

"length ball around the line of off, Morgan shows it a straight bat"

"angled in with the arm, Morgan works it square"
"short of a length, nipping to hit Morgan on the thigh pad as he hangs back"
"in-ducker, hit on the back pad, SA go up... Not given and height seems to be the main question, but de Kock <b>reviews</b>; what will ball-tracking say? Just shaving the top of leg stump! But that will stay as <b>umpire's call</b>, meaning SA do at least keep the review"

"short of a length, 132kph/82mph and Morgan jabs through midwicket"
"skips down, done by the length - <b>Hendricks scoops the catch in his follow-through!</b> Trying to assert himself but Morgan departs, the ball hit the splice of the bat and just popped back to the bowler. Another self-inflicted wound for England, and this chase is <i>just</i> starting to wobble"
