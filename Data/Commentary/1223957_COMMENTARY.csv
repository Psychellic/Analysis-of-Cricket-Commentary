He's reviewed... Only bounce can save him, I think. No bat on it. Big stride forward, so that might help. Nope. It's hitting the top part of middle stump, so he'll have to be on his way.

"ooh, Australia have reviewed for a caught-behind! Back of a length, straightening just a touch in the corridor. Kohli is looking initially to work this with the angle, I think, and then he's adjusting to the movement when the ball zips past his outside edge. Or has it kissed his edge? There's the tiniest of spikes on Ultra-Edge, but it's enough of a spike to reverse the on-field decision and send Kohli back. What a massive strike from Hazlewood!"

"134kph, wide yorker, well bowled, he squeezes this out to backward point and Zampa misfields to allow two"
"131kph, wide yorker, he can't get under, he drags it to long on for two, <strong>Pandya goes to his highest ODI score of 92</strong> to end the innings"
"back of a length outside off, chopped to backward point"
"ooh, what a delivery. Back of a length, angling in, pitching in the fifth-stump channel, jagging away off the seam, and then swinging late as well, after it's passed the batsman's uncertain jab"
"and again. This one pitches even closer to off stump before straightening past the edge. Labuschagne had to play at it, and the length just left his feet frozen"
"ooh, Bumrah likes this pitch. Similar line to the first two balls, but this keeps going with the angle with some extra bounce. Labuschagne does well to get on his toes, ride the bounce, and defend it by his feet"
"onto the pads, clipped to the left of long leg"
"back of a length outside off, jags in off the seam this time and sneaks past the inside edge as Labuschagne looks to punch through cover. Kept a little low too"
"back of a length, slanting across to off stump, punched to mid-off"
"full, angling across to off stump, tiny bit of shape back in. Gets forward for a push to mid-off"
"drops short now, and it only gets up to about stomach height, just outside off. Finch swivels and dumps it over the forward square leg boundary. Welcome to international cricket!"
"back of a length close to off stump, chopped into the point region"
"short, but this time it gets up to chest height, and closer to Finch's body with the line. Helped down to fine leg for a single"
"short, some width too, but the angle away from the right-hander defeats Labuschagne, who looks to cut without getting across with his back foot"
"and again, past the outside edge. Bumrah angles it in, hits that hard length in the corridor, and straightens it past a hesitant defensive prod"
"slightly fuller length, angling in towards off stump, defended back towards the bowler"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump, defended into the covers"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and steers to third man"
"shortish, not too much width, but that's a super shot from Labuschagne, stands tall and frees his arms through a back-foot drive between backward point and cover point"
"back of a length, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"length ball slanting across towards off stump, gets forward to punch towards cover point"
"shot! That isn't a short ball, it's on off stump, and Finch is waiting for something marginal like that, and he simply half-swivels and swats it between midwicket and mid-on. Dismissive"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to short extra-cover"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, gets forward to defend into the on side"
"big appeal for lbw as Finch steps across and looks to whip one through square leg. I think the impact was well outside off stump, though"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"there, again. This could even be outswing. Length ball, fifth-stump channel, and it veers away against the angle as Labuschagne pokes at it with an angled bat. Beaten comprehensively"
"again that movement, and this time Labuschagne pulls out of his stroke halfway and leaves it alone"
"back of a length outside off, waits on it and carves to third man"
"fullish, angling in towards off stump, and that's some timing. Just stands there, stays slightly leg-side of the ball, and slices a six over point. He may have wanted to hit over cover, and the bat may have spun in his hands"
"back of a length on off stump, clipped watchfully to midwicket"
"length ball on the stumps, clipped down to mid-on"
"Natarajan on the board. India's first wicket in Powerplays this series. What a moment for Natarajan. Not the most spectacular one. Not something you see when you dream of a maiden wicket. This is short, just outside off, Marnus wants to pull, but gets a bottom edge onto the wicket. This is short and angling away, could he have cut instead of pulled?"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
"fuller, angling in, defended to short midwicket"
"short of a length, just outside off, Smith shuffles across to work this to short midwicket again"
"fuller, but not driving length, Smith is back and across to push this back to him"
"wicket-maiden for Natarajan. What a start. This one holds its line in front of off, squares him up, and takes a soft outside edge to point"
"rare outright bad ball from Bumrah, wide half-volley. Finch gets forward and drives between cover and mid-off"
"length ball close to off stump, defended with an open face to backward point"
"length ball angling into middle stump, clipped to mid-on. Hung in the air briefly but no worries for Finch"
"back of a length, skids through with maybe a bit of inward movement, and beats the attempted flick. Hits him on the thigh pad"
"edged, and <b>put down!</b> He's been getting the ball to nip away in the corridor all through this spell, and he hits the perfect length with this ball, full enough so the movement finds the edge rather than beating it. Finch is half-forward, and he has a half-hearted prod at it, and the ball goes to the right of slip, at about shin height, and Shikhar Dhawan gets both hands to it but can't hold on"
"back of a length, angling down leg, and Finch misses his flick but picks up four leg-byes to the fine leg boundary. Insult to injury"
"full, angling into off stump, punched to mid-on"
"length ball, aiming towards top of off. Steps across and clips towards midwicket. No-ball too, but they could have got a wicket with it. Pandya moved quickly to his right at midwicket while Finch was slow to take off from the non-striker's end. The throw misses, though, and Finch can breathe"
"Natarajan goes for the yorker, and Finch, probably expecting it, looks for the reverse-ramp past short third man. Misses, and the ball rolls down to the keeper off the back pad"
"length ball angling into the stumps. Half-hearted appeal as Finch walks across to flick and misses. The impact, again, was outside off stump. Ball ricochets wide of slip for a leg-bye"
"length ball angling into the stumps. Steps across, meets it in line with off stump, and nearly beats short fine leg with the flick. Bumrah throws himself to his left and saves three runs"
"he's been seeing Finch stepping across his stumps repeatedly. Looks for the full one on leg stump to try and bowl him behind his legs, but ends up firing down a leg-side wide"
"shortish, down the leg side, Finch looks to pull and misses"
"overpitched. Wide-ish half-volley, and Finch shuffles down the pitch and drives smoothly to the right of extra-cover"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, steps forward and across and clips through square leg"
"<b>dropped</b> again. This is a much more difficult catch. Fullish, angling into off stump and straightening slightly. Pushes at it with firm hands, and it pops back to Bumrah at around chest height, to his left. Sticks his hand out, but the ball doesn't stick"
"back of a length outside off, jabbed into the point region"
"length ball, fourth-stump channel. Finch looks to get forward but his weight isn't fully forward as he looks to punch this down the ground. Ends up inside-edging into his pad"
"length ball close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"what a charmed life Finch is leading. Length ball angling into off stump, and this one bounces out of nowhere. Straightens slightly too. Looks to work it with the angle, and the ball pops up in the air, off the leading edge, but into no-man's land to the right of square leg"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"go on, just throw your bat at everything. Nothing's going to go to hand anyway. Down the track to a length ball that nips away off the pitch, and he drives with bat far out in front of his body. Thick edge, flies in the air to the right of backward point"
"length ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"down the track again, Thakur shortens his length slightly and Finch flat-bats to extra-cover"
"looks to step out again, and Thakur gets this one to nip back in slightly to beat the flick. Half-hearted appeal, the ball was probably heading down leg"
"length ball close to off stump, gets forward for a push to the left of short extra"
"fullish, angling into middle and off. Lets it come and clips to the right of midwicket"
"tossed up slow on off stump, skips out and clips with the turn to short midwicket"
"short, turns down leg, and Smith plays the old Tendulkar paddle sweep (pretty much a straight drive behind the wicket) past the keeper"
down the track but he can't get to the pitch of this loopy one just outside leg stump. Looks to flick and the ball hits his front pad
"down the track, and again he fails to reach the pitch of the ball. Wrong'un this time, past the other side of his flick to hit him on the body"
"back of a length, spins down leg slightly, goes back and works it to deep backward square leg"
"short on leg stump, rocks back and swats a pull to deep backward square leg"
"full outside off, a bit of late outswing. Driven firmly to mid-off"
"got him! No 62-ball hundred today for Smith. Not the most aesthetically pleasing dismissal, but Thakur won't care. Back of a length, angling down leg, and Smith, who's shuffled a long way across as he always does, looks to glance it fine but only manages to tickle it to the keeper. Tons of bowlers have tried getting him out like that, or with a leg gully in place, and they've usually failed"
"angling down leg again, but no shuffle from Henriques. Just clips it away neatly to the fine leg boundary"
"back of a length, a bit of width, and Henriques stands tall and slaps it between backward point and cover point. What a start!"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"length ball on off stump, punched to mid-off"
"dips onto a good length on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"full, on the pads, clipped to square leg"
"goes back to a fairly full ball pitching on off stump, picks the direction of turn and clips to midwicket"
"down the track now, gets close to this leg-stumpish ball and works it away through square leg"
"back of a length on leg stump, tucked away to deep backward square leg"
"beaten on the flick, not much of an lbw appeal because this was spinning down leg. A bit of flight and dip, and the ball beat the inside edge. Oh, hang on, India have reviewed! Kuldeep has bowled a better length through this over than he did in his first over, and Finch, who's got a big stride forward, simply fails to get to the pitch as he looks to flick. Turns sharply to hit his front pad, and it's turned too sharply. Missing leg stump is the verdict of ball-tracking"
"back of a length close to off stump, stabbed to the left of backward point, where Jadeja makes his customary diving save. Henriques took off for a single and then had to turn around hurriedly and throw himself into the crease. Direct hit may have been interesting. As it happens, he's called for a change of pads. Not sure what's gone wrong with his current pair"
"back of a length on off stump, uses his wrists to play that to mid-on off the back foot"
"shortish, a bit of width, cut away but can't beat backward point"
"length ball on off stump, clipped to mid-on"
"back of a length outside off, straightens slightly and maybe stops on Henriques. Defended into the covers"
"ooh, some extra bounce here. Shortish, a bit of width, but the bounce defeats the attempted cut"
"tossed up on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"flighted ball on middle stump, clipped to long-on"
"down the track to another tossed-up ball on leg stump, flicks it away to deep midwicket"
"shortish, turning quickly down the leg side, whipped to deep square leg"
"length ball spinning in towards off and middle, stays back and punches it back to the bowler"
"length ball, pitching on off stump and spinning further away. Waits on the back foot, watches it turn, and then punches to long-off. Clearly hanging back and looking to play it off the pitch, is Henriques. Kuldeep will want to find ways to bring him forward"
"back of a length, sliding on towards off stump, punched to extra-cover"
"tossed up slow and wide, looks to step across and sweep. Through it too soon and he's hit on the back"
"back of a length on off stump, whipped to deep square leg"
"length ball outside off, gets forward and blocks to short cover"
"flat slider going down leg. Looks to sweep and misses. Appeal for caught behind from Rahul, who's done well to move there and collect. Just brushed the flap of the pad"
"sweeps again, but can't beat the man at backward square leg"
"tossed up on middle and leg, gets forward and clips it away fine"
"down the track and he goes too early. Kuldeep spots him and bowls it shorter  and quicker. Ends up deliberately padding it away. Was in no danger of hitting the stumps from left-arm over, of course"
"quickish again, and Finch quickly picks the line, which is outside leg, and uses the pace to sweep it firmly to the right of the deep backward square leg fielder"
"down the track now and the ball lands just short of where he wants it, but he goes through with his big shot anyway. Doesn't middle it, and it lands a few feet short of the rope as long-on sprints to his left"
down the track and again he's not to the pitch. Clipped to midwicket
"tossed up outside off, gets forward and blocks into the off side"
"darted down leg, he tries to sweeps and gloves it over the keeper's head and it runs away for two"
"93kph, this holds up in the surface, he pushes back to the bowler"
"90kph, darted into off, Finch defends"
<strong>a slog sweep over backward square!</strong> What a shot to bring up <strong>another half-century!</strong>. Outside off and he hammers this over the man on the rope!
"gets away with a top edge! Short ball, he got a top edge and it balloons high in the air but lands safe between short fine running back and deep square coming in"
"shorter length, he stands tall and drives to long on"
"tossed up on middle, he defends from the crease"
"shorter length, spinning back into leg, he gets deep in the crease to work it to fine leg with the spin"
"wrong un, 78kph, pitching on off, Finch has to adjust late to defend"
"tossed higher, 79kph, he drives firmly back to the bowler"
"shorter length, he gives room and drives forcefully off the back foot to cover-point"
"full on leg, he sweeps but it comes off the toe of the bat and runs forward of square"
"shorter outside off, he's back and cutting to point"
"91kph, tossed up outside off, he slices a drive to backward point"
"shorter, darted into leg, he's back and pulling to deep square"
<strong>spins sharply</strong> past the edge. Ripping delivery. Drifted in and gripped away past the edge
"shorter length, he's back and tucking this forward of square"
"95kph, shorter, darted into leg, it takes him on the thigh pad"
"139kph, back of a length, Finch is on the walk and works this just midwicket and they pinch two. Outrageous running to pinch two there"
"139kph, shorter length, chest high, he swivels and pulls to wide fine leg"
"<strong>pulled powerfully between midwicket and mid off!</strong> Fractionally short outside off, he was so quick to spot the length, rocked back and smoked it"
"139kph, full on leg, he clips this to midwicket's right, Kohli dives to his right to knock it down but can't reel it in to get a throw off"
"<strong>pulled forward of square!</strong> Iyer gets there on the rope at full stretch to his left but it rolls off his hand into the rope. Too short from Thakur, chest high and Finch was all over it slapping it forward of square"
"angled into the hip, he glances this with ease to fine leg"
"<strong>picked up and deposited over wide long on!</strong> Tossed up in the arc of Finch and from outside off, with one stride forward and drags it over wide long on, one bounce four"
"drifting into leg, he works this off the front foot to midwicket's right"
"94kph, yorker wide of off, he plays over it and Rahul completes the take very well"
"95kph, full outside off, he drives straight to cover"
"tossed up, more spin, he slices this to backward point"
"96kph, angled into middle, he gets a thick edge onto pad"
"<strong>an appeal for lbw</strong> but it was bat first, just. He was pressing forward, got an inside edge, squeezing it onto pad. It was also outside the line"
"<strong>caught at midwicket!</strong> A pull shot picks out Dhawan! Back of a length, cross seam, similar to one in the previous over that he nailed, but this one he hit knee high to Dhawan. Big wicket"
"136kph, bouncer over leg, Green ducks under it"
"<strong>beaten</strong>, fending outside off at a back of a length delivery"
<strong>beaten again</strong> by 138kph late outswinger. What a delivery. Green is nervous and played the wrong line
"138kph, short ball, he pulls to fine leg to get off the mark"
"94kph, darted in, almost a yorker, he jams the bat down"
"shorter length, he's back and defending"
"drifting in and shooting through, he's back to defend"
back of a length he defends
"darted into leg, he works this off his pads to midwicket"
"drifting into leg, he defends"

"good length, top of off, he defends"
"darted into middle, he defends on the front foot"
"shorter length, he's back and slicing this to backward point for a single"
"<strong>holes out to long on!</strong> The dot balls on Green has built the pressure on Finch and he holes out> He's tried to launch this down the ground, he miscued to Dhawan at long on and he nearly spilled it but was able to hold on rolling to the ground"
"full outside off, he lap sweeps behind square"
"<strong>slog sweep for six!</strong> in the slot, he was down on one knee and hoisted this high over deep midwicket. Superb strike. <strong>And Jadeja over-stepped!</strong>"
"He tries the slog sweep again, it was fired quicker, he skied it over mid on for a couple"
"94kph, back of a length on off, he is squared up in a tangle"
"shorter stock ball, Carey tries to reverse sweep early, gets it off the glove"
"<strong>an edge</strong> trying to drive, gets a thick edge past slip and he pushes hard for two"
"80kph, flatter and pushed through, he got back and cuts to backward point"

"tossed up outside off, he reaches out and defends"

"131kph, back of a length, he defends with soft hands into the off side and Carey races through"
"130kph, full on leg, he clips this with the angle to mid on"
"<strong>missed by Kohli at mid off!</strong> It goes for four! Tough chance on the circle! Carey checked a drive on the up to mid off, Kohli jumped a long way in the air and stuck the right hand up but he tipped it over the bar like a goalkeeper and it rolled away for four. Tough chance."
"length ball outside off, he drives on the up to deep cover"
"full outside off and Green tries to launch over midwicket, a <strong>big swing and miss</strong> but it was well wide of off"
"133kph, full angled, into leg, he clips this to midwicket"

"steps outside off, he paddles a ball off middle very fine for a couple"

"137kph, back of a length wide of off, he gets a <strong>thick inside edge</strong> that runs past leg stump! A touch fortunate there Carey"
138kph angled down leg and it's called wide! They appealed for caught behind. It certainly looked like it came off the thigh guard
"137kph, short ball, only gets up chest high, he takes his eyes of it but pulls to fine leg without trouble"
"<strong>off the glove and just over Rahul!</strong> Only 136kph apparently, it looked like 146kph, too quick for Carey, bounced off his gloves and over Rahul"

"full, angling into the legs, clipped to deep square leg"

"short, angling down leg. Looks to pull and misses. Wanted to bowl the bouncer at his front shoulder, I guess, and missed his line marginally"
"back of a length outside off, punched to deep point"
"short, gets it to climb towards Carey's shoulder, but he's controlled his pull beautifully, swivels and simply helps it to the right of the long leg fielder, ensuring he keeps it down"
"length ball on off stump, defended into the covers"
"nicely played. That's fired in fairly full on middle and leg, and he makes himself room for an inside-out chip to the right of deep cover"
"length ball on middle stump, brings out the reverse-sweep in front of deep square leg"
"bang. The open stance allows him easier access to this sort of line. Length ball, angling into middle stump or so, and he gets forward, head over the ball, and absolutely shovels it over the midwicket boundary with super quick hands"
"back of a length on off stump, and Maxwell's hit this one out of the park too. Quick feet to get on the back foot with hips open, and even quicker hands to pull it waay over midwicket. It's landed on the stadium roof and rolled off the premises altogether"
"that's the line. Slower, wide line outside off, makes Maxwell reach out to drive and the ball turns to beat the outside edge"
"and again, beats him with sharp turn from that wide line. Maxwell goes hard at the attempted flat-bat drive and misses"
"length ball, looks to work it into the leg side and misses. Aborted lbw appeal because it pitched outside leg"
"length ball on middle stump, shows the full face to push down to long-on"
"back of a length on leg stump, tucked away to the left of deep square leg, where Kuldeep looks up too early and fluffs his pick-up. Has to run back and ensure he doesn't concede a boundary"

"full on off stump, punched down the ground, past the stumps and to the left of mid-off"
"back of a length outside off, punched to deep point"

"full outside off, driven with a lot of bottom hand down to long-off"
"sees Carey stepping away to make room and follows him with a quick, full one. Pushed down to mid-off"
"gone, is he? That run wasn't on at all. They've gone up to the third umpire, but you'd think there's no need. Carey looked to sweep one pitching just outside leg, and missed, and the ball rolled into the square leg region. Carey sets off quickly, and he's sent back by Maxwell, but too late to beat the underarm throw to Rahul. Kohli was the fielder sprinting in from midwicket"
"full on middle stump, clipped back to the bowler"
"full again, almost in the blockhole. Clipped past the diving bowler, down to long-on"
"back of a length at the hip, clipped to midwicket"

"shortish, angling into off stump, pulled to deep square leg"

"length ball on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, and Maxwell puts it away. Lets it come on and jabs it between backward point and short third man. A difficult field to bowl to against a set batsman"
"shortish outside off, slapped to deep point"
"very full, quicker ball in the blockhole on off stump, jabbed to short cover"
"tossed up on middle stump. Doesn't get a stride in, ends up stuck in the crease. Flicked to midwicket"
"full on off stump, driven to short cover"
"tossed up on leg stump, Maxwell brings out the reverse-sweep but can't beat deep point"
"back of a length fairly wide of off stump. Agar doesn't pick the wrong'un. He was shaping to slap it through point, maybe, and ends up playing a hurried flick to long-on"
"on the pads, nudged into the square leg region"
big wide down the leg side. Wanted to angle it into his feet and deny him room
low full-toss close to off stump. Punched back to the bowler off the inside half of the bat. Was probably aiming to go through cover
"full-toss, about thigh-high, on the stumps. Steps across and whips it to fine leg"
"slower ball, fullish on leg stump. Clipped to midwicket"
"looks for the yorker, ends up bowling a low full-toss on off stump, clipped towards midwicket, who moves quickly to his right to stop it but lets the ball get away from him slightly"

"shortish outside off, slapped to deep point"
"tossed up close to off stump, whipped down to long-on"
"what. A. Shot. Maxwell hits more reverse-sweeps for six than pretty much everyone else, and this time he had to manufacture even more power given that Kuldeep dangled it up slow, and it also landed a little shorter than you might think is ideal for that shot. No worries, says Maxwell, I'll just whack that into the second tier, in front of square"
"fuller and flatter, whipped to long-on"
"tossed up on off stump, clipped to long-on"
"full on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"goes for the yorker, and Maxwell was expecting that, sitting quite deep in his crease on off stump. Simply brings those wrists into play and whips it over the midwicket boundary to bring up another superlative half-century"
"low full-toss on off stump, and Maxwell's eased it for four, just a push between mid-off and extra-cover"
"goes a bit wider with the yorker, and Maxwell collapses his back knee to get down low and steer it to deep backward point"
"shortish outside off, and now Agar joins in the fun. Not bowling to his field, is Natarajan. Cuts it to the left of backward point, and the sweeper is well in front of square, so no way is he getting to that"
"goes for the leg-stump yorker now, and Agar makes himself room and drives to long-off"
"looks to go wide and outside Maxwell's hitting arc, slanting it away from him from over the wicket. It's hard to control the line while doing that, and Maxwell shoulders arms as the ball crosses the tramline"
"length ball outside off, opens his bat face and steers to deep point"
"slower bouncer outside off, Maxwell tennis-forehands it down the ground to long-on"
"short outside off, slapped to deep point"
"slower bouncer again, over off stump, and Maxwell thinks of playing the ramp to third man, then decides to leave it. It's called wide anyway"
"looks to follow up with the leg-stump yorker, and he misses his mark by inches. Maxwell looked to step across and help it fine, and couldn't put bat to it"
"bam, the bails go flying all over the place. That elastic right arm goes beyond the vertical and whangs it full and fast, at the base of the stumps. Maxwell looks to make room and carve it through the covers, working against the angle. He misses, and Bumrah - who's bowled so well with no luck all this while - hits. A crucial, crucial blow"
"fullish on off stump, steps across and clips it to deep backward square leg"
"shortish, close to off stump. Hops to ride the bounce and defend it"
"in the blockhole close to off stump, stabbed into the point region with an open face"
"low full-toss on off stump, jabbed down the ground to long-off"
"in the blockhole, clipped straight back to the bowler"
"nearly a yorker again, pitches just outside leg, beats the flick and hits him on the pad"
"length ball on off stump. No feet from Abbott, just pushes at it and slices it towards backward point"
"full on leg stump, driven to long-on. Natarajan may have got a foot to it to slow it down, after which he slipped and landed awkwardly, almost twisting his right ankle. He's fine, though"
"good ball. Agar looks to make room and carve through the off side. Natarajan's low full-toss doesn't give him the length to work with, and he ends up dragging it down towards long-on. Just four off the over, so an excellent comeback, albeit with Maxwell out of the picture"
"slower length ball on off stump, clipped towards deep midwicket"
"looks for the wide yorker, ends up bowling a wide, reasonably high full-toss. Steered down to third man"
"slower ball on off stump, clipped to long-on"
"shortish, slanting away from the left-hander, slashed to third man"
"leg-stump yorker, misses the flick and prompts an lbw appeal. Probably sliding down leg"
"slower bouncer, and Thakur has the breakthrough. Third wicket for him. Gets up just around shoulder height, angling in and cramping Abbott for room, and he plays a half-hearted pull, only managing to lob it to the keeper off his glove. India's quicks have really pulled this back in the last three overs"
"and he gets the last recognised batsman! Boundaries were needed, and this ball - more or less in the slot, off-stumpish - had to be attacked. Made room to go over cover, but he simply couldn't find the elevation, and the fielder pouches it with both hands in front of his chest"
"in the blockhole on off stump, clipped into the midwicket region"
"shortish, slanting across the right-hander. Jabbed into the point region"
"bouncer, over middle and off. Looks to make room and ramp it over the keeper, makes no contact"
"in the blockhole, angling into leg stump. Makes room and squeezes it out to backward point"
"full on off stump, clipped to deep square leg"
"yorker outside off, and Zampa looks to reverse-ramp and fails to make contact"
"full outside off, carved to deep point"
"in the blockhole on off stump, makes room and drives to the left of Kohli at deep point"
"shot. Full again, on leg stump, clears his front leg and swipes it down to long-on"
"low full-toss on leg stump, knuckleball too. Zampa makes room, adjusts for the lack of pace, and jabs it past the bowler, down towards long-off"
"length ball outside off, slapped to deep point"
"leg-stump yorker, almost. Very low full-toss, and he makes room and stabs it towards backward point"
"slower ball, short and wide outside off. Digs into the pitch and turns like an offbreak. Swings too early into the pull, and then the ball turns and rolls down to Rahul"
"big appeal for lbw, given. Zampa shuffles across and Bumrah bowls it full and straight. He misses the flick, and it looked pretty plumb, given especially how deep he was in his crease, but Zampa has reviewed anyway. No edge on it. Both feet inside the crease, and it's smashing into leg stump, so India have wrapped up a victory that will bring them quite a bit of comfort, after five successive ODI losses, and seven in a row across formats."
