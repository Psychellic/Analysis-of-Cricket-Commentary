"PK runs in amid defeaning noise. Hits back of a length, moves the ball away, Rohit is cautious as he defends to point"
"127 kph, a little fuller in length to keep the lone slip fielder in play. Rohit though bests those intentions by not even playing at the ball"
"two slips now, and Praveen targets Rohit's body. Backfoot push to mid-on"
"that's why Raina's got himself at second slip. Rohit was disciplined for the first couple of balls, but in T20 he can't keep leaving them. Reaches away from his body and the outswing beats him"
"opens him up now! Lands a fuller delivery on middle and leg and gets it to straighten. Rohit plays the line rather than the swing, and gets a leading edge towards third man"
"the inside edge now. This is a fantastic first over from Praveen. He is exceptional in drawing any help a pitch can offer. A little inswinger on middle, turned away behind square leg"
"yes he can. but he has overpitched it. Rohit leans forward and crunches it through extra cover. Finch moved to his right from cover, but he's beaten. Mid-off barely bothered"
"good length ball on and around off stump, defended"
"that should put a dent! He was heard on DJ Bravo's mic saying he wasn't getting much shape, but this one did move into the right-hander. Rohit went for a flick and he has picked out short square leg."
"fuller delivery on off stump, driven smartly to mid-off"
"had to wait a bit to get his first ball tonight. It's length and outside off, Parthiv goes for a slap through the covers but gets an inside edge instead"
"slower ball on middle, 'bowing, bowling, bowling!' yells Bravo. He's a master of those. Parthiv nudges it through square leg"
takes it from outside off and whips a shortish delivery to the square leg boundary. Behind square is where Parthiv gets most of his runs
"back of a length ball angled across the left-hander, inside edged as he cuts"
"see what I mean? The minute he has the option to hit behind square, he looks a very happy boy. A little short, a little wide, a crisp cut for four"
"shortish and tucking him up on leg stump - a little quick as well for Parthiv - who was hopping around. Flick shot fails, but he gets through for a leg bye"
"back of a length on off stump, punched back at the bowler"
takes it from around the off stump and dabs it wide of mid-on
"fuller delivery outside off, driven towards point. There is still some away swing for the bowlers"
gets behind a shortish delivery on off stump
"he's done it again! Doesn't look anywhere close to a wicket-taking delivery. Short, slow, there to be pulled to the legside boundary. But he fails to place it well enough. Picks out short square leg and walks back after banging his bat against his helmet"
"back of a length on off stump, he shimmies down with a block"
"beats him! Superb length from Dhawal. It isn't full enough that the batsman can lunge down. And since he is still new at the crease, he doesn't move back either. Pokes tentatively and the late movement away defeats him"
"leading edge to mid-off. That's a wicket-maiden! Excellent bowling from Kulkarni. Lands it on a good length on middle stump so the batsman has to play, and that is when his awayswing gains more venom. Buttler plays the line, closes the face and mis-hits it"
"moves around the stumps and weathers an lbw appeal. Praveen angles it into the left-hander, who moves across for a flick. Doesn't make contact, but it wanders away to square leg for a leg bye"
controlled backfoot block from Buttler as Praveen concentrates on not giving him any room
"walks at Praveen, he would have faced far quicker bowlers, but would he have faced someone as canny. Praveen pulls his pace back, and his length as well. Buttler doesn't quite adjust, but he did play with soft enough hands that it doesn't carry to slip"
"edged and past slip! McCullum leaps to his right, full stretch and nearly completes a blinder! He's not quite lean and mean, but I guess that happens after retirement. Lovely ball from Praveen, moving away off the seam, and the batsman chasing it with an open face nearly contributes to his end"
that's a little too far for the awayswinger to stray
"shortish and outside off, punched into the covers"
far more confident now as he plays a backfoot slice behind point. Nice timing
"how does he get so much power when he hardly has a followthrough? He met a good length ball on off stump with a gentle pat and it zipped away down the ground, past the bowler's left. Just amazing hands!"
"back of a length, and making him reach outside off, slotted into the covers"
"oooh, that is a ripper! Seam movement, so the batsman cannot reconise it until it pitches. Dhawal puts it on a good length on middle stump so Buttler is set up for a flick, and when it zips away, he is made to look a little silly"
"back of a length and outside off, eased to backward point"
"back of a length on off stump, at 118 kph, Buttler was aiming for midwicket again but has to settle for a single towards the covers"
"shortish on off stump, punched into the covers"
"flatter in trajectory, he hits it into the covers where Raina leaps to his right and saves a single"
"goes for the reverse sweep, and makes sure his front leg was outside off. That's why the umpire says not out when the ball hits the pad and Jakati goes for an lbw appeal"
"premeditates the reverse sweep, which gives Jakati time to fire it in on leg stump. Foils his timing"
"fuller ball on middle and leg, driven to long-on"
"waits on the back foot and glides it to short third man. Good work from the fielder to prevent the single, McCullum at leg slip applauds with a gleeful smile"
moves back and lashes a cut to deep point
"starts poorly though, short ball down leg, Parthiv pulls and misses. Faulkner thinks there was a little glove to the keeper, but the umpire disagrees"
"on the hips again, nudged behind square leg"
"skewed behind point. The sound off the bat was a dull thunk. Buttler was going for the extra cover loft, but it takes a thick outside edge"
"now the ball becomes friends with his inside edge. Buttler gets in line with back of a length delivery on off stump, finds a single through midwicket"
"that's the back of the hand delivery, and it fools Parthiv. Went in for a pull too early, gets an inside edge and it very nearly crashes into his stumps"
"yep, the offcutter. Buttler tries to exploit the field by moving to the leg side and slicing the shortish delivery behind point. Doesn't make contact"
"fuller ball on middle and leg, turned to short midwicket"
"just in time. The run-rate's been languishing below six, so Parthiv takes care of it by running down the track and smashing a flatter ball over the long-on boundary"
"drags one from outside off through midwicket, hit very hard and short midwicket Raina can't stop it. Had very little chance really"
"punched into the off side, but can't beat the ring"
"saw him advancing and fires it in short and on middle. With no room, Parthiv flails. The pull shot goes into midwicket"
that drifts away from the left-hander. Jakati's got some variation and its working excellently. Skids off the pitch and prevents the batsman getting any time to play his shots. Defended
"well bowled, Jakati! Some innate sense must have told him Buttler was nervous. That he would come down the track. And so he slips the ball down leg, it's quick as well so the batsman who was trying to adjust with a flick shot can't reach it. DK does an excellent job, moving quickly to his left and whipping the bails off before Buttler recovered"
"full on off stump, driven back at the bowler. That was left-arm orthodox, but this season he seems to have developed the ball that moves into the right-hander as well. And at his rapid pace, that can be deadly"
"too much pace for Parthiv. The ball's skidding off the deck, but not to the batsman's liking. Either way, that was not wide enough to cut. Dot ball again"
"picked up and deposited over cow corner. Dhawal should not be bowling short, especially when its at 111 kph. Slower ball or not, if they are pitched that short, they will be tonked"
"beaten for pace again as Kulkarni bowls back of a length and just outside off, Parthiv chops it by his feet. Inside edge"
"fuller ball outside off, run towards backward point"
"he's trying ever so hard, but besides the odd big hit, Parthiv's timing fails him. Here - against a back of a length ball on fifth stump - he plays a hack of a backfoot punch and gets it too high on the bat. Single into the covers"
"plays too early, and this slower ball, pitched at a fuller length and giving the batsman a lot less time gets the false shot. Pollard looks for a flick through midwicket, but the leading edge wanders through point"
"you were asking for him, and he has the ball in his hand and a jig to show off. DJ Bravo takes the skier with such ease and Tambe has a first-ball wicket. It was flat on off stump, Pollard stood and heaved it straight up. Could have done a lot better if he had moved his feet a bit more. Think he was reaching the ball a bit and it certainly did not take the middle. Bravo at long-off steadied himself, had loads to time to do so actually, and takes it so well"
"tossed up on leg stump, turned to deep midwicket"
nudges to midwicket
"some turn away from the right-hander, meriting the first slip in play, driven through the covers"
goes back and punches a 89kph shortish delivery on middle back at the bowler
some width on offer and Parthiv cuts it to deep point
"there's that rarest of rare deliveries. The one at full pace from Bravo. Short and wide, cut to backward point"
"that's the offcutter, just outside off, Rayudu picked it and runs it to deep third man"
"overpitched on leg stump, whipped away towards the deep square leg boundary. That had some heat! Kulkarni only had to move a few yards, but he needed the dive to stop the four"
"walks at the bowler, who pulls his length back and the pace too. Nudged through midwicket"
"131 kph, not quite short enough for the cut shot. But Rayudu is seduced by the width. Play and miss"
"that's the dipping slower ball on middle, Rayudu manages to push it to long-on"
"flighted on leg stump, Rayudu tries to get it past short fine leg, but fails"
"slog sweep, and it flies away. It was length and that helps the batsman out. The turn too may have worked against Tambe. Ends up allowing Rayudu the room he needed"
worked away to the right of long-on for a couple
that's the skidder one on middle and off - at 93 kph - Rayudu goes back and blocks
"length ball on leg stump, pushed to long-on"
"just didn't happen for Parthiv tonight. He walks off, sweating half his body weight. Loads of effort into that innings, and yet he only has 34 off 29. Falls to a shortish ball on off stump, when his pull shot does not have the requisite power to clear deep midwicket"
stays back against a flatter delivery and punches it through the covers
pushes a flatter delivery outside off back at the bowler
leans forward and opens the face against a good length ball. Finds point though
"loops it up on middle, defended. That was noticeably slower"
"and out comes the dart this time, off a round-armed action, at 97 kph. Runs it to short third man"
"goes back and pats a flatter delivery to the right of point, who is alert enough to stop the single"
"shortish and outside off, slapped to the sweeper on the off side"
"back of a length and outside off, pushed towards mid-off"
"shortish and outside off, pulled to deep square leg"
opens the face and runs a shortish delivery down to third man.
"no pace to work with, and with the slower ball angled too far outside off, Rayudu was left reaching so far away from his body. Hits the bottom of his bat as he lofts it over cover"
slid off the open face to deep point
"that's his specialty! And its unplayable more often than not. it's one thing to recognise the offcutter, but when it dips so sharply on the batsman.... Bhajji was moving across looking to flick, but it dies on him and he is struck on the pad"
"banged in short and outside off, passes harmlessly by"
that's at top pace and Bhajji likes it. Clears his front leg and looks to smack it through the covers. But he gets it off the toe of the bat and has to settle for a boundary through third man
"he is so good against pace. Just stays still and lets his hands take over. This was a fuller ball outside off, drilled to the left of long-off"
"so what happens you take away Bhajji's strength? This. Without the pace to work with, he doesn't look half as strong as the striker he can be. Bravo has understood that immediately and bowls an offcutter. It's back of a length to draw a big swing across the line. Thick edge settles in the keeper's gloves"
"slower ball wanders down leg, Krunal plays a flick and misses"
"oops, the back of the hand slower ball sails over waist high outside off! Actually, it was nearly up around the batsman's chest. But it wasn't straight and Rayudu could just let it go and take the free hit next ball"
"short and wide outside off, Rayudu pulls it to the right of long-on"
"back of a length on middle, nudged to deep midwicket and even with Krunal losing his bat, they are quick enough to beat bravo's throw"
"slower short ball angled into him, Rayudu gets under it and pulls to deep square leg"
well played! That's a fine way to get his first runs. Faulkner was bowling around the wicket and allowed the batsman only the slightest room. Krunal still makes use of it with a delicate late cut past the keeper.
"back over the wicket for the slower short ball, Krunal stays back and bashes it down the ground"
"telegraphed his intentions - to pull the ball over fine leg - by moving way outside off stump. So Faulkner goes straight, beats Rayudu and topples the stumps. Very few of Mumbai's batsmen have got their big shots going tonight, and yet they haven't bothered to change their game."
"shortish on leg stump, worked away to deep midwicket"
"fuller ball outside off, eased to deep point. Funny seeing Sixer Southee play the ball so gently"
"slower ball just outside off, Southee dabs it to the left of long-off looking for another second run. But the throw comes in and hits the stumps direct. He's safe."
beaten for pace - that's all of Bravo's pace by the way - and Southee gets a top edge as he goes for a pull shot. Lands safely
full and fast and down leg. Krunal swipes and misses
"ooooh, that was ever so close to being caught. It was the offcutter on leg stump, Krunal swings free, gets a thick inside edge and though the man dived to his right, short fine leg could not get near it."
"goes for the slog over midwicket, but gets a thick inside edge and travels far straighter. Long-on tries to stop the second, but can't"
"there it is! It's in the second tier at the Wankhede! Back of a length on off stump, heaved away miles beyond long-on."
"looks for a wide yorker, lands it well enough, but Faulkner's overstepped. Managed to keep it out of Southee's reach. Can he do it again for the free-hit ball?"
"back of a length and on off stump, and Southee skewed straight up. Can't get out caught off a free hit, so the long-off fielder let it drop in front of him"
heaved away to deep midwicket
"slower ball wide outside off, Krunal smacks it down to long-off. Very little timing there"
"legcutter goes way wide of off stump. Southee leaves it to collect the extra, and the keeper gets a bad bounce. Misfields, so there's another run on offer"
"big heave ho from Krunal, and the fuller ball outside off takes a thick outside edge and scurries away to the third man boundary"
"that's the slower yorker on middle, Krunal blocks down the pitch and looks for a single. But he has to hurry back because Faulkner departs  from his followthrough, dives to his left and takes a shy at the stumps"
"138 kph, goes for the blockhole just outside off. Doesn't quite hit it, which is why Southee is able to lace a drive to long-off"
"slower ball on middle, whipped to square leg and Krunal completes the run with his head thrown back. If he had beaten that man, it could have been a four"
"short, slow and outside off, Southee just about catches the trick. Looks for the slap over the covers. Ends up with an outside edge that sails over short third man"
in the slot and Southee smashes it down the ground. That's his second six in the space of two overs and Mumbai have got a score they would fancy defending
"that's a special effort! First in the slower ball to make Southee look incompetent. It was more a legcutter and it was pitched back of a length. Southee thought it was in the slot to slog, but without the pace on it, he has to adjust his bat swing. Tries to block, easily beaten. They go for a bye, DK throws it to Bravo, who takes aim at the bowler's end and throws the stumps down"
"what an effort from Akshdeep Nath at deep square leg! This was going for six, but he throws his left hand back and drags the ball to plop back inside the field. And while he was doing all this, he was off his feet as well. Spectacular effort. Similarly from Krunal to pick up the slower ball as he slogged it high"
"superb delivery first up, curls away after pitching on middle around back of a length, Finch looks to work that to leg but is beaten comprehensively by the movement"
"Finch gets in line with this one, short of length and on off stump, solid contact from Finch as he sends that away towards the midwicket boundary"
"Finch comes down the track, and is a bit early in the shot, the ball hits high on the bat and loops towards midwicket, Buttler dives forward but <b>fails to keep hold of the catch</b>"
"Southee greets his former national captain with a sharp bouncer, McCullum wants to hook that away for a boundary, but he misses"
"full ball this time from Southee, firmly driven off the front foot towards cover, can't beat Harbhajan Singh there though"
"a touch short from Southee, outside off as well, McCullum spots it early and sends it flying into the stands beyond midwicket, Southee conceded plenty in the first over though he didn't do too much wrong"
"length ball around off, defended towards point by Finch"
"length ball that Finch wanted to power down the ground, mistimes it and the ball rolls towards mid-on, a quick single is taken"
"is that out? the umpires want to see the replay, it was a full toss on the stumps, McCullum backs away and thumps that towards backward point, straight at Hardik Pandya who takes a low catch, or does he? the soft signal is out, looks like it is taken cleanly, Pandya seems to have got his hands under it. Yup, third umpire confirms it"
and is met with a very full ball just outside off. Blocked
"he was moving across outside off, so the wide call was perhaps a touch harsh. The length was predictable against Raina. Short and getting up around his chest. Pull, missed"
"moves across on off stump, nudges a shortish delivery away through square leg"
"appeal from that man at leg gully, but this seemed like it had bounced. Third umpire called into play. It was a near yorker on middle, actually replays show it was a low full toss and Raina's flick went to ground straight away before going to Buttler"
"that was brutal! Telling the bowler I don't want you pitching up, because you are getting some swing. A straight drive with only power in mind"
"so the fast bowler immediately shortens his length. Finch is back in his crease, using the extra time it gives him, to block it. Thought of a run, but Southee gets across in quick time and has a shy at the stumps"
"dabbed to point, and again Southee's been warded off bowling that full length after that four early on"
"low full toss on leg stump, whipped to long-on"
"pushes him back with a shortish delivery at 137 kph, Raina defends"
"an in-between length pulls a false shot. Not quite full, nor completely short either. Raina takes too long to decide and his up-off-the-ground flick shot does not connect. The ball lobs off the thigh pad towards point"
"starts with a slower ball, and the lack of pace masks a poor start. Finch was looking to take advantage of the line being way outside leg with a gentle little glance, but with no pace on the ball, he barely gets enough on it to reach short fine leg"
"132 kph, he seemed to load the pull shot up, but then changes his mind and leaves the shortish ball outside off. Good decision considering he would have been dragging the ball across"
that's his area! Anything pitched up makes his eyes light up and McClenaghan made his day by tagging it with width as well. Sliced away over point
"backs away looking to play through the off side, but McClenaghan keeps him quiet with a back of a length ball on middle"
"he is expecting the ball to arrive a lot quicker than it is. This was a leading edge, which falls short of point. Looked to take one from outside off and nudges it to midwicket"
"that's gorgeous! He does play some excellent drives, and this was on the up too. McClenaghan tried to follow his movement outside leg, but offers a length that he can play off he front foot."
was that the offcutter? Tucked to short midwicket
"shortish, but not enough width to make the best use of the cut shot. Finch finds the fielder rushing in from point"
"threads the gap at cover! Spectacular hitting from Finch, especially because he had jumped outside leg very early and Southee had followed him. The bowler wanted the yorker, ended up overpitching it and the batsman cashes in with an open face"
pushed down to mid-on
"drifts outside leg and is defeated by the short ball. Ample pace, ample bounce and Raina is beaten by both"
spears in a low full toss on leg stump - presumably looked for the yorker there - Raina manages to jam his bat down and get a single to midwicket
"on middle, from around the stumps, clipped through to deep midwicket"
"fired in on middle and leg, at 104 kph, Finch finds a single towards midwicket"
"sweeeeet! He made a little shimmy away from the stumps, gets under a flatter delivery on leg stump and lifts those arms through the line of the ball. Fine shot!"
"101 kph, bowled fuller and quicker at Raina moving outside leg. Closes the face as he looks for runs through midwicket, leading edge to cover"
"99 kph, fired in at Finch moving down leg, pushed to mid-on"
jumped outside leg so Krunal fires in a 112 kph wide yorker and keeps it to a dot. That brings us to a time out.
"136 kph, beaten outside off. That's a decent start. Hits his usual back of a length, Raina moves across and opens the face, misses"
"135 kph, the jump away towards the off side helps him take a shortish delivery on off stump to deep square leg"
"drifts down leg, would have been a good ball for the left-hander, but Finch can't reach it with his flick"
"hit rather high on the pad, but Pandya does bellow an appeal out. Finch was playing across the line, looking to flick one away from off stump. Gets off strike to think about that shot ."
pulls from outside off and he is able to do so by shuffling away to off stump and getting in line with a shortish ball angled away from him
pushed to long-on off the back foot
"129 kph, thumped down the ground. Raina is a very sweet striker of the ball when he has the chance to drive, whether it is along the ground or through the air. Hardik hopes to prevent his India team-mate getting the room he was looking for by stepping outside leg, but his length was still ripe to be lofted"
stays back to a shortish delivery just a shade outside off and punches back at the bowler
"doesn't turn, and Finch was hoping it would when he leaped away outside leg. Frantic flay of the bat throws up an outside edge that rushes to the third man boundary"
"beauty! Stayed put in his crease, with a clear plan in mind. Waits on the shortish delivery, then plants the open face on it. Lovely little late cut"
"flatter delivery at 96 kph, pushed down the pitch"
"backs away outside off, Bhajji bowls a skidder outside off at 92 kph, cut away to deep point"
"tries to pierce the gap between point and short third man, but Raina's slice is hunted down by a diving Hardik"
"slower short ball outside off, Raina has spotted it and short-arm pulls it through midwicket"
"slanted into the right-hander from around the stumps, picked away to long leg"
"141 kph. Pace and bounce. Raina had looked very good when he has had the chance to push on the front foot. So McClenaghan bangs it short on and around off stump. The pull shot shouldn't have been Raina's go to. If anything, he should have tried to ramp it. In swinging across the line, he gets a top edge and Parthiv runs a long way to his left and takes the catch at short third man"
"137 kph, short ball outside off, pulled to deep midwicket"
"fullish and outside off from around the stumps, eased to backward point"
"back of a length and outside off, guided to backward point"
some turn as Krunal hits a good length on off stump. Finch is wary as he drops it into the covers and sets off
"pushed through on off stump, tucked through midwicket. Krunal set off after it himself, looks pretty good as an athlete"
"zips through at 104 kph, goes on with the arm as Finch tries to flick it away. Hits his pad before he could connect. Leg bye to short fine leg"
backs away and slices a shortish ball through to deep point. Bad throw from Buttler allows an easy second run
nudged through midwicket
"tapped to deep square leg, and with Bhajji there on the boundary, it is an easy two"
"comes down the track and belts the ball back at the bowler. Hardik gets down in time to stop it passing him, and Finch was immediately interested in a single Came down, before Karthik even realised there was a chance. Makes a move from the batting crease when a fielder at point runs in picks up the ball and dives headlong into the stumps. Rohit was the man, but DK had put his bat back"
"slower ball on off stump, Karthik goes for a drill into the covers and it nearly carries to the man there"
"goes for a booming drive down the ground and misses the line of the ball completely. That ball did straighten though, just a bit off the deck"
banged in short and way wide outside off. Karthik lets it pass
"139 kph, he's good with those shots. His back leg wandered outside off, got into a crouch and scoops the ball over the short fine leg fielder"
skips down the track and whips a length ball from outside off to long-on
"shortish on off stump, eased to backward point"
"he's got one! And Krunal is celebrating even wilder than his brother! Races to Harbhajan who took the catch at long leg roaring and jumping and revelling in his success. Poor DK, he nailed the sweep and he may well have been thinking that would go for six. But Bhajji moved to his left and leapt up just in time to grab the ball over his head. Top catch!"
"tossed up just outside off, Bravo defends to the left of the bowler and Krunal throws himself after the ball and fields it himself. Great work again"
stays back to a flatter delivery and punches it to point with a flourish
whipped down to long-on with the angle of the left-arm spinner bowling from around the stumps
flatter delivery fired at the batsman's pads. Hits the target before the bat can interfere. Single to square leg
stays back and drills a shortish delivery on off stump to long-on
pins him on the backfoot as Bravo plays a defensive push. Was nervous about the ball straightening there
"he was back to take a wicket, and does so in double-quick time! Bravo is surprised by the short ball, but he is walking back ever so forlorn. He does not think he has nicked this. It was a short ball, a pacy one too, just outside off. Bravo was set up to pull it, then decided to ramp it. Having lost his balance playing two different shots to the same ball, he is floored on the pitch and reacted quite strongly when the finger came up. The ball seemed to deviate as it passed the open face of the bat. Posthumous swing fools the ump because <b>there wasn't a nick</b>"
"fuller ball outside off, heaved over the covers. No holding back from the India Under-19 vice-captain"
whipped away to deep midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, slid to deep third man"
fired into the batsman's pads and Nath's flick shot is not there in time
"103kph, flighted on off stump, pushed to short cover"
tucks it towards midwicket to secure the single. Finch has played a very controlled innings here. He knows he needs to last the full 20 overs for Lions
"width outside off, lashed to deep point"
stays back and punches a flatter delivery back at the bowler
"fired in on middle, Finch drives it back at Krunal"
"good length ball, very flat and very quick, Finch directs it through to the sweeper on the off side"
"takes the pace off, but keeps his line right. Finch defends on off stump and when the bowler can't get his left hand to it, there is a single on offer"
"goes short and a wide of off stump, Nath ramps it to deep third man"
"backs away, Southee follows him, bowling full and quick. Drilled down to long-on"
"twack! Nath was coming down the track, Southee bowls a bouncer, Nath reacts instinctively and pulls the ball to the midwicket boundary"
"another short ball having seen the batsman coming down the track, Nath tries to sway away from it and ramp it over the keeper. That would have been four too had he got anything on it"
"full and on the pads, whipped away to deep square leg. Krunal did well to make good ground on his left, but the throw doesn't have enough power behind it. Could have been a run-out chance."
"these non-turners are besting Finch. He had jumped way outside leg, and ends up having to move back in line with the ball. A panic-striken cut shot takes the outside edge, but third man was fine"
""
"tossed up outside off, knowing perfectly well that the youngster will go leg side. And Nath does, dragging the ball and losing all his power for a single to long-on"
"yorker outside off, sliced to backward point"
"Pollard! First sign of him in the field and it's a blockbuster effort. This was all set to crash into the boundary at long-off, until a blue blur leaps out and stops it. Powerful drive from Finch, but only two"
second bad ball of the over and this one puts all the fielders out of the picture. Beefy hit over midwicket
"the slower ball does it! Nath had cleared his front leg and was looking for the swipe again. McClenaghan, bowling from around the wicket and digging it in short, made sure the batsman had to drag it from over his left shoulder. So the top edge results and ends up as an easy catch at mid-on. Hardik takes it and goes bonkers with his celebrations again"
"hands in head as McClenaghan delivers a fuller ball on the pads, deflects off them past the keeper. Finch was looking for a leg glance, he'll take these nonetheless"
"slower short ball at 125 kph, pulled to deep midwicket"
"fuller ball outside off, Faulkner glides it to deep third man"
"yes it was. Offcutter, but it is pitched short and allows the batsman the time needed to pick it up. Finch plays a late cut and finds the gap between point and third man. Third fifty in a row, and this is when the pressure was right up there"
comes down the track and picks it away through midwicket
"low full toss just outside off, Faulkner was lunging forward, but mistimes the drive to short cover"
"looks for the yorker on off stump, Faulkner stays beside it and scythes it to deep cover"
"low full toss on off stump, skewed along the ground to long-on and then asks for a new pair of gloves"
"big full toss, and its a no-ball too. Rohit shakes his head in disbelief. Faulkner pushes it into the covers. But now he has a chance to do a lot more."
"wide yorker, good ploy from Bumrah. He suspected Faulkner would want to stay outside leg and made him reach. Faulkner's tall enough to do so and gets a thick edge through point and short third man"
"length ball outside off, Faulkner lashes it to the sweeper cover"
"back of a length slower ball, patted over the bowler with the sole intention of picking up a couple. Lions have handled the end-overs pressure ever so well, because they have had Finch leading them."
"shortish and outside off, Faulkner had the chance to slash it through point. Shortish slower ball, ripe for the shot.  Cannot connect"
"that's gone! The change of pace works again! The horns are out in full force at the Wankhede! I can't imagine how the umpire heard the nick, but he did. It was shortish from around the stumps, Faulkner backed away for a late cut and feathers it through"
"that's at his full pace, and its short and tailing into the right-hander too. Praveen was backing away to cut it through point. Beaten. twp dots, and a wicket. What an over!"
"make that two wickets and two dots! McClenaghan is making sure no one is missing Malinga. It's another shortish delivery angled into the tailender, Praveen was backing away and trying to slide it off the open face. Parthiv, who was moving down leg suddenly has to change direction, dives to his right and takes a stunner with both hands"
is that another? Kulkarni looks awkward as he tries to flick the ball. It's too quick for him and he nearly lobs a catch to the on-rushing Pollard at mid-on
"he can't run. His hamstring's a problem. Patted a short ball to point and was just jogging through, happy to be out if Bhajji can hit it from point. He doesn't"
"looks for the yorker on leg stump, Finch drags it to deep midwicket and drags his injured body across for a second run as well. Great work from Rayudu the fielder there"
"goes for the lap sweep, but he has hit it off the inside edge and the ball barely wanders past the left of short fine leg. Has the match been sealed there? Finch is off strike"
"smashed over extra cover! What a shot under pressure. He stayed stock still and reacted to the ball, a tad overpitched outside off. Top stuff!"
"low full toss on off stump, pushed to long-on for a single"
they've taken a second. Dhawal was running to the danger end and he makes it safely. Great work again. This was a low full toss and Finch drilled it to long-off. Pollard with the throw can't get him out
"short ball outside off, pulled away to the deep midwicket boundary and Finch raises his bat and his helmet and salutes the crowd! That ball fit his strength, big powerful man getting the opportunity to pull with all his might. Probably not the best ball to finish up. Excellent innings from Finch, lasting the entire 20 overs and handling the pressure of the tightest game of this IPL season"
