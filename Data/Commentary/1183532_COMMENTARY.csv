"length well outside off, left alone"
"swing and a miss! wobbling on a full length on a fifth stump line, tempted him into driving. But he doesn't connect"
"some movement for CdG, who's keeping his line well outside off and coming in"
"<b>run out chance missed at the striker's end</b>. Grandhomme has been getting some movement, and this one came back in more sharply. Head patted it towards point and set off for a non-existent run. Was almost halfway down when Nicholls swooped in from gully. Had time to aim at the stumps but missed. They take the overthrow"
"length on the stumps, defended on the front foot"
"length outside off, left alone"
"back of a length but well outside leg. Head tries to pull it off his hips, but it's too far down leg and he misses. Not the most advisable shot to play perhaps"
"fuller, swinging across him, clipped off his toes to midwicket"
"banged in short, going across him, he sways out of the way"
short ball but down leg again and this time Head just stays still and watches it go to the keeper
"back of a length, on target, he hops on the back foot and defends it to the bowler's right with a straight bat"
"banged in short, on target, but short enough that he can duck under it in time"
gets some swing into the right-hander but strays on the pads and is picked off through midwicket
"nice line outside off, and moving away, left alone"
"sticks to a full length on a fifth stump line, swinging away. Left alone"
"ooh, that was much closer to off stump and Paine left it again. Hits it on the seam and gets good carry as Watling collects in front of his face"
"back to a full length outside off, left alone"
"fuller and closer to off stump, defended to cover"
"<b>dismissed</b>. Short outside off, and Head gets into position early, going on the back foot and smoking a pull that forces Aleem Dar at square leg to jump out of the way"
"short again but cramping him for room this time on leg stump, and Head tries to move inside the line to pull but can't connect"
"back of a length just outside leg again. Tries to move inside the line to flick again, but misses again"
"length on the stumps this time, moves back and across to defend it towards extra cover"
"fuller and swinging across him, bowled it slower. Head deals with it reasonably well, digs out a drive towards mid-on"
"back to the short ball outside leg line, and Head has a swing at it, but doesn't connect with the pull"
"big appeal but New Zealand won't review. Southee indicates from slip that height might have been in issue. Length ball, pitched on off and nipped in a touch to defeat his attempted nurdle to strike him on the knee roll. Replays show it would have gone over the stumps"
"fuller outside off, stroked to extra cover"
"bit of wobble again, into the right-hander this time. it's very full though and he clips it gently to mid-on"
"full and well outside off, left well alone"
"length ball outside off, Paine's not interested in getting bat near it"
"shape away from the batsman, but well outside off and left alone again"
"floated up, but drifts on the pads and Head spots it early to sweep it fine and raise <b>his fifty</b>. Good knock, despite a few moments of lapses in concentration. But he had to see off some penetrative bowling"

"length ball well outside off, left alone"
"length ball on a sixth stump line, he's not going anywhere near it"
"fuller outside off, driven firmly but straight to cover"
"sharp movement into him! He's been bowling on a fifth and sixth stump line and Head is comfortable leaving those, but this is slightly closer and comes in very sharply. He's left it alone but it bounced over the stumps"
full and wide outside off and Head reaches for it and makes good connection with the cut. Valiant effort by deep point to dive and try to save the boundary is unsuccessful
"back of a length and closer to off, he defends on the back foot towards mid-off"
"and Paine's had enough of leaving balls, this one is wide outside off and in the slot, he goes on the front foot to smear a cover drive that bisects the field and finds the boundary"
"tossed up outside off again, inviting the drive. Too full though and Paine gets some nice meat on the cover drive, but can't beat the in-field"
"tossed up outside off, he takes a few steps forward and drives, but cover dives to his right to field"
"length outside off, pushed back to the bowler"
"floated up on a length, gently clipped to mid-on. He's alive to the possibility of a single and they take a quick run"
"length ball drawing him forward, but he doesn't quite get to the pitch and a thick edge rolls towards gully"
"<b>driven straight to cover!</b> Head is going to be disappointed with that shot. Southee had been testing his patience with the wide line outside off. This one was similar and Head couldn't rein his shot in, went for the drive, but it wasn't quite a half-volley and he didn't keep it along the ground, ends up getting it on the bottom half of the bat and driving straight to the man stationed there, possibly just for that shot."
"full ball on off, driven to mid-off confidently"
"full, shaping away from him, he gets on the front foot to defend outside off. Gets a thickish edge that rolls to gully"
"length ball on off, was a bit late in going on the back foot, ends up jabbing it to gully"
"full on off, shaping into him this time, driven back to the bowler but not timed well."
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"<b>big appeal and New Zealand have opted to review</b>. Went with the arm but might have just struck him outside the line? He was pushing forward in defence but playing for the turn when there wasn't any. No inside edge. <b>And impact is in fact outside</b>, so New Zealand have lost a review. That skidded onto him and Paine played down the wrong line."
"tossed up outside off, fuller one, steered to point"
"full and strays down leg, flicked to deep square leg"
"good length, drawing him forward. Takes a big stride out to defend this outside off"
"drawing him on the front foot to defend, but Cummins gets nicely to the pitch of this and steers it to point"
shortens his length a bit and Cummins goes deep in his crease and pushes it to short extra cover
"tight line outside off, but he can leave it confidently enough because it's not coming back in and is bouncing over the stumps"
"fuller on off, defended to the bowler's left"
too full outside off and stroked nicely between point and cover. Nice timing from Paine and he'll get three for that
"fuller around off, defended solidly into the offside with a big stride out"
"digs it in short, good surprise ball. Cummins spots it and ducks safely under"
"<b>big appeal for caught behind</b> but the umpire is unmoved. There was a definite noise there, but perhaps it was ball flicking pad. Southee bowled the off-cutter that time and it snuck through between bat and pad. <b>great decision by the umpire</b> because that missed the bat and clipped his thigh pad on the way to Watling."
"good line and length, makes the batsman lunge forward to defend."
"given some air outside off, defended on the front foot into the offside"
"gets this straighter, but the batsman is equal to it, defending down the pitch"
"pulls the length back a bit, and he goes deep in his crease to cut this to point"
"tossed up very invitingly outside off, that hung in the air for a long while and allowed the batsman to line it up nicely and smear it through cover"
another one dangled outside off and Cummins gets to the pitch with a stride and opens the face to drive through cover
"given some air, good line and length outside off. He stretches forward to defend"
"tossed up on middle, Paine clips to mid-on on the front foot, and sets off for a run. Cummins is very late to respond but he ends up diving in to just about make it in safely"
"<b>beauty!</b>. Tossed up, dips on him, has him coming forward to defend, grips and spins past the bat"
"fuller outside off, driven through point"
"tossed up, too full ends up as a full toss, he can't slap it through the gap, but they get a single to extra cover"
"tossed up on the stumps again, comes on the front foot to smother it"
"124kph, short ball outside off, he leans back and drops the hands to let it pass"

<strong>play and miss</strong> at a wide leg break that spins sharply away
"tossed up high, a half volley, he drives hard to cover"
"another wide half volley, he square drives to deep cover-point"
"<strong>Bowled him around his legs! Raval has a wicket in Tests! Brilliant piece of bowling.</strong> Great reward. This was drifting down leg, Cummins went down to sweep fine but didn't cover the line, it got under the bat, pitched outside leg, turned and hit leg stump! Shane Warne would have been happy with that"
"length ball, nice turn, but he goes deep in his crease and works it to fine leg"
"nicely tossed up outside off, but he comes on the front foot and slaps it past cover"
"drags it down a little short, and Paine goes back to punch this but can't beat cover"
"<b>does that count as a drop?</b>. Too close to cut even though Paine was going back and across, and he gets an edge that goes past the keeper and to first slip's left. But Taylor there, was going to his right. In fact, it brushed Watling's glove on the way too, but that was too quick for the keeper to catch"

"drifts on the pads, and rolls off the pad to leg slip"
"fuller outside off, goes to drive and gets a thick inside edge that goes to square leg"

"quicker one, skidded on into him, but Paine got his bat down in time to jam it towards point"

"short and wide outside off, chopped to deep cover"
"flat on a length outside off, worked to midwicket"
"<b>another one</b>. This was almost a lazy shot. Went forward and reached for the ball, his long reach means he gets to it and lifts it over mid-on's left and into the boundary"
"length ball down leg, easily tucked to fine leg"
"length ball angling into him, pushed back to the bowler's left"
"tempts him with a fullish one wide outside off, but Starc makes good connection, stroking a drive through cover"
"<b>lovely shot</b>. Not too short and not too wide outside off, but Paine is in position early and cuts it backward of point"
"a bit fuller and closer to off, coming in with the angle. Paine lets it go, covering the angle, knowing that it will bounce well over the stumps"

"good length on the fourth stump, makes Starc lunge out to defend"
"length ball outside off, he goes on the back foot and cuts it through cover"
"tossed up on the stumps, driven off the inside half of the bat to mid-on. Paine wants a run, but Starc sends him back."
"fuller angling into him, driven gently to mid-off and this time the quick single is on, and they take it"
<b>smoked</b>. This was on the cards. Starc gets one in his slot and launches into a lofted on-drive that goes all the way over long-on
punched on the front foot into the offside
bangs it in short and forces Starc to evade it at the last moment as it whistles past his helmet
"length ball, wide outside off, he goes for the drive, but doesn't connect well, and the ball rolls to mid-off"
"short of a length and into him, Starc goes well back and defends solidly to point"
"<b>dropped by Raval at mid-on</b>. Not a dolly of a chance, but a catchable one. Full outside off, and Starc goes for the drive again. Doesn't get underneath the ball enough and hits it to mid-on. Raval has to move forward and to his right, but gets low enough to gather the ball with two hands. Can't hold on."
"beaten. Length ball outside off in the channel and he tries to cut, but misses."
"length ball outside off, watchfully lets it go"
"full outside off, bowled it slower I think, and Paine had to adjust and stroke his off-drive. Paine has been taking some risky singles to that area and sets off again. Williamson moves to his right and lets loose a throw that just misses the stumps. Paine would have been gone if he had hit. <b>run out chance missed</b>"
"short ball outside off, lets it go"
"high full toss, almost waist height, and Starc is perhaps caught off guard. Drives it back to the bowler. Has a brief look at the square leg umpire too"
"short outside off again, Starc plays it beside his body and steers it down, but second slip fields"
"another full toss, lower this time. Slapped it back with a horizontal bat, but Wagner got a hand up and blocked the ball"
"yorker singing into him, gets an edge onto pad as he flicks it to fine leg."
"length ball angling across him, ends up well outside off and he's not letting his bat come anywhere near that"
"fuller length on leg stump, misses the flick and is struck on the pads. Wagner appeals but that probably pitched outside leg"
puts his back into it and bowls a bouncer that flies over him. So far that it's a wide. Starc is a tall man but he didn't even have to bend
"fuller outside off, he goes for the big drive, but splices it off the outside edge. Swirls into no-man's land beyond wide mid-off"
"angled across, ends up on the fifth stump, Starc wants to feel bat on ball so he goes for the drive but gets it off the inside half, back to the bowler"
"that one is angled too far across and Starc isn't going to reach that far, lets it go"
"<b>superbly caught by Williamson running back at mid-off</b>. Starc's adventurousness finally results in his downfall, not before a valuable contribution though. Length ball outside off, he swiped at it without moving his feet, it goes up high off the toe end, and Williamson keeps eyes on the ball while running back and holds on."
"full on off stump, almost a yorker, defended back to the bowler"
"swinging into him again, slower ball yorker. Lyon defends comfortably."
"there it is, banged in short but Lyon was looking for it too, swivels back and pulls through square for a boundary. Not timed perfectly, but got the placement spot on"
"<b>Lyon's taking on Wagner's short ball!</b>. Another one banged in towards his ribcage, he moves inside the line and pulls it fine"
"quicker one that's full and angling across him, outside off. He goes for the drive, but misses"
"<b>third time lucky for Wagner</b>. It's been an eventful over and it's ended with a wicket. The best short ball of the over perhaps, because it climbed into him and denied room to free his arms for the pull. Lyon had decided he's going to go for it, and does so again. Not so well controlled and picked out fine leg this time."
"<b>beauty</b>. Length ball, lifts off a length and moves away, whistles past the outside edge. Nothing Paine could have done about taht"
"<b>and he's caught down the legside</b>. Southee and Wagner have four each. He bowled this short and down legside, Paine went to pull but got a glove only. Watling tumbles to his left and gathers the ball."

"141kph, shorter length, angled in, he lets it go and it cannoned into his thigh pad at speed"
"142kph, back of a length, into the hip, he is cramped but tucks it behind square awkwardly for a single off the inside edge"
"142kph, back of a length, shaping away, beats the edge as he plays inside the line off the back foot. Paine took it above his head"
"<strong>caught and bowled!</strong> Leading edge just popped back to Starc! 144kph, back of a length angled into leg, it held in the surface, climbed and straightened, he closed the face of the bat trying to work through the leg side, it popped off the shoulder of the bat and looped back to Starc who took it casually in his follow through"
"145kph, angled down leg, he tries to glance, <strong>a loud appeal from Paine but no one else</strong>, given not out. No review and no interest from the bowler"

"138kph, pushed wide of off, sixth stump line, some shape back but wide enough to leave"
"136kph, good length, fifth stump line, he leaves decisively again"
"<strong>Bowled him! 140kph inswinger straight through the gate!</strong> Full and swinging down the line of leg stump, he tries whip through forward square, leaves a gaping hole between bat and pad, it brushes the front pad and then crashes into middle and leg stump! Way too good. He tried to play too square"
"140kph, good length, hint of shape on fourth stump, he defends pressing forward off the sticker of the bat"
"136kph, good length, fourth stump, hint of shape again it catches the shoulder of the bat and squirts to point"

"145kph, good length inswinger, this climbs off a length, comes off the sticker of the bat as he hands are low defending"
"144kph, bouncer, <strong>pins him on the shoulder</strong> as he tried to ride it! He got his hands down though despite the stinger"
"<strong>is he run out?! Cummins unbelievable at mid on!</strong> He is safe, just. It was full and swinging, he clipped it beautifully off his pads to wide mid on and took off, Cummins made the diving save, Taylor was stranded, Cummins threw at the striker's as he scrambled back, Warner backed up the missed throw and flicked it back on the stumps but Taylor was back"
"back of a length, nipping in at it takes him on the thigh pad"
"137kph, good length, top of off, he defends from the crease watchfully"
"133kph,  <strong>inside edge off the back foot past off stump!</strong> It runs away for four! Back of a length wide of off, he tried to punch off the back foot, it nipped back and a thick edge gleans four!"

"145kph, back of a length on leg, he's back and working this off the hip to forward square"
"141kph, brute into the ribs, he fends taking his eyes off it, it comes off the gloves and flies safely to fine leg"
"143kph, good length, swinging in, hits high on the thigh pad. The Aussies appeal it was going way over the top"
"145kph, full and shaping back into middle, he defends working this to square leg"
"143kph, short ball, he ducks late and it <strong>just</strong> misses his helmet and Paine leaps full stretch above his head to take it! Goodness that flew"
"138kph <strong>beaten</strong> on the inside edge. Back of a length outside off, it nips back between bat and pad as he defends on the back foot"
"138kph, an <strong>edge runs safely wide of gully!</strong> Another good length ball, nipping away, he defends away from his body and the thick edge runs wide along the ground"
"hit high on the pad, an appeal, not out, and there's no review. Back of a length, nipping in, catches him high on the pad it was going over"
"140kph, short ball, <strong>he doesn't see it and fends off the glove</strong>, it was into the arm pit but it flies safely to fine leg again"
"142kph, back of a length on off, he's back and defending with soft hands"

"140kph, back of a length wider of off, he's back and late cutting with control, bouncing it over backward point for three"
"143kph full and wide, <strong>he leans into a beautiful square drive.</strong> Class shot. Well controlled. He hasn't looked comfortable but that's how good he is. He can still cash in on the bad ball"

"pushed through wide of off, he leaves"
advances <strong>and thumps it flat and just wide of a diving mid off!</strong> What a shot. Skipped out and thumped it flat against the turn. But the substitute Neser wasn't far away with the dive! It rocketed to the fence
"flatter on off, he defends"
down the track again and slicing this inside out over mid off! It was well over him this time. Didn't nail it but got enough of it
"he's back and <strong>late cutting just past slip!</strong> He kept it down, he got a little close to it as it turned back but controlled it past slip and it ran away"
"length ball in the channel, but Williamson is just masterful at this. Waits on it, plays it later than anyone else, just opens the face of the bat and finds the backward point boundary. So few people who could have hit that ball for four"

"length on off, defended with an angled bat towards point"
"back of a length around off, Williamson hops across and keeps it down"

"fuller coming into him again, clipped to square leg"
"angling across him from around the wicket. Length ball, chopped towards cover"
"fuller, there for the drive and he executes it well. A diving cover gets a hand to it to slow it down bu they get a single"

"too far down leg and beats Paine too, so they get a bye"
"tossed up, but he meets it with a confident stride and picks it off through midwicket"
"back of a length in the channel, he lets it go. Paine cops it on the tip of the gloves and that's hurt him."
<b>sumptuous</b>. Full outside off and he leans into the cover drive oh so easily
"<b>ripper</b>. Even Williamson can't do anything about that. Swung in, pitched on a length and straightened. Misses the outside edge by millimetres"
"length outside off, left alone"
"length on the stumps, stays in his crease and tucks it to square leg"
another lovely drive. Low full toss outside off and he punch-drives through extra cover. Wade's haring after it and pulls it back in before the boundary
"length on off, turning in, gets behind it and punches to the bowler's right"
"length ball, turning sharply into him, pats it down to backward short leg"
"length again, but straighter this time so Taylor can go back and tuck it past the man close in"

"fuller, dipping on him outside off, defended with a straight bat on the front foot"
"good length again, dipping down, he comes on the front foot and clips to mid-on, without quite getting to the pitch of the ball"
"length ball angling across, lets it go through in the channel"
"fuller and slightly closer to off stump, but he knows where his off stump is and can leave comfortably"
"oooh nice one. Short ball and very close to the batsman, forced him to attempt to play at it, but Williamson dropped his wrists in time after first rising to meet the ball and allowed it to go past him"
"fuller on the stumps, defended towards gully"

"length on off, defended"
"quicker one darted across him, pitches and holds its line, Williamson gets a healthy edge while trying to steer it, and finds four to third man."
"oooh, he just wore that ball on the thigh pad. Back of a length and Taylor seemed like he read it late, or lost it, and ended up staying still in his crease. Tried to play a flick very late, by then the ball thudded into thigh pad and rolled off"
"length ball, pushes at it in front of his body a bit but with soft hands in the direction of cover and they take a quick single"
"<b>beauty</b> Pitches on a length and nips across, just enough to snake past the outside edge. Williamson keeps bat close to body and plays late, which means it didn't take the edge."
"<b>Smith takes a blinder at second slip</b>. Quick ball by Starc, on a length and moving away and it draws a poke and an edge from Williamson. It was flying at pace but Smith went airborne and was horizontal to his right at full stretch while plucking the ball out of the air."

"fuller on off, lunges out and blocks the ball"
"back of a length on the stumps, goes up on his toes to pat it down"
"almost a yorker on off stump, but not quite, which means he can off-drive this fluently past mid-off"
"length ball on the stumps, tucked through midwicket"
"superb bouncer, well on target, equally well played by arching well out of the way to let it pass through, and dropping wrists at the same time too"
"length ball on the pads, turned to square leg"
"good length outside off, and it just takes off after landing. Paine collects it well over his head."
"back of a length, nipping into him but ends up on the legs. Taylor thought it would rise higher but it stayed near the thigh pad, and he adjusted well, slapping a pull to keep it down"
"<b>direct hit at the striker's end</b> but Taylor might have made it in time. He had put in the dive, so was well in when the ball hit. This was a length ball, tucked to square leg and they hared across for a quick single"
"fuller outside off, comes on the front foot and opens the bat face to run it through backward point"
back of a length and that one bounced a fair bit. Taylor was on the back foot and had to get his bat up a bit higher than anticipated to jab it down
"<b>through him</b>. He was probably expecting a short one due to the leg gully having come in, but instead Cummins bluffed him with a length ball seaming in that went between bat and body"
"fuller on the stumps, pushes it to point's right by opening the bat face"
"back of a length, outside leg stump, he tries to flick it, but misses, it's a little too far down leg"
"that hung in the air! through backward short leg. Back of a length tucking him up, and he tried to keep it down but it was in a vacant area. Also raises <b>fifty</b> for Taylor. He's gutsed it out against some quality bowling"
"fuller on the stumps, nudged to midwicket with a half-prod forward"
"tailing into him late, strikes pad and goes to short leg. He was trying to flick it, but missed"
"short ball, but on the fifth stump line this time so it's easier for Nicholls to sway out of the way"
"<b>zips past the outside edge</b>. Good length and moving away from Nicholls, who's bat is drawn towards the ball. Labuschagne at short leg is appealing vociferously for it, he thinks he's heard something. But replays show there was no edge"
"length ball, jags back in off the seam and hits him on the kneeroll and rolls into the offside"
"good length on off, gets behind it and defends to the bowler's right"
"length on off, defended into the offside"
"short, and he saw it early, went to pull but didn't get it off the meat of the bat, goes to short fine leg off the bottom half of the bat"
"good length, nipping into him, he moves inside the tucks it through square leg"
"good length angling across him, but he's confident enough to shoulder arms to it"
"too short and doesn't really rise up, allows the batsman to stay beside the ball and cut it through cover-point"
"full, hint of shaping away, he stays in his crease and defends solidly"
"length ball straying down leg, flicked off the pads to fine leg's right"
"strays down leg again and this time Nicholls times it even better while flicking it off his pads, but good work by Cummins running to his right at fine leg, sliding and stopping the ball cleanly"
"<b>caught down the legside!</b>. Starc was looking for that line, gave up a few runs off the last two balls, but this one was a bit straighter and Nicholls thought he was getting some more free runs, but he didn't make proper connection with the flick. Gets a thin touch that a gleeful Paine holds on to. Third wicket for Starc"
"<b>castled him first ball!</b> Full swinging delivery that is too good for a nightwatchman. Might have been too good for a main batsman too. Swung in late, landed at his feet and snuck through to break the stumps. He was a bit late in bringing down his bat I suppose but that was just a great ball to a lower order batsman."
"swinging into him, almost yorker length again but slightly down leg. Taylor is well set and he flicks it off his toes"
"length ball in the channel, shoulders arms"
"zips through on a length, jagging in, but that is a good, confident leave"
"yorker on off stump, digs it out to mid-on"
"length ball on off, calmly defended on the front foot"
"full length on the sixth stump, and he lets it go"
"length ball going across him on the fourth stump, Taylor slashes it into the ground and towards cover-point"
"back of a length and rises up outside off, but Taylor stays beside it, rises with it, and punches crisply through cover"
"short ball, but he takes him on, pulls him front of his helmet. Keeps it down though, and to fine leg"
"full length outside off, carries after pitching and Paine collects at chest height"
"quick and straight and full, but Watling gets solidly behind it and defends it back"
too far outside off and easily left alone
"fuller on off, pushed to mid-on"
"<b>edged wide of second slip</b>. good length in the channel, he was trying to steer it more square, but it takes the edge and goes in the gap between second slip and gully"
"on the fifth stump and on a length, similar to the last ball, but he leaves it alone this time"
slips in the bouncer but he saw it coming and ducked safely under
"swinging in late into the batsman, who gets a thick inside edge onto pad while going forward to push at the ball"
"too full and Taylor meets it with a firm push that beats mid-on and finds the boundary, giving New Zealand a bit of cheer at the end."
"that low backlift comes in handy as Starc fires it up to the base of middle stump. Neat little flick from Watling, but the substitute Neser stops it diving to his right at mid-on"
leans forward - guess the feet move quite nicely soon after a double-hundred - and eases a full and wide delivery through point
"<b>up at the splice of the bat</b>! Taylor has to get off his feet to get on top of a very sharp short ball a shade outside off stump. Manages to block it in the end, but short leg and leg gully are waiting."
attacks the body again and Taylor works it off his hips to short leg
"tries a flick, off the thigh pad and down to the keeper. Starc's revving it up to the 140 kph range and he's definitely looking to trap Taylor down the leg side"
"145kph, short and sliding down again, far enough that Taylor doesn't even have to dream about a shot"
"very straight and very full again to Watling, who nudges it to midwicket"
"<b>half an appeal for lbw</b> and it's a lovely ball for it too. Might have been a nick though. Yep, HotSpot confirms it. Terrific stuff from Cummins though, hitting a fullish length on off stump and getting the pink ball to nip in off the seam. Watling brings down a straight bat but it's slightly outside the line of the ball because of its movement."
"134 kph, presses forward and defends the fuller delivery on middle"
nice and tight on the stumps again. Watling knows he needs to play and he does that well too - straight bat.
"back of a length and outside off - a bit of variation, to see if Watling might go chasing, no such luck, not that kinda player."
"in the off-stump corridor, perhaps just a tad shortish though. Watling has time to see it and block behind point"
digs it in and it soars over the ducking Taylor
"it was only a matter of time before he was gonna take it on and here he goes for the pull. The short ball, rising up towards his chest, <b>zips past his gloves</b> through to the keeper"
"another bouncer, but Starc slings it way down leg."
"oooh, that's not the ball to his field, but there <b>could still have been a run-out</b> and the Lyon-Paine partnership bungles it! All of it starts with a simple back of a length ball outside off when Starc has his field for the pull and the fend away. Taylor exploits it with a punch through cover and Lyon goes chasing after it. Watling completes the first, then looks up, wondering if there's a second, Taylor commits from the other end, then stops, which leaves Watling way out of his crease. He really was a gonner but the throw comes on the bounce, too close to Paine who is running up to the stumps, and he can't gather it on the half-volley"
"full and outside off, drives sweetly through cover point"
bangs it in and it goes down leg. Taylor has zero interest in it
"back of a length and outside off, Watling lets it come on nicely and bunts it by his feet"
<b>beautiful straight drive</b>. He had a life early when he went on to make a double-century. And here he is again allowing a very full ball to come onto him nicely and drills it down the ground past mid-on's left
"bouncer, typical quickie's reply. Watling knows it. He gets under it"
<b>cuts in off the pitch and nearly takes out off stump</b>! Watling sees the ball well outside off stump and thinks he's perfectly happy to leave it. But there's a puff of dust as Cummins puts everything behind it
"good length on off stump, pushes it safely to cover"
prevents a middle-stump seeking missile from its target
"sees an escape past the leg-side strangler as Taylor whips a ball off his knees towards the fine leg boundary, but leg gully dives to his right just in time"
"<b>lovely batting</b>. Australia have committed to this bang it in plan, and they do have the bowlers for it. But has the ball itself gone too soft for it to succeed? Taylor hasn't so far been rushed facing the short ball and here he just waits for it, taps it into the vacant area to the right of the bowler and skips along for a single"
<b>sweet timing on the off drive</b>. And all he does is present a straight face after judging the length and line right. Simple stuff
"full and straight again, Watling keeps it out, no trouble"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks it"
"<b>huge noise</b> as he goes chasing after a wide one, but it's <b>bat hitting the ground</b>. Starc always has this thing, his left-arm angle and his sheer pace makes even the very good batsman suffer blips in concentration and play waaaaay away from the body"
"full, straight, clips the pad and it runs away down towards the fine leg boundary"
"<b>ooooh, that's a snorter</b>! Cummins, who has so far almost exclusively bowled full and looked for bowled and lbw against Watling, rips one in and it rears up at the nose. Watling sees the danger and sways out of the way"
"<b>softened him up</b>! Or that's what everyone says anyway when a batsman is bowled after facing a short ball. Watling is slow in getting forward here. He has the right idea, the ball did need to be played. But Cummins has cranked it up. A 142 kph length ball kicks just a bit higher than he thinks it will, comes at him just a bit faster than he is ready for and it thuds into the bat even as he is still getting into the shot and ricochets onto the stumps. Spectacular bowling from Cummins. Just pure effort. Pure pain-barrier breaking effort"
bouncer first up at 142 kph and he gets under it.
"good length, outside off, taps it in front of point"
carves it through cover. He loves it full and he shows just why. Crisp drive through the gap
"<b>falls short of second slip</b> and it's Smith lurking there! Australia keep coming hard at the batsmen. The short ball angled across de Grandhomme surprises him. He looks to guide it behind point, but it bounces way more than he expects. Eventually adjusts to the problem and is still lucky the nick doesn't carry to the fielder"
<B>another bouncer</b> and Taylor is terribly late on the hook shot
"makes it rise up to Taylor's chest again, but this time Taylor is able to get up along with it and blunt it safely past silly point's left"
"<b>nails the pull shot</b>. It helps when they come up to just around the waist. Taylor climbs all over it, rolling his wrist and placing it between long leg and deep square leg"
"looks to pull against the angle and the banged in ball zips past his right shoulder, across him, beating him"
another pull shot and the 145 kph short ball lobs over to deep square leg
gets out of the way of another sharp short ball angled into the body
gets up off his toes to knock down the back of a length ball on off stump to short leg
"another bouncer but this is off target, down leg, and Taylor can easily get away"
"bangs in it. Ducks under. Rise, rinse..."
takes on the short ball and smacks it to deep square leg. Firmly hit pull shot but there's protection
"it's pinched up! A ball has been PITCHED UP! And de Grandhomme has hammered it down the ground. Of course, he is on the back foot, and it's his hands and his instincts that drive him into the shot, but boy has he timed it well. Screams away to the right of mid-off"
even the legspinner starts short! And Taylor rocks back to pull it hard to the right of deep midwicket
loops it up outside off and Taylor lashes it to deep point
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"tosses it up but de Grandhomme is happy to play it along the ground, refusing to pick up the bait and instead taking a single behind point"
waits for the legbreak to turn and then swats it on top of the bounce. Taylor does all this looking for a boundary but his late cut is stopped by backward point
another cut shot and as good as he is with it - here he makes room for it - he can't beat the field
"weeeeelll, it wasn't full. De Grandhomme has time to rock back and punch down towards a deepish mid-on"
"<B>through the gate</b>! Taylor's lucky not to be bowled here! Massive turn on the offbreak and its just about the perfect one, tossed up, drifting away from the right-hander, daring him to cover drive against the turn. Taylor goes for it and then heaves a sigh of relief"
"flighted delivery on off stump, defends"
"again teases him to play away from his body, Taylor gets sucked in again, and this time the ball doesn't turn, just kicks up past the top edge and beats him going straight on"
"delves into the sweep shot, but it deflects off Wade at short leg and goes over to midwicket"
shifts back to a good length ball outside off - and this one doesn't turn either. Blocked safely enough
"full toss outside off, spears it through cover"
"good length, outside off, leaves it alone"
"too short and too wide, Taylor has the right idea with the cut shot, but he can't reach it"
"short, quick and straight and Taylor, as much as he wants to attack it, has to stick to defence"
"full and outside off, drives to cover"
"shortish and outside off, he mis-hits the cut to point"
"goes back to block, but he ends up with an outside edge that slides past first slip. Lyon isn't getting as much spin as the batsmen fear and he's preying on that"
"tosses it up on off stump, de Grandhomme tries to whip it down the ground with the turn, no luck"
nudges it through midwicket
<b>there's another one off the outside edge</b>. All of this is the result of his changes of pace. The quick ones go straight on. He still gives them a good rip though and thanks to that big turning offbreak earlier in his spell both Taylor and de Grandhomme are playing for spin. Single to third man after the batsman hurries into a block while being stuck in the crease
"slower through the air this time and as a result it dips before de Grandhomme can reach it on middle stump, grips the pitch and then kicks up almost to the batsman's face"
""
"good length, outside off, no interest"
"loops it up on off stump, Taylor drives to deep point"
another sweet square drive with Labuschagne tossing it up wide outside off
"short and outside off, chops it to backward point"
"full on off stump, he hits to short cover"
slices a full and wide delivery out to the sweeper
"loads up the sweep again, but the ball is a bit too far in front of him for that shot and he can't quite reach there in time."
"<b>beats the outside edge</b> as he presses forward, lured in by the slower pace and the better flight."
shimmies out to slap a tossed up delivery to cover - or through it and he thinks he almost has until the fielder dives to his right and prevents a single. Head even hits the stumps direct
"full on off stump, Taylor keeps it out."
"full and outside off, defends"
"<b>everybody saw it coming</b>. And it's all because of that one ball in his first over. That one giant monster of an offbreak that sneaked through bat and pad and nearly bowled Taylor has created demons. He doesn't know how much Lyon is turning the ball and as a result he's often been playing inside the line of the ball. Here too, a tossed up delivery, all tempting like, draws Taylor towards it. He tries to block it out but the ball dips, turns only just, juuuust enough to take the outside edge and land safely in Smith's hands. Masterful stuff from Lyon."
"139kph, back of a length on off, he stands up and defends from the crease"
"137kph, shorter length rising outside off, he defends off the gloves into the off side"
<strong>magnificent pull shot!</strong> Chest high short ball and made it look pedestrian. He stood tall and thumped it with ease over midwicket. It made a pure sound off the bat
"141kph, back of a length but some width, <strong>he punches off the back foot behind point!</strong> Back to back from CdG. Had a lot of time there too"
"142kph, bouncer over leg, he just gets inside the line to let it go"
"<strong>caught at second slip!</strong> Everyone waited for Aleem Dar. He took an age to give it. Then did. Then de Grandhomme reviewed after discussing with Santner. Was this off the helmet rather than glove? It was a brute of a bouncer straight at his face, he thrust the gloves up in hope. Did it touch the glove onto helmet and then to Smith at second? Nothing on hot spot. RTS seems inconclusive. It definitely came flush off the helmet. But there's no conclusive evidence for Marias Erasmus to overturn Aleem Dar's onfield decision. So it stays out!"

"back of a length, outside off, he's back and pushing back to the bowler"

"<strong>prod and miss</strong> at a 124kph, delivery that wobbled away wide of off. He was playing for inswing. No foot movement."
"126kph, good length, inswinger on off, he's back and defending"
"123kph, shaping into leg, he glances this off his pads to fine leg"
"126kph, good length, wide of off, hint of shape away but he leaves"
"125kph, good length, wide of off, he leaves this alone"
"wide of the crease, 125kph, angled into off, he pushes firmly to mid on"
gets across his stumps and tucks the back of a length ball on middle through midwicket
"is drawn into playing away from his body, but with the lack of pace, he is able to adjust and roll his wrists on the cut shot, keeping it down to gully"
"again, those hands push away, following the back of a length ball outside off stump. Blocks it to cover"
thaaaat's better. Spots the ball being pitched short and outside off and doesn't think about playing at all
that time he does need to play with de Grandhomme hitting an off-stump line. It's still short though - which is weird for de Grandhomme - and Burns blocks it
"hits a better length this time, fuller and outside off, Burns lets it go"
well judged leave again. That over got progressively better from both batsman and bowler. Burns lets a good length ball outside off go and then gets some glove love from his partner
around the wicket to Warner who ignores a good length ball way outside off stump
"<b>plenty of swing</b> into the left-hander, but it is early to spot and Warner is good enough to adjust, playing with a straight bat to mid-off"
"pitches it up, looking for the top of off stump, Warner stands in between that unholy yet glorious union"
"a touch overpitched, and it is very neatly dealt with. Warner can hit the ball brutally hard but here he knows he just has to hit the gap - which is between the bowler and mid-off for this half-volley"
"adjusts his length, hitting the shorter area of the pitch, and Warner nudges it to midwicket off the back foot"
back over the wicket now and a good length ball is let go outside off
<b>onto him quickly</b>. Burns is forced back and the ball hits the splice of his bat as he blocks in front of middle stump
"full and outside off, he drives to cover"
ignores the good length ball outside off
"plugs away in that off-stump corridor, Burns is showing good patience"
"leans into the cover drive, the front foot towards the line of the ball outside off and the middle of the bat being pinged"
"<b>nearly plays on</b>! Not sure Burns is supposed to be forward to this, but it's CdG, so he lunges and is surprised by a little bit of kick off the pitch. The ball goes knockabout, hitting inside edge, then the ground and nearly bounces up onto the stumps"
flicks off the pad down to fine leg
""
"full and outside off, with a hint of away swing, Burns doesn't care for it"
"goes wide of the crease for a pitched up ball on off stump, Burns drives to cover"
"angles it into the right-hander, looking for lbw, and Burns is careful to keep his front pad away and present the straight face. New Zealand aren't rolling over here"
opens the face as he tries to steer a shortish delivery outside off to third man. Gully is in the way of that grand plan
"<b>beats the edge</b>! CdG is getting some help off this pitch! He's hitting it hard and getting extra bounce, certainly more than either of these Aussie batsmen are giving him credit for as Warner goes for a cut and misses"
"fuller ball, outside off, no shot"
goes back and blocks a shortish delivery on off stump
"<b>he's past Bradman</b>! Test match run number 6997, and it's a simple little dab towards point and some quick running to boot"
"full on off stump, defends"
"good length, outside off, bat plays no part in this play"
"full and outside off, Warner lets it go"
shifts back to push the shortish delivery to cover
"good length, too wide, no need to play"
<b>and now 7000 Test runs</b> with a juicy half-volley outside off that is sent screaming away behind point
"shifts back around the wicket and immediately hits a better area, the ball full on middle and nibbling off the pitch as well. Warner is careful to bring his front pad back so he doesn't play around it while presenting a straight bat"
"<b>nearly an edge</b>! He shouldn't be playing at those, but the angle draws him to lunge at a ball well outside off and the nip away off the pitch leaves him hanging. Warner's angry with himself for that. Tame, nothing sort of shot"
"and he's kept on zero still, a very good ball, on middle and off stump, shaping away from the right-hander. Burns blocks"
"back of a length on off stump, nudges it to midwicket"
"squeezes it through the gap past the right of cover. Doesn't entirely time it, his bat is pushing in front of his body and the away swing from CdG gets the outside edge"
lunges out to meet a ball outside off and slides it down to gully
"he's reaching again - and his hands are gripping that bat hard as well, partly why he's early into the shot - and and inside edge results off a full ball outside off"
"good length, on and around off stump, defends"
"<b>good leave</b>. Southee continues to hit the deck and get a little movement. Warner covers the line as he waits for the ball and finally when he judges it to be outside off, he sticks the bat up high into the sky"
"full on off stump, gets firmly forward to block"
"the teaser this time. Pitched up and wide outside off. Go on then. have a drive, I dare you. Warner doesn't. He knows Australia are in the box seat and he's not gonna let anything diminish that advantage"
"<b>cuts him in half</b> and <b>might have stayed low too</b>. Variation brought about by a cross-seam delivery and those aren't good signs for batsmen prepping for the second innings. Warner is entirely surprised by the pitch's shenanigans, having to hurry into his defensive stroke and realising the length ball angled into him sneaks under his bat"
"good length on off stump, defends"
"<b>spears it in, looking for lbw</b>. Warner is falling over as he plays the flick, there's that much effort behind this ball from Southee. Big inside edge saves the batsman"
nudges a length ball off his pads to long leg
"sets his mind to leave the short ball angling across him, but then as soon as it goes past, he practices the upper cut"
"tempts Warner to think about the upper cut again, but he's staying patient"
"good length ball on and around off stump, Warner covers it well and lets it go to the keeper"
"nips into the left-hander, but it starts on his pads so allows Warner to pick it away to the fine leg boundary"
"<b>ooooh, de Grandhomme may have BOUNCED Warner out</b>. Wouldn't that be something. New Zealand have reviewed it. So what have we got here? First off, it is the surprise of the summer. CdG has a mean bouncer. It keeps climbing on the left-hander. He is well off his feet as he tries to catch up with the ball. <b>Replays indicate that there may not be any contact with bat or glove</b>. Definitely some shoulder though, which deflects the ball to Southee at second slip. The HotSpot cameras again can't track a ball which is going that high but Snicko does not show any spikes as ball passes glove. So Erasmus says stick with the on-field call. Pretty much exactly the same thing happened when de Grandhomme himself was ruled out, only that time umpire Dar had given it out. Adding to all this, soon as NZ started celebrating, Warner seemed to be walking off. But maybe he was just switching off and walking to square leg to regroup"
starts with a half-volley outside off and Burns smears it through the covers. Good shot
gets some cut back into the right-hander but Burns is able to get behind it
"good length, outside off, hits a crack and rolls through to the keeper"
"fullish on off stump, defends well"

leans into the drive and finds mid-off
stays in his crease to deal with a length ball coming in for his middle and leg stump
"full and wide outside off, no shot"
"goes for the short ball again, but it doesn't get up at all. Warner's set up for the pull but the ball zips underneath the bat and draws out a wry smile"
waits on the shortish delivery outside off and places it between cover and point for a quick single
"good length and outside off, lets it go"
"full on middle, Warner protects his stumps stoutly"
he is definitely getting a tinge of inswing to Warner. And the left-hander is definitely wary of that. The bat never goes too far from his body as he keeps defending and keeps it straight
turns a fuller delivery on leg stump to midwicket
chops a back of a length outside off to cover
"looks for a yorker, doesn't quite get it right, Warner is away with a flick to long leg"
full and outside off from around the wicket. Burns defends
looks for the cut - and there's plenty of room for it - just that the ball doesn't bounce high enough and he under-edges it down by his own feet
"full and outside off, he defends"
"thinks about defending a good length ball outside off but then realising he doesn't need to, he doesn't"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"full and outside off, defends"
pushes to mid-on
"full and angled into him from around the wicket, Burns is partly falling over as he flicks the ball away to deep midwicket"
"back of a length and outside off, blocks"
"<b>direct hit would have had Warner</b>! He has only one stump to aim at, and he's only a few inches from nailing it. Bad shot from Burns - reaching well away from his body - bad call too - he doesn't expect Santner to be that quick to cut the angle and Warner had basically given up"
"full and outside off, defends"
"<b>ripper</b>. Wagner goes to his trademark barrage, a ball that is dug in and rising steeply up to the nose of the batsman. Warner sways out of the way and as he springs back upright he leans over and looks straight at Wagner, his mouth in the shape of an 'O'"
"another short ball outside off, Warner gets out of the way again"
"a hat-trick of bouncers to end the over, Warner drops his wrists and then again practices the upper cut."

"127kph, back of a length, angled into off, he defends from the crease to mid on"
"125kph, over-pitched and he plays a <strong>lovely square drive getting it behind point!</strong> He waited nicely on this and played it later, placing it past the man"
"125kph, good length fourth stump, he defends off the inside edge from the crease and it runs square"
"very full and tailing in late, it hits the pad but it's outside the line of leg"
"127kph, over-pitched again, <strong>and again he slices a square drive wide of gully!</strong> This wasn't as wide, he went inside out, but it wasn't intended to go that fine. It came off a thick edge. Still went along the ground"

"125kph, back of a length, shaping back to off, he's back and defending"
"123kph, good length wider of off, he leaves"
"<strong>huge lbw appeal</strong> but not out is the call. No review. It was just outside the line. Great delivery. This hooped back late, trapped him on the crease but it hit his back leg well outside the line and it wasn't even hitting according to Hawkeye"
"129kph, good length, back of a length, he's back and defending"
"123kph, fuller and wider, he mistimes a drive back to the bowler"
"<strong>caught at mid off!</strong> A mistake from Warner. This was a length ball and he tried to pull, it got big on him and hurried him, he spooned it off the splice and it floated to mid on with Blundell coming in to take the catch. Warner lost control of the bat after he hit it, such was the surprise"
wide half-volley and <strong>he cracks this through the vacant point!</strong> Lovely shot. it was a long volley but he put it away. Far more conviction than his previous two boundaries
"shorter length, climbing, he rides the bounce, getting up and knocking it down"
"125kph, good length wide of off, he leaves and it <strong>shoots low through to Watling</strong>. That stayed down"
"130kph, shorter length wide of off, he's back and playing away from his body, knocking it to gully"
"132kph, shorter again, wide of off, he gets over the bounce and glides it awkwardly to gully"
"short ball outside off, it didn't bounce and he didn't see it! It missed his hands and his head as it flew wide of him. He did drop the hands late"

"123kph, full length again, hint of shape, he mistimes a drive to mid off"
"<strong>dropped by de Grandhomme running back from square leg!</strong> Short ball, got big on him, he took on the pull, spooned a top edge forward of square, de Grandhomme got to it but spilled it running with the flight. He would have expected to catch that despite moving at full speed"

"flatter and straighter again, he's back and staying leg side to punch to cover"
"fired in, 83kph, on off, he's back exposing the stumps but defending"

"drifting into leg, it takes on the pad but was sliding well down"

"80kph, good length, he's back and tucking this towards midwicket and they run one"
"120kph full away swinger, he plays a textbook check drive to mid off"
"<strong>An lbw shout!</strong> Not out the call. New Zealand <strong>review</strong>. Good length outside off, shaping away and then nipping back. He did not offer a shot. It just brushed the pad. Ball tracking had it missing off by a ball width. New Zealand lose their second review"

"117kph, chest high short ball, he rolls the wrists on a pull shot hitting it to the sweeper"

"full on off stump, keeps it out"
"<b>oooh, close!</b>. Labuschagne hangs back, waiting to manipulate the ball perhaps into the legside again, but this one skids through quicker off the pitch and nearly topples him. The man in form, of course, is able to bring a straight bat down in time"

"full on off stump, Burns is forward with a block"
"full and outside off, drives to cover"
"digs it in and Labuschagne thinks about going after it, but it's just way too high"

"full on off stump, excellently defended"
"<b>finds the gap between gully and second slip</b>. And the audacious thing he is he was actually looking for it. He let the back of a length ball go past him before planting the angled face down on it, making sure the ball went down to ground straight away"
"full and outside off, defends"
"he's been fancying Santner. He's been fancying everyone! Last over there was the glide through the cordon, here there's the more imperious, steps out of his crease and boof over extra cover. Absolutely flipping brilliant. <b>Goes past 1000 runs in 2019</B>"
"allows the quicker, flatter delivery to come down and then calmly sends it scurrying to deep square leg"

"full and outside off, eases it through to the sweeper"
turns a fuller ball on middle to short midwicket
"<b>leading edge</b> as Labuschagne continues to do that thing where he takes balls around off stump and tries to dump them at midwicket. This one though straightens enough, and kicks up as well, to draw a false shot"

another wise leave alone from Labuschagne
opens the face and slices a back of a length ball down to third man
goes for the bouncer and Labuschagne bends his knees and sways out of the way
"<b>ouch</b>. A throw at the bowler's end, umpire Dar is getting out of the way, Santner's trying to back up the throw, and they both collide. Dar is down, the problem is the knee. Both the NZ and Australia physios are tending to him but he does look in a lot of pain. In case anyone's wondering, Labuschange defended a good length ball down the pitch and Burns thought the ball had gone wide enough of the bowler for a single. Nope. Southee's there and Burns needs a big dive in the end"
pulls a bouncer from outside off away to deep midwicket

"that's a slower ball, he digs this one into the middle of the pitch too, but because it's the variation, it doesn't bounce as much and Burns has to change from a horizontal bat shot to a vertical bat block"
"continues with his bouncer plan, but that one's too high says umpire Llong"
"looks for the yorker on middle, he works it to midwicket"
