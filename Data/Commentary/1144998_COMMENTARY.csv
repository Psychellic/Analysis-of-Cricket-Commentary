"starts off by drifting onto the left-hander's legs, tucked away to fine leg for one"
"Here's some inswing to the right-handed Finch. Nice length, and he's pinned to the crease, playing across his front pad, but it's swinging down leg as well as hitting too high - around the top of his thigh - and the ball rolls into the point region enabling a leg-bye"
"back of a length outside off, poked away into the point region"
"back of a length, swerving away mildly in the corridor, gets on the back foot and defends, playing besides the line rather than behind it"
"once again, back of a length in the corridor. Dabbed to backward point with soft hands"
"fuller now, swinging away from a middle and off line. Jabs down uncertainly without really getting forward, and gets a thick inside edge down to fine leg"
length ball slanting away into the fifth-stump channel. Left alone
"fullish, on the pads, and that's clipped away neatly to the left of square leg and it runs away quickly to the short square boundary"
"fullish, slanting away from off stump. Nice stride forward, waits on it, and guides it down to third man"
"length ball, finds some inswing to beat the inside edge of Finch's flick and hit him on the pad. Muted appeal - he knew it was sliding down leg"
"lovely length, inviting the cover drive but not quite pitched right up for it. Flashes hard at it with an angled bat and he's lucky not to have edged it"
"nice length again, a little closer to off stump. Left alone"
"back of a length, misses his line and ends up drifting marginally down leg. Carey misses the tuck off his hip and the umpire signals wide"
"again the line starts from outside leg stump. Looks to flick and can't connect, the front pad comes in the way"
"this one is slanted a long way across and pitched nice and full. Chases away from his body, goes for the angled-bat drive, and fails to connect"
"angled across again, pitching on about off stump and continuing to leave the batsman. This time Carey shoulders arms"
"back of a length, finishing on around off stump, gets nicely behind it to defend it back towards the bowler"
"length ball pitching on off and slanting further away, left alone"
"fullish, angling across to off stump, defended off the front foot to mid-on"
"length ball, finishing on top of off, hits high on the inside half of the bat as Finch defends half-forward, towards midwicket"
"fullish on off stump, picks up a single with a checked drive to the left of mid-off"

"length ball close to off stump, punched towards mid-off"
"back of a length on off stump, defended with an open face towards backward point"
"back of a length on middle stump, tucked away quietly into the square leg region"

"back of a length on middle and leg, worked away into the backward square leg region"
"length ball outside off, fifth-stump line, left alone"

"length ball slanting a long way across, left alone"
"full on off stump, driven to short extra-cover"
"good stop by Karthik at short extra-cover. Good length, a tiny bit of width, and Carey drives firmly on the up. Karthik dives to his left and parries it away"
"back of a length on off stump, punched back to the bowler"

"length ball homing in on the top of off stump. Finch brings his bat down nice and straight, full face showing, to block it back to the bowler"
"bowled him! Not the greatest shot Aaron Finch has played. This one's full, and Bhuvneshwar gets it to swing back in late. Finch goes for the big booming hit over mid-on, and only manages an inside-edge into his stumps. That shot was a result of all the pressure Bhuvneshwar and Shami have created with their lines to Finch. They've given him nothing in his areas today"
"fullish, angling into a fourth-stump line. Steered towards third man with an open face"
"back of a length, pitching outside leg. Looks to flick and misses, and is hit on the pad"
"nice length, pitching on off and continuing to angle away, and Carey's response is even better. The moment of weight transfer onto the front foot is just perfect, and he basically just meets it with the full face of his bat to send it racing between mid-off and extra-cover"
"and Shami responds with a perfectly directed bouncer. This is great bowling from the two quicks. Angling across, and Carey looks to hook - he has to work against the angle, and meet the ball in front of his back shoulder. Can't get on top of it, and only manages to balloon it in the air towards midwicket, where Dhawan takes a couple of steps forward and pouches it safely"
"bouncer first up, rising steeply over middle and leg, and Marsh has to jerk his front shoulder away from the line in a hurry"
"shortish, a bit of width, doesn't quite come on to the bat and Marsh has to check himself and chop it into the ground, towards backward point"
"fullish on middle and off, a tiny bit of swing away from Khawaja, who stays on the back foot and defends into the covers"
"nice length, slanting away from off stump. Khawaja is a little late getting on the front foot to drive, and Kohli throws himself to his left at gully to stop the thick edge from running away"
"back of a length, close to off stump, gets back and across to punch to cover point"
"length ball slanting across towards off stump, uses his wrists to whip it to the left of mid-on"

length ball pitching on off stump and continuing with the angle away. Left alone
"starts with a shortish ball at the hips, tucked away towards fine leg"
once again the line is leg-sidish. A little further down leg and Khawaja can't connect with the tuck off the hip
"on the pads again and Khawaja whips it away with a flourish, beats square leg to his left and there's no stopping it thereafter"
"back of a length, once again on leg stump, worked away to fine leg"
"and he gets his line right, angles this in towards the top of off stump. Marsh goes back and across to clip towards mid-on"
"full now, outside off, gets forward for a checked push to cover"
"fullish, angling into middle stump, clipped away wide of mid-on"

"back of a length outside off, sharp turn away from Marsh, who chooses to leave this alone"

"another flighted ball on leg stump, clipped gently towards square leg"
"slow, short, a bit of width, slapped to sweeper cover"
"ooh, that's pretty quick, 139kph. Back of a length and slanting away from off stump. Jabs away from his body and is beaten"
"back of a length on middle and leg, lets it come on and plays with soft hands to keep it down into the leg side"

"fullish, close to off stump, Khawaja plays a checked drive to mid-off"
"shortish again, fairly wide, slapped to sweeper cover"
"back of a length, wrong'un coming in towards off stump. Goes on the back foot and punches to long-off"
"ooh, that's lovely. So far Marsh has sat on the back foot comfortably and this time Kuldeep's flight draws him forward. Dips and spins away sharply to beat his outside edge as he looks to stab through the covers with an angled bat"
"back to that leg-stump line, worked into the leg side"
"full on middle and leg, clipped away through square leg"
"full on leg stump, whipped down the ground to long-on"

"back of a length on off stump, defended towards backward point"
back of a length on middle and off. Stays leg-side of the ball and runs it down to third man with an open face
"shortish on middle stump - it's not a long-hop, and it only gets up to stump height, but Khawaja's a damn good puller, gets across his stumps and puts it away, with his front leg up in the air and a lovely whip of his wrists to give it impetus, beats deep square leg throwing himself to his left"
down the pitch to the loopy off-stump ball. Meets it on the full and whips to deep midwicket
"nicely flighted on off stump, Khawaja gets forward and defends into the off side"
"back of a length, pitching on off stump and straightening away. Punched to sweeper cover"
flatter and quicker now. Fairly full but he plays the trajectory rather than the length. Goes back and across and defends it back to the bowler
"down the track again, drives it hard and mid-on dives right to keep it down to one"
"shortish googly, goes deep in his crease and pulls to deep midwicket"
"138kph, short into the rips, he swivels and rolls the wrists on a pull shot, hitting it hard to fine leg"

"140kph, short ball outside off, he pulls but doesn't time it, through square leg to the man in the deep"
"cut hard in the air over backward point! 137kph, short and wide and Marsh thrashes his hands at it, carving it over backward point and it flies to the fence."
"137kph, wide but a touch fuller, he's back and late cutting off the toe of the bat to third man"

"<strong>edged and it's dropped by Dhoni!</strong> It was shorter, he went back to cut, flashed hard, got a thickish edge, tough to handle, it bounces off Dhoni and ricochet's wide of slip! Hard to know if the edge was too much to react to"

It's sent upstairs</strong> He's OUT! it was pushed through outside off, he chops a cut to cover-point and runs, Jadeja swoops to his left, gathers one-handed, takes one step and fires with a rocket to the non-striker's and hits!

"full, fairly wide outside off with a tiny bit of outswing. Reaches out to stab towards extra-cover"

"back of a length close to off stump, punched firmly to extra-cover"
"drifts onto the pads and that's sensational timing from Stoinis, basically just let it come to him and clips it away when it's right under his eyes. Fine leg didn't have a lot of distance to cover to his left but it was past him before he could even react"

"back of a length, angling into off stump, goes back and across to tuck it away through square leg"

"tossed up outside off, stretches forward, waits, and dabs gently to the left of backward point"

"back of a length outside off, Stoinis shuffles across and out of his crease to get close to the ball and push into the covers. The fielder at short extra moves quickly to his left to cut off the single. Dhawan, I think"

"bam. Full and outside off and Stoinis smacks it back down the ground with the full face showing. A <b>half-chance</b> for Shami, had to stretch his left arm out to catch it at about chest height. Only got his fingertips to it, though"
"and he gets him next ball. Shortish outside off, doesn't climb as high as Stoinis expects as he goes for the pull. Only manages a bottom edge through to Dhoni"
Shami greets him with a bouncer rising over off stump. Ducks down low to get under it

"back of a length on middle and leg, worked away to the right of the diving square leg fielder"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to deep point"

"back of a length, close to off stump, punched to sweeper cover"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and dabs gently to the right of backward point"
"oh my, top edge, and four lucky runs for Maxwell. Digs it in short again, outside off, and Maxwell has to jump up to make any sort of contact with his attempted hook. The top edge loops over Dhoni and rolls down to the boundary"
"in the blockhole close to off stump, jabs down on it and squeezes it to the right of backward point"

"shortish, turning down leg, and Maxwell helps it away towards the fine leg boundary. Karthik chases it all the way from square leg to stop it near the boundary"
"floated up slow outside off, makes a bit of room and slashes it away nicely to the left of backward point. The sweeper on that boundary sprinted hard to his right and put in a sprawling drive, but to no avail"
"down the track and Kuldeep straightens his line, jabbed back to the bowler"
"and there's the hundred, lovely innings from Marsh, this, his seventh ODI hundred. Down the track, typically, to get there. Flighted ball outside off and he drives it to long-off to bring up the landmark"

"fullish on off stump, Maxwell plays a checked drive to extra-cover"
"once again, a touch short outside off, and Marsh slaps up his thousandth single to the off-side sweeper off Kuldeep"
"bam! That's marginally short on off stump, and Maxwell is back in a flash. Slowness of the pitch helps too, and the slowness of Kuldeep. Swivels powerfully through the hips to pull it away, high over the midwicket boundary"
"flatter, the flipper/slider out of the front of the hand, on middle and off. Maxwell gets forward and shows the full face to pick up a single to long-off"
"flights it now, outside off, and Marsh steps out and lofts it inside-out, easily clears the wide long-off boundary. Not the greatest over from Kuldeep, this"
"short outside off, slapped to deep point"
"short on off and middle, rocks back and pulls along the ground to the left of deep square leg"
"117kph, chest high slower, Maxwell is back and hammering a pull shot to the short square boundary!"
"140kph, length into leg, he went to flip this over the short square boundary as well, got a thick inside edge onto pad"
<strong>Given LBW!</strong> Maxwell <strong>reviews</strong>. Was this sliding down? It was fired into full and angling leg side. He tried to whip and was beaten for pace. Nothing on hot spot. Nothing on RTS. No bat involved. Ball tracking says missing leg stump! Not out. Good review from Maxwell
"139kph, full and wide, Maxwell backs away reaches out with one hand and slices this past backward point and away to the rope! What a shot!"
"139kph, low full toss, inside edge onto pad, it rolls past off stump to short third man"
"full toss wide of off, Marsh cracks a cover-drive, smoking it past the man in the circle to the rope! Easy pickings."
"138kph, full toss on off, he steps outside leg and lofts this up and over cover! Incredible hands to slice it into the gap! Deliberately done"
"127kph, slower ball, length outside off, he goes leg side again but <strong>misses</strong>. Maxwell yells at himself for missing that"
"122kph, slower ball, follows him down leg as he backs away, he glances in the air just short of short fine! They get one as the fielder knocks it down"
"length on leg, 131kph, and Marsh pumps this over the short boundary way back into the stands at square leg! A gift from Shami. Marsh says thank you!"
wide half-volley he cracks a square drive firmly to deep point
"136kph, thigh high full toss, he sits back and whips this with a flourish behind square"
"118kph, slower ball, right on the guideline outside off, Maxwell backs away but the umpire calls <strong>wide!</strong> Unlucky there. Not sure that was a wide"
"117kph, length slower ball, he carves it to deep cover-point, Maxwell calls two and takes on the throw and beats it easily!"
"wide yorker, well bowled, slides under the bat outside off"
"115kph, slower ball wide of off, Maxwell swings very hard and <strong>misses</strong>. Beautifully bowled. Deceived for pace"
"116kph, length slower ball wide of off, he toes a cut shot to cover, runs with the stroke a misfield on the circle means there's no run out chance"
"121kph, length ball in the slot, Marsh clears the right leg and heaves this way over deep square into the Members! Right in the hitting arc and he cashed in"
"136kph, full on middle, he drives back past the bowler, straight of long on and they get an easy two"
"wide half-volley, he carves this in the air towards the man at deep point and it's just short of him running in, they get two"
"<strong>dropped by Rohit Sharma at cover!</strong> Almost a freakish catch! It was crushed at cover, Rohit threw his right hand up above his head, it almost stuck, he had three bites at it but couldn't hold on!"
"full outside off, he lofts a cover-drive straight if the man in the deep"
"138kph, low full toss, he sits back and whips this through midwicket and the timing is good enough to beat wide long on running around!"
"141kph, bouncer, outside off, he tries to upper cut and misses, it's not called for height. Well bowled"
"full into middle and leg, he whips this out through midwicket to the sweeper"
"118kph, wide half-volley, outside the wide line, he jumps out and slaps it to cover. Would have been a wide if he'd let it go"
"135kph, yorker speared in at leg stump, he clips this out through square leg"
"<strong>caught at deep long off!</strong> Undone by a 119kph slower ball. It was a good length and wide, Maxwell tried to loft this over cover, but he dragged it to long off, DK stands 15 metres in off the rope and takes the catch easily"
"117kph, slower ball, angled wide off, he let it go thinking it might have been a wide but it was just inside the guideline. Well bowled"
"<strong>caught at long off!</strong> Bhuvi does it again with a slower ball! Good length slower ball outside off, Marsh lofts this towards long off but doesn't nail it, Jadeja, like DK, camps 15 metres in off the rope and takes the easy catch! Superb innings from Marsh ends with 13 balls remaining"
"136kph, full on off, he pushes this to cover and goes with the stroke"
"139kph, yorker on off, he clears the left leg and squeezes this out to cover"

"122kph, length slower ball over middle, he backs away, tries to play it as it grips off the surface but<strong> misses</strong> again"
"141kph, yorker on middle, he digs this out towards long on"
"<strong>Missed run out!</strong> 131kph, yorker, perfectly executed, he blocks it and runs, Shami gathers as Lyon runs into him, he looks up and throws at the striker's but misses by miles! Maybe stunned by the knock on the head from Lyon!"
"<strong>caught at deep point!</strong> Another length off cutter slower ball wide off, he reaches out and slices this high to deep backward point, Shikhar Dhawan waits under it and takes the catch comfortably."
"<strong>caught by Kohli on the run at deep backward point!</strong> 4 for 3! Great running catch! Another length slower ball outside off, Siddle slices a drive high to deep backward point, Kohli has to sprint off the rope to get there and he catches it at full stretch, running at top pace!"
"135kph, yorker, on off, he digs this out to midwicket for a single"
"135kph, full into middle, he turns this out through midwicket"
"brilliant flick over short fine! 116kph, length slower ball outside off, Lyon picks it, steps outside off and flicks this up and over short fine leg! Super shot"
"118kph, slower ball outside off, he stands and slogs this time but <strong>misses</strong>"
"<strong>launched over midwicket 20 rows back!</strong> Wow! Lyon gets him! Bhuvneshwar missed his spot, slower ball outside off, but it was the perfect hitting length, he stepped across and slogged this high over midwicket and got all of it!"
"fullish to start, just a hint of swing to straighten it towards middle stump, clipped towards midwicket, who dives right to stop it"
"some more swing, this time starts too straight and is definitely missing leg stump. Looks to flick and the ball beats his inside edge and thuds into pad"
"nice length, swerving into middle and leg. Watches it nicely, keeps his front pad out of the way, and clips gently to midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, Rohit leaves it alone. Threatened to come back in but eventually just kept going with the angle"
"fullish on off stump, transfers his weight forward into a checked drive to mid-off"
length ball slanting away into the fifth-stump channel. Left alone and Behrendorff begins with a maiden
"lovely ball to start with, on the fuller side of a good length and straightening back late into Dhawan's off and middle stumps. Keeps his front leg out of the way, brings down a straight bat, and picks up a single wide of mid-on to get off the mark in the series"
"back of a length outside off, defended into the point region"
"shortish outside off, only gets up to about hip high because it wasn't that short at all, but Rohit pounces on anything marginally in that region and he pulls it away nicely, into the gap between mid-on and midwicket"
length ball sliding down leg. Misses the flick and the ball tickles front pad on its way to the keeper
"short, wide, and Rohit presses half-forward and just extends his arms out to play a straight-bat punch to beat third man to his right. Made it look so easy"
"full now, in the sixth-stump channel with a bit of late outswing. Watches it well and leaves it alone"
"nicely bowled, beautiful length and late swing away from a fourth-stump line. Dhawan presses forward, watches it all the way, and leaves it, shaping to defend and pulling his bat inside the line at the last moment"
"full now, on middle and off, jams his bat down to squeeze it towards mid-on"
"length ball slanting into leg stump. No swing this time. Dhawan plays across the line, looking to flick, and inside-edges into his front pad"
"fullish and wide outside off, reaches out and slashes it away, to the right of backward point. Richardson chases around to his left from third man to make a good stop"
"back of a length on middle stump - keeps going with the angle rather than swinging back in as Rohit expected, and he's squared up a little and pops it off the outside half of the bat towards cover. Briefly in the air"
"back of a length, and once again the lack of inswing confounds Rohit. Squares him up again, on the back foot this time, and slides past his outside edge"
"full outside off, slanting across from over the wicket. Doesn't really time his drive, rolls out slowly to point"
"full, swings into the pads, and Dhawan whips it away beautifully. Places it perfectly too, beats square leg to his left and leaves fine leg with way too much distance to cover in the other direction"
"ooh, that's a little wild from Dhawan. Slants this across the stumps, again quite full, and Dhawan plays for the inswing and looks to hoick this over mid-on cross-batted. Ends up missing completely"
"length ball on middle and leg, tucked away to long leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"back of a length, swings away after starting fairly wide of off stump, straightforward leave for Rohit"
"back of a length, no swing, just ends up at Dhawan's front thigh pad and he helps it away to the fine leg boundary, past the diving keeper. Not sure if he got any bat on it, in fact"
"full this time, on off stump, ends up looking to hit it square, through cover point, playing for swing, and it doesn't swing. He's lucky to get a thick inside edge that rolls into the leg side"
"down the track now, Behrendorff pulls his length back slightly along an off-stump line. Swings across the line and swats it away through midwicket, off the inside half of the bat"
"shot! That's a wide half-volley alright, but how well did he hit that? Down on his back knee, frees his arms, and creams it to the left of the diving cover fielder"
"full again, not quite as full this time, doesn't get the same power on his drive this time, hits it to the man at cover"
"full on middle and leg, clipped away to the right of fine leg. Dhawan jams his bat into the turf while completing his second run, and nearly gets into a tangle with his feet as a result"
"back of a length, angling into the legs. Tucked off the hip into the backward square leg region"
"full, wide, four. He's going for his shots today, hasn't been afraid of throwing his bat at the wide ones. He's leaning back this time, not necessarily looking to get his weight forward and play along the ground. Ends up slicing it, but powerfully, in the air to the right of the diving backward point fielder"
"length ball outside off, punched on the up and Lyon saves four with a dive to his right at cover point"
"back of a length, keeps going with the angle towards middle stump. Goes back and looks to work it into the leg side, closing his bat face too early. Hits him on the back pad, but pretty high, and Richardson's appeal isn't the most confident"
"looks to angle it into the stumps again, ends up overdoing it and whanging it down the leg side"
"length ball close to off stump, lets it come on and opens his bat face for a gentle dab to third man"
"back of a length in the corridor, left alone"
"full outside off, squeezed out to backward point, who stops it with a dive to his left"
"back of a length, close to off stump. Doesn't get the width he wants - he was staying next to the line and looking to carve through the point region. Denied room, all he can do is chop it down gently into the off side"
"length ball, a little wider, slapped to cover point"
"full on off stump, and Dhawan drives to the left of the newly stationed sweeper"
"shortish, leg-stumpish, Dhawan swivels round and pulls it to the left of short fine leg. Hardly the field to be bowling even remotely short to"
"length ball wide of off stump, driven crisply on the up to sweeper cover"
"back of a length, tucked off the hip into the fine leg region"
"full, swinging in from about leg stump, can't connect with the flick but gets enough pad on it to pick up a leg bye into the backward square leg region"
"short outside off, and Dhawan loves it there. Plays a sensational shot too, hits deliberately underneath it, with a straight bat, up and over cover"
"and that is that. He's played with a lot of freedom today, but now he's played one shot too many. Length ball, angling into off stump, not quite full enough for the pick-up shot over midwicket. Plays too early, and ends up spooning it high in the air, off the outside half of the bat. Khawaja takes a steepler backtracking from mid-off"
"back of a length, swings in to beat Rohit's flick and hit his front pad, but it pitched outside leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and chops it down to third man"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, clipped into the leg side and midwicket dives left to stop it"
"back of a length, close to off stump, lets it come on and dabs to third man"
"Siddle throws in the wide tempter - go on, play that cover drive, he says, but Kohli judges the length well, knows it's not full enough, and leaves it alone"
"now he goes full and straight, looking to hit front pad or off stump, and Kohli plays around that front pad to whip it round to fine leg. Hands-on-head time for Siddle"
gorgeous shot. Again a fullish ball angling into off stump. Just shows the full face and eases a drive to the left of mid-on
"full outside off, and Kohli takes a big step forward and across and uses his wrists to whip it to mid-on. Unusual for him to do that so early in his innings, from so far outside off stump"
"back of a length, slanting away from off stump. Gives Rohit just enough room to free his arms and punch between backward point and cover"
"once again plays for swing when there is none. Lovely length, and Rohit is stuck on the crease trying to whip it across the line. Beats the outside edge, hits thigh pad, and rolls to the right of the keeper"
"extra bounce, and this time it does swing back in. Goes back to play that flick again, and this time it beats the inside edge to hit him on the thigh pad"
"length ball slanting across towards off stump, doesn't really get forward, just shuffles across and defends into the covers"
"nice length, angling across the stumps, draws Rohit forward for a defensive push to mid-off"
"beauty. He knows Rohit is tentative and is expecting that late inswing. There hasn't been much swing in this over. Fullish, not quite a half-volley, fairly wide of off stump, and it beats the outside edge as Rohit goes for the cover drive without getting a proper front-foot stride in"
"back of a length to start, goes right back to work it into the backward square leg region"
"tossed up full on off stump, clipped away neatly to wide long-on"
"floated up fairly full, just outside off, driven to long-on"

"length ball outside off, presses forward and defends towards point"
"length ball close to off stump, defended watchfully towards backward point"
"back of a length, just a touch of width, and that's enough for Kohli. The extra fielder on the leg side means there's no cover point, and Kohli stands up tall and punches with a straight bat into that gap. Cover gives chase, to no avail"
"full on off stump, driven firmly to mid-off"
length ball slanting across to off stump. Stays on the back foot and clips to midwicket
"stays back again, works this from middle stump to the left of short fine leg"
"back of a length on middle and leg, tucked off the hip to square leg"
again not full enough to draw the batsman forward. Kohli goes deep in his crease and across to work this from middle stump to deep backward square leg
"tossed up slower now, just outside off, stretches out to defend it back to the bowler"
"shot! That's a good-length ball, but it's just wide enough outside off for Rohit to step back, get down low, and cut it away through backward point"
"full, angling into off stump, clipped to the right of mid-on"
"wow. That's just the stock ODI delivery from the fast bowler, back of a length, angling into off stump. Rohit steps half-forward and across, and brings his wrists into play for a pick-up shot that easily clears the square leg boundary"
"length ball outside off, punched into the covers"
"back of a length outside off, guided down to third man with an open face"
"glorious. Fullish, angling into off stump, and Kohli plays that full-faced front-foot punch to send it whooshing past the left hand of the diving mid-on fielder"
"length ball outside off, and there's nearly a mix-up between these two notorious mixers-up between wickets. Presses forward, jabs it safely to the left of backward point, and then hesitates midway through a straightforward single. But they get their bearings right quickly and complete it comfortably"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to long-on past the diving bowler"
"length ball outside off, stays on the back foot, slightly besides the line, and punches to sweeper cover"

"back of a length on middle stump, goes right back in his crease to whip it to deep square leg"
"length ball on middle stump, clips it to the right of midwicket - not too far from the fielder - and hares out of his crease. Kohli, rightly, sends him back, and Rohit has to dive to regain his crease"

"shortish on off stump, shuffles across and whips it to midwicket"
"shortish outside off, stops on Kohli a little. Wanted to punch it through the covers, ended up hitting it towards mid-on off the inside half of the bat"
"back of a length, close to off stump, watches it well and guides it down to third man"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched with a straight bat to the left of mid-off, not far enough to his left to pick up one"
"another bouncer, Dhoni ducks under it"
"full on off stump, punched back to the bowler, who spots Dhoni briefly out of his crease and flings a throw to the other end. Misses the stumps, though"
"full on off stump, steps forward and across and whips this to deep square leg"
"down the track and Siddle sees him coming. Bangs it in and gets it to rise towards his chest. Dhoni spins around and sends a miscontrolled pull soaring towards the fielder at long leg, but Behrendorff, diving forward, can't quite get to the ball before it lands"
"short again, angling into Dhoni's left ribcage. Pulled along the ground this time to long leg"
"bouncer, climbs loopily, well over Kohli's head, before dropping down tennis-ball style into Carey's gloves"
"short, wide, sits up nicely for Kohli to cut. The sweeper on the cover point boundary runs quickly to his left and pulls off a sliding stop. Handscomb, I think"
"another loopy bouncer, Dhoni barely has to duck to get under it"
"back of a length outside off, gets across to get close to the line and pokes it to the left of cover"
"steps out of his crease and across to the off side to a fullish ball from Siddle. Looks to flick from well outside off stump, gets a thick outside edge to short third man"
"that's super running. Back of a length, angling slightly down leg. Shuffles across and misses the flick, and the ball drops down by Dhoni's feet, to his left, after hitting his pad. Just one bit of eye contact across the pitch is enough for both batsmen to steal a hurried leg-bye"
"back of a length, close to off stump, opens his bat face to dab to backward point"
"ooh, that's a rare uncontrolled hoick from Kohli. Fullish, on off stump, looks to whip it over the leg side and gets a thick edge that nearly carries all the way to third man. Lands about three or four feet in front of him"
"back of a length on off stump, punched towards mid-off and he finds Finch a touch too deep and on his heels"
"back of a length outside off, looks for the dab to third man but backward point moves quickly to intercept"
"shortish outside off, swatted down the ground with a horizontal bat, bounces down to long-on"
"And there it is, shuffles across to tuck this back-of-a-length delivery from a fifth-stump line to the fielder at deep square leg. Hundred number 39. THIRTY NINE! Here I was thinking he was still somewhere in the mid-to-high 20s. Wow. Not much of a celebration, just a fist pump. Keeps his helmet on too."
"in the blockhole on middle and off, clipped to the right of deep square leg"
"slower bouncer wide outside off, Dhoni leaves it alone"
"great running. Back of a length, fifth-stump line. Dhoni jumps across and uses his wrists to work it into the vacant mid-on region, and both batsmen knew as soon as he made contact that two runs were on"
"length ball on off stump, presses forward and shows the full face to send it rolling past the diving bowler towards long-on"
"full on middle stump, and Kohli chips it in the air - not sure if it was intentional - on the bounce to long-on. I think he was looking to flick it more through midwicket, and ended up checking his shot"
"in the blockhole on leg stump, steps across to clip to the left of long leg"
"length ball on off stump, clipped quietly to deep midwicket"
"length ball on off stump, stands utterly still until the ball reaches him, and jabs it away to the right of third man"
"slower ball, back of a length, on middle stump. Dhoni shuffles across and nurdles it into the midwicket region. No one saving one on the leg side"
"whoopsie. A huge moment for Australia, this. This is full, a half-volley on leg stump, and I don't know if Kohli was looking to hit this in the air, but he's flicked it, possibly a touch earlier than he wanted to, timed it perhaps better than he wanted to, and picked out the fielder at deep midwicket. With everyone back on the leg side, I doubt this was intentional"
"shortish, rising towards Karthik's ribcage. Jumps across and tucks it into the backward square leg region"
"length ball on middle stump, worked away to deep backward square leg"
"flat, leg-stumpish. Shuffles across to try and work it behind square, and he misses. Ball hits his thigh pad"
"down the track now and Lyon bowls it on Dhoni's pad, flicked to the right of deep midwicket"
"bam! Down the track and Lyon feeds him just where he wants the ball. A bit of flight, and outside off stump, and he can free his arms and hoick it away, with the turn, over the wide long-on boundary"
"flat length ball sliding on towards off stump, clipped back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, makes room and forces it past extra-cover diving left, and picks up two more"
"flighted and full on off stump, brings out that trademark straight-bat bottom-hand push to long-on to retain the strike"
"back of a length, angling into Dhoni's left hip. Tucked away to long leg"
"full on middle stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, shuffles across and nudges it away through backward square leg"
"short, gets it up to shoulder height over off stump, and how good a shot is that from DK? Steps back and across, swivels, rolls his wrists over, and finds the  gap to the right of deep square leg, nearly hooks it for six. Bounces just a foot or so short of the rope"
"length ball on off stump, clipped to the right of mid-on"
"back of a length, gets his line all wrong. With pretty much everyone in the circle on the off side, he doesn't want to give Dhoni any width, and he ends up whanging it down the leg side. Dhoni merely steps across and shoulders arms"
"back of a length on off stump, shuffles across to tuck it through square leg"
"full, angling into off stump, blocked back to the bowler. I guess he was looking for the single to long-on but hit it straighter than intended"
"full outside off, opens his bat face slightly to ease it past the left-hand of the diving extra-cover fielder"
"low full-toss outside off, punches it with a straight bat to the left of long-off"
"don't bowl short to Dinesh Karthik. Not today, at least. Sits up on an off-stump line, and he hits it up and over, into the gap between long leg and deep forward square leg"
"length ball outside off, driven to extra-cover"
"length ball on off stump, looks like the offcutter. Clips it down the ground, doesn't put too much weight behind his shot, and they can pick up two by the time long-on sprints forward and to his right to get to it"
"back of a length, slanting across into a fourth-stump line. Lots of bottom hand in that whip to deep midwicket"
"loopy slower full-toss outside off, swatted down the ground to long-on. Managed to get some proper dip on it"
"back of a length, off-stumpish, worked away to deep midwicket off the back foot"
"another slower ball, full and fairly wide, driven to deep point"
"shortish, leg-stumpish, jumps across and nudges it away into the fine leg region. Strays in line and Dhoni picks up a clever three"
"shuffles out of his crease and gets a fullish ball on off stump. Clipped away neatly, once more into that midwicket region"
down the track and Stoinis bangs it in short. Punches it with a straight bat to long-off
"fullish outside off, driven past the diving extra-cover's left hand, and to the right of sweeper cover"
"length ball on middle stump, shows the full face to drive to long-on"
"back of a length on off stump, and Dhoni jabs it gently in front of extra-cover, a couple of yards to his right, and hustles through for a quick single"
"someone asked where all the scoop shots were - here it is. Slower length ball outside off, and Karthik steps across and helps it nice and fine. There's no one at short fine leg, and the man at fine leg is quite wide, more long leg than fine leg. And that placement allows these batsmen to run three."
"fullish on off stump, and Dhoni goes for the big hit down the ground. Hits it pretty well, but straight to long-on, on the bounce"
"probably not. Back of a length on off stump, and MS Dhoni absolutely Dhonies this to bring up his fifty. Leans back, clears his front leg, and brings all that bottom-hand power into play to clear long-on as well. It'll be an interesting exercise to work out how many times he's hit this ball - 49.1 - for six in his ODI career"
"and there's the win. The field comes in, but there's still enough gaps to sneak that single. Full, close to off stump, and Dhoni clips it just wide of mid-on and hurries through to the other end. 2018 wasn't a great year for Dhoni. He's begun 2019 with two fifties in a row, the second one a vintage Dhoni chasing innings"
