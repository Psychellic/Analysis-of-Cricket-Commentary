"<b>Samson you stunner!</b> Oh boy! We saw a good one from Pandya earlier but this was, by some degree, a harder one. It's flat, it's dipping, it's absolutely laced across the line. Samson runs in from deep midwicket, staying low at every point and then dives to pick it up low and in front of himself. That took so much hurried movement that he absolutely had to nail the follow through as well to hold on - and he does that with the most graceful tumble. Superb.
