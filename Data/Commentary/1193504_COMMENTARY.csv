"<b>brainfreezes abound!</b> Slow-mo cricket! No-mo cricket if you're Mosaddek. Short ball down leg side, looks to pull but it's past him. Mendis leaps to his left to try and get this. He can only parry it upwards for himself. It appears the batsman thinks the ball is now past the keeper because Rahim is running down at the other end. So he's taking a walk around short-of-a-length whereabouts. Mendis is still juggling the ball. And has almost resigned, because he's REALLY struggling to hold on. Then he sees where the batsman is. Now he has the ball, and his right glove is off. Takes aim for an eternity as Mosaddek turns around and pauses life. Crunch. Ball hits base of stump."
