"back of a length and outside off, lets it go, but boy, look at that carry! Nearly takes Pant's face off!"
"<b>oooh, shapes in!</b> Not quite enough to draw the batsman into a shot, because Crawley judges it to be far enough outside off to not bother with it. Then, as it goes to the keeper, it starts swinging away!"
"<b>very late choice to block</b>, Crawley concentrating hard on not playing at anything he needn't. Gets a bit of an edge that goes straight to ground and then to gully"
"good length, outside off, confident leave"
"<b>now it dies on Pant</b>! What is this pitch, really?! Root couldn't figure it out. And in the course of this first over, it's allowed monster carry and now it punishes a fuller ball outside off to skirt through at shin height"
"fullish on and around off stump, making Crawley play."
"pitches it up outside off, Sibley shows no interest"
"gets it to <b>nip away off the pitch</b>, the ball originally angled in towards off stump. Sibley shuffles across to protect his stumps and then leaves outside his eyeline"
"<b>lovely carry again</b>. It looks like you bend your back, you get reward here. Bumrah hits the deck hard, on a good length. But it's not quite close enough to the stumps to prompt a reaction from the batsman"
"<b>a hint of movement away</b> but nothing too threatening, mostly because it starts too wide and Sibley has a simple decision to let go"
<b>goood balll!</b>. He's slowly getting his line right. This one is closer to the stumps and it's got that poison tinged away movement off the pitch too. Sibley is cautious and he needs to be as he covers his stumps and leaves warily
<b>now the indipper!</b> Splendid over from Bumrah. Perfectly worthy of Kohli adding a third slip in. The length is full. The line is attacking the stumps. And Sibley is finally drawn into a shot - a good shot - a forward defensive
pins him at the crease with a slightly back of a length delivery that Crawley blocks
floats it up there - almost a yorker outside off - Crawley is looking to smear it through the covers but it's too close to the blockhole
"<b>hits him on the pads</b> with inswing, but it's too much. Would be going down leg as Crawley tries to flick it down to fine leg"
<b>he's got him!</b> Ishant has got on a roll in his 100th Test match! And it's a very Ishant wicket too. The ball thudding into the pitch. Then decking away off it. Sibley is caught in his crease. He's surprised by the bounce. He's poking at the ball. The edge is taken. The edge off the shoulder of the bat. Very very very Ishant. And then a simple catch to Rohit at second slip.
"ignores a good length ball a tiny bit outside the off stump. Oooh, but it's his second no-ball of the over."
shortish and outside off and it absolutely slams into Bairstow's bat as he looks to chop it down towards point
<b>appreciable swing (but it starts early so it can be judged early) into the right-hander</b> but Bairstow is solidly behind it.
"full and outside off, lets it go"
<b>first runs off the bat</b> and it's a pristine push past the right of mid-on. Crawley isn't looking for the boundary. He's just trying to play the correct shot to a ball searching for his middle stump. Full face of the bat fetches him reward
good length ball outside off darts away - and sharply - after it passes the batsman. Good take from Pant
blocks a good length ball to mid-on - and since he's playing with soft hands he could run across to the other end and set up camp there
"<b>special bowling!</b>! He squares the batsman up with late movement. It's off the pitch. It's drawing Bairstow ti push his hands at it. Don't think there's anything on it though. But behind the sticks, Pant isn't able to collect it cleanly because the ball dips on him late"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"back of a length and outside off, a reprieve for the batsman, who just has to holster his weapon"
"defends a fullish delivery looking for the top of off stump - this is now Ishant's signature delivery for the past few years. He's learned to hit the stumps, bring them into play, without losing any of his pace"
"good length, outside off, good leave too."
"pitches it up, looking for the outside edge, Crawley isn't quite so obliging"
"<b>nails the drive</B> down the ground! He's very switched on so far. This is only slightly overpitched but he's pounced on it. Good stride forward and this time a proper punch into the shot, meaning he was always looking to smack it"
"<b>sharp swing into the right-hander</b> but it doesn't matter! Crawley is still able to adjust to it, and even play along with it, to flick the ball through midwicket and all the way to the boundary. <b>Superb timing again</b>"
"shortish on middle stump, he lets the ball come on and then works it off his hips through square leg"
"strikes him on the pads as he looks to work the ball behind square leg. Bumrah was probably trying to get it to straighten off the angle. It doesn't, which also rules out the lbw because it would be going down"
<b>outside edge</B> but he makes sure it goes to ground. Soft hands from Crawley to deal with a pitched up ball close enough to off stump to make him play. And the slight movement away off the pitch produces the false shot
too full and <b>Crawley is at it again!</b>. His front foot game is gangbusters! This time he accesses the gap between cover and point because Bumrah has been kind enough not only to overpitch but also give him room
"good length, outside off, lets it go, gorgeous carry through to the keeper."
touch too far outside off to make Mr Crawley come out and play
<b>lovely wrists</b>! Lovely balance! And the timing! We need to invent a new adjective for his timing! It's a stray on his pads and all he does is gently guide the ball through square leg and it springs away to the fence!
"<b>given out lbw but Bairstow has reviewed it</b>! Axar might have a wicket first ball! There is no bat involved. It's just a tossed up ball angled into middle stump. The batsman is looking to play for turn, but it only just straightens. Just slightly to clip the outside of the front pad right in line with middle stump. Beautiful work. Umpire Menon's on-field call is vindicated. And India's move to spin - potentially to counter Crawley's start - has resulted in Bairstow's downfall"
drifting into the pads and Root turns it gently behind square leg
"slow through the air, gets a little turn as well because of it. Root realises he will never get to the pitch of the ball, so he has to adjust with his hands and the ball on middle stump nearly pops over to short leg"
<b>very tight leave</b>. Axar is not getting massive turn so letting a ball go is tinged with danger bcause it can still just come on with the angle and take off stump

zips back in his crease - the second the length is short his feet put him in the perfect place to flick the ball through midwicket. <b>Outstanding Root</b>!
defends a good length ball on off stump
<b>play and miss</b>! For once Crawley goes driving at the wrong ball. It's not right up there as the previous ones that he absolutely nailed. Perhaps those gave him the faux confidence that thunders through his veins right now as he looks to hit Bumrah on the up and comes up second best
<b>back to normal then</b> as Crawley gets right behind the line of a good length ball on middle. This innings will depend on how long he can stay out there. He's already looking like he has the pace of the pitch down
"lovely, rock solid defence, head over the ball on off stump"
"pins him on the pads, Bumrah's angle into the right-hander, and the skid he gets off the pitch making sure he beats the Crawley's flick"
"back of a length on and around off stump, Crawley is uncertain behind it, guiding the ball to gully"
"loops it up onto off stump, Root lunges forward to defend."

One second Root is trying to get in line with a back of a length ball to turn it into the leg side, the next, it's rearing up at him, forcing him to take a painful blow. Looks like it's the first two fingers of his right hand and they will be tended to by the physio while <b>the rest take drinks</b>"
"shortish and outside off, Root taps it towards point"

"length, and he defends towards R Ashwin at mid-on. Wants a single, and takes a few steps forward, but Root sends him back"

"length, spins back into him from outside off, and they appeal for leg before. Not given, but <strong>India review this</strong>! Interesting, because he did get a big stride forward. For it to go back and hit the stumps, that would have to have hit him quite low. Well, it has struck him on the back leg, actually! May not be a bad shout after all! There's no edge on this, as he plays inside the line of the ball. Oh, it does most things right, but it's hitting on umpire's call. Crawley stays!"

Ashwin's angle from around the stumps, and his ability to vary his line will always bring his mode of dismissal into play, especially with these two players showing a keenness to play back.

It looked like it carried to the man at gully/second slip, but they're checking for a fair catch. Soft signal is out. Pujara was in tight, left knee to the ground, right knee up. Did he just about manage to grab this cleanly? Hard to tell from either of the angles the TV umpire has seen so far. Looked to me like he managed to sneak his fingertips underneath it, but it's so hard to tell from this angle, and it sounds like there isn't a better one available. 'Nice and slow,' Mr Shamshuddin says. There's a stump cam angle too, and from there it looks like a clean catch... and the big screen confirms it. <b>Leach goes!</b>"

Anderson doesn't fancy facing Bumrah under the lights. He's set up all wrong. He's flinching as the ball passes his bat - a short ball outside off
"<b>pin-point yorker</b>, angled in from around the wicket, surging through towards middle stump, but Anderson is staunchly in the way. Gorgeous TV!"
"loops it up on middle and leg, Foakes gets forward to block and instead finds an inside edge to fine leg"
"full on middle, Foakes gets a long stride and defends with a straight bat"
"goes a little more round-arm than normal for a pitched up delivery on middle and leg, Foakes plays the angle and nudges towards midwicket"
<b>knocks him over</b>! He is too quick to play back too. He skids through. He's dangerous. <b>And he has six wickets now</b>. Lovely bowling from the left-arm spinner. Its like he's channelling Ravindra Jadeja ever since he put on his Test cap. And now he has a Ravindra Jadeja wicket too. A flatter ball that persuades the batsman to go on the back foot - Foakes then tries to cut and playing these kinds of bowlers with a horizontal bat is so so dangerous - but it then kisses the pitch and surges through to mess up his stumps
"<b>gorgeous outswing</b>! It all starts with the angle into the right-hander, drawing him forward to block. Then halfway through it peels away and snatches the outside edge. Rohit though does well and doesn't push at the ball. Soft hands keeps it down as it goes to gully"
"back of a length and outside off, Rohit lets it skip past"
<b>beats him with a ripppppaahhhh!</b> Half an inch fuller and he would've got him. It's an Anderson special. Angle in. Good length. Can't drive. But still have to come forward to play. Rohit tries but he's comfortable done
"<b>indecision from Rohit</b>. A man who dominated on a rip-roaring turner in the last Test. Who rose above the conditions in spectacular fashion is suddenly clouded by doubt as Anderson keeps getting the ball to target the stumps and then dart away through the air. Originally wants to play, then pulls the pat away, in the end the ball thuds into the face of his bat and goes through to the keeper"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
<b>good leave</b> from Rohit. He's covering his stumps. He sees the good length ball is outside his eyeline and so he hoists his bat skyward. Good decision making
"shortish and outside off, Gill seems to jump leg side of the ball as he guides it to point"
flirts with a back of a length delivery outside off and is beaten. Good carry through to the keeper too
defends a shortish ball on and around off stump towards point
"<b>outside edge and Stokes is claiming it and umpire Anil Chaudhary's soft signal is out</b>! Replays though seem to bring a little more doubt into the picture. 'The ball clearly bounced', says third umpire Shamsuddin and Gill survives. Stokes is utterly bemused. And Broad and Anderson have rounded on the umpire Chaudhary. Root too. This is all spicing up! Lovely ball though. Hits the deck on an in-between length to trap the batsman in his crease. Then it decks away off the seam and a squared up Gill offers it the outside edge as tribute. All of that is perfect, but the catch, with Stokes diving forward as the ball dies on him, might not have had all his fingers under the ball as he took it"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
<b>loud thud</b> as shortish ball hits the middle of Gill's bat as he defends into the covers
<b>good cricket!</b>. Anderson is bowling full now. He needed only one over to figure out the length he wants on this pitch. Rohit gets a small stride forward and then he plays with soft hands so that it slides off the open face of the bat towards gully
pokes at a back of a length ball moving away from him and gets a bit of an outside edge. Gully dives to his right to stop any runs
"good length on off stump, Rohit pushes it in front of point and brings India's first runs off the bat"
"back of a length on off stump, he defends"
<b>strikes him on the pad</b> while he's still stuck on the crease. For once an Anderson ball doesn't swing. Just goes on with the arm and potentially might have gone down leg as Gill tries to flick it and comes off second best
"pitches it up on off stump, Gill strides forward to defend and that's been his best shot in this little innings so far. It's the kind of shot you can get confidence from to turn things around"
works it off his pads towards square leg
"ooooh, hangs it out there to drive outside off, but Rohit is watchful. <b>What a battle</b>!"
"full on middle and leg, Rohit presents a straight bat"
<b>flows into the drive</b>! This time the ball is closer to him. The angle is bringing it to him. So he plants his front leg down the line and punches the overpitched delivery down the ground
"shortish on off stump, he lets it come to him and then knocks it down to short midwicket"
he's slowly getting it here. Thunderous sound off the bat as he blocks a shortish ball outside off towards point
"<b>brilliant bowling</b> but Gill is not going to be so easily undone. He stands firm against a full length delivery on and around middle stump, playing as late as he can to check on the swing Anderson might get. There's nothing here so he turns the ball towards midwicket"
"<b>nearly chops on</B> but he's alert and he kicks it away! This time the pink ball snarls into the right-hander. And it's tinged with extra bounce too. Anderson is such a master. Gill is up off his toes as he tries to tame this delivery, but it comes off more the bottom edge of the bat and he needs to redirect it so that it doesn't roll onto his stumps"
<b>extra bounce again</b> as Anderson hits the deck on a decent length and the ball surges up to meet the shoulder of Gill's bat even as he tries to come forward to block
"full on off stump, Gill defends"
"full and outside off, wise leave from Gill"
"<b>brings the stumps into play again</b> and Gill feels the need to yank his bottom hand off the bat as he negotiates an indipper from Anderson well enough and then walks away to have some dinner. Very challenging five overs to face for any player, let alone one so young in his Test career"
"length, angles in, and he goes back to punch this towards mid-wicket"
"shorter in length, and he guides it towards third man. Gully dives to his right to cut this off"
"fuller, looks for some swing, outside off, and he punches this through extra cover"
"banged in a touch short, and he hops to defend towards point"
"length, swings back in from outside off, and he leaves. Sharp movement <em>after </em>it passes the batsman, and Foakes collects low to his left"
"length, around off, and he defends with a little forward press"
"fullish length, and angles back into him. <strong>Didn't know a lot about that</strong>, playing back. Struck on the pads as he shapes to flick"
"length, angles in, and he presses forward to defend. Just a bit of a gap between bat and pad, but he did well to jam his bat down to defend towards mid-wicket"
"length, around off, and he defends with a forward press. Just shortened the length a bit, but he was quick to move forward to cover the line"
"length, straighter line, and he defends from the crease"
"wider of off, and he lets his bat hang out a touch. The length is shorter, though, and it goes off on the bounce towards gully"
"defended to point, off the back foot"
"length, dropped towards cover and they pinch a quick single"
"just a little shorter in length, and he looks to get a square drive going. Doesn't middle it...he was anyway committed to the front foot. Just played away towards point"
"worked away towards mid-wicket, with the incoming angle into him"
"length ball, angles into him, as he shapes to play this towards mid-wicket. They appeal, but it's not given, and <strong>Root reviews</strong>, albeit a bit reluctantly. First look, it seems to have been sliding down leg. No bat involved, and the impact is good. Wickets is umpire's call, and that saves Gill. Oh, closer than I initially thought. England do retain their review, though"
"length, and he defends with a forward press"
"fuller length, drives with a forward press to mid-on"
"length, outside off, swinging further away, and he shoulders arms to this"
"fullish length, but outside off, and he can leave as it swings further away"
"<strong>Jaffa!</strong> Good length, and just outside off, getting Rohit to just poke at it, Seams away and goes through at good height to Foakes"
"length, and he gets forward to defend this ball around the fourth stump line"
"just a bit back of a length, defended to point"
"length, driven towards cover"
"short, and Gill gets going with a cut through cover-point. His 27th ball, and an easy one to put away. Just eased through the area"
"<b>superb riposte from Broad!</b> Seam movement away from just outside off, making Gill play at it. Bounces through to Foakes"
"closer in length, just around off, and he defends after getting behind the line of this"
"length, around off, and he defends after getting behind the line"
"length, and he presses forward to defend"
"length, defended towards cover"
"length, around off, and he gets nicely behind the line of this to defend"
worked away with the incoming angle towards square leg for an easy single
"length, around off, and he presses forward to defend this towards cover"
"short, and he goes back and jabs this through the square leg region. Just uses the pace on the ball and gets it away towards between deep mid-wicket and deep square leg"
"defends a shorter ball, driving towards point"
"back of a length, defended towards cover, and Anderson takes a bit of a tumble in his follow-through. Looks alright, though"
"length, wide outside off, seaming further away. Left alone"
"fuller, and he defends after covering the line of this straighter ball"
"short, and he helps it on its way to fine leg with a little hook after covering the line of this ball"
"short, and he slaps this through the cover-point region. Won't go for four, though, as point gets across to his right to stop this"
"fuller, straighter, and driven back to the bowler with a little forward press from Gill"
"length, outside off, left alone. Keeps a bit lower this time as it goes through to Foakes"
"just a bit short in length, and he plays this towards gully"
defends a length ball outside off
"short, and he goes back to pull this backward of square. Just sits up a bit for him, and he is quite happy to fetch this from outside off"
"this is carved through point. Archer is still a touch short, but offers width outside off with this ball. He just hangs back and pings this through the point region"
"back of a length, and he hops to play this towards square leg. Easy single, with the angle of the ball slanting it towards his pads"
"short, and he ducks under this. Too short to invite any sort of interest from the batsman"
"fullish, driven towards mid-on and he picks up a single"
"length, and he presses forward to defend this"
"a little shorter, and he can go back to punch this towards cover"
"just a touch shorter, and flatter, and <strong>spins across him</strong>. Left alone, but there was decent turn and bounce on offer for Leach"
"length, spins away from him as he lets this pass"
"fuller, on the pads, and he stretches forward to play this past short leg towards square leg"
"fullish, around off, and he leaves as it swings away from him"
"length, angles in, and he plays this towards mid-wicket"
"short, and that <strong>takes the upper portion of the bat's edge</strong>, but lands well short of point. Archer cranks this up, and Gill does well to play with soft hands"
"back of a length again, and he gets behind the line to defend this"
"dug in a bit short, wide outside off, and scuffs through low towards Foakes on the bounce. This was a bit slower at 140.7 kph...imagine that!"
"short, fetches this from outside off, and gets a top edge. Taken at where a short leg might have been, such was the amount of time available to Crawley to get across from square leg. Pin-drop silence in the stadium. Archer gets the breakthrough that England desperately needed! The pull and hook should be used judiciously on a wicket like this, which even on the first day, has showed just a touch of variable bounce. Better to shelve those shots, if possible"
"just a bit short, and he can go back and drive this towards deep point"
"skips down the wicket, first ball, and drives to mid-off"
"fuller, driven back towards the bowler after covering the line, which is around leg and middle, spinning back into him"
presses forward to smother one around leg
"that could be close, as he stretches forward to defend. Given out, and are they planning to review it? No, Rohit talks him out of it. Massive wicket this for England. Leach bowls one out of the Axar Patel book of bowling on this pitch, by spearing one in and getting it to go straight through. Excellent thinking from the spinner, as Pujara is new to the crease and not likely to play any big shots straightaway. Rare failure, at least in terms of balls faced, for Pujara. But is there an opening here for England?"
"length, and he stretches forward to defend. <strong>This was going on straight too</strong>, and just caught the inside part of the bat as Kohli defended"
"length, swings away from outside off, and he leaves"
"length, outside off, nibbles away, and he leaves again"
"short, and he pulls this behind square. Raaaaaaces away along this outfield, and bisects the gap between long leg and deep square leg perfectly"
"short of a length, outside off, and he steers this towards a deep gully in place"
"length, angles into him, and he defends with a forward press"
"short, and he looks to pull, and almost pulls out of the way. This <strong>runs off the top edge</strong>, and goes bang behind the keeper. Not far from a six, perhaps. But Rohit didn't know a lot about that"
"length, around off, and he presses forward to defend one around off"
"full, down the leg side, and Kohli has a waft at it. Goes through Foakes as well, and they pick up a couple of byes"
"length, around off, spinning away, and he watches this through"
"fuller, straighter, and poked towards mid-wicket. Just wide of the fielder close to the bat, and that allows them to pick up a couple"
"length, and he hangs back to punch this towards deep point"
"fuller, driven towards mid-on"
"back of a length, 137kph, and Kohli defends comfortably off the back foot"
"hits the pitch halfway down, Kohli steers into the covers. 134kph"
"back of a length, steered off the ribcage into the midwicket region. 136kph"

"runs his fingers down the side of the ball again, and Kohli steers watchfully into the off side"
"banged in, back of a length, and Kohli guides it out to point with an open face. Maiden over"
"full and straight, whipped to Anderson at mid-on, and they scamper through for a single"
"sharp turn from a length, nudged to short midwicket off the back foot"
"wide on the crease, but overpitched, and Kohli slashes a drive out to sweeper-cover"
"full outside off, but too full again, and Rohit leans on the drive. Crawley fields at deep cover"
"full outside off, driven out to deep cover once more"
"slides on with the angle from round the wicket, and England like it... and they'll <b>review</b> the not-out decision. He was a long way down the pitch, but it hit him below the knee roll. No bat involved, with Rohit beaten on the inside edge. Impact in-line, and just missing the bail between middle and leg. Good decision, and Rohit survives. Wry smile from Stokes."
"drops short at 141.5kph, and <b>Kohli lashes a pull shot away for four!</b> Half-tracker to start, in at the ribs, and a vicious pull behind square"
"length ball, nudged to mid-on with soft hands for a single"
"too short on the hip, and Rohit nudges it to long leg for a sauntered single"
"banged in, back of a length, and Kohli rides the bounce, defending off the back foot"
"hung wide outside off stump, left alone"
"banged in halfway down, and steered to point on the bounce. 130kph"
"Rohit skips down the track looking to launch Leach for six, but the bat closes in his hands. He meets the pitch of the ball, and manages to drag it for four, wide of mid-on"
"good turn from a fullish length, clipped into the leg side for a single"
"skids on with the angle, and Kohli is playing for the turn, pressing forwards outside off stump. Inside edges past the leg stump, and it skews away for a couple"
"wide on the crease, very full, and Kohli drives uppishly into the covers. Falls <i>just</i> short of Bairstow at extra cover, diving forward and to his left"
"hint of turn and keeps a little low from a length, as Rohit shoulders arms"
"overpitched on leg stump, as Rohit skips down and clips this wide of mid-on for a couple"
"length ball, pressed out to mid-off"
"loopy bouncer, 127kph, and flies way over Kohli. In fact, wide enough that it's given as a wide. Stokes yet to find his mojo"
"banged in halfway down, outside off, and Kohli bottom-edges the pull. Squirts away into the leg side"
"length ball, keeps a little low, and <strong>Kohli times the short-arm jab to perfection</strong>. Effortless short, which races away through midwicket, beating the deep square-leg fielder. All class"
"length ball in the off-stump channel, left alone. 132kph"
"good bounce and carry, but short and wide enough for Kohli to leave it alone"
"hung outside off stump, Kohli shoulders arms"
"fullish outside off, good shape on the ball. Turns away from the bat as Rohit leaves it alone"
"length outside off, Rohit plays tip-and-run into the off side and they sneak through for a bonus run"
"drawn forward, and Kohli defends with his bat face angled towards the off side"
"full and straight, nudged away for a single to point"
"shapes to paddle-sweep, without much conviction. Strangled appeal from Leach, who thinks it might have hit the pad first. Clearly bat first, and it dribbles away for one towards fine leg"
steered into the off side
"banged in halfway down, and Rohit brings out that characteristically beautiful pull. There's a man out, so it'll just be a couple"
"length ball, defended watchfully"
"back of a length, punched off the back foot into the covers"
"back of a length, <strong>thick edge through the vacant gully region for four!</strong> Strange field with two slips, a very wide, deep gully and a catching backward point, and it flies through the gap as Rohit shapes to punch off the back foot"
"<b>Rohit brings up his half-century. 63 balls, with eight fours</b>. Flicked through midwicket for one"
"superb diving stop by Pope in close at point, throwing himself to his left to cut this off as Kohli opens the face on a checked drive. Don't think it was even a half-chance, as it bounced short of him"
"length in the off-stump channel, checked drive into the covers"
"full on fourth stump, pressed out to cover-point"

"full, and Rohit is forward to smother the turn"

"full and straight, comes forward to defend"

"length ball, defended into the covers"
"length ball, guided out to point"
"turns from a length, Rohit defends"
"premeditates with the paddle sweep, and <strong>Pope can't quite grab it at short leg!</strong> Incredibly harsh to describe it as a drop, but he did get his hand to it. Great anticipation to run round to his right, and stick out a hopeful left hand while leaping, but he couldn't cling on"
defended out towards mid-on
"drifts in and then spins sharply away, <strong>beating the outside edge</strong>. Foakes whips the bails off but Virat's back foot is down"
steered away into the off side
"<strong>dropped in the gully!</strong> After dropping an almost impossibly hard chance, Pope shells a much more straightforward one. Back-of-a-length ball, wide outside the off stump, and Kohli was surprised by the extra bounce, almost looking to withdraw the bat at the last moment. He steered it straight to Pope at gully, who couldn't cling onto the catch."
defended into the covers
"length ball on fourth stump, defended into the off side"
"length on fourth stump, nudged into the leg side"
"length ball, hung outside off, and Kohli shoulders arms"
"fraction full of a length, and Kohli jams the bat down on it, steered into the off side"
"tossed up, defended into the covers"
"blocked into the covers. Looked for a split-second as though he would paddle-sweep, causing Stokes to run to his left at slip, but changed his mind"
"<b>Foakes whips off the bails and this could be tight!</b> Good turn and bounce to beat him on the outside edge, and is Rohit's back foot down? Sharp work from Foakes. Mr Shamshuddin says 'foot is grounded', and the decision is not out. England are again nonplussed, and Root is having words with umpire Menon. He's remonstrating with him, but has eventually accepted the decision"
"turns sharply from a length, as Rohit leaves alone"
"sharp spin as Rohit brings out the sweep, and it flies past the outside edge"
"sharp turn again, as Rohit shoulders arms this time. Maiden over"
defended into the off side

"squeezed into the covers, and they sneak through for one"
"too full, too straight, and Rohit clips elegantly through midwicket. Lovely shot. Leach gets round to cut it off, sticks out his left hand... and misses the ball completely! Might be the effects of the dew, or perhaps he just didn't stick his hand down low enough. Archer is frustrated, but it wasn't a great ball"
"length ball, steered into the off side"
"back of a length, defended off the back foot. 132kph"
"full outside off, and Kohli defends with an open face"
"<strong>bottom-edged onto the off stump! Leach gets Kohli!</strong> Length ball, and Kohli shaped to cut, playing for the turn. But it just skidded straight on, no real turn to speak of, and he was cramped for room. Kohli chops on, and Leach roars in celebration. Yet again, a straighter one from a slow left-arm spinner has done the job. Kohli looks furious with himself, getting out this late in the day"
"straight, length ball, which Rahane defends with soft hands"
"turns from a length, Rahane defends with soft hands once more and finds gully on the bounce"
"<b>edged just short of gully!</b> Leach is right in the game here. Length ball, good turn away from the bat as Rahane lunges forward with harder hands this time. Root deflects it through the gap between him and Stokes, and Rahane is off the mark"
"length ball, Rohit defends watchfully and that will be <b>stumps</b>"
"nice and full, largely holds its line on off stump, Rahane inches forward and defends it solidly to cover"
"pitched up on off stump, 133ks, Rahane shows off his straight bat and plays it back to Anderson from the crease"
"good length and homing in just a shade outside off, 139ks, run away to short mid-off"
"on a length and angling into middle stump, carefully blocked back to Anderson once again"

"back of a length and skids back in at off stump to tuck up Rahane for room, having him defensively stab it out to the leg side"

"fuller and quicker outside off, down the track and patted to mid-off hanging back"
"on a length and drifts into middle, not sure if Rahane had nicked it onto his thigh pad, the ball lobs harmlessly in to the leg side"
"threatens to slide on but spins away outside off, Rahane reaches for it and is beaten on the outside edge"
"Leach drags his length back outside off and gets it to spin away. Rahane jumps back, aims to drag it to the leg side, but loses his balance, and does not make contact"
"too full and holds its line on off, dead-batted away"
"back of a length and outside off, 134ks, Rohit stands up tall and punches it solidly to short cover"
"fractionally short and wide outside off, Rohit latches onto it and carves it away past the right of backward point for four. Punched off the back foot for the first boundary of the day and it's greeted by big cheers"
"good length and homing in on middle, patted to mid-on off the front foot"
"<strong>this is even better from Rohit. Glorious!</strong> Stands up tall, rises on top of a short ball outside off, and laces it away to the left of short cover and right of backward point"
"slightly overpitched on off, laced back to Anderson who sticks his left leg out and stops the ball"
"pretty full and sliding in at off stump, Rohit opens the face and dinks the ball to cover"

"much fuller and angling in at off stump, whisked into the covers off the front foot"
"pitched up on off, safely negotiated off the front foot by Rohit. India, by the way, have moved into the lead"
"pushed through around off, dabbed behind point off the front foot"
"<strong>skidder from Leach, and he has Rahane lbw</strong>. Full, skids into Rahane from left-arm around. The batsman elects to play back to this full ball which hits the pitch and seems to gather more pace, striking him on the pad in line with off even before Rahane had jabbed his bat down. It's the skidder that's more dangerous on this track. The tracker returns umpire's call on off stump"
"full and sliding across off, bunted down to long-on"
"pushed through faster on off stump, Rohit dead-bats it away"
"wide of the crease, full on off, run away to short cover"
"Rohit ventures down the track, Leach pulls his length back, fires it quicker. The batsman hides his bat behind pad, the ball lobs off the thigh pad"

"much fuller and wider of off, Pant doesn't go searching for this. Left alone"
"pitched further up and homing in on off, played back"
"good length on off, Pant moves forward, opens the face, and dinks it to short cover"
"short, wide, Pant delays the cut, and ends up chopping it hard to backward point"
"back of a length and skidding back in at off, cramping Pant for room. Stabbed into the pitch off the inner half to close out the over"
"<strong>Leach wins another lbw appeal from umpire Menon.</strong> Rohit opts to challenge this on-field out decision. Length ball, another delivery that slides in towards off, as opposed to turning away, Rohit misses the sweep altogether and is struck on the hip in line with off as he goes low. The tracker returns umpire's call on impact once again. Umpire Menon's on-field decision will stay"
"on a length and spins away outside off, Ashwin jumps back and handsomely punches through the cover-point region"
"darted wide of off and breaks away further, Ashwin is happy to shoulder arms"
poked in the air but bounces in front of point
"shorter and spins away outside off, allowing Ashwin to punchily defend off the back foot"
Ashwin presses forward to defend this full ball on off stump
"<b>caught behind</b>! Root is ecstatic and Foakes is magnificent and Pant is - after a little conversation with his partner potentially about a review - is gone. England may not have picked a second spinner but their captain has mitigated that with his very first ball and isn't it a beauty. Tossed up ever so invitingly from around the wicket, drawing the left-hander into a drive. But then it starts to dip. It will pitch well outside of Pant's reach but he's committed to the shot and throws his hands at the ball. The turn on offer does the rest, snatching the outside edge and Foakes will never miss a chance to prove his keeping credentials"
"flighted delivery on middle, Sundar defends"
"blocks a flighted delivery on middle. Good block too, long stride forward, soft hands to smother it"
pushes it through this time and Sundar plays it out from the crease
"quicker again, but this one remains full. Sundar stretches forward to defend outside off"
"round-arm to finish the over, Sundar protects his stumps well"
"steps out of his crease and chips the ball over mid-on. Outstanding shot from Ashwin. The footwork here is glorious. It isn't premeditated. It is, however, very quick and it gets him almost to the pitch of the ball and from there all he has to do is pick his spot"
"full and drifting nicely into leg stump, Ashwin defends"
blocks a flighted delivery on middle
"<b>sharp turn</b> and it beats the outside edge! Ashwin is drawn forward as the ball drifts into middle stump, grips and then rags square. Foakes is brilliant behind the stumps again, grabbing the ball and whipping the bails off in a flash"
"full on middle, defends"
"pushes it through on middle and leg, Ashwin presses forward to defend"
"if the batsman can't get to the pitch of the ball, these front foot defences are completely useless. Root slows it down, angles it into middle and the sharp turn beats Sundar"
<b>now the straighter one and he's nearly caught at short leg</b>. Sundar is forward to defend again but the length ball skids through to take his inside edge and nearly does him in
"flatter delivery on off stump, defends off the back foot"
brings out an inside out cover drive and looks quite solid doing so. Only downside is he doesn't beat the field
"too short on middle, Sundar goes back to block"
"loops it up outside off, Sundar lets it go. Good battle. Good cricket."
"defends a tossed up delivery on off stump and looks for a single, but Sundar has seen it go straight to backward point and says no"

presses forward on middle and off and defends

Root loops it up on middle from around the wicket, the length is nice and full, but this isn't the straighter one. It rips away past Washington's front-foot prod to hit the top of off stump. Big-turning offbreak from Root. Golden arm: two wickets, two maidens, zero runs scored off him"

"<strong>Axar cleans up Crawley first ball</strong>. Whoa! 90ks dart, full, slides in with the angle from around the wicket. The length is nice and full, but Crawley plays back to it and plays down the wrong line. Axar nails the stumps and celebrates another first-ball wicket. He had trapped Bairstow first ball in the first innings"
"Hat-trick for Axar at his home ground? Bairstow has been given out lbw, but he calls for a review. Quite similar to the Rohit dismissal earlier in the day. On a length, the new pink ball, slides in at off. Bairstow drops down to his knee, sweeps, and misses. No bat/glove involved. Thumped on the hip in line with off, but ball-tracking reckons it would've bounced over the stumps. So, umpire Anil Chaudhary on-field out decision is reversed in the end"
"<strong>Axar gets his man now. He sends back Bairstow for a pair</strong>. 93ks arm ball, fizzing in from around the wicket, Bairstow misjudges it and plays outside the line of it, searching for turn. Axar storms through his defences and celebrates once again. England: 0 for 2"

"Sibely dashes down the track, Ashwin tosses it around a leg-stump line from around the wicket, prodded in the air to the left of Pujara at leg-slip. <strong>The fielder can only finger-tip it away</strong>. Dropped, but that's a difficult chance"
"<b>Ashwin belts out an appeal for lbw, did that straighten enough?</b> The original decision is not out. Pushed through on middle, spins in to beat the inside edge and ping the front pad. The tracker suggests that it would've bounced over the stumps. Umpire Menon gets another one right"

Tossed up, dips, creating some distance between the bat and pitch of the ball and spins away into the gloves of Pant outside off. He smartly collects the ball to his right. Has Sibley nicked it? Yes, he has edged it while aiming for the sweep and Pant snaffles it. Sibley has to go. Good call from umpire Chaudhary"
