"flat and straight on middle, defended back"
"a tad quick outside off, fired in. Pushed to mid-off from the back foot for a run. No turn in the early going"
"another one darted in on leg, chipped to midwicket"
"and gone! Not a bad option, but quite terrible execution. Gets right across his stumps to sweep Hamza's darts over square leg, But the length is shorter and not quite a sweep-able delivery. Stirling attempts a pull and just plain misses it. Hits leg stump. Have to connect"
"slow and straight, a hint of turn, worked to midwicket with the angle"
"good over from Hamza. Flat and quick on leg, clipped away to midwicket"
"full and wide to start, too much width. Driven elegantly towards cover, but a misfield allows the ball to go through. Dived over the ball, to his right. Naughty"
"good adjustment in line. Full and straight, defended"
nicely played. Gets to the pitch and flicks away through midwicket for three. Knew his areas and his shot. Well done
"slow on off, the length is shorter, pushed to cover"
"darted in on middle and leg, Porterfield shovels it through midwicket with a strong bottom-handed flick. Good timing and finding a gap is all you need"
"good end, slow on off, blocked away towards cover"
"a full delivery outside off to start, driven away to cover"
"shot! That's Miller power and Miller bottom hand. Overpitched outside off, Thompson nails his cover drive between cover and mid-off. A T20 beauty."
"good length outside off, nice adjustment, Thompson misses his waft"
on the pads and flicked away for four more. Great batting. Playing on merit. On the leg stump and Thompson plays this late behind square
"on a length outside off, dabbed away towards backward point"
"good stop by Nabi. On a length outside off, carved away towards point. Nabi, at extra cover, dives to his right and saves runs"
drilled to long-off. A tad full there was Nabi
"nice. Slow on off, not too full. Blocked"
gets down and works the ball towards square leg for a run
"stops on Porterfield. Slow through the air on off, the length is short. Allows the ball room to turn. Chipped to cover on the bounce"
"fuller this time, driven to long-off"
"a mow across the line. Slow in the air on middle, Thompson runs down and squirts a heave to deep square leg"
"overpitched on middle and leg, flicked to mid-on"
"looking for the yorker, on middle and leg, jammed out to mid-on"
"again too full, outside off. Driven with decent timing but straight to mid-off"
"drags that length back, line is decent, around off. Clipped to midwicket"
"pressure getting to Porterfield. Gets down, aiming for a swipe through the leg side. No connection other than with the body"
"great fielding. On a length on off, heaved away to deep midwicket. The fielder runs across to his right and saves a couple"
"picks the length early, goes back and hammers a swat through midwicket off the short length. Well done again, this lad a powerful striker"
"massive. That's fantastic batting. Knew the full one was coming after the previous short delivery. Comes to the pitch, gets there and launches a mow over long-on. Maaasive"
"another misfield. No damage. Flat outside off, Thompson's sweep is fumbled by short fine leg"
"four more. That isn't great bowling. Short and wide outside off, slapped through cover from the back foot"
"19 off it now. This is too short again, Porterfield is hanging back and slogs a pull over midwicket. Knew his field and the stroke to get him four."
"that's gone through again. Shortish and wide, scythed away through cover. A half-stop results in a couple. 21 off the over"
"there's four more. Tripe bowling. Short and wide with not much pace, Thompson stands tall and nails a cut behind point for four"
guided off the open face down to third man for one
"on a length on middle, swung away down to fine leg"
"gets just enough to clear midwicket. Fullish on middle, squeezed over midwicket for a couple. No timing at all"
"almost takes out Porterwfield. Full and straight, Thompson brings out his bottom-handed power and drills a drive at his partner. Four to long-on. Wanted to go straighter but the ball will often go squarer because of the imbalance of power between both hands"
worked away for a run
"use of the feet, gets to the pitch, and drives to long-on for a run"
"shortish on leg, worked to deep midwicket"
"flat and quick on the pads, Thompson misses a wipe across the line, struck on the pad"
"looking to work one, the ball trickles back up the pitch off the pad"
"clattered back towards the bowler who sticks his right boot out and parries the ball for a couple, good stop"
worked away through midwicket for a couple to end another productive over for Ireland
"pace off the ball, a slower delivery on middle, slapped to mid-off"
thrashed down to long-off. Was hustled for pace there was Thompson
calmly pushed to long-off for another run
"shades of David Miller again! On a length on middle, Thompson stands in his crease and dispatches the pull waaaay over midwicket. All power"
"looks to go over cover. Great option, considering the ball was so far wide outside off. Just missed the stroke"
finishes well. A length outside off goes past the bat
fantastic batting. Gets low and reverse-sweeps past point. Another calculated risk that comes off.
worked away towards deep square leg
skews a drive over cover for a couple. Long-off cleans up
"that's taken. Flat on leg, Thompson comes down but doesn't get to the pitch of the ball. He lofts the ball anyway but doesn't get enough behind his lofted flick. Long-on gets around to his left and completes a relatively easy catch"
pushed away towards the sweeper cover for one
"did not pick the length at all. Went right back to an overpitched delivery, almost popped a catch to cover, but the ball makes its way to long-off"
"drilled back at Rashid, who stops the ball nonchalantly"
"full and wide from Rashid, O'Brien gives himself room and hammers a lofted drive over cover."
"fired in on off, pushed away down towards long-on"
"shortish and wide, tapped past cover for a couple off the back foot. Playing this exceptionally well so far"
"<strong>huge appeal</strong>. Not given. Flat and straight, spinning back in. Too much doubt?"
"inside-edged towards square leg. Porterfield calls for two, gets it with a fumble from the fielder running in."
"full and wide, a balanced drive to the sweeper cover"
"just very good cricketing options. Full and straight, Porterfield gets across, gets low and paddles the ball over fine leg for four. Makes it look easy"
"full and wide outside off, goes through the bat. Shahzad does a Dhoni, closes a gap between his legs and lets the ball hit his pads to save byes"
glided away towards point
"full and straight, driven down to long-off"
looking for a run. Tip and run. Doesn't connect. Full and wide. O'Brien misses. A good comeback into that over from Janat
"the googly on middle. There's chaos after that. I think Porterfield's gone. Absolute chaos. Slapped to cover who fumbles and allows the batsman to come back for the second. But there is a direct hit at the strikers end. And so, they decide to come back for the third. But there is a throw at the non-striker's end that hits the stumps too and this finds Porterfield short. So, what should have been a dot ball turns into two runs and a wicket. Never seen that sequence of events before."
"another googly, on middle. Pushed to cover"
"flat, wide and quick. The ball goes through"
"the legbreak that turns. Slow outside off, spins and takes the outside half towards point"
worked away towards the sweeper cover
"another googly outside off, pushed back towards the bowler. Just three runs off that over"
flipped to deep midwicket for a run
tapped to long-on for another single
"flat on the pads, ricochets towards short fine leg for a run"
gets across and nails his sweep to deep midwicket where the fielder gets across to his right and saves two. Good stuff
outside-halved down to short third man
"just over cover! Flat and quick on off, O'Brien doesn't time his lofted drive but gets enough for a couple"
swept to short fine leg. Shapoor is quick to it
"another googly on middle and leg, worked to deep square leg from the back foot"
"the legspinner and Rashid strikes! Was that be best option? May have not been picking him, which is why coming down makes it doubly streaky. He doesn't get to the pitch, nor does he pick the legbreak, nor does he make contact with his wild heave. Shahzad does the simple rest"
driven to long-off for a run
"shortish and wide outside off, mis-timed pull to long-on"
"another wrong 'un. Flat and wide outside off, played away to point"
"superb execution. Gets on one knee and laps the ball fine, past short fine leg for four. Easy."
"full and wide, slapped to the sweeper cover"
"cut away behind point for a couple, to third man. Nicely played"
attempts a lap scoop but the ball is wide outside off and slow. All he does is pop a ball towards square leg awkwardly
driven towards cover for a quick single
"full on a fourth-stump channel, and quick. Tucker beaten for pace as he misses a slog"
"slower ball on off, tapped towards cover for one"
"slower ball, well bowled. Plenty of pace off. Tucker is through his pull, deflects to the keeper off the body"
comes down and converts a full delivery into a yorker. Jams it out to point
"full delivery outside off, moves away late. Like Starc from around the wicket. Beats the bat"
carves a yorker straight to backward point. Another dot. Afghanistan roaring back into this game
"a low full toss outside off, sliced to deep point. Just three off that over"
much better option when you ain't picking the variations. Gets low and nails his sweep to the square leg boundary
played away towards backward point for a couple
works the ball towards mid-on for a single
the reverse-sweep. Gets a bit of bat down to short third man for a run
"googly outside off, cut to backward point"
"good finish. The ripping googly, Wilson chips down but doesn't get near the pitch. Plays the ball back"
"that's four. The yorker gone awry. A high full toss outside off, Wilson carves the ball over point for four. That was clearly over the waist too."
"a slower straight delivery on off, inside-edged towards the edge of the pitch. Shapoor puts in a dive"
superb shot. Gets low and scoops the ball over the keeper. Flawless execution of the lap sweep
"four more! Hammered. A short delivery on middle and leg, sits up for Tucker to thwack through midwicket."
"another high full toss. This is called a no-ball. But this can still be run-out. Did he get his bat back? He did, so that's two for Ireland. The batsman misses his cut, the keeper failed to collect cleanly. And the batsmen scampered a bye, the throw was good at the bowlers end."
"shortish delivery outside off, mis-timed pull to long-on for a couple"
"another short, slow delivery that sits up for Wilson, pulled to square leg. 18 off the over"
excellent yorker outside off. Nothing Wilson could do. Goes through to the keeper
"short, slow and outside off, slapped to deep cover for a couple"
heaved away to deep midwicket for a run
another reverse-sweep towards point. Just one more. Fantastic variations in this over
"this was in the slot and smashed. Slow and straight, Wilson stays in his crease, waits for the ball to come to him before swatting a six over deep midwicket"
"shovelled to long-on. The fielder can't prevent the second, but the fumble entices the third. Run-out at the striker's end in the bid to steal the extra run"
"floats it up and pitches on middle and leg, pushed off the front foot to the on side"
"some width on offer outside off, cuts and picks out point"
comes forward to this fullish length balla nd bunts it straight down the pitch
overpitched outside off and Shahzad lofts it over long-off. Does not really ge hold of it as he got it off the toe end of the bat but enough to carry to the boundary
pushed off the front foot back to the bowler
"backs away but the bowler follows him. Too short, however, and too easy for Shahzad who swivels around and pulls to deep square leg"
given too much air and bowls a harmless full toss around waist height. Tarakai makes full use of it and shovels it between long-on and deep midwicket with n angled bat. What a first delivery to get upfront
again pushes it too full and fails to make the ball pitch but this time it is on leg and coming on lower and it is pushed down to long-on
backs away to this short of a length ball and slap it away but there is not enough room and he cannot place it through the off side
"pitched up and on the pads of Shahzad who picks the length and trajectory early, gets down to sweep and gets it away fine"
"tries to tuck it away into the leg side with the angle, fullish length. The angle means it slides in more than he would have liked and he cannot make contact. Gets hit on the pads. appeal turned down as it was heading down leg"
"tossed up and sliding in with the arm, advances down the ground and works the angle to his effect to launch it through the midwicket region. This is some start for Afghanistan"
"fullish length ball on leg, defended off the front foot"
"length ball, angling down leg, not much pace on it and misses the flick as the ball cuts back in sharply."
"short, wide, that's a loose line and length to be bowling. Opens up his arms and slaps this har dhtrough the covers region"
too short and too wide again. Does not really get it away as intended. He was looking to flay it uppishly through the off side. Goes too hard at it and skews it off the outside edge to the third man region
punches it off the front foot towards mid-on. No run there
"short ball, just outside off. Shapes up to pull it away but the ball goes from beneath the bat and to the keeper. Appeal for caught behind from the keeper and the bowler follows him in appeal. But it did not look like there was any kind of bat involved there and it is not given"
"short of a length, angling in from outside off, stays leg side of it and punches it firmly to mid-off"
"short, wide, flays it over the covers region, slapped hard off the backfoot and no one in the deep. Can't be giving that much room to Shahzad"
"short of a length, nipping back in, pulled away with the angle to deep backward square leg"
"short ball, not much pace, does not bounce much as well as it goes over the bent back of the batsman and the keeper also fumbles as it bounces awkwardly in front of him"
"slow fuller ball outside off, waits for it to come on before carving it late through point for a single"
"short of a length, tries to pull and gets hit on the ribs as he goes through with the pull too early. No pace on that. Shahzad wants a single and comes down but is sent back by the non-striker. Direct hit could have seen the back of him and Shahzad isn't amused at all with that call from the non-striker. But Tarikai had a better idea of where the ball went as Shahzad was recovering from the blow and looking for the ball"
"full and on he pads, flicked away to square leg"
"backs away early and the bowler follows him with a fullish length ball that is pushed down the ground, through the mid-on region"
full and on the leg stump channel. Picked up off the pads and lofted clean and long over deep midwicket. Half-volley on the pads and even the change up in pace does not work in his favour
"overcompensates with line and length, short and width on offer outside off, Tarikai flays it to the left of the mid-off fielder with a horizontal bat"
"short of good length ball, shifts back to ride the bounce before dropping it in front of the covers region"
"good, smart catch by the wicketkeeper. Tarakai was looking to loft this over the leg side. Length and it stops on the batsman, so it does come on to him as well as he would have liked. Tries to slog it away and gets a leading edge that goes towards third man and the keeper runs across and snaffles it well"
dabs it into the leg side
Ireland's bowlers are not learning from their mistakes. Can't be bowling so short and outside off first ball to a new batsman. It is slapped off the backfoot and wide of the extra cover fielder
too short again and he swivels around and pulls. Gets it finer than he would have liked. It was a trap set up with a short fine leg in place. He fumbles and lets the ball go through the fingers. <b>Missed chance</b>
"short and room on offer outside off, stays firm on the backfoot and pulls it through midwicket"
"short and wide, opens the face of his bat late and steers it to third man"
"full and on the pads, clipped behind square"
""
""
""
"short and spinning away outside off, rocks on to the backfoot. It's a half-tracker and is dispatched over deep midwicket"
"good length ball, not spinning away much. He is playing for the turn and gets an insid eedge that does not miss the stumps by much"
stays back to this short of a length ball and drills it down to long-on
"sliding in with the arm on a fullish length, tucked behind square"
"<b>dropped</b>. Kevin O'Brien is the fielder at long-on. It is loopy and sliding in with the arm and Shahzad comes down the track and lofts it. O'Brien is moving to his left, just in front of the long-on boundary. Makes a reverse-cupped attempt and ends up spilling it. It falls to the right of him, in front of the boundary"
""
comes down the track and defends to the right of the bowler
"good length ball, comes on straight, defended from the crease to the right of the bowler"
comes down the track and targets the long-on region and this time it is clean. Goes a long way into the grassbanks. Shovels it with immense power and gets the timing right as well
stays back and tucks with the angle to backward square leg
too short but is rushed by extra pace and does not make good connection on the pull. Not enough room as well
rapped on the pads and the ball goes to fine leg. They try a leg bye and a direct throw could have seen the back of the batsman. But the throw is not direct. Shahzad was trying a dicey single
"googly from Mulder, not picked by the batsman and is hit in line with leg. Not given by the umpire"
third consecutive appeal. Short of a length and Shahzad looks to flick it away off the backfoot . Shahzad is not playing for the turn and gets rapped on the pads. Seems to be heading down leg and umpire seems to be indicating an inside edge as well
"loopy delivery, sliding in on middle and leg, raps Shahzad high on the pad and the ball goes behind square"
"full ball, just outside off, lofted clean and straight over the bowler. Long-off darts across and gets his hand to it but cannot stop it entirely and the ball goes to the long-off boundary"
makes room for himself early but the ball comes on very slowly to him and he has to wait for it before slapping it away to point. He is inside the ring and he cannot fire a direct throw as there is a yes and no
"coming on straight on off, defended"
"short of a length, cuts but not enough room and he cannot get it past cover"
"good length ball, angling in on leg, punched off the front foot to the right of the bowler who moves across and fields it"

"short ball, swivels around and pulls it clean and hard over deep midwicket. Sitting up nicely and picks the length early"
""
"fuller this time and room on offer outside off again, nails a slog sweep this time as the ball sails over deep midwicket"
does not middle the attempted slog this time and the ball goes off the inside part of the bat to deep midwicket
"very full ball, yorker length, pushed down the ground"
"full and angling in, pushed off the front foot to covers"
"length ball outside off, flays it with a flat bat to long-on"
"slower full ball, waits for it to come on before clipping it in front of midwicket for a single"
"short of a length ad nipping in on leg, swivels around and pulls but cannot make contact. The angle takes it further down and they take a bye as well as the ball gets away from the keeper"
"short, wide, gets the front leg out of the way and swats it with a flat bat to sweeper cover. Hit extremely hard"
"full on off, pushed off the front foot to extra cover. The fielder comes in early and throws but misses as they complete another tight single"
sprayed down the leg side. The batsman does not even attempt to play this one as the wicketkeeper tumbles to his  left and collects it
"advances down the ground to meet the pitch, comes on at a slow pace and he can only clip it gently to the midwicket region"
"length ball, comes down the track and knocks it to midwicket"
"short ball, not much room. Tries to manufacture some by backing away but cannot pierce backward point"
goes for a wild slog and cannot make good contact as the ball goes to the leg side
tucks it to short fine leg and takes off for a single. Throw fired at the bowler's end and the bails are whipped off. They go upstairs to check if he has made it back. Shahzad hardly grounds the bat or bends forward but he has made his ground
runs it down to long-off for a single
""
"shorter in length, backs away and flashes his bat to work it away wide of extra cover"
tries to pull and drags it wide of long-on
"short ball, lack of pace means he cannot find good timing as he pulls it away"
"too full, half-volley on the stumps and the bat swing is very quick as he drills it straight down the ground as the ball races away into the boundary"
"the running between these two was always dicey and their luck runs out now. Shahzad has been caught short of his crease at the keeper's end. It is a length ball and Shenwari uppishlu plays it to the leg side and takes off for a single. Mid-on who is slightly wide, comes running in and Shahzad, though he responds well initially, stops in the middle before continuing with the run. The moment's hesitation costs him"
slashes at this wide ball and works it to point
gets down to slog sweep. The ball is some good distance down the leg side so he does not have room. Gets it away off the inner part of the bat to deep fine leg for a boundary
"eased down to long-on, jogs the single to bring up the fifty"
"short of a length and spinning away, slapped to sweeper cover"
"length ball, stays in the crease and punches to midwicket"

"slower short ball, tries to pull it away and does not time it as the ball goes to fine leg"
"full and on leg stump, picked up off the pads and drilled hard between long-on and deep midwicket. This one's getting over in a hurry"
sprayed down the leg side. Ireland getting it all horribly wrong here. The batsman misses the glance and the keeper misses the ball as well as the wicketkeeper dived to his left and the ball goes to the fine leg boundary
sprayed down leg again and the keeper collects it this time
"full and angling away, comes forward and drives off the front foot to extra cover"
whatever Afghanistan are doing now are working in their favour. Short of a length and outside off. Not much room and does not sit up as well as he would have liked. Gets a top edge on the attempted pull and the ball goes on the bounce over third man
and another wide. Sprays it too wide outside off and the batsman chases it. Goes so wide that he almost loses balance as he reaches out for it. The ball misses the flashing blade and the wicketkeeper appeals for a catch as he takes it. Not given
Kevin O'Brien's struggle in this over ends with another boundary. Too full and lofted straight down the ground. One-bounce over the straight boundary
"angled down leg, misses the flick and the ball goes off the pad to the left of the diving wicketkeeper and towards fine leg"
"comes down the track and ends up nearly yorking himself, the ball goes off the inside part of the blade to the square leg region"
"fuller ball outside off, defended off the front foot into the off-side and the bowler runs to his left to cut it off"
"superb catch at long-on. They go upstairs to check if he has taken that fine, but does not seem like there's any problem. It was full and the batsman was using the inward angle and lofting it. It's the long part of the boundary there and the ball nearly carries but not over the fielder there. He moves to his right, takes it reverse-cupped and is arching back. The angle and momentum takes him over the ropes, so he flicks it in the air, crosses the boundary and steps back in to take it again. It's a pretty clean effort, no part of the foot was on the ropes"
"full and outside off, tries to squeeze it out through the off side and cannot make contact"
"good length outside off, drops it in front of covers off the front foot and they take a quick single"
"short of a length, no pace at all, tries to pull and goes through with the shot too early"

"short of good length, swivels around and pulls it to deep square leg. Just two needed now"
"fullish length outside off, eases it down to long-on for a single. Scores level"
"oh, gone! Got to ask, was that really necessary? Full and outside off and Nabi drills it hard through midwicket. Cannot keep it along the ground and sends it straight into the hands of the midwicket fielder"
"takes the aerial route to finish it off. Full and outside off, frees his arms and clears the long-on boundary. Shovels it from outside off and with the fielders inside the circle to prevent the single it was a chance he could liberally take. Makes clean contact and the ball sails a long way over the boundary"
