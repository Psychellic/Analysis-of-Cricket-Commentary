"straight and fast, he plays it on to his pad as he looks to whip it away on the onside"
straight and a little short in length. He defends it off the crease.
full and flicked on the onside past the man at short midwicket. Some good running between the wickets fetches them three
"short and just outside off-stump, he shoulders arms"
starts from outside off stump and then keeps going further away. He has nothing to do with this ball
"just cutting back in, but still outside off. Taps it defensively"
"a hint of shape away from the bat, as Fakhar comes down on it hard. Doesn't quite middle the intended cover drive, as the bat turns in his hands"
"hint of swing away again, as Fakhar looks to drive this too, but finds the bat turning. The ball squirts away to mid-on"
"straight and a bit shorter this time. Tucks the batsman for room, as he defends"
"straying down the leg side this time, and Fakhar tries to dab it away. Hits his pad, but doesn't go far enough to allow him to change ends"
short and he pushes it away to the off side and past the man at short cover. Easy single on offer before the man from cover can field it to his right
"straight ball, with a bit of swing in. He flicks it, but is fielded by short midwicket. He comes down the wicket but is sent back"
"short but towards the leg side, he smartly goes back to transfer his weight and tuck it away to the on side with soft hands"
"pitches this up, and Hafeez leans into a drive, but very well stopped by BJ Watling"
"a hint of away swing with a good-length ball, and coerces Hafeez into a drive. No movement of the feet, and he would be thankful he makes no contact"
"full, and drives it through the off side with a much better balance this time. <strong>First boundary of this match</strong>"
"short and cuts back into him, he plays it off the backfoot onto the man at short midwicket"
"full and takes the outside edge, but there's only one slip for Hafeez. Fielded at third man"
"straight ball, a hint of swing into Hafeez. He smartly plays it wide of the man at mid-on and picks up a single. There's a wide slip for him now."
"a little fuller, and <em>quicker</em>. Raps him on the pad as it cuts back into him, but they capitalise on this to switch ends again"
"straight and full, and just outside off. Hafeez punches it down the ground and picks up two. This is now a good phase of batting from these two"
"pitched up again, but doesn't get the kind of purchase he was hoping for, and Hafeez leans into it and places it through midwicket. Ferguson with a good attempt, and he might have saved a run here"
"short and tucks him up. He plays it away to the on side, where the man at square leg tidies up"
"this is short and wide, and Fakhar leans into it and pierces the infield. The ball pulls up and is fielded by Ish Sodhi"
"pitched up, and quick. Again gets the outside edge of Hafeez, but flies through the vacant gully region. Henry is definitely asking a few questions with his pace today"
"short, but a tad too straight. Fakhar hangs back and just swings it around the corner towards long leg"
"quick, and a touch short of length. Hafeez jumps onto his toes and defends this"
"short again, and this time Hafeez uses the incoming angle to just push it away to the on side and picks up a single in the vast swathes of space in the inner ring"

"full, and he drives it with soft hands, and picks a single before the man at mid-off can get to it"
"full ball, and Fakhar looks to carve this straight down the ground. The bat turns and takes it towards mid-on, he looks for a quick single but is sent back"
"a little slower through the air, and straight at his pads, and he looks to flick but doesn't time it well enough to pierce the infield"
"another slower one, but is far too close to Fakhar this time. He waits on it, and then leans into it and flicks it away imperiously through the midwicket region. <strong>Class!</strong>"
"too straight again, and this time he whips it away with his bottom hand dominating. Boult must correct his line when bowling to Fakhar Zaman."
"shorter and a bit more to the offside. This time, he drops it with soft hands and picks up a quick single"
"angles across him, and Hafeez plays it defensively off the front foot"
"back of a length, and quick! Fakhar hurried into a defensive prod, as he looks like he was shaped to hit it through the offside"
"short and outside off stump, and Fakhar looks to fetch it. Seems caught in two minds, and eventually does well to roll his wrists and just hang back on the intended hook"
"this is pitched up, but too straight again. Fakhar launches into it, and flicks it beautifully. Terrific timing there."
"a little outside off stump, and this time he looks to drive. It goes far too quickly to covers to allow him to rotate strike. The boundaries are coming easily, though"
"angled across him, and he defends off the front foot"
fuller and straighter. Fakhar has to defend this one
"angles across him, and there's a bit of extra bounce as well. Hafeez tries to nurdle this towards third man, but doesn't get close enough to it, as it whizzes through to Latham"
"a full ball, and straighter this time. He goes on to the front foot, but can only defend it"
"this time Hafeez comes down the track and looks to take a shorter ball by the scruff of the neck. Toe-end of the bat, but only floats towards mid-on, with no pace. Enough time to get a single"
"short again, and Fakhar plays it with soft hands. dropping it at his feet. Great running between the wickets"
"short again, and he defends up in the air. Not enough space for a quick single here"
"straight ball, that he works off his legs and gets it down to the backward square leg fielder"
"short, and he plays it down towards short fine-leg...and picks up a single!"
"straight, and he leans into it. That is <em>perfection</em> in timing, as he gets it past the sprawling man up at mid-off. Great shot, Fakhar!"
"slower ball, and he plays it with soft hands. Looks for a quick single, but the man at point is quick to cut the angle off"
"short ball, and he gets suckered into playing the hook. Mistimes it, but it falls short of Lockie Ferguson at short fine-leg. He could have dived for this..."
"straight ball, that he drives back at the bowler. Henry fields and has a shy at the stumps, but misses"
"straight and full, which he drives down the on-side. Rockets quickly to Ish Sodhi at mid-on"
"fast but way outside off. Hafeez has a think, but lets it pass"
"short and quick. He bowls it from wide of the crease and angles into Hafeez, and has him <em>hopping</em>. Well played though."
"short and fast again, and this time it takes the outside of the bat. Hafeez does well to just ensure his hands are soft, as it runs down to third man"
full and just misses the yorker length. Fakhar can use the pace of the ball to just whip it around the corner and pick up an easy two
"quick again, and hurries him up. Can just drop it dead near his feet"
"back of a length and attacking the thigh again, Zaman does not have much room to work with. Simply deflected off the pads square through the leg side"

"short and <strong>zipping off the pitch outside off, 146ks</strong>, Hafeez is late onto it, and is beaten again. Chest-high take for Latham"
"<strong>Is Hafeez out hit wicket?</strong> Has his heel tipped the bail off? NZ think they have their man. The TV umpire has been called in. Ferguson kept pushing Hafeez back with the short stuff. This is short again, at the body, he jumps back and whips it away to long leg. But in the process he has dislodged his own bail. What a way to go"

"short and he looks to swivel it away beyond short fine-leg, but only picks up a single."
short but enough time for Azam to rock back and force it through the offside
short and fast. Sohail forced to defend this one. Why didn't New Zealand go to Ferguson before?
"going down the leg side, and it seems to take the pad along the way. Latham dives away to his right and comes up with a superb stop"
"short again, and this time Sohail has time to just hang back and steer it down to third man"
"fast and full, he drives but gets it to Nicholls at point. He fires it in and hits the stumps at the non-striker's end. Batsman is safe, though"

"tossed up, and he comes forward and defends"
"<strong>FIRST MAXIMUM AND A FIFTY TOO!</strong> It was short, and he rocked back and got it through cow corner. Almos carried to the fielder there"
comes down the wicket and chips it to midwicket
short and he goes back and forces it through the offside
"well bowled! Just held the ball up a bit, and Sohail tried to make room, but was beaten by the turn that made him play outside the line"
"big turn again, and this time he works it to the offside after making a massive amount of room! Encouraging signs for the Pakistan spinners"
round the wicket and straight and fast. Sohail does well to nudge it away to the onside. He also brought up his 50 with the six in the previous over
straight and defended straight down to mid-off
"slightly fuller, but still quick enough to only allow Azam to drive this off the back foot. The man at cover is quick to get to the ball"
"fast and short, but a bit of width. Azam plays an uppish cut that goes down to the sweeper at the point boundary"
"short and well-directed, Sohail ducks into it. He looks interested to see if he can get a wide out of umpires Raza and Wilson, but they only call one bouncer for the over"
"this will have to be re-bowled. Striving for extra pace, strays down the leg side"
"fast and into him, and Sohail plays a defensive poke to the off-side"
"wide, and this has been cut beautifully by Azam. He brings up his fifty with a two, and the first to applaud him is Sarfraz from the players' balcony"
"play and a miss! Good length ball, and just a bit of shape away, probably a slower ball, and he misses out on the drive"
"fullish ball, and he smacks it straight down the ground. Terrific piece of timing, and not much of a follow-through, either, as he creams it past the man at mid-off"
"pitched up, and he drives it wide to the left of the man at mid-off"
"<strong>TAKE THAT!</strong> Length ball, and he makes room and then muscles it over midwicket, and that has gone at least about 10 rows back in the stands"
"fuller ball, and he drives it to point."
"slower ball, and he looks to cut it, but misses"
"outside off stump, and seemed to be slower through the air. Azam threw the kitchen-sink, and all he got was an outside edge down to third man"
"strays down the leg side, and Sohail shapes to glance it. Misses out, but it is called wide anyway"
"<strong>terrific catch</strong> in the deep and a <strong>huge wicket</strong>! Another slower ball, and lures Sohail into playing a mistimed flick. There was still some work for Worker to do (no pun intended, I promise!) and he did it effortlessly at the square leg fence, running forward and taking a superb low catch"
"short and fast, and Azam is late on the cut this time."
"short and cutting into him, he just opens the face of the bat and runs it down to third man"
"full but down the leg side. He walks across and flicks it down to the long leg region. Good over from Ferguson, this"
tossed up and drawing Malik forward. He dabs it and looks for a single
"a little shorter this time, and Malik does well to place his cut wide enough of the cover fielder to force him to run around his left and clean up"
"tossed up, and he drives it down the ground, but too close to the man at cover"
"short, and he pulls it away, but there's a sweeper in the deep in Boult"
"big turn, and Azam had already shaped to play it to the on side. In the end almost had to fetch it from the fifth stump, but did well to run hard as the ball went into the outfield"
"off the back foot, he plays it through the vacant in-field on the on side and picks up two. Great hustling by Azam and Malik to make this a very good over for Pakistan in the end"
"fast and outside off, from where Malik forces him towards the point fence"
"<strong>terrific shot</strong>! Much fuller in length, and Azam was waiting for it, just flicked it and did it with enough force to put it over the man at midwicket"
"fast again, and he glides it down to third man. Some <em>terrific running</em> again to hustle the fielder and pick up two here."
short and he's banged this away on the on-side. There's a good bit of fielding at the square leg fence to keep it down to a single
"slower ball outside off, and Malik reads it well. Just back-cuts it down towards third man, and they steal a couple before Sodhi can rifle in his throw"
"short and Malik looks to play this away on the on side. Comes off his glove, and then harmlessly rolls down to Latham down the leg-side, on the first bounce"
"rifled in from round the wicket, and full enough to cramp him for room. Can only squirt it away to short midwicket"
"short and slow, and he half-pulls it away to the on-side"
"full and slow, and he just pats it away with soft hands and quickly rotates the strike"
"outside off and full, Azam jams his bat down on it and gets it to the man at point. Quick running again to steal a single"
outside off and this time he drives it through the in-field. They pick up two before the man at the sweeper position can send in his return
"played away on the on-side, but there's a fielder there. Just five off this over"
"<strong>WHAT A SHOT!</strong> Not a great ball to be honest. It was more of a loosener, outside off, and he goes inside out and whacks it out of the field. Great start to a crucial over"
"another wide ball, and he goes for a shot again. Top-edges it, but gets it past the infield on the offside"
"fast and full, and the batsmen takes it on the bat before it can bounce. Forces it away to the offside for an easy single"
"slower ball, and Azam has done well to hold back on his shot. In the end, he takes it just off his chest and plays it down to the long leg region"
"well wide of the crease, and he squirts it over point for a single. Would probably have been called wide if he had let it alone. Great over already for Pakistan"
"bowls it wide, and this time Shozab Raza does call it wide, as Babar Azam lets it go. New Zealand's discipline has been good, on the whole"
"full and straighter, and Azam misses out as he tries a delicate dab towards third man"
"full toss and he looks to drive it. Goes off the toe-end and straight towards the man at mid-off, whom he was aiming to clear"
"straighter ball, and he looks for a hoick across the line. An inside edge carries it down to fine leg, who attacks the ball and keeps it down to a single"
"short and slow, and he pulls it away and picks up two before the return can come in to Latham. Lots of spaces at this Dubai stadium, and running will be a critical part of the Kiwi batting effort, too"
"pitched up, Malik plays it with soft hands and pushes for two. Excellent running, as they took on Nicholls' throw from the deep"
slower and straighter from Boult. He chops it down the ground and plays it to Ross Taylor at cover
"straight and full, and he goes down to Sodhi at a wide mid-off position. Eight off this over then"
"<strong>DROPPED!</strong> This is not typical of New Zealand. Short ball, and Azam got a hold of it, and it was going straight down Henry Nicholls' throat. He got to it, but just saw it pop out. Eventually, did well to keep it from going for four. They are checking on it"
"this time it is wide and full, and Malik miscues his heave through the offside. It goes towards Worker on the point boundary, who runs around to his left and picks up the catch. The end of a short but effective little innings from Shoaib Malik"
"full and wide again, and this time he taps it down towards point with soft hands"
"a full toss outside off, and he steers it down to third man"
"outside off, and he steers it with an open face of the bat to the left of Worker at the deep backward point region. Easy two on offer in this huge ground"
"full and drives on the up, but there's a fielder in the deep to clean this up."
"short ball from Ferguson, but Azam does well to drop-kick it down towards long leg. Doesn't hit it too hard, and that enables them to come back for the second. This has been a superb innings from him"
this one beats him. Hurries past him just outside off
"short and he guides it to the off side and takes on the arm of the fielder in the deep. It's a poor throw, and an opportunity missed for the New Zealand team. They have been a little poor in the field today"
"fast and full, but too straight, and it enables Azam to drive down the ground. <strong>He's on to 90 now</strong>"
"short from Ferguson, and Asif looks to pull it but is hurried into the shot. Can only play it away to the deep midwicket region"
"very good full ball, and Azam does well to get some bat on to it. Asif calls him through for a single as the ball drops over to the on-side. <strong>It was a ball timed at 146 kph</strong>."
"full and straight, and he can only play it away on the onside. There's no in-fielder there, so an easy single on offer"
"oh, a full ball and wide too. Just within the tramlines, though, and Asif makes no contact despite having a waft at it"
"full and straight again. This time, he plays it away to the point fielder and gives the strike back to Azam, who is on 92"
"slower ball, and he saw it right through and had a heave towards the midwicket fence. Miscues the shot, though, and it <strong>carries all the way to Nicholls</strong>. This time he holds on, and that's the end of a very useful innings for Pakistan."
"full toss and straying down leg, Ashraf gets a shot away, and they look for three. The first throw is wayward, and the backing up is poor too. <strong>They have actually run FIVE here</strong>! Sums up the effort from New Zealand today"
"full ball, and has been flicked with some great power. The fielder is a mere spectator, as Asif Ali adds some much-needed muscle to this finish from Pakistan."
"<strong>GOT HIM WITH A SLOWER BALL!</strong> Looks like a back-of-the-hand, or at least from the side of the hand, from Ferguson, and it was as straight as it could be. Ashraf looks for a big heave down the ground, but only hears the death rattle behind him."
"short and he plays it away on the onside without knowing much about where it went. It falls between the man at short midwicket, and the backward square leg fielder running in"
"beaten by the lack of pace again, but the batsmen do well to switch ends"
"<strong>TIMBER!</strong> Full, straight, and fast. You miss, I hit, he seems to say, and he walks the talk. Fourth wicket for Ferguson. Why Latham didn't turn to him earlier, we would not know, but perhaps that has made the critical difference between allowing Pakistan to post a winning total and not?"
"short and slow, and Sarfraz has to watch it till the last second before tucking it away to the fine leg fielder"
"short ball and that's a <strong>FIVER for Ferguson</strong>! Intelligent lengths and changes in pace, and Lockie Ferguson gets another wicket, as the short ball is whacked by Hasan only in the air on the onside, where Worker does the rest. This is still a fine total by Pakistan, as they finish at 279 for 8. That's 11 more than what they got batting first the last time they clinched a <a href='http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/13008/scorecard/473927/new-zealand-vs-pakistan-5th-odi-pakistan-tour-of-new-zealand-2010-11' target='_blank'>bilateral series against New Zealand in February 2011</a>."
"back of a length and outside off from over the stumps, wobbles away late, no shot. Off-side wide to start"
"similar length and Afridi gets this to seam back into the left-hander, still no shot from Worker"
"Re-set the radar, Shaheen. Shorter and banged down leg, still no touch from Worker"
"back of a length and holds its line outside off, Worker seeks to force the ball through the covers. Instead, he inside-edges the ball to the midwicket region"
back of a length and ducks back into a solid punch to mid-on
"Afridi, you beauty! This is a terrific ball, which <strong>storms through the gate of Munro</strong>. Fuller than a good length, Shaheen lands this on the seam, jags back in, breaches the weak defences of Munro. This is the reason why he has been fast-tracked to the Test squad, despite playing only two first-class games so far. He's a special talent. Isn't he?"
"rising short ball outside off, pulled weakly to midwicket"
"short and outside off, punched to point"
"straying onto the hips, duly glanced to long leg from the crease"
"back of a length and angling away outside off from over the stumps, knocked to short cover"
"back of a length and attacking off stump, Worker moves forward to dead-bat it away"
"back of a length and angling away outside off, back-foot drive from Worker but can't pierce the packed off-side ring"
"hip-high short ball on middle, swatted away to long leg off the back foot"
"Nicholls finds the gap on the off side. Back of a length and angling away outside off, punched past the right of short extra cover"
"short and Afridi hits the bat hard outside off, jabbed down to deep third man with an open face"
"back of a length and aiming for middle, Nicholls' punch to mid-off intervenes"
"back of a length on middle, clipped to midwicket. There's a misfield and a mix-up, but just a single in the end"
"back of a length on middle, again, jabbed to mid-on"
"much fuller and outside off, presses forward and drives it straight down the ground, bisecting mid-on and mid-off"
"pitched further up and outside off, Nicholls leans into a drive but can't beat short cover"
"full around off, gets forward and pushes it back to the bowler"
"short and angling away outside off, glided with the angle to deep third man"
"short and on off, stabbed back to Ashraf"
"short on top of off, a back-foot force to short cover ensues"
"fuller and holds its line outside off, driven straight of mid-off off the front foot"
walks forward and taps a single to mid-on from off stump. Good running from Nicholls and Worker
"nice and full on off, Worker covers up in defence, and the ball rolls away to short cover"
rides the bounce of this short ball outside off and finds a single to deep third man
"excellent inswinging yorker on leg stump, <strong>homing in at 141.8ks</strong>, jammed square through the leg side"
"back of a length and on off, tip and run to short cover. Again, good running from these two"
"on a length and just a shade outside off, opens the face and dabs to point"
"on a length and outside off,driven on the up but can't beat short cover"
"shortish on off, worked to mid-on for a hustled single. These two are keeping the fielders on their toes"
"What was that, Worker? He runs down the track, hacks to the leg side, but misses it by a long way. Ashraf found some seam movement as well, making life tough for the batsman"
"Okay, now Worker steps out and thumps it to the midwicket boundary - the first in the chase. He ventures down the pitch, meets a short ball outside off and muscles it away. Dismissed"
"back of a length and angling into the pads, follows muscle with finesse, picked away fine of short fine leg"
on a length and <strong>skids back in</strong> to beat the inside edge and ping him on the pad
"on a length and slanting in towards off, prodded back to the bowler"
"very full and sprayed into the pads, full-blooded flick from the batsman, but Haris swoops in and dives to his right to collect the ball at short midwicket"
"back of a length and angling in, Afridi has Nicholls falling over the flick but this is surely heading down leg with the sharp angle from over the wicket. He barely appeals"
"short and outside off, punches outside the line and inadvertently sends an inside edge to square leg"
"full and outside off, driven through the line to mid-off. A fumble there from Zaman allows a single"
"short and outside off, Nicholls swivels on the back foot, gets on top of it and times a pull behind square on the leg side"
