"overpitched, lots of width, and Ambris hardly has to move his feet to clatter that over mid-off"

"back of a length on off stump, makes a bit of room and slashes to backward point"
"makes plenty of room before the bowler delivers, and receives a back-of-a-length ball on off stump. He's created room to free his arms, and he does just that to lift it effortlessly over the covers. Top shot"

"full on middle stump, driven back to the bowler"
"full on off stump, and he drives inside-out, into the gap to the right of mid-off"
"flat length ball on off stump, can't make enough room to really give this a proper slap. Stabs it to the man at cover point"

"shortish, straightens towards leg stump to tuck Soumya up for room. Jabs it away to backward point"
"edged, and it's wide of the keeper! Shortish, angling away from off stump. Not too much room, and I think he was trying to dab it past the wide slip, ended up edging it much finer than intended, past the left glove of the diving keeper"
"excellent bouncer, rising steeply over leg stump, and Soumya falls over backwards, literally, to evade it. Did well to keep his eye on the ball though"
"length ball angling away from off stump, and the previous ball slowed down Soumya's front-foot movement to this one. A little late coming forward to push into the point region, and the ball slides past his open bat face"
"back of a length on off stump, tucked away with soft hands through square leg, and the man has to come in a long way off the boundary so they can run two"
"sharp short ball creates the chance, and Ashley Nurse puts down a dolly! It's up at shoulder height and he's caught between pulling and fending, and in the end he sends it ballooning up towards short third man. Nurse gets right under it, gets both hands to it, and puts it down"
"bang. Full on middle stump, and he clears his front leg and launches it cleanly over the wide long-on boundary"
"different length, similar region, four more. Back of a length, on middle and leg, and he clears his front leg and swats it away over midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, and he pulls fiercely again, can't beat the man at midwicket"
"back of a length, lots of width, cracked away past the tumbling fielder at backward point. Was that a misfield?"
"back of a length on off stump, nudged away quietly through midwicket to bring Soumya back on strike"
"shot! Soumya's batting on another planet here. Short, angling away from off stump, gets up to chest height, and he picks the length so quickly, he's able to meet it well in front of his body with a full extension of his arms, and pull it all the way over the square midwicket boundary"
"shortish on off stump, lets it come on and uses the pace to guide it down to third man"
"length ball close to off stump, jumps across and dabs gently into the covers"
"what a brilliant shot that is! Length ball angling across into a fifth-stump line, and Soumya takes a big step back and across, head nice and still right through, and then flicks it away to the right of the short fine leg fielder"
"short, angling away into a fairly wide line outside off. Looks to open his bat face and ramp it over the wide slip, but can't put bat to ball"
"length ball angling across to off stump. Takes a big step back and across, then forward and across, and drives to the left of mid-on"
"length ball on middle stump, stays leg-side of the ball and bunts it gently into the off side with soft hands. They quickly decide on the quick single, and Tamim makes it easily to the striker's end, defying Holder's attempt to kick the ball into the stumps, which misses anyway"
"down the track comes Tamim, and Holder slants it wide of off stump. Goes for the big flat-bat hit over the covers, fails to connect"
"short on off stump, takes a big step across and pulls in the air, on the bounce to the left of deep square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, opens his bat face and steers to third man. That brings up Bangladesh's 50"
"again short on off stump, and again he looks to shuffle across and pull. He's looking to go over short fine leg, but can't get it as fine as he'd like, or off the middle of his bat either, and it lands somewhere between that fielder and the man at deep square leg"
"bang. Length ball angling across to off stump, and he takes a step out of his crease, moving away from the line to make himself swinging room, and smacks it between the umpire and the non-striker"
"four more. Down the track again, making a lot of room again, and he lofts the leg-stump length ball up and over wide mid-off. Doesn't quite middle it, but he gets it well over the fielder in the circle"
"down the track again, and this time Gabriel bangs it in short, invites Tamim to hit the shoulder-high ball over mid-off. Goes through with the shot, ends up hitting it high rather than far, and he ends up hitting it down the throat of Holder at mid-off. An exchange of words between Gabriel and Tamim as he makes his way off the ground"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and dabs to third man"
"bouncer angling down leg, misses the hook. Not called wide - wasn't too far from leg stump and he'd taken a step across anyway"
"big appeal, given! Back of a length, and it nips in and keeps a touch low, maybe. Looks to work it leg side and the ball beats his inside edge and hits front pad. Given out by Richard Kettleborough, and there's no DRS, so Sabbir will have to walk back even though it may juuust have been going down leg. We'll have to watch a few replays to know for sure"
"overpitched, lots of width, and even though cover point is out on the boundary there's no stopping this drive, timed so sweetly into the gap to the left of the fielder"
"fullish on off stump, and Soumya kind of outsmarts himself by taking a big, premeditated step back into his crease. Gets a touch too far underneath the ball in the attempt to hit over mid-off, so he doesn't quite get the desired power on it, but it doesn't matter. Clears the fielder and rolls down to the boundary"

"short, gets up to shoulder height on off stump, and Mushfiqur controls his hook really well to hit it along the ground to deep square leg"

"shortish close to off stump, chopped down to third man, rolling his wrists over on top of the bounce"

"length ball slanting across the stumps, looks to slog across the line and inside-edges into his pad"
"shortish on off stump, pulled in the air, but on the bounce, to deep midwicket. He's got to be careful with this shot now that that fielder has dropped back"
"short ball on off stump, rises pretty steeply, and it looks like he was early on the pull. The ball misses his top edge and hits him on the grille of the helmet. Doesn't spend too long nursing his wound. Takes his helmet off, checks if the grille is fastened properly, gives his head a bit of a shake, and puts it back on"
