"comes roaring in to delivery a very full delivery outside off, Tamim watches it squirt past to the wicketkeeper. No real carry"
"<b>what a ripper</b>! Cummins got Tamim with a similar ball in the second innings in Dhaka, hitting the deck on a good length and getting the ball to nip away like a meanie. Sensational stuff."

"good length, outside off, Tamim brings his bat down and tucks it behind his pad"
"lands the yorker just outside off at 140 kph, Tamim squeezes it out to second slip on the bounce. <b>A smidge of awayswing there</b>"

"good length ball, from around the wicket, pitches just outside off and is allowed to go through to the wicketkeeper"
"loops it up and drifts it into Sarkar, who comes forward and blocks calmly"
"a little turn as Lyon pushes the ball through, giving it a lot more rip, and Sarkar defends cautiously"
"<b>lbw appeal</b> as the good length ball skids on with the angle, beats Sarkar's forward press and hits him on the pad. Would have slid down"
"<b>inside edge squirts between the keeper's feet</b>. That's rather unfortunate, Wade is preparing to collect the orthodox top edge as Sarkar cuts, he can't possibly be blamed for the under edge sneaking past him"

"135 kph, bangs it into the deck on off stump and strings it across the left-hander, who isn't tempted"
"gets a little leading edge to the right of mid-off as Cummins, producing away movement off the pitch, lands it on leg stump and makes Tamim close the face early"
"wobble seam delivery, targeting off stump and darting away past Sarkar. The batsman, to his credit, did not flirt with it"
defends a shortish delivery at 143 kph under his eyes
"<b>inside edge</b> as Tamim is forced to bring his bat down a little quicker, and a lot straighter than he would have liked. This is a quick, good length delivery on off stump, and though it is the orthodox offbreak, the newness of the ball makes it skid on and threaten lbw"
"steps out of his crease and pads up at that point, knowing he's too far out to be in trouble"
blocks a good length ball on middle
"<b>hint of turn</b> as Lyon tosses it up outside off, Tamim defends, gets an outside edge through backward point"
"wanders out of his crease, but Lyon shortens his length, and gets some turn to make Tamim check his shot. Half a shout for lbw, but to no avail"
"shortish on middle, Tamim whips it to midwicket"
drives on the up the fuller ball outside off. Toe-ends it to cover
"<b>appeal for a catch</b> as third slip runs forward to collect the ball off a ducking Tamim. No dice from the umpire. But what a bouncer from Cummins. Thunders in and gets it to rise towards the batsman's nose, and because of that, Tamim takes evasive action, taking his eyes off the ball and getting hit on the leading shoulder"
works it to square leg
<b>beats the outside edge</b>. This is special from Cummins. He's got the pace up - 146 kph - and he's generating movement off a pitch that really doesn't care much for fast bowlers. Seams away past an in-form batsman
"pitches it up now, seeking the edge, but Tamim doesn't oblige."
pulls his bat inside the line of a shortish delivery at 141 kph. Darts through to the keeper
keeps back and clips a good length ball past short leg's left
"<b>keeps going straight</b> as Lyon pitches it on off stump. Good on Sarkar to present the full face. New ball, won't turn."
"tosses it up on off stump, Sarkar defends, head right over the ball"

"fuller delivery on off stump, blocks"
"fuller delivery on off stump, Sarkar keeps it out. <b>Back-to-back maidens</b>"
"<b>dropped</b> by Maxwell at third slip. Poor Pat Cummins. He's been bowling splendidly on a docile pitch and yet it seemed only a matter of time before he would get Tamim's outside edge. It was a hard-handed push, and with the slips standing reasonably close, Maxwell is surprised by the pace at which the ball arrives. Has to move to his right, straight in, straight out"

pushes a good length ball to cover
"pushes him back with a short ball at 138 kph, Tamim defends on middle"
brings him forward now with a 143 kph good length ball on off stump. Stoic defence from Tamim
"has a flash at a short and wide delivery - went after it whole-heartedly - and is beaten. In any case, the outside edge would have flown over the slips at Cummins' pace and with Tamim's hard hands"
"141kph, leaves the good length ball snaking across him"
too straight and Tamim flicks him to long leg
"<b>ripper</b>, as he pins Sarkar to his crease, then squares him up and finally beats the outside edge with a 141 kph away seamer."
"<b>pins him lbw</b>. Lovely change of pace from Lyon! This is quicker, having spent much of the morning tossing the ball up. Tamim is too late in bringing his bat down. Worse, his front pad is right in front of middle and off, and that means he has to bring it across to have any hope of meeting the ball. Can't do so. And the ball has a free path to skid on and strike low on the front pad."
"<b>gets it to straighten</b> on off stump by bowling slower, tossing the ball up. Kayes defends"
"loops it up, gets it to dip just outside off and has Kayes reaching away from his body to block"
"goes for the quicker ball, hoping that the batsman will be pushing across on that front foot again, but he drops it way short. Kayes heaves it over midwicket"
"goes back and blocks a good length ball that bounces appreciably. Well controlled, with soft hands from Kayes"
"pushes it through on off stump, Kayes goes back and blocks with a straight bat. Probing over, successful over. Australia can return to concentrating on their plans without thinking about that Tamim drop."
"good length ball, from around the wicket, on middle and leg, Sarkar tucks it past short leg's left"

"keeps out a quicker, fuller delivery, with the inside edge"
slices a good length ball to point
"good lenght, just outside off, Kayes blocks"
"defends inside the line of a tossed up delivery on middle, expecting turn, but the ball is still new and it slides on with the arm as O'Keefe continues around the wicket. Kayes off the mark with a streaky single to third man"
"goes for a sweep, and he could nearly have been bowled around the legs. He mis-hits the ball and it nearly rolls back to topple his castle"
presses forward to block on off stump
flicks a shortish delivery on his pads between the two bat pads
"steps out of his crease, to ward the close-in fielders away, and flicks a flighted ball through midwicket"
"shifts back, expecting the ball to come on with the angle, and by virtue of that, he is in the best place to flick it behind square"
"pushes it through on leg stump, Kayes punches it to midwicket. Decent bounce for Lyon"
gets a good length ball to straighten on middle and so the batsman defending inside the line gets an outside edge
"<B>huge appeal for lbw, umpire Llong says no, but Smith has called for the review</b> And Australia celebrate again. Lyon on song. He is testing both edges of the bat by varying his pace and flight - when its slow and loopy, the ball straightens from around the wicket to the left-hander. When its quicker, it skids on, and at that point batsman can't be playing across the line. Kayes doesn't care for that. He's under pressure and he wants to dispel it. Goes for the big slog sweep. Doesn't connect. Struck low on the front pad, replays indicate its in line with off stump, and this pitch doesn't have the bounce for the ball to lob over the stumps"
"moves back and across to block a good length ball on off stump. Well, mostly off the inside edge"
"tosses it up on middle, Mominul expects it to straighten as he blocks on off stump, but it keeps going on with the arm and takes the inside edge past short leg. Good soft hands from the batsman"
steps out of his crease and clips a full delivery on middle to mid-on
"<B>keeps so very low</b> and Wade grabs it, sensationally! They go up for the caught behind, upon hearing a noise. But that might be bat hitting ground as Sarkar cuts"
races down the pitch and whips it to midwicket
"hangs back and blocks a reasonably full delivery on off stump, playing with soft hands"
"loads up a sweep, but one of the two short legs is in the way of him securing runs"
"a little short and too straight, allows the under-pressure Sarkar to clip behind square"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
"he has to reach out, and bring his wrists into play, all of which ensure that though he isn't to the pitch of the ball, his cover drive screams away into the gap. Great shot, but he was made to take a lot of risk for it"
goes back to a good length ball on off stump and defends
"another risky slash outside off, but it wanders out safely to point"
"nicely done, as he moves back to the flatter delivery and clips it to short fine leg. Good field placings from Australia. Leads a good shot to no runs"
"that's brilliant! Charges out of his crease to the tossed up ball and launches it over long-on to stir the crowd up a little. Sarkar is a lovely, free-flowing batsman when he can get into the groove"
"loops it up on middle, from around the wicket, Mominul blocks"
"too far down lag and Mominul sweeps hard, keeping the ball down. It deflects off Handscomb at short leg out to the man at long leg"
taps a full delivery on off stump to long-on
nudges a full delivery on middle to midwicket
"another sweep with O'Keefe straying on the pads, bowling around the wicket to the left-hander, Mominul places it nicely behind square"
"shifts back to then take advantage of another ball that's too straight from O'Keefe. Lyon spins the ball away so he can afford fine leg being up. O'Keefe spins it into the left-hander, so he prefers giving the single out there rather than leaking a boundary"
"not entirely short enough to pull as the ball zips into him, Sarkar pulls and the ball lobs off his thigh pad"
sweeps hard the ball on leg stump to deep square leg
"shifts back to punch a quicker, flatter delivery on off stump. Excellent footwork"
"shortish and outside off, Mominul moves back and dabs it to backward point. Lovely shot, plays so late"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
brings him forward to defend outside off
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"<b>catch</b> is the cry, but the flick off the pads lands safely between midwicket and mid-on. Seems like this good length ball has held in the pitch just a touch"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"gets the pull shot going, but he isn't fully confident in playing it. Finds midwicket"
"full on off stump, as Cummins switches over the wicket. Sarkar protects his castle well"
"back of a length and outside off, Mominul punches it through cover. He's looking very good in the short time he's been out there. Unhurried. Precise with his footwork, getting him in all the right places to face the ball"

pats a tossed up ball to long-on

"<b>drift</b> away, which tempts Mominul into a false shot, a push into the covers. The ball pitches before he can reach it and turns just enough to take the outside edge"
"tosses it up outside off, drives to cover"
"skips out of his crease and hits with the turn over midwicket. Backs himself to clear the man, and does so, just about."

spears a cover drive to the right of the fielder for a single
"<b>just past the first slip</b>! Bangladesh have their fifty with Mominul attempting a late cut, and getting more of the edge than the face of the bat. Smith dives to his left, full length, but he has no chance"
"<b>goes on with the angle</b> past the left-hander's outside edge. Good on Mominul to ensure that though he is lunging forward to block, the back foot stays grounded behind the crease"

"and now for the fuller delivery, and to Mominul's credit, he does come forward to flick past short midwicket. It was uppish though and only a few yards past the diving Warner"
"136kph, bangs it in short to Sarkar as well, from over the wicket though, and Sarkar pulls it to deep square leg. Super hit."
"good length ball outside off, no shot"
"shapes for a late cut, but the ball is both too full, and too tight on off stump to be playing that shot. The ball goes down to slip, but could have gone anywhere, even onto the stumps"
"pushes it through on the pads, Sarkar works it behind square leg"
"another skidder, pitching on a good length and coming on with the arm from around the wicket. Mominul just about brings down a straight bat to save himself. Had he gone through with the horizontal bat shot he was shaping to play, things might have been dicey"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
shifts back to the flatter delivery on off stump and blocks
"rides the bounce nicely, and plays the late cut as its meant to be played - late and when there is a little room on offer. Mominul finds two runs past slip."

moves back to flick a shortish delivery to short leg
nudges a good length ball off his pads
"good option to unsettle a left-arm spinner from around the wicket - the sweep, with the wrists rolling on top of the ball to make sure it doesn't pop up. Needs a dive from the fielder at long leg to stop it reaching the boundary"
"and excellent fielding again - Cartwright diving headlong after the ball and flicking it back before he crosses the boundary. Agar shouldn't have allowed his team-mate so much work, but this flighted delivery goes too wide outside off and Mominul enjoys himself with a cover drive"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
"gets a <b>leading edge</b> as he closes the face too early against a tossed up delivery on middle. Slow through the air this time, Lyon troubles Mominul again"

"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
pushes a shortish delivery back at the bowler
"drifts in to the left-hander, who nudges the flighted delivery to midwicket"
"<b>traps him lbw</b> and umpire Llong says off you go. Sarkar comes down to chat with his partner, but if he has to be doing that, he knows he hasn't hit it. What a strike from Australia's lead spinner. Right on the stroke of lunch, he unleashes one of his quicker balls, and it skids on so much that it hits the back pad in line with all three stumps. Sarkar is just too slow to bring his bat down. He's also expecting the ball to turn, when it just hasn't done so all morning."

"a good single. The first run in 19 balls. Fullish delivery outside off, Mominul gets forward and defends towards cover for one"
"beautifully stroked. A tad too full outside off, no seam movement. Shakib leans forward and nails a straightish drive. Even Warner at mid-off can't get across to his left. All timing"
"on a length around off, defended back, head over the ball, eyes on it"
"that's a poor ball. Full and wide from Cummins, Shakib stays in his crease and throws his hands at the ball, goes whistling past short cover for four. Too much width, these runs could be crucial."
"slow on the pads, nudged to short leg. Watchfully played"
"skids on with the arm again, no turn. An inside edge to short leg again."
"shorter outside off, pushed through. Short enough for Mominul to go back and defend"

"lovely line. Applause from Steven Smith. Fullish length on the fourth-stump channel, defended into the off side"

"141 kph, on a length outside off, dabbed to gully with an angled bat"

"shortish on middle and leg, nudged towards square leg"
"flat and full, straight. Mominul gets forward to defend"
"width! And Mominul climbs all over it. Short and wide outside off, Mominul slaps a cut through extra cover. May have wanted that finer but a gap is all that matters"
defended off the front foot
"and again! Fourth lbw for Lyon, four dismissals. Lyon gets this to drift on, like he has been doing through the morning. Flat and straight, Mominul goes back, looking to flick this through the leg side, but the ball drifts on, beats the inside edge and hits the front pad in front of middle. Mominul looks at his partner in hope, but Shakib sends him on his way. Just being regularly beaten on the inside edge are Bangladesh here. Plumb."

"too short, enough room and Shakib laces it in front of point. Top shot. Makes the opposition pay for bowling poorly"
"he's walking! Agar has instant vindication as Shakib nicks behind! This is again a very quick delivery, angling across the left-hander. The only problem is, it doesn't have the kind of width the batsman is looking for. Shakib still tries to force it away, perhaps through cover, but only ends up offering a catch to Matthew Wade, who collects it gleefully. Excellent take from the under-fire wicketkeeper. Came off a very thick edge (No 10-for for Lyon)"

"a shade short, and too straight, which then allows the batsman to pull to deep square leg"
"short and wide, and Sabbir hammers it through to the cover boundary. Easy putaway. Seems like a top-spinner gone wrong from Lyon..."

"zips into the right-hander off the pitch - and it's a really full length too, so Mushfiqur playing back means he's been put off by Agar's flat trajectory. Only the straight bat saves him"
shifts back to a shortish delivery on leg stump and blocks
"slows it down as he aims at off stump, Mushfiqur defends on the front foot"
"another exploratory delivery, tossed up over the batsman's eyeline. Mushfiqur won't be tempted"

"good length ball, going on with the arm, Mushfiqur addresses it well"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> but it would have gone down. For the first time, Mushfiqur, batting deep in his crease, is caught on the move and his panic-stricken flick doesn't work"
moves back to a shortish delivery outside off and guides it to point. Rides the extra bounce so well
nudges a shortish delivery on the pads behind square leg

"pushes a full delivery back at the bowler. Interestingly, though, that ball <b>tailed into the right-hander</b>..."
"he's running in hiding where the shiny side of the ball is, and the ball responds by weaving in the air, into the right-hander. Mushfiqur flicks behind square leg"
"fullish on off stump, defends"

"good length ball on off stump, blocks"

"full on off stump, drives to short cover"
"full and outside off, drives to mid-off"
"back of a length on middle, blocks"
"attacks the stumps at 129 kph, and it keeps a touch low. Mushfiqur's intense concentration, and his abiding by his straight bat, helps him out again. He may only have 25, but he's battling some very disciplined bowling and has rarely looked out of place."

"flight on off, 87 kph, defended back"

"Wade thinks he's pulled off a stumping here, and he might well be right. The third umpire comes in and this might be a pretty unfortunate dismissal. Sabbir, trying to pull a ball darting sneakily past his thighs, overbalances! He is pivoting through his shot, and during the course of that, his back leg ends up being on the crease - only by a hair's breath - while his front leg is up in the air even though it was behind the crease line.

"how's that? Handscomb needs a dive to make his ground, has the bat bounced? He's gone by a distance. It's extremely unfortunate for Handscomb, end of a terrific knock. It's flat down leg, Warner works the ball towards square leg. Handscomb is a bit too eager to help Warner to 100, but he is sent back after he made quite a few strides. Shakib picks up ad hits the stumps direct at the bowler's end. That is exceptional fielding. Handscomb can't make it even with a full-length dive."

"a big appeal, but struck quite high. Flat on middle and off, Wade comes down and pad-bats it away. Mehedi forces his captain<b> into a poor review</b>. Shoved the bat behind the pad. But he was so far down the crease that there were too many variables. Impact is umpire's call (over 3 metres), and the decision will stay. Umpire Llong signs a thumbs-up, which is misinterpreted by the crowd as the raised finger. A loud cheer goes up. Bad review."

"full, straight and later! Plumb in front. <b>Wade misses a straight delivery and reviews</b>. Both pads, that one seamed back in late to beat the inside edge. Is it drifting down leg? 'There is a gap between bat and ball,' says the third umpire. Three reds and Wade has to trudge off. Did not look like a great review from the outset. There may be just a hint of reverse swing?"
"good length outside off, defended to cover."

"flight outside off, short enough for Maxwell to go back and punch back to the bowler"
"gets right forward to defend, good technique, closing any gap between bat and pad"
"is there glove? Yes, says umpire Llong, but he wants to check if it has carried. Maxwell doesn't think it has hit glove at all. A big inside edge into the pad, the ball lobs up, Mushfiqur dives forward - to his right - and collects it easily. Two replays showed to the TV umpire - neither very clear - but it looked like Mushfiqur got his hands underneath that. He did. Good game awareness from Mushfiqur, but more instinctive, you see a ball coming towards you, you catch it. Just enough spin from Mehedi. Maxwell wanted to review that, used the T signal. He did review, which is why they used UltraEdge to check if there was an edge, but I've seen those checked without the review. I'm confused."

"quick outside off, defended into the off side"
"74 kph, big appeal. No says Llong. <b>Mushfiqur reviews</b>. Now, that's not a bad review. 'No shot offered,' says the third umpire. It was flat and wide outside off, Cummins did not expect as much spin as there was, and left it, the ball spun back and struck Cummins well outside off. There is one green - impact, but that doesn't matter because he did not play a shot - and two reds (hitting off stump). And the decision is overturned."

"leg-stump ball, tucked around the corner to square leg"
"flighted and spins in on off, dead batted"
"straight ball outside off, stabbed out to the covers"

"back of a length, slight tail away from off stump. Squares him up as he defends off the outside half"

"<b>taken at first slip.</b> Impressive Test bowling. He's pinned Sarkar on the back foot. Goes slightly fuller with his length this time and gets it to move slightly away from the off stump. Sarkar plays for the angle, without any feet. it's a hanging bat, and it's an invitation to take the outside edge. Cummins finds it"

"full at middle stump, tapped to mid-on"
"back of a length at off stump, on his toes to defend down the pitch"

"good length at off stump, defended into the off side"
"<b>just manages to clear cover point.</b> Steps out, gets leg side and looks to launch this over extra cover. He didn't get to the pitch at all. Luckily for him, this doesn't turn sharply away. He skews it over cover point"

"<b>he does make too much room this time!</b> Doesn't get to the pitch once again. He hasn't got to the pitch all morning, but he's been down the track quite a few times. Lyon gets one to turn away this time. It bounces and nearly takes Wade out. Like an awkward bouncer, it heads for his chest. He contorts slightly, and manages to hold on to it.

This delivery pitches and scoots low on the bounce, but Wade stays nice and low, gathers the ball cleanly and disturbs the stumps. He was in complete control.

"drifting into the pads, worked towards the man coming in from midwicket"
"drawn forward by the flight, Mominul squeezes this back to Agar"
"worked with the spin to short fine leg, Mominul wanted a single but is sent back"

swung away towards deep  backward square leg. He was in complete control of this pull shot
"Cummins' brilliance has ended Mominul's stay. <b> Lyon becomes the highest wicket-taker in 2017. </b>  This one was tossed up outside leg from over the wicket, it gripped and spun away sharply, Mominul looks to sweep against the turn but didn't get under the delivery and ended up top-edging it towards deep backward square. The error was induced alright, but Cummins, who has pranced in without losing intensity, was super quick to charge in and then dive forward to complete a low catch. Mominul's defiance is over, it's a wicket Bangladesh dearly didn't want to lose at the stroke of tea."

shot! Steps out and lofts him cleanly over the bowler's head. Emphatic

wrists this towards square leg

drifting into the pads and he's whipped this away towards deep midwicket. Swwet timing
driven wide of the cover fielder

stabs away an in-drifter wide of short leg
