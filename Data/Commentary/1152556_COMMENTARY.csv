"length ball on off stump, defended off the front foot into the on side"
"nice length, pins Harvey to the crease, playing across the line and missing, looking for the flick through square leg. No lbw appeal - was clearly headed down leg"
"fullish, fifth-stump line, Harvey plays a checked drive to cover"
"short, sits up just outside off stump. There's a deep square leg in place, but Jason Sangha, diving to his right, can't stop this front-foot pull from running away for four"
"full on off stump, and Harvey gets his front leg out of the way to chip it down the ground, over mid-on"
"fullish slower one wide of off. Reaches out to drive without getting a front-foot stride in, and plays a little early. The ball rolls gently into the covers"
"starts with a stump-high full toss, and Finch clears his front leg and swats it away over the midwicket boundary"
"full, bowls it at Finch's feet when he sees him look to make room. Looks to drive down the ground and hits it to long-on, off the inside half of his bat"
"nicely bowled, just back of a length and skidding along the angle from over the wicket. Looks to punch through the covers and the ball beats his outside edge"
tossed up a bit more. Looks for the push to long-on and Cook stops it with a dive to his left
"and that's the first wicket. Fairly flat outside off, and Harvey tries to take on long-on with a slog-sweep. Doesn't connect nearly as well as he'd like, and Chris Jordan takes a super catch, running forward and to his left and diving forward to catch it inches off the ground"
"tossed up on off stump, driven down the ground to long-on"
"back of a length outside off, punched straight to backward point"
"back of a length, nips in towards off stump a touch, defended into the covers off the back foot"
"shuffles across to the back-of-a-length ball just outside off stump, and looks for the scoop over short fine leg. Doesn't middle it at all - it may have straightened a touch off the pitch, and it loops up high but lands in no-man's land, some 30 yards behind the keeper"
"shortish, a bit of outswing outside off. Looks to pull but can't connect"
"short on off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
"back of a length outside off, keeps a little low and sneaks under Finch's bat as he reaches out to punch"
"short outside off, sixth-stump line. Steps right across and pulls it away crisply, easily beats deep square leg running to his left"
"again he tries the scoop over short fine, again he ends up top-edging - I think the ball held up off the pitch a little - and again he ends up ballooning it into that unoccupied area behind the keeper"
"slower one, on a length and at the stumps, and Harper has to go. Slogs across the line, misses, and it crashes into middle and leg"
"length ball outside off, presses forward and plays a good-looking drive to deep point"
"back of a length slower ball on off stump. Looks to step across and flick, and it rolls away into the square leg region. May have inside-edged it onto his pad"
"back of a length slower one on off stump, punched back to the bowler. Seemed to keep a touch low"
"slower short ball outside off, hops and dabs it gently into the covers"
"back of a length, and some late inswing sends it down the leg side, past the attempted flick"
"digs it in shorter still, gets up to about shoulder height, and he can't quite control the hook. Hits high on the bat and rolls into the backward square leg region"
"length ball wide of off, reaches out and drives - no power - to extra-cover. A bit of late outswing made him reach out wider than ideal"
"back of a length slower ball close to off stump. Keeps a little low again, and he plays it to mid-on with a turn of his wrists"
"length ball on off stump, pushed with soft hands to extra-cover and they sneak a quick single"
"back of a length, a bit of inswing towards off and middle. Clipped to mid-on"
"short, wide, can't find the gap. Slaps it straight to backward point"
"gone, Jordan gets Finch with a bit of extra bounce in the corridor. Went for the back-foot punch with an angled bat, without really getting close to the line, and Holt takes his first catch, a simple one straight to him at waist height"
"back of a length, sliding well down leg. Nabi can't connect with his flick"
"full now, and overcompensates in line by whanging down an outswinger wide of off stump. No way Nabi's connecting with that drive"
"full outside off, and Nabi times that well - opens his bat face slightly and drives it in the air, to the right of backward point, and it runs away quickly to the left of the deep point sweeper"
"length ball outside off, lets it come and eases a single to the sweeper on the cover point boundary"
"back of a length slower one on off stump. Takes ages reaching the batsman, and Cooper just plays a defensive bunt back to the bowler"
"another slower ball that loses all its fizz when it hits the pitch. Looks to flick, plays way too early and misses, and there's a half-appeal for lbw, quickly aborted. Seemed a touch high, and maybe going down leg too"
"flat and fullish on middle stump, clipped away to the right of deep midwicket, gently, so the fielder has a lot of ground to cover running in from the boundary"
"full on off stump, steps across and clips it into the straight midwicket region. With everyone back front of square on the leg side, there's a lot of potential for twos in that region"
"flat length ball on off stump, defended back towards the bowler"
"another length ball, wrong'un coming in towards middle stump and cramping Nabi for room. Was staying leg-side of the ball, and he opens his bat face and stabs it to point"
"quickish legbreak pitching on about off stump. Sticks in the pitch slightly and Nabi closes his bat face early, looking to step back and across and work it leg side. Edges it away just wide of the keeper"
"fuller now, opens his bat face to push to sweeper cover"
"lovely flight just outside off, and Nabi presses forward looking for the push into the covers. Doesn't turn, and he inside-edges it into the midwicket region"
"a touch shorter, steps back to punch to sweeper cover"
"back of a length, slides on with the angle towards off stump, is a little cramped for room but he manages to jam his bat down and punch into the cover point region"
"slower now, outside off, stretches forward to sweep and doesn't really get hold of it. Off the inside half of the bat towards short fine leg"
"ooh, some turn now. Pitches on leg stump, on a good length, and Cooper closes his face early looking to flick. Leading edge drops into the cover region"
"fuller now, clipped away towards midwicket"
"quickish, on middle and leg, clipped back to the bowler"
"short, wide, chopped down to short third man"
"back of a length on off stump. Doesn't turn that much, and Nabi is working against the angle, trying to play it off the back foot through midwicket. Ends up playing it back to the bowler instead"
"full on leg stump, clipped to deep square leg"
goes back to a flat length ball slanted across outside off. Jams his bat down in a hurry to jab it back to the bowler
"back of a length, slanting across without too much turn back in. Punched to long-off"
"gone! There have been a few leading edges on this pitch, and this time it pops up in the air, straight back to the bowler. Flat legbreak on leg stump, and Cooper - not for the first time today - closes his bat face too early looking for the flick"
"flat and fairly full, angling into middle and leg, gets his front pad out of the way and defends to mid-off"
"tossed up slower outside off, presses forward and pushes to the left of extra-cover"
"googly, reads it well enough - the line was a giveaway, well outside off - and presses forward, lets it come on, and pushes to sweeper cover"
"back of a length wrong'un, spins down the leg side and beats the flick round the corner. Good take down the leg side from Holt, good quick feet"
"full now, driven down to long-on"
"length ball wide of off, legbreak. Slows down the pace nicely, and Nabi reaches out to steer it backward of point"
"flat, speared wide of off stump. Reaches out and tries to slash, but it's too far away"
"length ball angled across to off stump, lets it come and dabs it towards short third man"
"length ball on off stump, gets on the front foot for a push into the point region"
"sees Nabi premeditate and take a big step back, and spears in a yorker. Clipped to midwicket"
"shot! Was waiting for something on that line, I think, and he gets a leg-stump ball, on a length, and he quickly drops down on one knee and brings his bottom-wrist power into work for a pick-up sweep over the square leg boundary"
"flat, at the pads, nudged away into the fine leg region"
"tossed up outside off, reads the googly and stretches across to sweep through backward square leg"
"flatter now, on the stumps, goes for the sweep again, and he knows fine leg is in the circle. Deliberately hits it up and over, and even though he doesn't connect as cleanly as intended, he finds the general area he's aiming for and picks up another boundary. Smart batting"
"knows he's looking for the sweep and fires it fuller, wide of off. Doesn't connect, and is hit on the pad"
"another leading edge. Looks to work the legbreak from middle stump into the leg side, and the ball holds up a little. Edge rolls down towards backward point"
"down the track to the flighted off-stump ball, drives it past the diving bowler to long-off"
"flighted ball wide of off, driven to sweeper cover"
"starts with a full one, right up there. Gets across and clips it gently into the backward square leg region"
"slower bouncer, and the bowling change and the change of pace have brought the breakthrough. Digs it into the pitch, and it gets up to shoulder height while losing a lot of pace off the pitch. Christian plays a non-committal hook, and only manages a top-edge through to the keeper"
"ooh, well bowled. Greets the new batsman with a quick one, pitching just short of a good length and slanting across him. Pokes at it from the crease and it slides past his outside edge"
"and again, beats the edge twice in two balls. His feet don't go anywhere, and he just aims an angled-bat jab at the ball"
"full now, slower ball, on about off and middle. Adjusts late to open his bat face and run it down to third man"
"shortish outside off, hops up and stabs it to backward point"
"full on leg stump, clipped to midwicket"
"flat again, fairly full, angling into off stump. Can't really get down low thanks to the pace and trajectory, so his sweep is a hands-only thing. Top-edges it but it bounces down safely before reaching deep square leg"
"flat again, clipped away through midwicket"
"and that's Holt's first stumping at the senior level. Rushes out of his crease too early, and Cook bowls the topspinner. Pushes at it, well in front of his body, playing for turn, and it sneaks through between bat and pad, with a bit of extra bounce, and Holt has to adjust to collect and stump Webster, but he's so far out of his crease he can take all the time he wants"
"full on middle and off, drives and Watson throws himself to his left at extra-cover to stop it"
"full outside off. Jabs at the drive, aiming for the covers, ends up squeezing it down to long-on off the inside half of the bat"
"ooh, edged and just past the diving keeper. Back of a length, straightens a touch as he looks to stay leg-side of the ball and run it down to third man. Holt dives full-length but the ball just eludes him"
"ooh, nearly another fantastic catch from Jordan. Length ball, sticks in the pitch as he looks to clip it leg side. Pops up off the leading edge and Jordan, sprinting from mid-on and throwing himself to his left, can't quite get to it before it falls to the floor"
"back of a length outside off, and again Nabi looks to run it down to third man, ends up missing as it straightens past his edge"
"full on middle and leg, clipped quietly through midwicket"
"shortish on middle and leg, keeps a little low as he goes for the pull. Has to check himself a little to play it to the right of midwicket"
"dug in short, fairly wide of off. Nabi goes for the hard slash with both feet off the ground, but the ball bounces past his edge"
"short on off stump, and Boyce puts this away. Makes a bit of room for a powerful cut, perfectly placed to the right of backward point"
"flat length ball on leg stump, nurdled away into the midwicket region"
"length ball wide of off, and Nabi looks to go over extra-cover, but long-off is wide too, and he doesn't hit it wide enough of that fielder. Jordan takes a good low catch there, tumbling to his left"
"full on off and middle, clipped to backward square leg"
"wrong'un, tossed up outside off. Blocked back to the bowler"
"flat, goes back to try and work it from middle stump. Adjusts late as it straightens and skids through, pokes it away to backward point off the outside half of the bat"
"bangs it in on off stump, and Boyce is ready for it, he either sets himself up early for that length or he judges the length in a flash. Either way, he swats away the pull and clears the forward square leg boundary"
"back of a length slower one, keeps low, angling into the pads. Tucked away into the short fine leg region"
"full outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
"in the blockhole on middle and leg, jams his bat down quickly to keep it out"
"slower ball, shortish, and it keeps extremely low to sneak under the pull. He's lucky it juuust misses leg stump"
"short outside off, keeps low again, sneaks under the attempted back-foot punch"
"slower ball slanting across. Beats the outside edge as he pushes at it with his hands, and rolls down to the keeper"
"length ball on middle stump, pushes it to mid-on and steals a quick single"
"oh my Slower bouncer, slanting across the right-hander. Opens up, shapes to pull, and it takes an age to arrive, and eventually he aborts the pull and just bunts it gently into the covers"
"back of a length, angling away from off stump, perhaps not short enough to pull, can't connect with the shot"
"length ball on off stump, clipped into the mid-on region"
in the blockhole on off stump - a good response from the bowler to Boyce's movement across his crease. Jams down to keep it out
"slower length ball just outside off, legcutter. Steps forward and looks to launch it over mid-on. Can't put bat to ball"
"slower ball, fuller and wider. Slogs again and misses again"
"another slower ball outside off, and this time he does get some bat on it as he goes at it with the big golf swing. Gets way more height on it that distance, and Jordan, running in like a sprinter from long-on towards wide-ish mid-on, tumbles forward but just fails to reach the rapidly dropping ball on time"
"bang. Boyce has been waiting for anything short. Went deep in his crease before the bowler released, and got the short slower ball he was hoping for. Swivels through his hips and clatters it away over midwicket"
"that's even better! length ball outside off, and he carves it away, with a slicing motion of his bat, and clears the point boundary"
"Big, big over. Possibly a match-turning over. 17 off it. Short, outside off, and Boyce slashes at it. Only manages an edge, but that's enough for the ball to run away quickly between keeper and short third man"
"Nope. Leg-stump yorker, and he flicks it away to deep square leg"
"sees him stepping across, looking for that scoop over short fine leg, and goes for the yorker. It would have been right in the slot for this shot if he'd got it wrong, but he gets it right and Boyce can't connect"
"whoops. The pressure of a batsman in form, and the pressure of the field. Third man and backward point were in the circle, fine leg was in the circle, and Jordan guesses he might try to make room and looks for the leg-stump yorker. Ends up whanging a full toss way down the leg side"
"bam! Boyce is on fire here. Slower ball, back of a length, angling into the body. Clears his front leg and simply smacks it over the square-leg boundary"
"off-stump yorker, makes room and stabs it away neatly, but hits it straight to backward point"
"full outside off, and there's that slicing carve again. He's already hit a six with this shot - has he cleared the point boundary again? He may have hit the boundary cushions on the full here... Lots of replays being looked at, and eventually the signal is... six!"
"and he ends the innings with a boundary and brings up a magnificent half-century! Squeezes this past the backward point fielder diving to his right, and it absolutely races to the boundary. Again Jordan went for the yorker, and again he wasn't too far off but Boyce had made just enough room and his hands did their magic thereafter"
"back of a length, angling into the body. Tucks it off the thigh pad to backward square leg"
"fuller, again too straight, clipped easily off the pad to the fine leg boundary"
"back of a length on middle stump, gets behind it and defends towards midwicket"
"gone! The shot was on, but the placement was off. It was full enough and wide enough for the on-the-up cover drive, but he picked out the man at extra-cover"
"shortish, a bit of width, but it keeps low and scoots under the attempted slash"
"short outside off, and he stands tall and puts it away elegantly, slaps it at the top of the bounce and finds the gap at cover point"
"full, angling into off stump. Shapes for the cover drive, but he's not forward quickly enough, and the angle makes the ball go to midwicket off the inside half of the bat"
"length ball on middle stump, defended to mid-on"
"length ball close to off stump, nice stride forward for a nice-looking straight-bat push to mid-off"
"full on off stump, whipped away over midwicket, off the inside half of the bat. Rolls slowly through the outfield and deep square leg can mop up"
"back of a length on off stump, punched firmly back to the bowler"
"back of a length, a bit of late movement into the pads. Pinned to the crease, he looks to flick outside the line and misses. No appeal, since this was probably going over the top and possibly down leg too"
"back of a length, angling into middle and off to tuck up Sangha. Blocked back to the bowler"
"shortish, angling into middle stump. Lets it come on and tucks it to the right of midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, worked away nicely to the left of deep square leg"
"back of a length outside off, lets it come on and dabs it to the left of backward point"
"not the greatest shot, but how's that for a sensational catch?!?!? Back of a length wide of off stump, and it was too far outside off for Sangha to play that hoick over the leg side. Ends up slicing it over point, and it's probably dropping down some 3/4ths of the way to the boundary. Mackenzie Harvey turns around, runs towards the boundary with his back to the batsman, and catches it as it drops down from behind him"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked to short extra-cover"
"fullish on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"back of a length on off and middle, worked away to the left of midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to mid-on"
"shortish outside off, chopped away to backward point"
"back of a length on off and middle, clipped to midwicket"
"full on off stump, and that's a beautiful shot from Ferguson. He stays on the back foot, and uses the inward angle and uses his wrists to find the gap to the right of mid-on"
"back of a length, slanting away from off stump, steered down to third man"
"back of a length, a touch too straight, and that's nicely played. Steps across and tucks it away to the backward square leg boundary"
"back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face to stab it down to third man"
"back of a length again, no width, defended towards backward point"
"back of a length on off stump, makes a bit of room to try and carve it to the right of backward point, who makes a diving stop but can't prevent the single"
"slower ball, fairly full, slanting away from off stump. Stays back and looks for a dabbed single to backward point, but the fielder moves in quickly to cut it off and force Devcich to turn around in a hurry"
"back of a length close to off stump, carved away to deep point"
"slower ball, angling into off stump, stays back and tucks it gently into the backward square leg region"
"back of a length outside off, punched to deep point"
"back of a length, angling into the body, tucked off the hip to short fine"
"shot! Slower one, full, outside off, and he spots it early, holds his shape, and drives it back down the ground, flat and hard over the umpire's head"
"slower length ball angling into middle stump, nudged into the backward square leg region"
"back of a length on off stump, punched down to long-off"
"length ball on off stump, and Ferguson clips it neatly to mid-on. No sweep yet."
"short outside off, slapped away to sweeper cover"
"tossed up on off stump, clears his front leg and flat-bats to deep extra-cover"
"short and wide, carved to sweeper cover"
"back of a length, gets it to turn fairly sharply from leg to off and cramp Devcich, who's looking to make room to punch to long-off or through the covers. Punched back to the bowler instead"
"back of a length on off stump, whipped away to deep backward square leg"
"not quite short enough to pull, on off stump, can't beat Finch at midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, keeps low and sneaks under the attempted slash"
"shortish outside off, punched to sweeper cover"
"back of a length, gets it to nip in towards off stump and tuck up the cut. Still manages to cut it but can't beat backward point"
down the track and Christian pulls his length back a touch. Stays leg-side of the ball and chops it down to third man
"full, just outside off, driven with a lot of bottom hand to long-on"
"tossed up on off stump, and the mounting required rate has done for Devcich. Clears his front leg and sinks down on his back knee for the slog-sweep, but it's too full to really get the elevation he wants, and there's also a long-on in place for exactly that kind of shot"
"flighted ball outside off. Shapes to sweep but realises it's too full, and adjusts to opens his bat face and steer it through backward point instead. But what';s happened here? A run-out in slightly unfortunate circumstances, it looks like... Green, running the second and going to the keeper's end, gets his bat stuck in the turf a couple of feet short of the crease as the throw comes in from the deep. and he's forced to jump into the crease feet first rather than slide his bat in. When the bails go off, his feet are in the air."
"reverse-sweep first ball in senior cricket. Flat outside off, and he can't connect"
"more conventional now, and he gets his first run with a drive to sweeper cover"
"slower now, angling into leg stump, looks for the clip through backward square leg and the keeper scurries to the ball to prevent a single"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked to short extra-cover"
"back of a length, angling into middle and off, pushes it to midwicket and thinks of a single, but Ferguson sends him back, rightly. Too close to the fielder"
"length ball on off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and dabs to backward point"
"a touch too straight, tucked off the pads into the backward square leg region"
"short outside off, slapped to sweeper cover"
"full on middle stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"flighted ball on off stump, reverse-sweeps hard and along the ground, and deep point does really well to sprint to his left and cut off the boundary with the full-length dive"
"slower and slightly shorter, reverse-sweeps again but straight to short third man"
"tossed up slow outside off, swept firmly along the ground to deep midwicket"
"ooh, quicker one. Saw him shaping to sweep and fired it in full. The angle juust took it past leg stump, and that's a harsh wide call"
"tossed up full on middle stump, driven to long-off"
"ooh, this time he juuuuust misses off stump. Ferguson goes for the big sweep this time, and Boyce slows it down, bowls the slider, and beats his bat"
"finds the boundary, but nearly holes out in the attempt. Tossed up slow again, wider this time, and Ferguson has to reach out for the lofted drive over extra-cover. Hangs in the air, keeps long-off interested, but it's just outside his reach as he throws himself at the ball"
"And Holt simply whips him for six! Goes full, on off stump, and that's stunning wristwork to deposit it beyond the backward square leg boundary"
"fullish on off stump, clipped to long-on"
"full outside off, Ferguson swipes it down to long-off"
"there's that pick-up shot again. Shades of Ricky Ponting in that one. A step forward and across to the full one on middle stump, flicks it in the air, on the bounce, to the right of deep forward square leg"
"a good-looking shot, looked like he timed it really well, but he's ended up picking out deep midwicket. Fullish, outside off, goes for the big hit over the leg side and ends up hitting it straight to the man on the rope"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"full outside off, driven to deep point"
"slower ball, back of a length, on middle stump, tucked away to deep midwicket"
"full, follows Holt as he steps away from the stumps, looking to make room. Drives it to mid-off"
"slower bouncer, angling marginally down leg. Can't connect with the hook"
"sees him looking to make room, and follows him again. Whipped off his hip to deep square leg"
"ooh, back of a length, and this one skids off the pitch and beats Sams for pace. Went back and across, looking to work it from outside off stump, and the ball zipped past his inside edge"
"full, angling into off stump, and Holt has smacked this over deep midwicket. A whippy angled-bat slog, and he gets just enough on it to clear the rope"
"six more! Length ball angling into the stumps, and he steps across with his front foot and whips this over the square leg boundary - more convincing than the previous one"
"this is stunning from the 19-year-old. Dug in short outside off, and he slaps it away, slicing underneath the ball, and finds the gap between backward point and short third man"
"length ball on off stump, and he knows midwicket is back on the boundary. Nudges it gently in his direction and picks up two, though he had to hurry through the second and dive to make his crease"
"length ball outside off, pushed gently to deep point"
"back of a length outside off, opens his bat and steers it to short third man. May have been looking to place it slightly finer there"
"slower ball, slanted wide of off stump - too wide. Holt doesn't even try to play it in th eend"
"another slower ball, and Holt tries to make room and ends up too far from the line of the ball to slap it away"
"back of a length, fourth-stump line, steps across and whips it to deep backward square leg"
"full on leg stump, they take the single even though he flicks this straight to short fine leg. Was on his heels a little, so they do it comfortably enough"
"short slower ball outside off, pulled away through square leg"
"short outside off, slapped into the cover point region"
"in the blockhole, just outside off, digs it out, back to the bowler"
"full outside off, too full for elevation down the ground. Looks to swipe it leg side and inside-edges into his front leg"
"slower one, back of a length, and Holt, stepping away into the off side and looking for the scoop over fine leg, can't connect with the ball"
"short ball outside off, a fair way outside off, and Holt, trying to drag it from there and pull, can only hit it down the throat of deep square leg. An innings of promise from a really promising player"
"in the blockhole on off stump, jabbed along the ground to long-off"
"length ball wide of off stump, Jordan gets forward for the flat-bat drive to sweeper cover"
"full outside off, he didn't miss the yorker by much, but it's a few inches short of the blockhole, and that gives Sams just enough swinging room to absolutely hammer it to the cover boundary"
"England 1, England 0. It's full, outside off, and he clears his front leg and hammers a big drive down the ground, but straight to the man at long-off"
"slower one wide of off stump, slapped off the front foot to the left of sweeper cover"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off. The left-handed Sandhu lets it come on and guides it down to third man"
"short, wide, off-pace. Keeps low, barely gets to Sandhu on the first bounce, and it also leaves him off the pitch. No way he can connect with that cut"
"full, close to off stump, whipped to long-on"
"stays back to a length ball slanting away from off stump, looks for the old-fashioned late cut. Can't make contact"
"slower length ball wide of off stump, slapped straight to point"
"back of a length slower ball, slanting away from off stump. Looks to make room and cut, misses"
"in the blockhole just outside off, jabs at it and misses"
"another yorker angling across the left-hander, also the slower one this time. Swipes at it, looking to go leg side, and misses, but there's enough time to steal a bye"
"boom, off stump pegged back. Full offcutter, and it's too full for the cleared-front-leg big hit over the leg side. Past the inside edge and it's bye bye Daniel Sams"
in the blockhole once more. Looks to flick and all he manages is an inside-edge into his pads
"looks for the dipping yorker, ends up as a low full-toss on the legs, and Cook clips it to short fine leg"
"right up there on middle and leg, jabbed firmly back to the bowler"
"slower ball, quite full, on off stump, swiped away through square leg"
"slower length ball, leg-stumpish. Looks to flick, and only manages to edge into his pad. And that's followed by a collision and a run-out. Both batsmen were converging on the same side of the pitch, and Gurney was also moving in that direction to get to the ball. He manages to sneak between the two batsmen, and ends up unsighting both of them. They collide, leaving Cook sprawled on the pitch, and he picks up the ball and completes the run out at the keeper's end"
"slower ball, back of a length, looks for the lap-sweep and only manages to get his thigh pad on it. Rolls away into the backward square leg region"
"another slower ball, slapped down to long-off"
"back of a length outside off. Looks to dab it behind point, only manages an inside edge into the leg side"
"and, appropriately enough, he's the man to end it. Fawad steps out, and he fires it wide. Beats the desperate reach-out drive, and Harper does the rest"
