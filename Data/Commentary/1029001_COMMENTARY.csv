"very full length to launch the season, with a hint of late in-dip to the left-hander. Stabbed out to point"
"flung out wide of the off stump, Stirling reaches for the ball and steers it to cover"
"sliding into the pads, can't clip it away"
"full length again, and that's pleasingly punched down the ground for two. Might have been aiming a bit squarer, but got good contact all the same"
"on the pads, flicked out to midwicket for an insta-single"
"panned into the covers, lovely flowing strike, but the fielder is well placed to intercept"
"good areas, Woody. Outside off on a full length, punched to cover"
"on the pads, and that's a well-played shot to a fairly poor delivery. Too much pace to be spearing it down the leg side. No-one was cutting that off"
"better line and length, back outside off, and a judicious leave to some good carry"
fizzer. That one really kicked off the deck as Joyce was lured into a drive. Billings is lifted off his feet as he takes the ball on the rise
"good ball, really tight line on and around off stump. Joyce leaves well"
"a fraction over-pitched, and it's wide of the stumps so Joyce frees his arms with impunity. Using the extra pace to squeeze a compact square drive clean to the boundary"
"stand and deliver! Stirling doesn't bother to move his feet, just lines up a belting cover drive, and duly belts it through the covers!"
"better ball, tighter line, demanding a respectful defensive prod"
"in the air for a while as short midwicket scrambles to intercept! Wasn't really there for a cramped hoick-cum-drive through the leg side, and lucky to survive"
blocked on and around off stump
pushed into the covers
"edged, and out of the reach of Root at a solitary slip! This one headed straight across the right-hander, who was playing for a bit of inswing. Lucky again!"
"well bowled. Tight line, a hint of movement off the seam, and beats the edge"
"through to the keeper once more, slightly back of a length this time, but no expansive strokes"
"hauled into the leg side, shorter ball and skidded into a hurried pull"
through to the keeper once again
"on the back foot, squeezed down to third man"
"another tight line, through to the keeper with good pace and carry"
"looking for a very full length, to encourage swing, but the only swing in that shot is a lusty swing of the bat. Point cuts off a whistling square drive"
"'ave some of that! Stirling leans back, butchers a flat-batted mow back past the bowler. I approve!"
"held back a touch, and Stirling adjusts accordingly, soft hands and an open face, to guide the ball through the slips. Runs flowing now..."
"that is sumptuous! A checked drive, all timing and placement, clean through the covers! England have some thinking to do"
"back of a length, defended out to point"
"a bit of an ugly hoick into the leg side, but whatever. He's having fun out there. Half an appeal for lbw but clearly down the leg side"
"whoops! That's never good for a bowler's mood. A tip and run to Bairstow in the covers, whose shy at the non-striker's end goes awry..."
"back on a tighter line, defended again"
defended into the leg side
"through the gate! Through the canyon, if truth be told, as Stirling gave himself acres of space outside the leg stump, but Wood's angle from wide on the crease, and nip off the surface, pinged his delivery with a pleasing 'clunk' into the top of middle stump"
"on the pads, tucked to leg"
"bouncer, and well directed too. Short and sharp, and Joyce turns turtle"
"outside off, tidy line but not much in the way of swing. Left alone"
"tight to off stump once again, respectful leave. Stirling would have walloped that to kingdom come"
"on the pads, worked to leg with a shuffle"
"outside off, and thumped through point. It's not been Willey's day so far"
"through to the keeper, as this one does nibble a touch, back into the left-hander, whose leave is good in the end"
"much fuller, strikes the pad and up goes the finger! Joyce might felt that was sliding down leg, but if so, he should have got bat on it and sent it on its way. Batsman error, and England have both openers!"
tapped out to point
"good delivery, squared up a touch on the back foot in defence"
"through to the keeper once again, Wood is looking sharper with every over"
"outside off, still no stroke as Wood fizzes another one through to the keeper"
"back of a length, hurried defence into the leg side"
opens the face to guide a single down to third man
"on the pads, tucked out to midwicket"
"wobbly delivery, attacking the off stump, and poked into the covers"
"dangled outside off, and a bit of a hard-handed push"
"tighter line to the off stump, tucked into the leg side"
"fully forward, blocked into the off side"
forward and defended out to the covers
worked off the hip to square leg
"an ungainly flip over the shoulder, good pace and excellent line restricting Balbirnie's options.  But fortunately for him he muffed the stroke, as Adil Rashid would have been lurking for the catch at fine leg"
"good work from Hales in the covers, cutting off the single"
"on the back foot, defended to the leg side"
angled defence out to backward point. Wood is proving very tough to get away
"full length, wide of off stump. Pushed back down the pitch. End of the Powerplay, and Ireland have been reeled in a touch after a brisk start"
"that one did swing, from the hand, defended into the leg side"
"on the back foot, blocked to the leg side"
"well bowled, just dangled outside off, and inviting trouble. Another hard-handed poke from Balbirnie, who hasn't quite got going yet"
defended with more composure back down the pitch
"squelch. A round-arm pull to a not-very-short ball, and a visible buckling of the legs as the ball strikes him amidships"
"better looking stroke, a firm on-drive, but well stopped at mid-on"
"outside off, pushed into the covers"
stabbed down to third man
tucked off the pads to the leg side
"well bowled, nipping back off the seam, into the left-hander"
solidly into line
firm push into the covers. A tidy first over
"on the front foot, pushed to cover."
"good pace already from Plunkett, and a tight line"
"defended with a hop on the back foot. Clocked at 81mph, but looked faster than that through the air"
"fenced through the cordon! Very full length, and toe-ended past the solitary slip"
"another edge, another one that eludes Root at a slightly random fourth slip. Plunkett does the double tea-pot, as well he might"
"firmly forward, blocked back down the pitch"
"onto the front foot, pushed to cover"
"round the wicket, and a baseball-slug across the line, out to deep square leg"
"on the back foot, defended to third man"
"back of a length, nudged into the gap at midwicket"
"too much width, and back of a length, but Ball has a sweeper on the cover boundary who tidies up a wild smash of a cut"
"filleted down to third man, using the width and working the gap"
tucked out to square leg
"full length, solidly blocked back down the wicket"
"onto the front foot, punched to mid-off"
"on the back foot, nudged to third man"

"on the pads, can't get it away"
"outside off, fizzing past a loose and expansive cut"
"fuller length, dug out, back down the pitch"
left alone outside off
"edged and gone! A flat-foot waft as Ball found some lift outside off, and Billings grabs well, moving to his right. The end of what became a combative knock from Balbirnie"
"round the wicket, full and wide of the stumps and squeezed down to third man for a run first ball"
touch back of a length and worked defensively towards the bowler from the crease
floated up from over the wicket and nudged into a gap in the off side for one
"pushed through outside off, Porterfield attempts to reverse sweep and fails to connect"
"floated up on the stumps, gets forward to defend"
"Porterfield gets in a bit of a tangle here, going down to reverse-sweep again and he must have got some glove on it, otherwise Rashid's lbw entreaty would have been fairly persuasive"
"slower pace, goes back and plays with the turn through the leg side"
tosses up the googly and this spins away past the outside edge as O'Brien goes back and prods at it unsuccessfully
"shortish, around off stump, defended"
"Ball is still coming round the wicket, Porterfield gets across and dabs into the covers"
"short of a length, angled in and tucked off the hip through backward square"
"good pace from Ball, wide in the channel and he draws O'Brien forward, beats the bat with some seam movement"
"plugging away outside off, lets this one go"
line and length (another DL Method classic) and again it ducks past the outside edge - good over from Ball
tossed up and met stoutly on the front tfoot
lets go a full toss that Porterfield swings away towards cow corner for a couple

"flighted, on the stumps and worked away with the spin for one"
tossed up and nudged off the pads to leg again
"pushed through on middle and off, Porterfield drops back and cracks a flat-batted stroke through the covers to the sweeper"
"round the wicket, dollied up and defended coming forwards"
"gives it some air, Porterfield tries to get on with it... and chips  to mid-off! A gift of a wicket and Ireland's captain trudges off, having done neither one thing nor the other with that stodgy innings"
angled in on the stumps and worked away for a single
"pushed through flat outside off, not much turn to speak off, left alone"
"flighted, outside off, O'Brien leans out and punches towards cover"

floated up and O'Brien comes forward and eases into a gap
"over the wicket, tossed up and straightening on leg stump, tucked away off the front pad"
"off-stump line, Wilson presses out to block"
"slides this one on, Wilson plays with an angled bat, the ball thuds into the front pad... and Dar gives it! Wilson quickly <b>reviews</b>, however, seemingly confident he got some bat on it... but no, it passed under the edge, missed the glove and he was pinned right in front! England have another and Ireland are in a spot of bother now. Rashid liked the look of it from the start, scrambled the seam so minimal turn and Hawk-Eye had it hitting the top of middle and leg"
"slips in the googly and it's well disguised, O'Brien pushing at it and getting a thick inside edge that runs away for one"

"round the wicket, angled in and nudged away"
"length ball, steered square from the crease"
"quicker ball, drifting down the leg side, KOB sweeps and it deflects off the pad behind square"
tossed up and worked through mid-on for one more
"flighted, spinning and tapped back down the track"
NOB stays in the crease and nudges a single through square leg
"tosses up the googly, spins back in to hit the front pad, the ball loops to slip... and up goes Aleem Dar's finger again! <del>Think this has clipped the inside edge and been given as a catch, though</del> Rashid was initially appealing for lbw and KOB didn't bother asking for a second opinion, Hawk-Eye eventually showing it to be smashing leg stump; either way, Ireland are six down and England are all over them like a knock-off kit"
spinning to hit the inside edge and they think better of trying for a single
"flighted and this is given some tap, in the air but launched wide of mid-off and it runs away for a rare boundary"
"bowled him, another one goes! Two in the over for Rashid and Thompson's three-ball stay is over, completely deceived playing back to a slider, or googly, that thuds resoundingly into off stump"
angled in on the pads and flicked away fine
"over the wicket, tossed up and defended"
moves across on off stump and pushes the ball away
"raps the pads, Root appeals... and up goes the finger! Ireland are swaying the breeze, looking anything but shipshape and Bristol fashion as Root wins another lbw decision, this time from Rob Bailey. He fired it into the pitch, skidding on without turn and homing in on leg stump"
"darted in on off stump, clips the inside edge and runs to leg"
tossed up and met on the front foot with a solid block
tossed up on the stumps and defended

"tossed up, NOB comes forward and pushes a single through the covers"
Murtagh gets into line and defends

"over the wicket, back of a length around off stump, defended into the covers"
"shortish, Murtagh backs away and attempts to give it some long handle, plinked in front of square"
stays back and dabs a single down into the off side
"banged in, this is a fast-rising bouncer that clears Murtagh's  baseball swing and Billings snags it above his head"
"dug in short and Murtagh gets a thick top edge on this, again flailing wildly, and it clears the keeper for four. It's as good a plan of attack as any Ireland have right now"
back of a length and another swing and a miss from Murts
"full and flighted around leg stump, swept along the carpet but short fine leg cuts it off"
"gives it some air, O'Brien heaves to leg, misses the ball - and whaddayaknow, that's out! NOB rolls his eyes as Dar pulls the trigger again, think more in disappointment at the shot than the decision. Simple legbreak, pitching on leg and straightening to hit the back leg"
"big shout for lbw, the googly spinning in to hit the front pad... heading down leg this time, Dar indicates"
"pushed through and Chase prods at it uncertainly, gets a single into the leg side"
"full toss, Murtagh takes the kitchen sink approach and steps out to bludgeon four wide of long-on"
"humpty again, but he picks out long-on - Rashid has his five-for and Ireland have been dumptied for 128! Tossed up the googly and Murtagh obliged by picking out the safe hands of Alex Hales, Ireland dismissed for a calamitously low score, looking green in more than one sense"
"shortish and coming back in to Jason Roy, who taps down to leg"
"fuller, Roy goes for an absolute beast of a yahoo... and gets a thick inside edge on to his boot, which causes a bit of hopping around in discomfort. Steady on"
"on the stumps and clipped off the pads, straight to square leg"
"length ball on off, shows it a straight bat back to the bowler"
"shuffles forward, whipped off the pads... but taken low at midwicket by Dockrell! Ireland have their breakthrough, an impetuous shot from Roy, not keeping the ball down and sharply taken. In the words of Jeremy Corbyn: The fightback starts here!"
"short of a length on off, Root comes across to defend"
"steady from Chase, back of a length and chopped down towards point from the crease"
"good length, shaping in as Hales moves across and prods at it defensively"
"<b>dropped!</b> Murtagh throws himself to his right in his follow through but can only get fingertips on it! Hales was trying to drive off his toes, got under the ball and it was a clear chance, sharp but catchable - goes begging"
"angled in, fullish and patted back watchfully"
"pitched up wide of the off stump, no swing and Hales throws his hands through a drive, picks out cover"
"laced to the boundary, Hales this time bisects mid-off and cover and raises England's first runs off the bat"
back of a length and defended with a straight bat on off stump
"Chase bangs it in on a length, blocked"
"slightly overpitched and the line is too straight, clipped with superb timing off the pads and it sprints away through midwicket for another four"
"drags his length back a touch, chopped into the ground on the back foot"
"fullish, 85mph around off stump, Root drives wide of mid-on for a single"
"wide half-volley and Hales is into position, down on one knee, crumped through cover point to the fence once again"
"back of a length in the channel, Hales opens the face and guides one more through gully"
"pitched up, 79mph and pushed along the ground to mid-on"
"ooh, nicely bowled, this wobbles away from Hales in the air, past the outside edge as he feels for it"
"full of a length, ducking in and driven, comes off the inside half of the bat and runs into a gap"
"Root makes an early move and turns the delivery into a half-volley, mistimed punch but they get one to midwicket"
"big ole swing and a miss from Hales, think Murtagh cut his fingers over this, got some extra bounce as the batsman came forward and looked to hit him into the Severn, over the bat and stumps and into the gloves"
"length ball, tight line and defended this time"
"short and wide and put away, Root opens his shoulders and slaps a cut past backward point"
"better line, blocked from the crease around off stump"
"short ball, 84mph and swatted on the pull, can't get it past midwicket"
"drops back on off stumps and guided wide of third man, Root wanted two but he had to run around the bowler and can't make it back"
"<b>dropped!</b> Short and brushing the glove down the leg side as Hales tried to glance... but Niall O'Brien grassed it, should have been a simple take but Hales has another life"
"pitched up and slashed through the off side, Hales rubs in some salt - and Chase has overstepped, too!"
"full outside off, Hales clears the front leg and heaves down  the ground, beats mid-off and runs away for four more. Peter Chase is in the House of Pain"
"fullish, gentle pace from Murtagh, driven along the carpet to mid-on"
"good length, tailing in and Root picks up one off the inside edge into the leg side"
"<b>takes the edge</b> but it lands between slip and keeper and races away for four! Hales is riding this gift horse into the sunset, done by Murtagh's length, he prodded at it and got a thick outside edge but it just died and didn't really give O'Brien much of a chance this time"
"slogged over the leg side, Hales continues to cash in, taking on Murtagh's medium pace and clearing the infield"
"fullish, clipped through midwicket and they come back for a second"
"just <i>fractionally</I> overpitched this time and Hales is on to the front foot, bullying another drive through the covers. Ouch"

"short ball, swings hard again, there's a big top edge on this, swirling towards backward point - well taken by Porterfield! Hales' luck runs out, but not before he'd taken advantage with a rapid fifty. Another wicket for Chase but Ireland need a few more to make the home fans nervous"

"full on the stumps and clipped in front of deep midwicket, they come back for two"
"drops a little short, Root goes back on his stumps and nurdles one to midwicket"
"short ball, Morgan swings it to leg, high in the air... and Kevin O'Brien makes his ground from fine leg to take an excellent running catch! England are three down, another for Chase... and Jonny Bairstow will get a bat after all!"
