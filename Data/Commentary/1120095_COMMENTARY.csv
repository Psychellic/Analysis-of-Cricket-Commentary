"a nice start, some swing, good length on the pads, nudged down to fine leg for a run."
"beauty. Lovely swing. Full delivery outside off, the ball banana-shapes away from Dhawan, who is left with his bat hanging outside off"
"full again, around off, Dhawan defends towards short cover, looking for one, but he defends close to Boult, who is very quick on it to prevent one"
"wild swing. Full delivery outside off, shaping away, Dhawan looks for a golf swing over mid-on, but the away shape takes the leading edge, towards third man, one bounce to the fielder."
"comes charging again, full delivery outside off, Dhawan runs down and looks to go over the off side, a better option but the ball skews off the outside half towards third man again, to Sodhi's left. He can't quite get across"
"fine finish, on a length around off, worked away towards midwicket"
"<b>yikes, that's a ripping cobra of a delivery</b>. Good length on middle, the ball pitches, stops and rips away from the bat. An absolute jaffa"
"flat on off, spins away again but Rohit pulls, towards backward square leg"
"flat and quick, following Rohit, all he can do is half-time a stab to cover. Superb defensive bowling"
"flat and quick on middle and leg, Rohit backs away and slaps a pull down the ground, past Williamson at mid-on, who races back and makes it, but can't quite get to the ball"
"lovely pace, slowed this one up on off, Rohit fails to make contact with a slog sweep, bounce and spin takes the ball over the bat"
"terrific over from Santner, quick down leg, lots of spin and the ball beats Rohit's jab, hits him on the thigh pad for one leg bye to point."
"the offcutter to start, superb bowling, down leg, Rohit is too early through his pull, off the arm towards the keeper"
"another offcutter, and Santner takes a good catch. Full outside off, cutting away, Dhawan runs down, but doesn't get anyway close to the ball, the ball has enough room to slow down and move away from Dhawan. The ball goes up in the air, no distance. Santner runs back from point and takes a good catch, eyes on the ball till it's in his hands"
"Santner takes another catch! Two in two. And this is another fine catch. Short down leg, another offcutter, Rohit is early through his pull, the ball goes in the air, flat towards Santner at deep square leg, who runs in, gets down and takes a sensational catch, with both hands low to the ground"
"yet another cutter outside off, the ball spinning in, 114 kph, cut down to short third man"
"yet another offcutter, the fifth of the over, short down leg, nudged down to fine leg"
"another cutter, full outside off, clipped to long-on for one. Just four off the over"
"lovely shot. It's short on middle, Kohli rocks back, picks the length and pummels a pull through midwicket, finds the gap with ease"
"over long-on. Sodhi makes the mistake of bowling this one full on leg. Kohli can just get forward and lift the ball over long-on, close enough to the pitch to go through with the shot"
"quick outside off, defended into the point region for a run"
"quick on off, punched towards point for one."
"taken at deep midwicket. Silence befalls Thiruvananthapuram. It's quick, it's short and Kohli sees an opportunity for six more. He goes back and pulls to deep midwicket, hits in the air, all along looking to clear the boundary, but he doesn't get enough power behind that. Straight to the fielder, reverse-cupped catch. Not a bad innings at all."
"slow around off, defended towards cover for a quick single."
"well played, found the gap and executed beautifully. A short and wide offcutter outside off, slapped away through cover, just to the fielder's left"
"slow down leg, 106 kph, the ball is close enough to leg not to call it a wide. Um, that's close, let's just say I've seen those given wide more often than not"
"yet another cutter outside off, cut away towards point"
"superb stop from Williamson. An offcutter on middle, flicked away towards midwicket. Williamson dives to his right to save two, maybe four"
"another cutter, short outside off, coming back in, flapped away towards midwicket, an ugly heave. Iyer runs back for two, and makes it with a full-length dive. It was a good throw, straight to the keeper, good dive"
"12 cutters in 12 balls from Southee. Short outside off, stabbed over cover for a couple. Struggling for timing, but picked a good area"
"quick but very wide down leg. Pandey misses a swat, wide called"
"86 kph, in the slot, and Pandey can get underneath that. Can't bowl so full on a surface that is spinning so much. Pandey doesn't time it well, but enough power to clear long-on"
"that was too full again, but more loopy and wider outside off. Pandey winds up for another six over long-on but the ball rips away"
"short down leg, pulled towards short fine leg for one. Good run from Iyer, take and make all these marginal differences"
"Guptill will not drop it, 99 times out of 100. That wasn't as full, Iyer even came down but couldn't get close to the pitch, the ball spins away, takes the outside half and lobs towards Guptill at long-off for an easy reverse-cupped catch. Looked to hit it too hard, but can't do much else, I suppose. Just that length, have to be full but not overpitched. The ideal length a fuller than good length"
"superb fielding from Guptill. Flat and very wide outside off, a terrific option. Slapped towards Guptill at long-off, who keeps attacking the ball for the catch. The ball bounces just in front and takes it cleanly, on the bounce"
"full and wide outside off, driven into the cover region"
"beautiful bowling. It's the seventh over, but there is loop and flight, <b>but the length is not full</b>. The ball pitches and rips past the edge"
"quick, fired in down leg, paddled down to fine leg for one"
"superb bowling Santner. Short on middle and leg, very conscious of not bowling full. This is a much harder length to hit, pulled through midwicket for a couple"
"soooo much flight on that, it was full but wide outside off, drilled down to long-off"
"mistake! One mistake is enough at this level. This is full on middle and leg, and Pandya swings through the line, clean over long-on. Good hit"
"full again, but he varies the line, flat down leg, off the glove or arm to third man. 11 off the over, but that was superb bowling"
"a cutter outside off, slapped to deep cover for one. No timing at all."
"superb fielding. A short cutter on middle and off, Pandey sits back and wallops a pull towards long-on. Santner runs towards his left, and as he is losing balance (with both his feet off the ground and falling away), he throws the ball to de Grandhomme, who had the game awareness to move close to long-on. Santner still kept his balance and threw the ball straight to de Grandhomme. Stunning stuff."
"the yorker on off, jammed away towards backward point, but the ball makes its way through. Short third man cuts it off, an additional run conceded"
"another cutter, short outside off, Pandya looking to go straight, over long-on, but the ball skews off the outside half towards extra cover for a couple."
"wow, Boult makes up for that lost run, a good length delivery outside off is muscled back to Boult who throws himself to his left and stops the ball with one hand. Absolutely terrific"
"the perfect yorker, on middle and leg, shovelled away to deep midwicket for one."
"good length on off, 127 kph, some away swing, outside-halved down to third man for one"
"a cutter on leg, Munro comes charging at Bhuvneshwar and like he has done so many times on this tour already, he wallops a swat over midwicket. Massive hit"
"full and wide outside off, 134 kph, good delivery, jammed back to the bowler. Yorker almost"
"the knuckle ball, full down leg, swerved in the air, a thick inside edge onto the pad for one"
"another knuckle ball, full outside off, Guptill comes running down, looking to hit it straight but the ball swerves past the outside edge. Swings in the air"
"fantastic comeback from Bhuvneshwar, another slower ball on off, Guptill looks to clear his front leg and smash the ball over midwicket, but he does not make contact. It's on off, and the ball's path is unhindered. Poor shot, but he didn't waste too many"
"seam. 138 kph, good length outside off, and Munro's half prod makes contact with nothing but air. Away movement"
"back of a length on off, more seam movement, defended back to the bowler. Not much Munro can do"
"superb catch from Rohit this time. Good length around off and middle, Munro comes at Bumrah, looking to go over mid-on, but the ball skews off the outside half. Rohit runs back, keeps his eyes on the ball even as his body is trailing behind the trajectory. He sticks out both hands, and don't ask me how, but holds on, the ball in his fingertips almost"
"a slower cutter outside off, dabbed down towards third man for one. Good from Williamson, he won't play too many dots"
"132 kph, yorker down leg, off the pad towards short fine leg"
"another slower delivery outside off, Williamson dabs it away towards short third man for one."
"darted in, short outside off, Williamson under-edges this towards slip"
"short and wide outside off, carved away towards deep point for a couple. Would have been wide had he left it."
"another short delivery outside off, keeps low too, under-edged into the pads. No timing"
"Williamson gets lucky, was struggling there, full outside off, driven back to Chahal who parries it away to long-on. Pandya hunts it down to prevent two"
"short and wide outside off, more spin away, slapped towards Kohli at cover, who dives to his right to save a couple"
"a misfield from a slightly nervous Kuldeep allows the extra run. Flat and straight, pulled towards deep square leg. he is unsure which direction the ball is going to spin after pitching, much like his bowling MO, but manages to stop the ball from going past"
"good length around off and middle, Williamson swats the ball over square leg, he races back for two, but he is one short, Williamson in a hurry to go back doesn't complete the run"
"good length outside off, slapped to long-off for one"
"a full knuckle ball outside off, Phillips doesn't make contact. Another dot. Superb bowling this. NZ struggling to score at 6 an over"
"into the gap and four. Good length on middle and leg, not fantastic timing but placed it well, a heave into the gap at midwicket, one bounce for four"
"that would have been wide, but Phillips gives it all he has. A legcutter outside off, Phillips gets a thick outside edge which flies down to third man for four"
"through his pull too early. Short on off, Phillips is too early through his pull, the ball keeps low because there isn't as much pace, the ball creeps under the bat. NZ will be happy with that over"
"full delivery on off, very quick, driven to long-off. Wants two, won't get it Williamson"
"loopy but straight, too full, so full Phillips can't get underneath, driven to long-on"
"a direct hit from Pandya and Williamson is gone. Lots of flight, Williamson comes down, can't quite muscle a heave over the infield. Hits it to Pandya at midwicket, who picks up and hits the stumps down at the bowler's end. Williamson had given up."
"taken at deep midwicket. New Zealand fall to 28 for 4. Flight on middle and leg, the googly outside off. Phillips goes after the big heave, the slog sweep, but all he can do is toe-end the ball to Dhawan at deep midwicket, who gets underneath the ball and takes a reverse-cupped catch"
"flayed away past point for a couple. Full and wide outside off, de Grandhomme goes after it but skews a couple"
"six, a flat six. The tossed up googly on middle and leg, de Grandhomme gets underneath the length, and lets his muscle do the rest, powers a six over wide long-on"
"full delivery outside off, badly-timed to deep cover for a run"
"the slider, quick and flat outside off, goes past de Grandhomme's bat"
"well bowled, slow and wide outside off, de Grandhomme tries to go inside-out but can't make contact as the ball spins away"
"flat and wide outside off, chopped away towards cover for one. Fine bowling"
"the googly outside off, Nicholls shuffles across and misses a slog sweep"
"85 kph, short and wide outside off, slapped to deep cover for one. Just three off it, that's a game-changer"
"taken at fine leg. A slow offcutter down leg to start, Nicholls gets low, gets underneath but a top-edge lobs towards fine leg, who runs to his left and takes a good catch. Tried to put Bumrah off but didn't work"
"a high full toss on off, driven towards the sweeper cover for just one"
"a full toss on middle and leg, looking for the yorker, flicked away past square leg for four. Superb timing"
"good stop Dhoni! Saved three runs. Sees Bruce coming and fires this short down leg, bounces in front of Dhoni but he throws his full body behind it, and lets it hit his body. A wide and a bye"
"the slower delivery outside off, bounces extra and beats de Grandhomme's bat, but Bruce calls him through. Good awareness. The bye nearly results in a run-out"
"run-out? It's another slower ball outside off, but Bruce tries to ramp the reverse-lap, misses. Dhoni picks up, throws to Bumrah, who in turn throws at the bowler's end, misses. Pandya comes in from long-on, picks up cleanly and returns a terrific throw to Dhoni, who doesn't miss! Bruce dismissed trying to steal one"
"another slower ball outside off, the ball misses Santner's drive. De Grandhomme takes the bye, Dhoni misses at the batsman's end"
"another bye. It's another offcutter outside off, Santner misses another heave. De Grandhomme steals another bye as Dhoni misses the stumps again"
"fine stop from Pandya. Full outside off, drilled back to Pandya, who sticks his left hand out and takes the blow. OUCH! Pandya is writhing in pain. Has he broken a finger? Dislocated? The physio comes out. He's fine to continue."
"that's six. A slower delivery outside off, de Grandhomme knew what was coming, he stayed in his crease and swung away over deep midwicket. Just clears the boundary"
"a slow offcutter very wide outside off, left alone from de Grandhomme. Wide called"
"ooh that was in the slot, right in the slot, a slower cutter outside off, de Grandhomme swings but finds deep square leg for one"
"and that's the game. A slower delivery on middle and leg, driven away towards long-on for a couple."
"a 120 kph short and wide delivery outside off, carved away towards deep point, <b>India take the T20I series 2-1</b>"
