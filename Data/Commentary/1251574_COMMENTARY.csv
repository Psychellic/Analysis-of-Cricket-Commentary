"floated up across him, full enough to drive to long-off"
"good length outside off, goes to cut it. Quick work by cover, who scores a direct hit after running to his right and sliding and stopping. Bavuma the fielder.  But Zaman is home."
gently defended back to the bowler
unleashes a spanking cover drive but can't beat the fieder stationed there. Made some room for that shot
"<b>class by Babar</b>. Markram thought he'd push one through quicker, went marginally short, and that was enough for Babar to go on the back foot and cut it pleasingly through point"

"<b>he's finally got hold of a slog-sweep</b>. Gets one on the correct length and not too far away from him, goes down and nails it beautifully, sending it soaring over deep midwicket"

"tossed up on the stumps, clipped back to the bowler"

"<b>bang</b>. That's been absolutely leathered. Too short to start with and the ball just sits up, Zaman clears his front leg and swats a powerful pull that travels flat but still clears the midwicket boundary."
"back of a length going across him, patted back to the bowler"
"too full outside off and he creams a cover drive, but the man on the boundary does well to sprint to his left and cut it off. Not the greatest running to get only one run there."

"slower ball on a length going across him, waits for it and taps it gently through midwicket"

driven straight to mid-on. Babar lets out a cry of anguish
pushes it to short midwicket
"looks to slog sweep, misses.Given out lbw but <strong>Fakhar reviews.</strong> Went through with the stroke a tad early, didn't get any bat on it. The only bone of contention is if it would've hit the stumps. Ball tracking says missing. <b> Not out it is </b>"
don't need to refer this one! This is a bit of a brain fade from Fakhar after playing so well. Goes for a premeditated paddle but ends up getting an inside edge onto the pad as it lobs up for the keeper to complete a simple catch. No doubts about this one.
"sharp turn and bounce to square him up and beat his forward prod, lovely from Maharaj"
"beaten again as he plays inside the line of this one, two in a row"
"nearly had him! Short of Malan at slip. Oh dear, Rizwan had no clue about that one, played for the turn."

"giving himself room, so he pushes it through quicker and he mis-times the cut to point. Maharaj ends a fine spell"

crashes another cover drive but not as well timed this time so only a single
"<b>he's toe-ended it back to the bowler</b>. Sarfaraz will be filthy with himself for that dismissal. Gave himself a lot of room, exposing all three stumps and then some. Smuts tossed it up on the stumps, and Sarfaraz had to reach for it, gets it off the end of the bat towards the bottom and the ball tamely chips to the bowler, who holds on easily."
tapped softly towards square leg and they run through for a quick single
"length ball on off, gently tapped to cover, they sprint for a quick single again. Bavuma sprints in and fires a flat and hard throw, which Klaasen cops on his shin. Might have been close if that had hit direct."
"floated up outside off, and he unleashes a cover drive that screams across the turf, sweeper cover has to run to his right to gather"
"<b>and he's chipped it back to the bowler</b>. What a day Markram the bowler is having. Tossed up on middle, straightens and Faheem plays a bit of a nothing shot, just pokes at it tamely. No real conviction in that shot and it settles nicely into Markram's hands at chest height."

"length on the stumps, goes back and whips it off his pads through square leg"
"leading edge, but no fielder there. Was looking to turn it away, but the ball goes to the bowler's right and well short of mid-off"
"length on the stumps, clips it through midwicket"
"flatter and quicker on the stumps, stays back and cuts it fiercely. Fumble by the man at deep point means it's a comfortable two"
"looking to work it through midwicket for a single to retain strike and he's beaten a bit by the ball holding up a tad, and it rolls to the bowler off the leading edge. And man is Babar angry or what. Swishes his bat in the air and lets out a scream because he thought he could get a single there"
"back of a length outside off, cuts through point"
"floated up across him, ends up on a fifth stump line, he goes down on one knee and unfurls a cover drive. No getting past Bavuma at cover though, who has been spectacular today - as always"
"full toss and he's not managed to put it away. Waist high outside off, he could have smashed it anywhere, ends up hitting straight to point"
"flatter outside off, slapped to long-off"
"fired into the batsman who was looking to make room, can only jab it towards cover"
"<b>blinder from Bavuma</b> at cover. Poor ball to finish, too short and asking to be hit, Nawaz went on the back foot and crashed it hard, but didn't keep it down. Flies low to Bavuma, and is dying on him but he gets fingers under it and holds on. Another wicket for Markram - off a poor ball but he's bowled fantastically overall"

"good old mow across the line to a length ball, thick inside edge runs past short fine leg"

"flat on the stumps, rocks back and throws himself into a pull shot, no timing on it. Deep midwicket collects"
swats across the line to deep midwicket
"tossed up wide outside off, and Hassan was giving himself room and thus made the ball out of the reach of his attempt to crash through cover"
"tossed up outside off again, this time Hassan doesn't give himself room, stays still and is thus able to carve it through point with great timing, picked the gap too"
moving across again and this time he drives to deep extra cover
<b>walloped</b>. Too straight and full and Babar goes down on one knee to unleash a pleasing arc of a slog-sweep that sends the ball way over deep midwicket
"full toss across him, ends up well outside off, and he punches a drive through cover. That ends a fine day for Markram with the ball."
"flatter on the stumps, slugged across the line to deep midwicket"
"falls over as he completes the shot but that won't matter, because he's nailed this beautifully. Skips down the track, gets to the pitch while giving himself room and swings through the line, lifting it clear, straight past the bowler and over the boundary."
"giving himself room this time and wanted to send this ball to Johannesburg, judging by the swing he took at it. Doesn't connect though"
"<b>he connects nicely now</b> does Hassan Ali. Smuts bowled it slightly quicker, Hassan steps out and uses that amazing bottom hand power to slug this over long-off"
"and he's done it again. Too short and he rocks back to slug it across the line, well over deep midwicket. Not timed perfectly but so much power into that, it still carries over the boundary"
"made as if to give himself room and Smut bowled it full at the stumps, Hassan just needs to get a good, clean golf swing going, and he connects magnificently. Best connection of the lot in that over I think. Rousing finish."
"<b>boom</b>. Slower ball, length goes wrong, too short outside off and Babar moves across, swivels and uncorks a superb pull. Soars over midwicket"
"better length on the slower ball that time, hard length outside off, and he mis-times the attempted swat across the line. Goes off the bottom half of the bat to long-on"
"keeps it wide outside off, almost beyond the tram line but Hassan is not going to let a ball go without getting bat on it. Turns out this is a bit too far to reach so he can't time it as well and it rolls to long-off"
"<b>wham</b>. That is dismissed from his presence. Reads the slower ball again, sets himself up in position and unleashes a monster of a pull shot that travels waaay beyond the wide long-on boundary"
"fuller outside off, throws his bat at it and gets a thick edge that bounces to the third man boundary"
"<b>he's caught at the point boundary</b>. A few more yards and it would have been a century, but what a finish this has been by Pakistan. This was a full ball outside off, he went down on one knee and slashed at it hard. Got a top edge that was well held by the man on the boundary."

"leans into the drive, goes over cover and hits it one bounce to the fence! Too much width from Hasan, Malan was down on one knee to say 'I love such deliveries' and put that away"
"dive saves him at the bowler's end, quick single taken as he took off after a bullet drive to mid-off"
"wrists this into the gap at square leg, called for two and will get two"
"length ball on middle, pushed into the covers"

"<strong>cracking sound of the blade as it met the ball!</strong> This was short, angling in and Malan absolutely belted that pull off the front foot, one bounce into the ropes at midwicket"
"bunts it to cover. Close to a no-ball, no well, actually given as no-ball. <B> Freehit coming </b>"
slips it down leg and Malan picks him off his pads to the fine leg boundary. Freebie from Shaheen
driven wide of cover
"Appeal for caught behind, not given. <strong>Pakistan review.</strong> They're checking to see if there was an inside edge off the bat onto the pad and then through to the keeper. Replays confirm there was a spike. Markram was looking to punch this away, played down the wrong line to get a thin inside edge. <b> It was a reluctant review but they get it right nonetheless </b>"
"floats one onto the pads, flicked straight to midwicket"
rises with the bounce and fends to point
"tucks this into the leg side, straight to mid-on"
"beaten as he looks to drive on the up through point, went at it with an angled bat"
"beaten on the drive, some sound as ball passed the bat but no one w2as keen on even an appeal"
beaten as he looks to drive on the up through the front foot. <B> Maiden to begin for Rauf </b>
"tossed up full on the pads, gently turned through square leg"
"nice length, gets him coming on the front foot to defend"
"tossed up, played down the wrong line, struck on the pads  but he was giving himself room and struck well outside leg, going further down"
"given too much air, full toss, whipped through midwicket"

"back of a length dug into the pitch and into the batsman, he goes right back and gently taps it towards midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, punched to point"
"<b>super shot</b>. There was a man at deep square leg yards away, but he had no chance. This was hit like a bullet, went down on one knee to sweep and leathered it square."
"googly, strikes him on the thigh pad spinning into him as he was attempting to push at it. Usman appeals but that's heading down clearly. And over."
"went down to sweep again, but this time the length wasn't quite as full, and the ball bounced over his bat and struck him right elbow. Usman belts out another appeal but that is clearly going over the stumps"
"fuller outside off, comes on the front foot to defend. Shaking his right arm again after that. It's still bothering him, clearly"
"length ball, pitches on leg and spins across him, goes back and taps it in front of square"
"tossed up outside off, takes a half step forward to drive hard, but can't beat cover"
"back of a length on a seventh stump line and moving away, he has a big swing at it but misses. It's far enough outside off that it's given a wide"
"back of a length again, stands tall and slaps this through cover because there's width on offer. The man in the circle dives but can only get a hand to it to slow it down. Enough time for them to get two"

"gets it on a hard length outside off, Smuts moving across taps it into the legside and looks for a quick single, but there isn't one on offer"
"fuller around off, punched to mid-off"

"googly, spins in sharply from outside off, nudged through midwicket"
quicker one dragged too short and he short-arm jab-sweeps it to deep square leg
"good length on leg, spinning across him, goes back and whips it to mid-on. They sprint a quick single and make it easily because Rizwan at mid-on fumbles"
"<b>flipper goes through him</b>. Ripper of a ball. He had no idea which way it was turning, was shaping to cut it, and the ball hurries through between the gap left and crashes into the stumps. Smuts caught on the crease, with feet and bat out of position. Perfect sight for a spinner. Looked like a googly to me at first but replays show that was squeezed out between thumb and forefinger and not out of the back of the hand."
"<b>beaten</b> on the outside edge. Floats a googly up wide of the stumps, Bavuma coming on the front foot to defend, stays inside the line and it goes past"

"good length on off, punched through cover by opening the bat face again"
full toss and this time Bavuma won't miss out. Whips it through midwicket. Picks the gap and collects four.
"<b>would have been run out with a direct hit</b>. Good ball, length on the stumps and spinning away, Bavuma gently defended towards cover and set off for a run. Malan had to respond, would have been a goner with a direct hit, but the throw was fired in and the slip fielder backing up - Babar - could collect it off his toes"
"fuller outside off, carved towards point"
"a bit short, goes back and slaps it to mid-on"

"good length outside off, jabbed towards point"
"goes on straight, on off, but he deals with it well punching it through point"

gets well forward and jabs this back down the pitch
"drifting into the pads, worked into the gap at deep midwicket"

"shortish on middle, defended back"
"got him with a beauty! This is as plumb as they come. Drifts into middle and leg, hits the deck and straightens to hit him on the back pad. Malan played down the wrong line and was stone dead. Massive lift for Pakistan."
"driven to sweeper cover, off the mark"
"gentle tap into the off side, takes a few steps but can't run. <b> 'yeh nahi bhagega' says Sarfraz (he won't run)"

"works it wide of midwicket as they get a quick single. Pressure building, the asking rate has shot up"
"attacks the stumps with a full-length delivery, squeezed to mid-on"
"appeal for lbw, but the impact was outside the line even. The batsman was certainly playing a stroke, but <strong>Pakistan seem to have reviewed.</strong> Why would you burn a review there? Hard to comprehend. Not out."
"pulled but not entirely in control, down to deep midwicket"
eased wide of cover for a quick single
"drifting into middle and leg, works this down to long-on"
"big shout, massive shout and he's gone. Klaassen was hit on his back as he tried to mow this. Given out after a long deliberation, but <B> Klaasen reviews. </B> Looks adjacent to me. No bat at all, so what we need to see is ball tracking, and it comes back to show ball would've hit the stumps. Klaasen is gone and Pakistan are delighted. Nawaz has turned this game on its head in this spell, third scalp for him and Pakistan believe they can nick this. What a moment"

"length ball coming into him, steered to point"
"tossed up, drifts away from the left-hander, goes to drive, thick outside edge goes to third man"
"fuller on off, bunted to long-on"
"<b>beaten</b>. Nicely tossed up, drifts away and spins away - googly I think - and he's beaten going for the drive"
"and this one comes on way quicker than he was expecting, and bounces more too. Slider pitches on off and rises up to chest high, he was shaping to pull but gets it off the bottom end to mid-off"
"beaten on the drive once again, lovely drift and loop by the leggie"
"he has to do something to counter, so he skips down the track, gets to the pitch and drives along the ground to long-on"

"fuller on the stumps, punched to cover"
"good short ball outside off, he was looking to cut but nowhere near the ball as it rose over his bat"
"persists with the short stuff, and he's nailing it well too. Gets this to rise just outside off to just below shoulder. He goes to pull it, can't get hold of it, and it trickles towards mid-on off the bottom half of the bat"
"gets some bat on this short ball, didn't try to hit it too hard, guided pull through midwicket. Uh-oh, he's spoiled a good over by overstepping. Just a smidgeon but nothing behind the line. <b>No-ball</b>"
walked across to try and paddle it over the keeper but ends up not connecting. Hassan's over stays good after all.
"<b>he's got it away to the third man boundary</b>. Might have been another slider but a bit fuller, he stays low and chops it fine, beats short third man's dive"

"googly, comes on the front foot to it and pats it to long-on"
"<b>great stop from Rizwan at short third man</b>. Tossed up on the stumps, he goes for the reverse sweep, gets a bit of glove on it and gets it fine. Rizwan has to run to his right and dive full length, does it and stops the ball. Looks like he's not fully physically okay, but he stopped that well"

"loses control of that, full toss at waist height, flicked to fine leg with one hand off the bat handle"
"length on the stumps, tapped to cover"
"short ball, swivels and pulls, nice sound off the bat but that doesn't travel all the way. Longer boundary at deep midwicket, and gives enough time for the deep square leg to run around and cut it off"
"fuller outside off, gets down low and gets his bat horizontal to steer to third man"
bouncer again - that seems to be the plan to Andile - he manages to pull it through backward square leg. Not timed well enough but that gives them time to hare back for the second. He has to dive at the striker's end to make it
"short ball outside off, that kept low. Went past off stump at almost stump height. He was looking to pull, but the ball scooted through under the bat"
"good length coming into him, calmly tapped to third man"
"<b>shot</b>. Given width outside off, and it's too short, he stands and slashes, connects beautifully to send it screaming to the backward point fence"
"and that is hit incredibly hard as well, Imam at point has managed to stop it but he's flat on the floor with the blow. It's his right hand finger that he's clutching. <b>That's actually a dropped catch</b>. Was hit so hard he hardly had time to react, the ball pings his fingers and drops to the ground. Imam dropped to the ground soon after."
"cleverly bowled, offcutter and he's defeated by the lack of pace as he is too early into his cut"
"length outside off, runs it to third man"
"fuller on off, opens the bat face to steer it to third man. Slipped while going for the second but that's still <b>a very fine 50</b> by Verreynne. Superbly compact and with a range of shots, to go with a cool head on his shoulders."
"full outside off, crisp drive but straight to cover"
"sharp bouncer that he had to get out of the way of. Banged into the channel outside off, he was shaping to have a go at it but had to arch back. That hissed up like a cobra"
"another quick bouncer outside off, doesn't rise as much but he's still late on the pull, and gets it off the toe-end towards mid-on"
"yorker on the stumps, not much he can do with it, except what he did, defend it towards mid-on"

"hits the deck on middle, defended back"
steers this down to third man
hint of width outside off and he slaps this way into the gap at deep point
"nice and full on off, slower delivery, defended with soft hands"

"pushed into the cover region. Four of that over, Pakistan won't mind"
"dug in short on middle and leg, helped along to fine leg"
dabs it down to third man
"right line, around off on a length, cramped for room as he defends, can't get a run. This is excellent bowling. Pressure building on the hosts"
"high full toss, above the waist, as Phehlukwayo defends. Taken by surprise by that one, but hey, he'll get a <b> free hit </b> for the no-ball"
"that is adding insult to injury! Magnificent blow over extra cover. This was full and wide, Andile clears his front leg, makes room and swings through the line to clear the ropes. Ah, incredible"
arches back and helps it down to third man
backs sway to swing this over midwicket but is beaten for pace
"short of length outside off, bunted behind the wicket. <b> There's Andile's half-century </b>"
"looks to pull, gets an inside edge on the bounce to Sarfraz"
"hit back to the bowler, who fires the ball down the stumps at the striker's end. They look for an overthrow off a deflection but won't get it as it goes straight to short fine leg."
pulls this slower bouncer to deep square leg
"drilled back, the bowler puts his boot out to stop and deflects this into the leg side. Hardly any time to react for Hasan there. Must hurt him"
"slower ball and six! He makes room, gets underneath the delivery and belts it over extra cover. Raises the 100 of the partnership as well"
"looks to swing this over the bowler's head, gets a thick inside edge down to deep square leg"
"<strong>great work at wide long-on by Babar, saved two runs.</strong> Full and angling into the pads, this was whipped away uppishly, strong bottom hands and all"
"through with the stroke early, beaten by a slower delivery as he tried to scoop fine"
"slower ball and he's hit this down the throat of deep square leg! This was picked from way outside off, but he ended up getting more elevation than distance because it came off the top part of the bat. He ended up dragging it to Qadir in the deep. The century stand has been broken. Impressive knock from Verreynne though"
drilled down to long-off.
hit straight to the fielder at point
hit hard but will only get one to long-on
steered down to third man
"looks to clobber this over deep square, but through with the slog way too early. Excellent change of pace from Hasan"
"<b> that is an incredible catch from Sarfraz! </B> Andile swings this leg side but gets more elevation than distance. This goes a mile in the air. Short fine is running around, deep square is running in, but Sarfraz calls for it, loud and clear, puts his glove out to ask others to back off. The ball is still on its way down and he circles underneath it for a bit and takes the steepler. Incredible stuff. Andile didn't get the timing right also because this was a slower delivery and he was through with the shot early. Big moment in the game"
"clears mid-off for four! Too full, he backed away and hit it up and over. Right in the hitting arc"
mistimes this slower delivery back to the bowler
"length ball angling in, plays all around it and is hit on the box. Looks to scamper a leg bye, but can't get it"
"slower length ball outside off, defended"
"beaten by a slower length ball, he was looking to slap this away"
works this into the gap at square leg
"mistimes this hoick into the leg side, they'll scamper a single"
"has he gloved this down leg? Yes, he has. Haris tucks him up by angling it in from around the wicket, Hendricks looks to pull but it's too quick for him, just manages some glove on it and Sarfraz takes it gleefully."
"jammed down to long-on, they scamper back"
"off a thick inside edge, into the gap at deep midwicket"
"backs away, clears his front leg and wallops this over extra cover"
miscued over square leg
"yorker, squeezed into the leg side"
"this has been belted one bounce over the ropes, straight down the ground to bisect long-on and long-off"
"pulled from way outside off, down to deep square leg"
"looks to heave over mid-off, makes zero contact and the stumps are rattled."
"good strike down the ground! Made room, and swung his arms to generate power to clear mid-off"
"he's muscled this over long-on! Woah, where did that come from? Slower, fuller, he backed away, exposed all three stumps, cleared his front leg and went down town"
"yorker length outside off, beaten as he jams his bat down in time"
"that's an incredibly fast bouncer on leg stump, he was backing away to get a free swing but was cramped for room and saw this zip over his head. Typical response from a fast bowler to being hit"
"off the pad, down to fine leg"
"hit hard but to mid-off, they'll scamper a run"
another run to a mistimed hit
"beaten as he heaves this slower delivery, through with the stroke even before the ball arrived"
"hocked down the ground, Sipamla puts in a dive at the bowler's end to make it back in time"
"full toss, he backs away and swats this one bounce to the midwicket boundary"
squirted into the leg side
beaten by a skiddy bouncer as he looks to pull this one
"that's that! It's all over, <B> Pakistan win the series. </b> Shaheen cleans him up with a rip-roarer. Full, straight and into the blockhole to clean out the middle stump as the batsman swings and misses. Pakistan have become the second team after Australia to win two bilateral ODI series in South Africa after successfully defending 321. They've earned 20 points in the World Cup Super League and move to the top of the table, level with England and Australia."
