"starts with a short ball. Well directed, towards leg. Ducks underneath"
"back of a length delivery on middle and leg, clipped down to fine leg for a run. Looked hurried for pace"
"an attacking shot immediately. Shortish outside off, pulled away towards mid-on."
this is too short. Dug in again. Another bouncer that Naibducks underneath. But this is too high. Called
yorker on middle and leg. Jammed out. Not much swing so far.
"goes for it and finds the gap. Full on middle and leg, not a good line. Naib just flicks the ball nonchalantly over square leg. Didn't bother keeping that down"
"another boundary. That's bad bowling. Drops short on middle and off, not too quick. Naib picks the length early and pulls over square leg for four more"
"nicely bowled. His mode of operation. Flat outside off, a hint of spin. Played into the off side"
"full and straight again, worked towards midwicket"
"excellent bowling. Full, straight, accurate. Defended back"
"flat outside off, pushed back to the bowler. Not much the batsman can do with that. It's a lovely length"
"good length again, but slightly wide. Ghani tries to cut but misses. Some extra bounce"
"excellent over, but that's good batting too. Easy to think you need to attack after five dots in a T20, but the ball isn't there so he just flicks to deep midwicket to pick up one"
"good length on off, much better from Taylor. Skewed off the shoulder of the bat towards point"
"lovely shot. Runs at the bowler, improvises after seeing a shortish length and swings away over cover for four. No intention of keeping that along the ground. Why bother?"
nudged away towards deep square leg
yorker. Aimed at leg stump. Clipped to square leg. Much better over this from Taylor so far
"just slightly short and Naib is all over it. Clears his front leg and whack, over midwicket. Cross-batted carnage"
"much better. Fullish and straight, defended towards midwicket."
"straight and full, driven to long-on. Good batting."
"and that's through Naib. Full, straight again. Not changed much. Naib brings his bat down at an awkward angle and then plays down the wrong line. Goes through his defense and hits middle and leg stump. Not a very astute shot, considering the type of bowler Badree is"
"<strong>a big appeal</strong>. No. Sliding down. Flat down leg, may have been the googly. Stanikzai does not pick it. Hit in front of leg but that was drifting down."
flat and wide outside off. Stanikzai gets a bit of an edge on that and it races through the vacant slip region for four
"flat and straight, worked away to square leg"
"phew, <strong>that's ou</strong>t with no bat. Flat and straight, extremely full. Ghani looks to sweep but misses. Struck right in front. Did he get some bat on that? Yes, says the umpire."
"what happened there? Stanikzai ball-watching. Ghani runs two and is still run-out. A shortish delivery outside off, tapped towards short third man. Ghani sets off. Stanikzai puts his hand up in denial without looking at his partner. Taylor picks up and lobs his throw over the bowler's head. Ghani sets off for his second run but mid-off picks up and returns a better throw to the bowler who removed the bails. Not good from Stanikzai. There was probably one there, but could have done more to prevent the run-out"
"on a length down leg, hit on the thigh pad"
"shortish delivery outside off, pulled to mid-on"
"shortish delivery again, chopped towards short third man. Stanikzai takes a few steps forward before being sent back by his partner"
"hurried for pace and Stanikzai's gone. Afghanistan in tatters. A quick, short bouncer on off. Stanikzai gets to his pull far too late. The ball hits the splice of the bat and lobs back to the bowler for a simple catch. Clever bowling, if you're dropping short, it has to be quick."
"good length on off, blocked back"
"flat and straight again, inside-edged towards fine leg for a run"
"a googly on leg, pops up off the pad towards fine leg for a run. Leg bye"
"full and straight, worked to midwicket"
"quick and accurate. Superb bowling. Flat, outside off. Defended"
"slow and full on middle, worked to midwicket"

another short ball. Quick. Well bowled. Pulled to deep square leg for a run
"short and wide, spinning back in. Cut to point"
on the pads this time but Shenwari finds midwicket. Too many dots
"spinning back in, flat and straight. Shovelled to midwicket"
"this drifts down leg, a bit of pad or bat for a couple to fine leg. Narine ain't happy with that decision"
"the away-going one. The carrom ball? Full outside off, spinning away. Beaten comprehensively. Well collected"
swerves away prodigiously again. Excellent bowling. Beaten by a distance
"good length on middle, worked away past midwicket for a couple. Nicely played"
slightly leg-sideish. Allows Karim to open his wrists to collect one through square leg
"falls just short of deep midwicket. Back of a length on off, shovelled pull towards deep midwicket. Lands short of Mohammed running in"
"good length on leg, pushed back"
"looks for a big hit and gone. Short delivery on off and middle, the pressure of dots has resulted in a wild swing. A thick edge is easily collected by the keeper. Not a bad plan, execution nowhere close."
"another tidy over. Good length on middle, worked to midwicket."
"full and straight from Narine, defended back"
"short and wide, spinning back in. Hammered to deep point for a single"
"beautiful bowling. Flat outside off, moving away. Beaten again"
"good length outside off, pushed back to the bowler"
"nicely hit away. Overpitched outside off, driven away elegantly past cover for a couple"

"back of a length and angled in on middle, clipped hurriedly to midwicket"
"wide of the crease, angled in, attacking the stumps, bunted only as far as mid-on"
"short ball on leg stump, cramps the batsman up for room. He can't connect with a pull-flick"
"just short of a good length and outside off, rides the bounce and dabs it down to deep third man"
Afghanistan five down and sinking. Nabi backs away outside leg. Brathwaite digs it shorter and wider outside off. The batsman reaches out and slashes in the air. Gives an easy catch to deep third man
"yorker - or a near yorker - on off stump, jabbed back to the bowler"
"pinned in front!  Umpire Brathwaite raises his finger. This was the quicker offbreak, skids in and keeps a touch low. Shenwari is stapled to the crease as he plays across the line and misses. As plumb as it can get"
"slider, plays across the line, hit outside off"
"this one goes the other way! Starts outside off, breaks away, whistles past the outside edge"
"spooned back to the bowler. Wrong shot at the wrong time again! Story of this innings. Narine holds this offbreak back, lovely dip. The batsman dares to play across the line, does so early, and chips a return catch"
"floated up on off, inside edged through midwicket"

"straight ball on middle and leg, twirled to the right of mid-on. That should have been a single"
"nudged with the spin, placed square of short fine leg"
"Walton with the big gloves snaps it up! Narine has his third. Looped up slower on middle, bounces more than the batsman expected it to. He attempts the reverse sweep, plays early, and the top edge is tracked down by the keeper"
"dropped by Brathwaite at first slip! This one breaks away outside off, takes the outside edge, slip dives to his right but could not hold on"
"pushed through flatter and quicker, breaks in and hits the pad"
"full and outside off, slower ball, chipped to mid-off"
Rashid runs down the track. Williams delivers another slower ball - this is short and wide outside off  - cuts and top-edges it in the air. Lewis runs back from backward point but shells it

"Rashid clears the boundary again. Short and outside off, swatted with a flat bat over long-off"
"leg-stump full-toss, attempted slower ball, dispatched past short fine leg. 16 off three balls. Can Afghanistan get to 100?"
"Rashid backs away outside off, back of a length and outside off, just bounces over off stump as the batsman flashes wildly and only connects with thin air"
"slower short ball on off, hip-high delivery, Rashid picks the change-up but pulls it flat and hard to Narine at midwicket. The fielder times his jump to perfection. Rashid falls for a career-best 33"
"slower offcutter outside off, beats the outside edge comfortably"
"edged and flies over a leaping Walton. Short and outside off, swishes and sends a thick edge past the keeper's reach. Afghanistan inch towards three figures"
"<strong>Afghanistan pass 100</strong>! The keeper messes it up. Back of a length and angled in, beats the wild swing of the batsman, Walton is late to bend down, the ball rolls away to the fence"
"short of a length and angled in, Hamza sizes it up and short-arms it over the wide long-on boundary. Flat six 14 off the first three balls"
"uses his feet, nearly yorks himself, but carves a single to third man"
"Zadran backs away outside leg, the bowler follows him, hacked to mid-off. A direct hit could have dismissed Zadran"
"slower cutter on off, slogs early, shoots a top edge up in the air. Walton snaffles it. No issues there"
"four to start. Full and wide from Shapoor. Walton's weight is on his back foot. From that disadvantaged position, he converts the length into something shorter by leaning back and carving a cut past backward point"
"rollicking start. Full and straight, Walton offers the full face. Nice even balance. Past Shapoor and mid-on for four."
a slower ball and straight. Drags back that length too. Defended towards cover

"flat outside off, no turn. Hit back to the bowler"
"flat and straight again, no room. Hammered to mid-on from the back foot"
"gets underneath that. Quick and straight, but Walton prepares himself for that pace and he lofts the ball over mid-on this time"
drifts down leg this time and all Walton needs is some bat. Gets that with a sweep. Four easy runs to fine leg
"flat and quick, pushed back to the bowler. Better line, no room"
"down leg again, clipped to short fine leg"
"that's why. Drops short down leg, a long hop. Lewis picks the length early, rocks back and swivel pulls over short fine leg for six."
"flat and straight, pushed back towards the bowler"
"flat outside off, Lewis goes back quickly again and punches a drive through cover. Somehow finds the gap"
"quick again, straight. Hit to long-on"
pushed through from wide of the crease. Hit back to the bowler
"shovelled to long-on. Naughty angle of that bat face, came down at 60 degrees instead of 30-45 degrees"
"a slowish delivery around off, blocked to cover"
another lovely stroke. No consistency in lines or lengths. This is a straight half-volley and Walton drives it back from where it came. Full face of the bat past mid-on.
"taken this time. A shorter length on middle, Walton chooses to pull. Got there slightly late, hurried for pace. He can only skew his stroke towards midwicket, who dives forward and completes a quality catch. Never easy to get your fingers underneath those"
a full toss outside off. Samuels somehow misses a drive. Played down the wrong line. May have been Shapoor's angle
worked away to square leg
"not properly timed but still six. A slower ball outside off, Lewis gets underneath the length and lofts the ball over mid-off. Just clears the boundary. Shapoor has his hands on his head, not sure why, that wasn't close to a dismissal. Lewis picked his shot well"
"flat and straight, Samuels strides forward to defend"
"wow, that's humongous. Tossed up on off, Samuels hammers his straight six way over long-on. Got underneath that too, sensational hit. Bring out another box of balls"
"superb comeback. Drags that length back, flat on off, it spins away just enough to beat the bat"
"flat down leg, Samuels beaten on the other edge this time. Struck on the pad"
worked to short fine leg
looking for another clean swing but Hamza fires in a yorker which Lewis can only jam away towards mid-off
slowish on leg from Nabi. Played back
looks to go over mid-on but Nabi's angle and lack of turn means the ball skews over point off the leading edge. Almost makes the boundary too. Bats nowadays eh? Good effort on the boundary to save one
walks right across and works the ball towards midwicket
looking for another big hit but the length is excellent. Samuels improvises an awkward defensive stroke
whipped to midwicket where a fumble allows one
"six more. The crowd have some catching to do, they don't do very well. Flat on off, Lewis gets underneath this too and slog sweeps over square leg. Picked his area early"
"full down leg, worked to long-on"
"quick on off, blocked"
"a googly outside off, played back. Nicely bowled"
drifts down leg for a wide.

"good end. Full outside off, spinning back in. Defended"
"good length outside off, punched to the sweeper cover off the back foot"
"how many times does Lewis get out like that? That';s the only way I can remember him getting out. Shortish on middle and leg, Lewis pulls in the air and finds square leg who dives to his left to take a great catch. A perfect example of how strengths can become weaknesses with even slightly flawed execution"
"delectable. Samuels holds the pose too. Good length outside off, punched through cover and mid-off from the back foot. Yum."
"that's six. Samuels belts Karim's dibbly-dobbly nothings over long-on for a huuuge six. Stays in his crease and swings. Connect, boom."
"finds cover this time. On a length outside off, pushed to cover"
"on a length on middle, pulled to long-off"
"well bowled. Tosses up the googly on middle, somehow Samuels defends"
"overpitched on middle, drilled back to the bowler"
<strong>a stumping missed</strong>. Samuels comes down but the googly pitches down leg and continues on. The keeper fumbles his collection and allows Samuels to get back. A wide to boot
punched to long-off from the back foot
"well played. Doesn't pick the legbreak so he plays the line, allows himself to get beaten by a distance"
this is full enough so Simmons stays low and hammers a lofted slap over long-off for six. Lovely stroke
"swings across the line and misses this time. The straight googly on middle and leg, Simmons chooses a good option - the sweep. But you've to connect if you're attacking an accurate legspinner. Simmons doesn't and off he goes."
"flat and straight, punched to cover from the back foot"
"yikes. Short outside off, pushed towards cover who gets his hands over the ball and allows a run to long-off. Naughty, naughty"
"fullish delivery around off, pushed towards cover who, by the time, gets across to his left allows Samuels to make a tricky run"
blocked back off the straight line
"flat outside off, a hint of turn. Pushed to cover"
"shortish and wide outside off, hit to Samiullah at cover. This time Mohammed is struggling but Shenwari had to get to his left, not his stronger arm, and the run is easily made"
"short on middle, pulled to deep midwicket"
"it's a googly, not sure Mohammed picked him. Left that"
"another googly down leg, misses his flick."
this is the legbreak. Very quick. Still gets the ball to turn. Beaten
"<b>dropped</b>! Juggle, juggle, juggle, down. Flat outside off, a thick outside edge goes quickly to Stanikzai's right. He pops the ball up, then does it again. But the ball finds grass"
"played back to the bowler, a googly"
"full and straight, blocked"
"slow and straight, a nice pace, gets some turn. A leading edge towards the bowler"
"quick and straight, played back"

"looks for a big hit, the legbreak goes past the edge again. Mohammed did have some problems with Shadab too"
driven to long-off
"shortish outside off, Samuels goes back and hits the ball back to rashid"
a googly to finish. Samuels shaped ti cut but can only check a shot towards point. End of an excellent spell from Rashid

"tossed up legbreak. Mohammed doesn't pick it again, beaten on the outside edge"
"shortish delivery outside off, pulled to deep midwicket"
"overpitched from Shenwari, Samuels drills his drive past cover. Lovely timing, found the gap too"
"a yorker on off, jammed out"
"shimmied down but the length was dragged back, Samuels chops one towards point"
"straight through. A slower ball on middle and leg, Samuels wants to send this out of the ground. But doesn't make contact. The leg stump is uprooted. Swung across the line, instead of going straight. Shapoor sends him off with a long stare."
"full and straight, pushed to mid-off to get off the mark. A loud, confident 'yea, yea, yea, yea, yea' from Powell"
"on a length down leg, clipped behind square for a couple. Nicely played"
