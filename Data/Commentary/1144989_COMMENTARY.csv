"short of a length, angled into the pads, worked backward of square"
"fuller, outside off, driven firmly to the covers and there's a superb save by McDermott"
"gets the line wrong, and <b>clears deep square</b> with a strong flick off his pads, just has the legs to clear the man on the rope. Similar to how he fell in the ODI series in Adelaide"
"outside off, full, he comes forward and drives between cover and point"
"hammered! Offers up some width outside off, Hendricks drives on the up. Powerful"
"length ball angled across, a swing and a miss...handy first over for South Africa"
"over the wicket, full at off stump, swung without much footwork through the leg side"
"142kph, pushed down the leg side"
"back of a length outside off, played to backward point with an open face"
a might swing across the line as this slides across outside off
"back of a length, taken on the pad as he again aims to leg but that pitched fairly short and must have been outisde leg"
crunches a drive off the front foot to mid-off
"this time he connects! Full outside off, a lovely swing of the arms, drives up and over mid-off"
"short of a length, into the hip, he goes for the pull and it glances off the thigh pad to fine leg"
"short outside off, clubbed through midwicket, this sits up nicely and its a dismissive shot"
<b>miles into the stands</b> as he pulls this from back of a length over deep midwicket
"and again! He's taking apart some average bowling here, short of a length outside off, Hendricks getting onto the front foot and clubs through midwicket"
"<b>and then the short ball works!</b> Properly banged in this time, climbs a tough more on Hendricks, takes more top edge than middle out to deep square"
"length ball at off stump, 115kph, a slower one, angled to backward point"
"round the wicket, tapped into midwicket"
"full at the stumps, pushed just to the on side and they steal a quick single"
"gives himself room outside leg stump and carves this over backward point, a slicing drive"
"uses his feet and works a straight delivery through midwicket, Faf wanted the second but go sent back"
"nearly drags this on as he moves outside leg, it's fired in by Maxwell, takes the bottom edge"
"attempts a reverse sweep, takes the pad into the leg side"
"starts a touch short, de Kock again moving to the leg side, drives behind point and a slip in the deep allows a third"
steps to leg and drills down to long-off
"big appeal for lbw as de Kock misses a conventional sweep and Finch calls the <b>review</b>...has it struck him outside the line of off stump? No bat involved. Yes, it's outside the line"
"finds space, gets some fortune...came down the pitch, done in the air, miscues his lofted drive but it lobs between cover running back and long-off coming in"
"what power in that! That's a crunching, skimming cover drive which reaches the boundary in the blink of an eye"

"goes down on his back knee, fetches this from outside off with a slog-sweep to deep square"
"good work from Maxwell, dives to his right to cut off du Plessis' drive"
"a full toss, quick, fired across outside off and du Plessis misses. Carey does well to get a pad on it"
"but Carey can't stop this one, Maxwell firing it in very quickly, this time there's a thin scratch on it as du Plessis tries to heave to the leg side. Wasn't a catch, it nutmegged Carey"
"full and straight, 147kph, clipped through midwicket and they gamble on a second to Maxwell's arm"
"that's superbly played, gives himself room outside leg then ramps this over short third man...using Stanlake's pace to his advantage"
"that's very wide down the leg side, and they steal an extra run as well with Carey unable to prevent it with an under-arm throw"
"gives himself room and picks out cover as this came off the middle, travelled at a rate of knots to the fielder"
"down the pitch again, it's a short delivery, swatted into the leg side...tennis-style"
"a big full toss, just manages to clear mid-on, didn't get it as cleanly as he wanted, came low down off the bat...Coulter-Nile couldn't quite get it with a leap"
"<b>a brilliant parried boundary catch by Maxwell</b>, we see them pretty often these days but they are still fantastic. This was pulled towards deep midwicket, Maxwell took it just inside the rope and had terrific awareness of where he was, flicks it in the air, jumps over the boundary then back inside to regather the catch"
"<b>oops, massive full toss</b>, not sure if this was a knuckle ball which slips out. It pitches half way towards Carey as it flies over Miller's head"
"short, pulled on the bounce to deep midwicket"
"low full toss at the stumps, clubbed to long-on"
"very full outside off, drives powerfully towards deep cover, a sliding save around the boundary"

"a length ball outside off, tries to clear long-on but doesn't connect well enough and finds the man"
"round the wicket, goes for the wide yorker, driven firmly square to deep point...South Africa's 100"
"short of a length, a slower ball, defeats the pull and takes him in the stomach"

goes deep in the crease and sends a short-of-a-length delivery through backward point
"carves a wide full toss straight to deep cover, Australia finishing well so far. Miller gave himself a bit of room and ended up having to reach a long way for it"
a low full toss is heaved down to long-on
"that goes a bit wrong, dragged very wide outside off"
"full outside off, big swing, thin edge, comfortable catch...the big build-up for Morris and he bags a golden"

"back of a length, angled across outside off, he'll be annoyed he missed out on that"
"and another fresh air shot, swings across the line of a back-of-a-length delivery. Superb final over from Tye"
"back of a length at off stump, 143kph, worked out to deep midwicket"
"gets the line wrong, angled into the pads, just takes the thigh guard and it <i>just</i> has the legs to trickle into the boundary"
"144kph, short of a length, follows Lynn as he aims to pull through the leg side and beats him for pace"
"<b>misjudgement in the deep!</b> This should have been a catch...Lynn pulls a back-of-a-length delivery towards deep square, Hendricks had come in too far and it lobbed over his head"
"now he gives himself some room to the leg side, this is fuller and straight, sliced over backward point"
very good work from de Kock as he dives full length to cut off this bottom edge as Lynn aims leg side again
"comes down the pitch, it's back of a length, he does well to whip this off his pads behind square"
"short of a length, into the pads, drops down by his feet and Lynn calls him through"
"a flat-batted swat to a short delivery, goes straight back towards the bowler who can't cut it off"
"<b>dropped!</b> And another mess-up in the field for South Africa. Three fielders converging and none of them really wanted it. Phehlukwayo the man who ended up dropping it. Finch was followed by a short-of-a-length delivery, sent it very high into midwicket. David Miller, running in off the boundary, may have had a better chance"
"back of a length at off stump, a rare dot ball"
"<b>strikes this time!</b> Back of a length, this doesn't bounce much, Finch swings to the leg side and his castled"
skims past off stump as Lynn gives himself room to a length delivery
"short of a length, a short-arm pull clears mid-on with some ease"
"hammered dead straight and into the stumps! That's cost him a boundary. Drills his drive off the middle, demolishes the timber"
"<b>picks out cover first ball!</b> Short won't make an impact, follows his ODI duck in Perth with one here. Full outside off, was there for the shot, nice length for it, but just drove it to the edge of the circle"
"short of a length, good delivery, nips back at Maxwell who pushes it towards mid-off without much conviction"
"<b>cleaned him up!</b> What an over from Morris. Gets the yorker bang on. Right at middle stump, Lynn gave himself a touch of room. Tailed in a touch as well, lovely delivery"
"starts on leg stump and gets tickled away fine, Ngidi makes excellent ground around the rope to flick it back. Brilliant from a fast bowler"
"pushes down the leg side, hasn't started on the right line"
"another poor ball, full outside leg stump, he's fortunate Stoinis just flicks this for a single to long leg...would have been a wide"
"a slower ball, at the stumps, flicked through midwicket"
"another slower one, full outside off, and this is sent skimming to the cover boundary by a sweetly-struck drive"
"<b>finds backward point this time!</b> Goes for another drive, not quite as full, this time the face opens a touch and it's sliced in the air. Neat catch above the head"

"pushed wide across outside off, a swing and a miss...not too far from a wide. Just four off the over"
steps outside leg stump and swings a length ball to long-on
"<b>scooped into the hands of de Kock!</b> But at least he's not run out. Went across his crease, a short-of-a-length delivery, aims to scoop it over the keeper and it runs off the face"
"full and straight, pushed back to the bowler"
"on off stump, back of a length, opens the face through point"
"driven through the off side, wide of long-off which allows him back for a second"
"picks up this slower ball! Maxwell connects well, a full delivery angling in towards leg stump, he brings out the golf swing and clears deep midwicket"

swept to deep midwicket
"sweetly struck, lofted straight down the ground, long-on does well to get across"
gives himself room to a shorter delivery but it's just a single to long-on
"full, can't get underneath it, dragged through midwicket"
"<b>simple catch to long-off</b>, came down the pitch but couldn't get the distance needed, slow through the air"
"gets the yorker in but isn't backed up in the field, sliced towards backward point who dives over it"
"back of a length, follows Maxwell, carved over point. Keeps the strike"
"full outside off, a slower ball, he's through the shot...perhaps moving around the crease too much"
"another dot ball, this time a swing to leg against a short-of-a-length delivery"
"this is superb from Morris, follows him with a short ball which Maxwell tries to ramp down to third man. Crowd want the wide, as does Maxwell. Probably a fair shout, actually"
"tries for the yorker, just gets it wrong and slips down the leg side"
"<b>it's all happening!</b> Goes for the yorker, it's a low full toss which is driven to mid-off, almost carries for the catch, du Plessis collects on the half volley and goes for the run out by NCN makes it with a dive"
"follows him with a back-of-a-length delivery, deflects off the hip to third man"

"and now the follow-up is a dot as he moves outside leg, swings and misses"

"another short one, makes a connection this time and pulls to fine leg off the glove"
gets a top edge and this hoick to leg and it flies to fine leg
