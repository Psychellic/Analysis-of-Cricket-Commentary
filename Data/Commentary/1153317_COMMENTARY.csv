"<b>top edge caught easily at mid-off</b> dug in the short one outside off, and Tamim went for the pull. Too slow on it though and he only gets a top edge that balloons to mid-off"
"<b>that's gone through everyone</b> another short ball outside off, Sarkar tries to go for the pull first ball. He's too late on it, but perhaps his bat swing unsighted the keeper, and the ball goes over his head for four byes"
"<b>beautiful shot</b> a mite fuller outside off, and Soumya punches it with minimal follow through to send it racing to the point fence"
"good length outside off, pushed into the off side"
"<b>another short ball does the trick</b> Oshane's speeds today have been around 140kph mark, but this seemed like more of an effort ball. Dug in short, Liton was coming down the track, cramped him for room but he still went through with the pull. Only managed a top edge that mid-off caught for an even easier take than Tamim's"
"full and homing in on the stumps from around the wicket, Shakib defends from the crease with a straight bat"
"<b>thick outside edge flies to third man</b> what is with the Bangladesh batsmen moving away and making room? Happening without much control of the shot. Shakib does that now to a fuller ball, gets a thick outside edge that flies to the third man fence"

Good length ball, nipping into the batsman, Mushfiqur tapped it towards point and set off for quick single.

"full ball on the stumps, tapped back to the bowler"
"<b>he's nicked it behind</b> He was given out by the umpire, but his colleague at square leg has a chat with him, and they go upstairs to confirm if it carried cleanly. Seemed out and soft signal is out as well. Back of a length, off-cutter and too close to punch for Mahmudullah, who tried to force it away anyway. Ends up getting an edge to the keeper. The third umpire confirms it's out"

"fuller ball outside off, he opens the face to drive it past point"
"angled into the pads, and he misses the flick. They get a single with the ball rolling off the pad towards midwicket"
"too short and pulled powerfully to the deep square leg boundary. Rovman doesn't have the pace to hurry the batsman, and he was onto it quickly, going on the back foot and absolutely smoking that"
"corrects his line and goes fuller, and the batsman comes forward to wrist it to long-on"
"angled across him and beats him. Shakib went for a big drive over cover, but missed it completely"

"length ball on the pads, goes back to flick it to fine leg"
"<b>that's got air miles on it</b> down the track, picks it up on the half-volley and frees his arms to swing it high and handsome over midwicket. Brings up his <b>fifty</b> as well. Shakib has held the innings together and scored briskly even while wickets have been falling"

"outside off, punched to point"
"short ball into the ribs, but Mehidy stays back and turns it down to fine leg"
