"back of a length on off stump, defends"
cuts a short ball to point

"he's a bit rushed again as he tries to flick a ball on his hips and it goes up in the air, past the right of midwicket"

gets behind the line of a ball on off stump
"short again and he pulls it away. Good shot. Hits it in front of square, showing he's not afraid of these short balls"

"too full and on off this time, Porterfield drives that down, not very convincingly but he has enough on it for another four"

taps the length ball back to the bowler
"he pulls the length back, and the batsman goes back to work it to leg"

This was a good ball but nowhere near the stumps, pretty short and well outside off, it rises and naps back in sharply, Stirling wants to help it to third man but only manages to edge it to off stump. Instant cry of anguish from him because he has to go back"
stays still in front of off stump to defend the length delivery back
"flight and some drift towards the batsman's feet, he flicks it for one"
"<strong>beaten completely by the googly</strong>, loud appeal and given. But he's asked for a <strong>review</strong> as well. Was it turning too much? Beautiful googly turning in from off stump, hitting him on the front pad as the bat was outside the line. Looks very close as we wait for UltraEdge. Looks like the ball just missed the inside edge, it's very close because the bat brushed the pad when the ball crossed it. 'No bat' says the third umpire and ball-tracking says it's <strong>going over</strong>. The umpire smiles, so does Walsh"
"bit of a mix up now as Tucker pushes the ball to mid on and wants a quick one. O'Brien is ball watching and took off very late, but he eventually makes it because of an inaccurate throw"

"loopy full toss, dipping outside off, and O'Brien drives it with minimal footwork, through the covers and he gets four"
"loopy delivery on the stumps now, and pushed back"
"there's a gully in place and he gets a dolly! Ireland falling apart again. Short ball rising on Tucker, excellent use of height from Joseph. Tucker was taken by surprise and stuck his bat in front of his face, and the leasing edge lobbed up to Lewis' right"
"short of length around off, he stays back expecting the short ball and defends to off"
"shortish again outside off, he taps it towards cover"

"brings it in this time towards the stumps, and Singh gets a thick inside edge to the leg side"
"nicely bowled on middle with some turn towards off, he waits and defends"

"nice length to make him come forward, he gets a very thick outside edge to short third man. Some turn there"
"<strong>just wide of sweeper cover</strong> and it's gone all the way! A half-volley, O'Brien went for a risky inside-out drive and it went to the right of a running and sliding Shepherd, and over the top"

"back to outside off, he steers it wide of point in the gap for two"
"around length outside off, pushed to cover"
"it's the <b>short ball trap</b>, gets the top edge but it falls <em>just</em> to the left of fine leg! Singh went for the hook as the ball rose on him, it went high too, but it was out of Cottrell's reach as he ran in and to his left"
"short of length outside off, tapped wide of point for one"
"<strong>loud appeal</strong> for lbw, <strong>given</strong> immediately and it's been <strong>reviewed</strong> straightaway! I think it's too high. O'Brien almost on his toes there, the ball coming in sharply from short of length outside off, hitting him over the knee roll and it's <strong>going over the stumps</strong>"
"back of length outside off, punched into the covers this time"
"Joseph does get his wicket in the over, thanks to a needless heave from O'Brien, and the top edge is taken at fine leg. Absolutely no need for that shot, back of length and coming in, he swings the last ball of the over after surviving earlier in the over, doesn't middle it and it goes high enough for Cottrell to run in from fine leg and get under it in time"

"back of a length on off stump, defends"
outstanding drive again as Joseph goes really full on off stump. Mid-off in the way

"good length, outside off, lets it go"
drives smoothly to long-off
"pushes to mid-on and runs and there's a direct hit. Pooran's the fielder who is onto the ball quickly and pings the target. Singh though puts in a full stretch and he's safe, plus the fact he was on the front foot when he played the ball might have helped"

"angling in now, fine leg is square and he glances it fine to get two"

off stump line from good length and he defends it square of the pitch
runs this down to third man from outside off
"the <strong>extra bounce</strong> makes the ball rise and Pooran ends up taking his eyes off the ball while hopping and trying to pull, taking it on the shoulder for a leg bye"

"short again, swatted with intent now to deep square leg"

hardly any room but he tickles that down to third man for one
on the fourth stump and Hope still flicks it behind square on the leg side for one

"full outside off again, and another big drive, this time to sweeper cover for one"
bit too full and it's driven straight down to mid-off along the ground
pulls the length back and Hope flicks that to leg for one
short ball around off and he smashes it into the ground with a pull towards square leg
"back of length towards leg now, he hops and works it to leg again"
"126kmh, angling in from around off, he helps it to midwicket again"
that's a straight drive with as straight a bat as you can ask for! Hardly any follow through which means the timing was perfect to drive the ball for four down the ground
now that full now and it's flicked to mid on now
"short ball to end the over too, pulled to midwicket gently"
"short ball, Pooran does well to pivot on the back foot and pull that in the air and behind square for a cracking four"
"drives this one on the up now, from outside off to point"
"127kmh, tight line on off, he taps it to point and screams a big 'no'"

gets a bit of width and slams it but finds mid off

"flatter ball on middle, works it through midwicket"
"full and outside off, he drives to the sweeper"
nudges a tossed up ball down to long-on
rocks back and taps it through cover
Appeal for lbw and umpire Wilson's given it! Shai Hope reviews it though. He is a good deal across his stumps on the front foot and ends up missing an offbreak that beats his inside edge. Pins him on the front pad in front of middle stump. HawkEye shows umpire's call on hitting the wickets and that was - all together now - O-U-T.
loops it up outside off to draw the batsman forward in defence
"that's outta here! He sees it tossed up, wades forward and unleashes a clean swing of a straight bat. Six over long-off. Whoa."

rocks back to drill the quicker ball on off stump to long-off
"another low full toss, this one wide outside off, he lashes it to the sweeper"

"pushes it through down leg, Pollard misses his flick but does get a pad past short fine leg"
drives a full ball outside off to the sweeper
"launched again! Onto the actual UFO shaped roof! Overpitched from the part-timer and Pollard lunges forward and unleashes a monster straight hit. New ball, please."
this actually clears the roof! Pollard puts even more muscle behind this hit and the ball soars clean over the Worrell Weeks Walcott stand right behind the bowler.
"fires it into the base of off stump, Pooran steers it to point"
dinks a length ball behind square leg
stays back to block a flatter delivery on off stump
works it to midwicket
"full and outside off, defends"
beats the outside edge as a good length ball doesn't turn into the right-hander as he expects
dabs a back of a length ball on off stump to third man
"Pooran could have been run-out! Pollard tries to work the ball to midwicket, but it bounces up a bit more on him, making him mis-hit it. Besides, there's a fielder there, Simi Singh. WI really shouldn't have gone for the single, Pollard eventually sends Pooran back but a direct hit would have had him"
works the shortish ball past midwicket
digs it in and the ball rips past the left-hander as he drops his wrists. This is good stuff. Hostile stuff

"full and outside off, drills it to long-off"
"fires it in at the stumps, Pollard is back in his crease and offers a punch to long-on"
thumps the short ball down to long-on

goes short but it's too far outside off for Pollard to play
"opens the face and runs the good length ball, bouncing extra, awkwardly to third man"

"good length on off stump, defends"
deals with a ball rising up past his chest with a neat little nudge past midwicket
slides down leg as he hopes to pull it
"gets to fifty with a rasping cut shot past backward point. He doesn't really have all that much room to work with, but his bottom hand is so very strong. Enough power there to compensate for lack of room"
"whips it over short midwicket - possible catching chance, but Pollard strikes this very clean. Stirling is the man close in. Too close in as it turns out"
clips a good length ball to short fine leg
backs away to try and flay the short ball through cover. A little too much turn for him to succeed
slows it down and tosses it up. Pollard defends
"shortish and outside off, punches it down to the bowler"
"he cleared the ground two-handed, so he goes one-handed this time and it's the same result. Well nearly, this time he only clears the rope (at long-on) To think Singh had actually deceived him with the ball dipping in front of him, forcing him to reach out..."
"full on middle, defends"
allows the short ball to come to him and dabs it behind point
walks at the fast bowler who promptly bowls short and Pollard works it to long leg
lets go a good length ball outside off. It definitely looks like these two feel they can win this
"the ball climbs on him again, but Pooran is still able to work it through midwicket, and before anything else can happen, <b>we have rain</b>"
rises up with the short ball and taps it towards midwicket
"bowled im! Lovely work from Singh, coming from around the wicket, angling the ball so sharply into the left-hander. It pitches on leg stump. Pooran plays for a bit of turn, but there's way more than he bargains for. His outside edge is beaten and his stumps take a hit"
plenty of turn as he hits a good length and gets Shepherd to block in front of middle
"full and outside off, drives to mid-off"
tries to flick a full ball well outside off and ends up with a leading edge back to Singh

chops a good length ball outside off to point
defends a good length ball on off stump
"attempts a flick to a ball that strays into his body, goes off his thigh pad to the keeper"
"caught and bowled! That might be the game! McCarthy goes short. It sticks in the pitch. The ball hasn't done that all night. But it does now. Pollard is early into his flick. It lobs off the splice of his bat. McCarthy rushes forward, dives to his right, gets it in both hands and is instantly mobbed by his team-mates"
a beauty to welcome Pierre! Pitches it on length on the stumps and moves it away to beat the outside edge. What a big over for Ireland
"gets one in his range in front of the stumps, stretches his long arms and hammers that with a big swing over midwicket for a six!"
sharp turn into the batsman who goes back and opens up to help it to leg
"outside off, he opens the face of the bat towards point"
"<strong>taken at midwicket</strong>! The slip fielder had just moved to midwicket, and Simi Singh darts in a flat and quick delivery. It wasn't a great ball, was very short, but the pace hardly gave Shepherd any time to go back and pull properly. Doesn't middle it and Stirling dives to his right for a good, low catch"
leans forward a bit and drives to long off to get off the mark
"makes full use of the leg stump line and sweeps that behind square, against the turn to get four useful runs"
"slow and back of length outside off, he leaves it"
"<strong>nearly takes the outside edge</strong>. A more drivable length and just outside off, he drives down the ground but misses it completely"
"on good length and drivable length outside off, he leaves it again"
"good bounce for that back of length ball outside off, watches it go to the keeper again"

"back of length and coming in, he defends it towards off off the back foot"
"outside off, the batsman goes back and steers it to point"
"touch shorter and slower, he goes back and punches to mid off this time"

outside off and it's pushed back by Pierre
goes on the back foot to pull but only slaps it back to the bowler
that's a maiden as Pierre helps the ball to point off the back foot
"in two minds there, Walsh. It's that nagging line outside off, and he withdraw his bat a little late"

on the back foot and punched to cover point
"short ball rising and angling in, worked towards midwicket for one"

"fullish now outside off, he drives for a thick outside edge to third man"
some turn there around off as Pierre goes back to defend
"<strong>loud lbw appeal</strong> as Pierre goes back, the ball came in with the angle but the umpire says no. Ireland want the review but they're out of time!"
"short and turning away, he slaps it over the covers for one"
<strong>almost another mix-up</strong> as he steers the ball to point and doesn't want a single but there's a deflection at point with the fielder diving and they eventually take one

"a bit of angle on the of side, he steers it towards point"
point dives to his right to save a few as Walsh cuts that hard off the back foot
<strong>just wide of short midwicket</strong> and Walsh survives! Back of length towards the hips and the extra bounce beats Walsh who lobs the ball to the leg side and Balbirnie leaps to his right but can't get there
"towards leg again, worked to fine leg for one now"
"<strong>into the rib cage</strong> with a short ball. Walsh hops, tries to defend and gets an inner edge onto his body"
"a bouncer nearly down the leg side, called wide for the height by square leg umpire"
"slower full ball on the stumps, he flicks with hard hands and can't clear midwicket"
"some turn around off, he opens the face for a quick single towards point"
"full on off, driven down to long off for one more and that's the team 200. Big cheer from the crowd"
"full on middle, pushed back to the bowler"
"pulls the length back a bit, he reaches out to tap to point and sends Walsh back"
"<strong>edged to slip</strong>! The fifty partnership is broken, Ireland are back in the game. McBrine gets a bit of turn with a length delivery, Pierre stays back and wants to push it to off but only gets an outside edge to slip where it goes straight into Stirling's safe hands"
"turning into Joseph, he helps the ball to midwicket"
"there's an appeal for caught behind, there was a noise, down the leg side. Umpire says no as the bat hit the ground or ball took the pad"

"short ball, not too quick, and he lets it go over his eye level"
"there's a <strong>sound down the leg side</strong>, the Ireland players go up in celebration for caught behind, the umpire takes a few seconds and <strong>calls it a wide</strong>! Ireland <strong>want a review</strong>. Short of length down the leg side, he wanted to tuck it away fine, and UltraEdge shows there was nothing despite the noise. Great decision by Illingworth"
"<strong>chipped in the air and just over midwicket</strong>. A risky shot from Walsh as he flicked it in the air, midwicket ran back for the catch but it was outside his reach, and they take another risk by going for the second"
"fullish on the pads, flicked wide of fine leg now for two more"
"oh, a <b>misfield at mid-off</b> gives Walsh a single and he will happily keeps strike"
"fullish on leg, driven down past the bowler to long off"
"and he turns it down the leg side for a wide, good take by the keeper"

the bowler and keeper appeal loudly for lbw but it's hit Joseph's front pad in front of leg and was probably going down leg

such is Joseph's confidence that he taps the ball towards short cover and takes a quick single to keep strike
driven elegantly into the covers off the front foot
steers the back of length ball to point now
"rising short ball gets the top edge, and <strong>falls just wide of backward point</strong>! Joseph was surprised by the steep bounce there, he stuck his bat in front of him and the edge lobbed to the left of point but he didn't dive to get to it. Wasn't very far"
"on length outside off, he pushes into the covers"
outside off on length and he lets it go
"some more room now outside off, he drives and misses"
"<strong>could've been a run out</strong> but they come back and eventually take one for the overthrow! Flicked to midwicket, Joseph hares out and is sent back, keeper collects the throw from short midwicket and throws it at the stumps but misses and concedes one"
""
"accurate on middle stump now, he steers it to cover"
"<strong>right in the block hole</strong>, he digs it out, back to the bowler"
swing and a miss outside off as it's pitched short and it goes over the bat
"angles the length ball away, beats the outside edge with a good delivery but it's not enough"
on the stumps and it's driven down to mid off
"<strong>loud appeal for bat and pad</strong>, Ireland think they have Joseph but the ball only lobbed off the pad towards short leg where the keeper caught it. Bat also hit the pad"
"drives on the off side, bit of side edge excites Ireland"
on the stumps and driven down again
sharp turn outside leg and it's a wide down the leg side
this time Joseph takes it on the pad as the ball turns when he goes on the back foot
"has the <b>keeper dropped it</b>? Joseph went back to push it on the off side, the ball turned from back of length, the pad in front of off stump, some gap between bat and pad and the ball may have taken the inside edge. Replays are not really conclusive"
"on length on the stumps, driven into the covers"
"<strong>smashed down the ground</strong> for a cracking four! That's the shot of a top batsman. It wasn't all that full, but it was in that line outside off and Joseph swing hard down the ground with a big follow through"
"and again, this time a <b>more elegant straight drive</b>! Pitched up, in the slot, and he drove that with a complete straight bat, high elbow and what not"
"and he's chipped a catch to midwicket because of the pace variation! Slower delivery, short too, so it takes time to reach Joseph who has opened his stance already and then slaps the ball gently to midwicket. Like a friendly slap"
"tries to target the stumps but it's gone towards leg stump, he's stuck on the pad in front of leg, no run"
full on the stumps and flicked along he ground to midwicket. The fielder dives to his left to get both hands
leans forward and taps the ball to point

low full toss driven down hard and mid-off goes to his left to fire in a throw
tries a yorker and Walsh drives it down to long on
"<strong>that's very close, has Cottrell made it at the bowler's end</strong>? He pushed the ball down the ground, short cover put in a dive to his right and quickly threw the ball too, at the bowler's end. Hardly any time for Cottrell to make it. Direct hit and he was gone. Cottrell's bat is nowhere near the crease when the bails are dislodged but the third umpire wants to make sure that the ball is still in the bowler's hand when the stumps are broken. He's asking for different angles, he wants the zoom, he wants to rock and roll. Give him everything, I say! We have the zoom and it seems that the ball is popping out of the hands when the stumps are broken. The ball is hitting the stumps, in my view, this should be out. I wonder if Ruchira Palliyaguruge would have taken so much time and replays if so much was not at stake. Oh, he says the evidence is not conclusive, because he's not sure if the ball was in the hands or not when the stumps were broken. He gives the benefit of the doubt to the batsman, <strong>not out</strong> it is, the match goes on!"
"<strong>oh my goodness, there's more drama. We're not done yet</strong>! Walsh struck the full toss into the covers and didn't take off for the second at all, but Cottrell turned around and ran three-fourths of the second. The throw is in at the bowler's end when it should have been at the keeper's, Cottrell is on another planet, but the bowler doesn't collect the ball, he loses balance, Cottrell slips while turning around and he eventually makes it by the time the ball reaches the keeper's end."
"<b>sealed with a six</b>, Sheldon Cottrell! He sized up for the big shot by opening his stance, got a full delivery outside off and he tonked it over the covers. The Kensington Oval has erupted, Ian Bishop is screaming on the mike"
