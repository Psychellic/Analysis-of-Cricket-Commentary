floated up and angling in on middle. Du Plessis goes inside-out and lofts it over extra cover. Sweeper cover runs to his right and cuts it off

"length ball outside off, cuts back in sharply and Duminy sticks the bat out with no feet, gets an inside edge that misses the stumps"
offers up some width outside off on this length ball and du Plessis steers it wide of the backward point fielder. Guptill runs across and slides to field it
Duminy defends this length ball and the bat face closes slightly as he completes the defence and the ball goes off the outer part of the blade to the right of Boult
"fullish ball, commits early on to the front foot and ends up walking into the forward push as the ball goes off the outer part of the blade to the third man region"
"length on off, holding its line, opens the bat face from the crease and guides it to point"

"length ball, beats him with pace as it jags back in sharply. Du Plessis gets a nasty inside edge on to the inner thigh"
stays leg side of the ball and flays this length ball through the off side but cannot get it past the diving cover fielder
nicely controlled. Du Plessis uses the angle on that one nicely to his advantage. Boult angles one in at pace and du Plessis just picks it up off the pads and chips it over the fielder at mid-on as the ball sails well over the man there and goes to the boundary. And that brings up <b>Faf's fifty</b>
arches back and runs this down to square third man
"short of good length on off, defended towards covers"
"slower ball, tucked to midwicket"
backs away to give himself a chance to free his arms. And comes down the track to get on top of that. It was another off-cutter and takes an age to come on but du Plessis does well to take a good stride towards it and pulls it to deep midwicket. Nice control on that shot as well

"advances down the track and Neesham drags the length back, makes the late adjustment and stabs it out to third man with an open bat face"
opens the face of his bat and guides it to third man. The fielder is slightly square and he runs to his left and cuts it off

"short ball, Duminy arches back to negotiate the bounce and opens the face of his bat to guide it down to third man"
"width on offer outside off, length, guides it to backward point"
opens his arms as he sees width outside off and tries to cut but it is not short enough and he bottom-edges it hard into the ground
sticks to the wide outside off channel and this time Duminy punches it off the backfoot in front of point and they take off for a very quick single
"fuller and just outside off, around the fourth stump channel, drills it off the front foot down to long-on"
Dragged on. The wide outside off channel pays. Duminy opens his blade as he sees this one pitch around a set of stumps outside off and tries to cut it away. But he does not account for the late movement. Cuts back in late after pitching and gets the inside edge as the ball goes into the stumps.
"front foot defence, inside edge to the pads"
tossed up and angled in on middle and leg. Defended
"good length and spinning away, comes forward and drops it into the covers region. Guptill is stationed there and du Plessis takes off for a single. He is sent back and a direct hit would have seen the back of him. He was halfway down and has to put in a desperate dive"

"shorter ball, swivels around and pulls. Not much pace on the delivery or off the wicket and he cannot time it well as he gets it away to midwicket"
"short ball, this one's at 130 clicks and he is done in by lack of pace. Gets hit on the shoulder as he completes the shot early"
shifts back in the crease and tucks this away to the leg side
""
strides forward and drives this fuller ball to long-off
du Plessis lays into a cover drive as he gets the front leg out of the way and pummels this but he cannot beat the fielder there as he makes a diving save
"fuller ball again, cover fielder dives again and though it is not driven as hard this time, it gets past his dive"
defended down the pitch. No run there
"short of a length on the stumps, opens the bat face and steers it to backward point"

"chipped straight to midwicket. Length ball, gets stuck in the surface and does not really come on. It was an off-cutter and du Plessis comes forward and tries to turns it away into the leg side. But he is not in the best of positions and he fails to keep it along the ground as he fails to get his head completely down while playing it"
"bang on off, moves away to make room for himself and cuts to point"
stays in the crease and waits for this one to come on before turning it away to square leg
opens the bat face by using his wrists and cannot beat backward point
fetches a sweep from outside off as this one comes on at a fuller length and plays it to deep midwicket
backs away and uses the depth of the crease to this length ball on the stumps before punching it away to long-off
"Miller sweeps again but this time he does not keep it along the ground. Gives it too much power and it goes hard and flat to the fielder at deep midwicket. Brownlie snaffles a superb catch. It was coming on to him quickly and dipping on him but he judges the dive to perfection as he gets forward, gets low enough and pouches it smartly"

There is uncertainty whether it has carried or not. Taylor begins to walk off and soft signal is out but it really is touch and go. Seems like it has bounced just before the glove and the umpires refer it upstairs. Replays are conclusive enough and the decision is not out"
tries to cut but this is again too close to cut. Boy is Taylor struggling here. They have asked for a review of the lbw. Not out was the decision. The ball cuts back in from short of good length and raps Taylor on the back thigh. Seems like impact is outside off. Replays show there is no bat involved and ball-tracking says impact is outside off

comes forward to push this fullish length ball and drills it off the inner part of the blade to midwicket
misses the flick as he is hurried by the pace on that delivery. Gets slightly big on him also after landing on a length and Taylor wears it on the pad as he jumps up and tries to turn it into the leg side

Guptill lofted it straight down the ground and de Villiers just came running out of nowhere but could not get to it. De Villiers had to first run quite some distance to his right, which he does and puts in a full-length dive and gets his hands to it but cannot hold on to it. <b>150 for Guptill</b> and he gets a standing ovation"

"tries to drag this from outside off and slog it. It's quite wide and he is not close to it, ends up dragging it to mid-on"
"chipped straight down the ground, over the bowler's head. And he could have nearly been gone there. But it's just Guptill's night. Everything he tries is working in his favour. This was too full and Guptill could not get right on top of it. Lofts it and gets good elevation but not the distance. Du Plessis runs across to his right from long-off and dives but the ball drops short"
"good length on the pads, flicked to long leg"
again short of the fielder at long-off. Tries to pull this short of good length ball but Tahir gets it to spin a good distance outside off and Guptill drags it to long-off. Brilliant fielding by the fielder and the throw is fired to Tahir who collects it but dislodges the bails with his hands as he throws the ball. Guptill was on the line when the bails came off and he would have been gone
"full ball, driven to mid-off who throws it at the striker's end and Guptill is pretty sore and cannot stretch. Does not drag the bat. De Kock collects it but Guptill makes it back"
"googly, Guptill picks it and slogs it powerfully over deep midwicket. Long way into the grassbanks"
"and that is Guptill's 11th six. Pitched up right on the stumps, in the slot for Guptill who gets the front leg out of the way and lofts it straight down the ground"
luck favours Guptill right till the very end. Guptill tries to slog this pitched up ball but he skews it off the leading edge as the ball goes past covers. De Villiers runs back and puts in a dive and again the ball falls in front of him. And they have enough time to come back for the second
