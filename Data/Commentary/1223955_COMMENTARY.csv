"<b>stronger appeal this time</b> but not given. They're not going to review. This looked very close, but perhaps he was struck just outside the line of off. Good flight by Jadeja, and on a nice length, he's coming forward to defend but is beaten on the inside edge and struck on the pad flap"
goes down legside so he'll have to rebowl that
tucked through square
"length outside off, cuts to point"
"<b>just out of reach for a diving Shikhar Dhawan</b>. Tossed up wide of off, and Finch was tempted to slash at it. Dhawan as in the ring at point, the ball was hit over him, runs back and puts in a dive - always difficult to do running back - but the ball just eludes him"
"turn again, but Finch gets forward to defend this outside off"
that one is too wide outside off and it's outside the tram line. Wide.

"given some air outside off, and he defends"
"flatter on leg stump, tries to go down and slog sweep, but misses it. Goes down leg so it's a wide and they take a single too"

targetting the stumps and Finch offers a straight bat back
"length outside off, cuts it to Saini at short third man and excellent running between the two to get that single. Saini fumbles as he's put under pressure to fire back a throw"
"<b>misses the direct hit at the bowler's end</b>. Length ball angling into him, and this was tapped to mid-on. They ran through and Jadeja was the man there, swoops in and lets loose a throw. Misses the stumps - Finch was miles out if he had hit"

"fuller on the stumps, angling into him, flicked backward of square"
"yorker on the stumps, goes back and punches to mid-on"
"yorker outside off, uses wrists to dig this out to midwicket. A bit of a fumble as two fielders converge so they take a quick single"
"and Bumrah lets Warner know that he's not here just to make up numbers. Excellent bouncer, outside off, Warner sways out of the way"
"unlucky for the bowler. Warner was backing away a long way, Bumrah followed him and did so excellently too, but the yorker length ball flicks his pad and goes very fine for four leg-byes"
"short ball again, rising up to Warner's ribs, and he can't time the pull. Drops down near him off the bottom edge"
"fuller, tapped to long-on"
"keeps it on a fuller length on the stumps, Warner goes back and across and taps it back to the bowler's left"
"excellent running again and Warner has raised <b>fifty</b>. He's been almost quietly dominant. I know that's an oxymoron, bur Warner's pulled it off. Plays what has been his favourite shot off Jadeja to get there, the minimal flourish flat pull through square leg"
"fuller, driven to long-on"

"tossed up on the pads, this time he turns it more square to keep it clear of Kohli and gets a single"

"fuller, tailing into the stumps, clipped to mid-on"
"nips back in from a length to hit him on the pads, as he's trying to swat this across, goes off the pad to point. Half an appeal from Shami"
"<b>slammed</b>. That is just disdainful. Shami goes fuller and Warner stays still and just swats it over midwicket's head and into the boundary. Didn't even have a big flourish but timed it so well, he didn't need to"
"length ball tucks him up on the stumps, steered to cover. The fielder lets loose a throw and misses, no one backing up so they get a second"
"<b>huge appeal for a catch by the keeper</b> and not given. Kohli has gone for the review. Yorker length ball, shaping away a touch, his bat hit ground as the ball went past and Rahul had an easy take. And there is a spike as the ball goes past the outside edge with the bat not yet having hit the ground I think. Yes indeed it is, so the umpire will have to change his decision and India have their first wicket."

"keeps giving it air, but better length, dips on him outside off, but Smith stays still and drives calmly through point"
"some turn again, as Chahal pulls his length back, but it's also given Finch room outside off and he slaps this through cover. The man at deep point runs to his right to field it"

a slog sweep across the line forward of square to the gap
"quicker ball pushed through, it comes off the inside edge onto pad"
"<strong>Given LBW!</strong> Smith <strong>reviews</strong>. Jadeja pushed through another quicker flatter ball, it was shorter, Smith went right back trying to work to leg and got hit high on the pad. He thought it was too high. The umpire was convinced it was hitting. No bat involved. Ball tracking says <strong>it's going over the stumps!</strong> Smith survives. That was so close to clipping the bails! Incredible."

"<strong>lofted inside out over wide long off!</strong> What a shot! Tossed up outside off, he moved down and stayed legside to lift it high over the rope"
"<strong>dropped by Chahal at short fine!</strong> Tough chance. It was angled down leg, he flicked it fine, Chahal at full stretch to his left got a hand but it didn't stick. Kohli applauded the runs saved"

"fuller on off, jabs his bat down in time to defend towards point"
"well timed again, full outside off and stroked through cover. The fielder got a hand to it sliding, so that slowed it up enough for the ball to be pulled in before it hits the boundary"
"<b>lovely shot</b>. Starc bowls it on a fuller length, but it's not a length that should be driven so easily. Dhawan's in great form too though and he comes on the front foot to stroke this through cover"

"almost yorker length on the stumps, but Agarwal's moving well and he gets nicely behind it and deep in his crease to dig it out back towards the bowler"
"<b>caught at point</b>. The bowler out-thinks the batsman in that one. Agarwal stepped away again, looking to thrash this over cover, but Hazlewood banged it in short this time and followed the batsman. Agarwal ended up not in the best position and his slash went off the top edge to loop to point, who had to take a couple of steps back for a comfortable catch"

"length on the stumps, defended"

The ball plops to Finch, and the Australians aren't going to drop Kohli twice."
"good shot to start off, punches this length ball through point from close to offstump"
"<b>snorter does him in</b>. Iyer will not want to watch a replay of that. Hazlewood dug this in short and rising sharply towards his head. An ungainly attempt to get out of the way by Iyer, but his bat was hanging in the air like a periscope above his head. The ball balloons off it towards the leg slip area, and Carey settles under it comfortably."
"length ball nipping into him, defended back"

"full angling into him from round the wicket, pushed to point"
"angling into him again to deny him room, punched back towards the bowler"

"length ball on off, punched through cover. There is protection in the deep"

"length ball, goes back and flicks with the turn to backward square leg"
"<b>he's hit a full toss straight to cover</b>. He'll be filthy with himself. Zampa tossed that up more than he intended, and it is a very hittable full toss low on off stump. Rahul crashes it, but picks out the man at cover precisely."

"flatter on the stumps, makes room and punches to cover. they take a single"
""
"length ball, swept to square leg"
"drags it shorter, swatted to deep midwicket"
gives himself room to launch it over cover but misses it completely. Nice flight and drift and spins away from him
"length ball outside off, sliced through point"
"length ball on the pads, flicked to deep square leg"
"tossed up outside off, patted back to the bowler"
"googly, he stays beside it and strokes it to deep point"
"tossed up wide of off, he goes down on one knee and lofts it over cover. Not timed well so doesn't carry to the fielders in the deep"
goes right back and whips this to long-on
"tossed up on leg stump, swept fine. Short fine leg fields to his left"
"googly, tossed up and goes through him as he tries to go over cover. Misses the stumps"
"length ball, stabbed into the legside"
goes for the drive but is beaten all ends up
"flatter on leg stump, flicked to midwicket"
"quicker one outside off, he slashes at it, gets a thick outside edge that short third man can't quite get his hands to"
"<b>nails it over the bowler's head</b>. Went down on one knee and slog-swept this straight back. Tossed up and in the slot, and he got hold of it nicely"
"has another big swing, but this time can't connect. Length ball going across him, he was clearing his leg and looking for cow corner"
"<b>down the track and over the top</b>. Tossed up and he came down and hit this very straight, over long-on"
"sliding across him on a length, cuts it to deep point"
"length ball, spinning away from off, he carves it to deep point"
"<b>this time he picks out wide long-on</b>. Down the track again, didn't get the elevation he had last time, and hits it flatter. Starc moves smartly to his left and pouches the ball, making the catch look easier than it was"
"googly first up, and Shami goes deep in his crease and defends it"
"tossed up outside off, nicely stroked through backward point"
"length on the stumps, goes back and across to cover his stumps and nudge it to midwicket"
"length on leg stump, tries to cart it away over fine leg but gets it on the pad"
<b>boom</b>. Shami won't be kept quiet for long. Comes down the track and has a nice clean swing of his bat to send this way over deep midwicket
"down the track again and he absolutely leathers this, flatter than the last one but more powerful too, bisects long-on and deep midwicket"
"full toss, going for another heave-ho of a hit, but it squirts off the leading edge towards cover"
"flatter and quicker, tried to flat bat it towards midwicket but it takes the top edge and runs very fine - no fielder to stop that one"
"full on off from around the wicket, driven on the up to deep point"
<b>they've gone for a review for caught behind</b>. I think it flicked the pad. length ball goes down leg and Carey collects and belts out an appeal. Starc follows but not as confidently. Finch has gone for the review though Starc seemed to shrug as if to say 'I'm not sure'. Nothing on HotSpot and no spike on Ultra edge either. So it'll stay not out.
"yorker outside off, driven confidently to mid-off. Not timed that well though"
"full outside off, giving himself room to slash it on the offside but can't connect"
"fuller outside off, thick outside edge goes to third man"
"beaten outside off, length ball and he is feeling for it"
"goes for the yorker on middle stump, doesn't quite get it, the batsman clears front leg and swipes across the line to deep midwicket"
"yorker on middle and leg now, he can't get bat on it. Was sliding down leg"
width outside off and he crashes this full ball through cover
"full on the stumps, clipped to mid-on"
"back of a length outside off, steps away and throws his bat at it. The sliced shot lobs up, but doesn't carry to third man"
"low full toss, yorker gone wrong, he heaves it to mid-on"
"length outside off, he's trying to thrash it through off again but gets the toe-end of the bat and it trickles to third man"
"fuller on the stumps, patted to mid-off"
steps away to carve this length ball through point. There's a man in the deep to field
"<b>the Starc yorker</b> on show finally. Too good for Shami, blockhole and off stump knocked back. Not been a happy day for Starc, but he at least has one trademark wicket now"
"yorker outside off, Bumrah keeps it out, getting right behind it and patting to cover"
"back of a length outside off, Bumrah was probably expecting a yorker, and he's late on that, goes past his bat"
"yorker goes through him, misses off stump though, and it's a big win for Australia"
