"his first ball is a low, dipping full toss that snakes around wide of off, Devcich digging it out to point"

"dug in outside off, and Devcich fiddles at it with a cut but can't put bat to ball"
<b>chipped to mid on!</b> Where did this come from? I don't think it was a slower ball - the speedometer read 136km/h - but Devcich flicked across it too early and sent a tame leading edge to Pollard at mid on

"<b>picked up over square leg!</b> The line helped the shot, Sameen slipping this one towards Fakhar's pads. Without a man out, this was nothing more than a freebie"
"whipped into the leg side, but without much in the way of timing and the ball goes nowhere"
"<b>edged, and gone!</b> Sameen corrects his line, and Fakhar's feet are stuck in cement as he thrusts his bat out at the ball outside off. A thin edge is the result, Kamran holding the simplest of catches behind the stumps"

"<b>three in a row!</b> It's a short ball from Wahab, but Haris is in an excellent position to lift it over fine leg. He shuffled across to off and used the pace of the bowler against him"
"<b>leading edge falls safely!</b> Wahab really bent his back on this one, generating pace and lift off the track. Haris fends airily, but the ball falls short of point"
angled down to third man for a single
he comes round the wicket to start and delivers a slower ball which has the beating of Umair outside off
"Umair flashes a cut out through point, but Hasan Ali is in the cover sweeper position and he cuts it off, tumbling at the boundary's edge. Looks like his back is alright, then"
"another slower ball, this one at just 109km/h, and Umair inside-edges it onto his own pads"
"<b>a ramped uppercut finds third man!</b> It was a full pace delivery from Mills, dug in outside off, and Haris just looked to help it on its way. But he couldn't lift it far enough, the substitute fielder Khalid Usman holding an excellent catch, inches from the turf, diving forward in that position. The set-up was virtually identical to the chance that went begging earlier - same bowler, same batsman, same fielder"

"Umair is up on one leg to pull again, but gloves the short to short fine leg"
"<b>beaten on the pull!</b> Short from Wahab, and Wiese can't put bat to this pull as the ball rushes through him"
"<b>bowled by the slower ball!</b> Tymal Mills is a master of these sorts of deliveries, and the one that gets the better of Umair loops perfectly out of the back of his hands. The batsman is too early into his shot, and the stumps are disturbed"
"another slower one, and it's far too good for Afridi, who hasn't a clue as it passes him outside off"
"yet another slower ball from Mills, and Afridi has a poke and misses this one too. Both the batsman and the bowler have a little smile"
"full pace on this low, dipping full toss and Afridi pushes it down the ground to <b>raise the 100</b>"
"<b>nicely placed</b> from Wiese, who pushes the ball to the left of Sammy at cover. Sammy eventually creaks into motion, but he's not moving very well at all in the field and puts in a dive that is merely cosmetic"
"yet another slow one from Mills, and it's nudged off the pad for a single to fine leg"
"speculative appeal for lbw from behind the stumps, but he's got a massive inside edge on it and the ball rolls to leg to allow a single"
"Afridi swings wildly at a 140km/h length delivery outside off, but doesn't get close to hitting it"
"<b>in the air, and safe!</b> What really saved Afridi here is how terrible his connection on an attempted loft over long on was, the ball failing to reach the men on the boundary and falling in no-man's land"
"a back of a length slower ball is fended into the leg side, and they take a single off the body"
"<b>clattering into the stumps!</b> Full and fast from Wahab. Afridi shuts his eyes and has a heave, but the ball zips through him to disturb the timber"

"<b>beaten outside off!</b> Well bowled by Afridi, getting the ball to leave the left-hander off the pitch"

"excellent end to a fine over, Afridi beating Amin's outside edge with another away swinger"
"just short of a good length from Rahat, and the batsman hops to defend"
"slower ball from Rahat, and Kamran is only half forward to tap it softly to cover"
"punched with a little more authority by Kamran, who also manages to thread the gap at cover. Haris Rauf hares after it, and he almost fumbles the stop at the boundary's edge but manages to fling the ball back into play with a move that wouldn't be out of place in Swan Lake"
"Kamran stands tall to cut, but he finds point"
"<b>the stumps are a mess!</b> Game on. Rahat shapes one back in the air to Kamran, who is neither forward nor back and leaves a big gap between his bat and pad"
"an attempted glance to leg off a rising delivery bears no dividend, and it's a dot to end another good over"
"angled down the leg side, and the ball takes a bit of pad/thigh on its way to the fine leg boundary"
"outside off this time, and Amin presses to cover"
"Afridi probes outside off, the ball snaking around mischievously as Amin taps to point"
"<b>spooned to point!</b> Afridi hoops one away outside off, and Amin pushes at it with his hands far away from his body. Wiese scoots around and times his leap at cover point, holding the catch after a little bobble, and Afridi celebrates with the Starman pose made famous by his namesake"
"<b>dragged on!</b> He's on a hat-trick. This is outstanding bowling, and very loose batting. Dawson's first delivery is cross-seamed and wide outside off, and he gets low to drive airily at it only to send an inside edge cannoning into his stumps"
"close! Pollard walks into defensive poke but the ball is very full and curving in sharply through the air. He has to jab his bat down in a hurry, and manages to keep it out"

"<b>big appeal!</b> Pollard shuffles across and misses a flick to leg, but the umpire says no. It was possibly a bit high, and possibly headed down leg as well"
"<b>bowled him!</b> There's swing for Wiese too, and this one shapes back in to Pollard, who pushes at it without much foot movement. The gate is left open, and the ball bursts through it! This is officially a crisis for Zalmi"
