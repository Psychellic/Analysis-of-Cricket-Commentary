starts short. A touch down leg side. 50-50 wide ball. The umpire says it's okay after Dhawan lets it go
short of a length this time. Rising up at his thigh guard and he can't get bat on the attempted glance. Gets a single behind square
"here we go. Can't have a Williamson innings without him getting on his toes, getting the elbow high and punching one between point and cover. That's exactly what he's done to this length ball in the corridor"
"surreal. He threads one through point and cover again, this time off the front foot. No one quite as gorgeous as Williamson on the square drive these days. This is a full ball swinging well away from him but he gets there with a big stride and caresses it"
short of a length and in at middle. Stands tall and nudges it to mid-on with soft hands
<b>misses</b> a full toss. That couldn't have been different from the throwdowns he was taking earlier. Shin height full toss outside off but he can't get any bat on it whatsoever as he looks to drive
"length ball wide outside off, goes on the up and can't get on top of the bounce. Ends up slicing on the up to sweeper"
oh dear. Kishan misses a straightforward take. Mitch attempts a yorker that goes down leg side. Kishan makes the ground but can't hold on
one bounce and four. Third man would've taken that but there isn't one. It's a length ball wide outside off. He slashes on the up and deliberately opens the face
<b>Dhawan gets one on the knee cap.</b> Can't catch a break! Length ball slanting in from outside off. Gets on the front foot and looks to drive and gets an inside edge that misses the flap on the lunged back knee. Treatment time...ice treatment. Followed by some mobility exercises.
"<b>bowled him!</b> Same ball, same shot, inside edge again. Dhawan driving with a gap between bat and pad again. This time the stride is even shorter, possibly because of the bump he got last ball. It hits that back leg again, but this time on the thigh, before taking out the stumps"
<b>beaten</b> on the outside edge. Saha gets one slanted across his corridor and he jabs at it on the front foot
"<b>got him!</b> Saha chases again and isn't as lucky as before! McClenaghan, not a public favourite in Mumbai these days, has brought two wickets in his first over. Another length ball pushed across him and this time he's looking to drive away from the body. A thin edge and Kishan holds on"
"full and in at off stump. Driven firmly, straight to mid-off"
good length and just outside off. Allows it to come on and steers it to third man with an open face
"shot. Back of a length with width from Bumrah and he eases into this, without any feet movement. Just opens the face and steers it through point"
"length outside off, driven on the up to sweeper point"
good length on off stump. Allows it to come on again and drops it into the point region with soft hands
"short of a length outside off, drives on the up to deep point"
"short of a length and cutting away outside off, left alone"
sweeet. Pandey stands tall and slaps one over the non-striker. Length ball wide outside off but he shuffles and closes the face as he lifts this on the up
"offcutter, back of a length and just outside off. Gets on top of the bounce and dabs it straight to short third man"
length and slanted across off. Shuffles to try and tickle one behind square. Can't get it off the pitch
"nicely timed, but Krunal keeps it to one. Uses the angle across him to open the face and chop this behind point. Krunal gets his full body behind it with a slide at deep backward point"
"he's come out with a plan. Pandey walks down the track a touch, uses the shuffle across again and gets close to this length ball pushed wide. Thumps it on the up over mid-off"
<b>inside edge</b> zips past short fine. Pandya starts in a nice area - length on off stump. Williamson brings an angled bat down on it as he pushes on the front foot. Tentative. Effective.
"short of a length and down leg side, left alone"
length and just outside off. Drops it into the off side with soft hands
<b>beaten.</b> A jab with an open face. Length ball outside off with some climb. He can't get bat as he tries to find the third man boundary
"<b>straight to extra cover!</b> Pandey's daredevilry comes to a close. An aesthetically pleasing innings ends in a tame, throwaway manner. Length ball wide outside off. He gives it the charge and can't get elevation on the drive to clear the fielder"
length on off stump. Defended back to the bowler
"short of a length outside off. Punches neatly to cover point's left but Krunal dives one-handed to get in the way of at least another run, if not three more"
short ball coming in at the corridor. Chops it straight to point
length ball angled in at off stump. Closes the face and drags it to mid-on's left off the front foot
<b>mix-up</b> and Shakib will be shown the way eventually. Got none of that from his partner. It's an offcutter that Williamson taps in front of short midwicket with soft hands. Takes the instinctive two steps forward but without a call. No call from Shakib either - they're both looking at the ball. There's no run there. Shakib is halfway down. Midwicket swivels and takes the non-striker's stumps down on the bounce....ah hang on. We've looked at the replays and it sounds like <b>Williamson said yes first and then no.</b>
"length on off stump, goes deep in the crease and nudges it through point off the outside half"
<b>falls short of mid-off.</b> Length ball outside off and Pathan pummels it on the up towards mid-off. It dips on him and he might have dived if it weren't for Pathan's power behind it
"Kishan's horror day behind the stumps continues. Predictably, Pathan gets a bouncer. It's well directed and has him ducking, but Kishan parries it over"
"<b>beaten on the outside edge.</b> Length ball banged into the corridor, moving away off the seam. Williamson looks to run it to third man but can't connect"
"short of a length outside off. He gets his weight on the back foot and slices between point and gully. Third man sprints to his right and manages to get a hand on it with a slide, but that was travelling too fast"
short of a length and in at off stump. Defended to point off the back foot
good length and just outside off. Tapped back to the bowler off the front foot
"slower ball, short of a length outside off. Pulls to deep square"
slower ball at a yorker length. Pathan clears his leg and jams it out towards short extra cover
"<b>hammered.</b> Superb pull shot from Williamson - technical perfection. Mustafiz drops it short of a length at his hips and he swivels, gets the bat parallel to the ground, watches the ball come on and keeps it down to beat deep square to his right"
"short of a length just outside off, defended to point off the back foot"
another perfect pull. This one a little higher - lifting up at his face - but he manages to keep it down. McClenaghan dives early this time -  a bit too early. Ends up pushing it away from his face as he's on the floor
"slower ball, back of a length and just outside off. Defended into the covers off the back foot"
slower ball at a length on leg stump. Gets deep in the crease and dabs it behind square with soft hands
"short of a length outside off, stabbed through cover off the back foot"
"inside edge? Yes. Williamson is walking. And Sunrisers sink further. There';s some seam movement for Hardik, a length delivery seams back in after pitching. Williamson plays close to his body, but the ball still moves back in enough to take the inside edge. An easy take for the keeper."
"a full delivery outside off, 139 kph, a thick inside edge through wide mid-on for a run."
"a length delivery outside off, 135 kph. Dabbed away down to third man for a run."
"ooh yeah, that's glorious. Regal some may say. An overpitched half volley outside off and Williamson leans into a delectable drive through cover, gets four."
"back of a length outside off, Nabi opens the bat face and guides that down to third man"
"strays down leg this time, another extra delivery"
"132 kph, sticks with the shorter length. A decent bouncer. Pathan gets underneath that."
"a short delivery outside off, Nabi rocks back and pulls the ball into the gap at midwicket. Too short, too slow. An easy put-away."
"flatter, on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
the googly. But he drifts down leg. Yusuf stays low and just paddles his fine sweep to the fine leg boundary. Well played.
"flat on middle and leg, 80 kph, nudged to deep midwicket again. The runs have come this over."
"flat outside off, 84 kph, pushed to the sweeper cover for one with the spin"
"a big appeal, pad first, think Mumbai. But it's a legbreak that may have struck Yusuf outside the line. With the spin, that's missing off stump too. But <strong>Mumbai want to review</strong>. It is pad first, but that needed to be a googly. Yusuf got forward and looked to defend, the ball struck him outside the line and the spin is also taking that away from the stumps, says HawkEye."
"a slower delivery outside off, drilled down to long-off for one."
"a dart, 95 kph, on the pads. Yusuf closes his bat face too early, a thick leading edge lobs over midwicket, one to long-on"
"another leading edge. Slow on middle and leg, gets some turn too. Off the top edge towards midwicket"
"flat and straight, a thick inside edge towards midwicket"
"nice, more slowness and extracts some turn. Outside off, Yusuf gets forward and blocks"
"quick and straight, defended back. Yusuf now 8 off 13."
"the googly goes through Nabi's wild heave. It pitched outside off, and turned back in. Nabi clears a front leg and swings, looking to clear midwicket, an indicator he read the variation. But the ball finds a massive gap between bat and pad to hit the stumps. Sunrisers now struggling."
"the legbreak this time. Flat outside off, there is some zip and some turn as the ball beats the bat"
"out comes the sweep, a cross-batted shot is always an indicator the batsman isn't sure. The legbreak outside off, Rashid misses the sweep."
"nicely bowled, slower around off, tapped away towards backward point"
"the sweep, the googly outside off. Rashid gets some bat on his sweep, one to deep square leg."
"slightly shorter and wider, cut away to backward point for a run."
"starts with a leg side delivery that drifts down leg, wide called."
"strays down leg, swept away towards short fine leg"
"strays down leg again, swept away behind square. Another misfield from Mustafizur."
"nicely bowled, flat and straight, pushed away to long-off, one more."
"that's short and wide, right where Yusuf was waiting for that. Waits and waits and then laces a cut behind point for four."
"flat and straight, nudged to short fine leg for one."
"flat and quick, on leg, inside-edged away behind square for a run."
"a good length delivery outside off, a thick outside edge flies down to third man for one"
"a slower delivery outside off, Yusuf taps a length delivery to backward point. There is no run there. Lewis runs in, picks up but misses at the batsman's end."
"outside edge and gone! Good captaincy from Rohit. That's exactly how Rashid was caught in the reverse fixture earlier this season. Back of a length delivery outside off, Rashid plays slightly inside the line, a thick edge is elicited and comfortably taken."
a short delivery outside off is ramped over the infield for one to third man
"back of a length outside off, chopped down to third man for one."
a full delivery outside off is guided away to backward point.
"a length offcutter outside off, punched to the sweeper cover for one."
"back of a length outside off, an offcutter, chopped down to third man for one."
"124 kph, short and wide outside off, slashed away to deep point for one."
nicely guided with the angle but he picks out backward point. A short cutter from Mustafizur.
"a big shot but he somehow finds a gap behind point. Another cutter outside off, Thampi looks for a big hit, but the ball skews off the outside half and over the infield."
"beaten on the outside edge. Yet another offcutter, it grips and moves to beat the bat."
"gone through Thampi and Markande strikes! It's a flatter delivery, quick through the air and short. Yet, Thampi misreads the length, goes back and looks to cut, he fails to connect, but the ball hits off stump."
"slow down leg, worked into the leg side."
"it's another googly, drifts down leg, nudged away to fine leg for a couple."
"yet another googly, shortish and wide, carved to backward point. Played off the back foot."
"the legbreak outside off, played to backward point with the angle and a slightly-open face."
"excellently bowled, very slow through the air outside off, loads of flight. The ball leaves Sid Kaul on the outside edge."
"a full delivery outside off, slashed to deep point for a run"
"a full offcutter outside off, eliciting a drive but not an edge as the ball flies past the outside edge."
another one! Yet another offcutter and the ball beats the bat.
"a hat-trick of slower balls that beat Kaul's outside edge. Full and moving away, beats a drive rather easily."
"run-out! Terrible from Sunrisers. They've had a shocking evening. A slower ball outside off, Kaul finally gets bat on it. Slices a drive to point. Hardik Pandya misfields, which makes Kaul think there is a single. Pathan comes running down, sees Pandya's throw is coming and returns back to his crease, allowing Kaul to sacrifice himself. The ball pops out of Kishan's gloves, just as he made contact with the stumps"
"a full delivery on off, nicely blocked back."
a shorter and wide slower delivery is slashed to the sweeper cover. Yusuf declines the run.
"full and quick, around off, 142 kph, guided to point"
"a shortish delivery around off, pulled down to long-on. Still no run. Sunrisers going nowhere."
"smashed down to long-off. A slower ball is hammered back past the bowler. Bumrah sticks out his right hand, but the ball flies past. Pollard throws to the batsman's end, but he's fine"
"141 kph, a low full toss outside off, sliced to short third man. Markande goes flying to his left and stops the ball, to the awe of the crowd."
"a good length delivery outside off, guided away to backward point for a quick run"
"an offcutter outside off, Yusuf tries to sweep the ball but he isn't close to the ball. He's now 23 off 30."
"a low full toss outside off, smashed to deep cover. No run again. He just can't hit a boundary."
"he finally gets one away! A smile on Williamson's face. Another cutter, right in the slot, around off. Yusuf clears his front leg and smashes the length over long-on. A boundary after 35 balls, first six of the innings."
"smashed to deep midwicket! Picks out the fielder. A short delivery on off, swatted away to Hardik, who keeps his eyes on it and takes a good reverse-cupped catch. <b>It's Sunrisers' second-lowest IPL <a href='http://stats.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/records/team/lowest_innings_totals.html?class=6;id=5143;type=team' target='_blank'>total ever</a></b>."
inswinger on a good length. But it starts on middle and slides down
inswinger rises from a good length at off stump. He fends it away as he trues to defend
"good length, swung in at middle stump. Gets behind the line and defends from the crease"
"some late swing in again. Plonks the front leg across and whips it to deep square. Risky shot, had to get bat on it"
"<b>falls short of cover.</b> Lewis gets in a weird position there. Almost like it's the first time he's encountering a swinging ball. This goes away outside off and he hangs his bat out at it, no control at all"
<b>beaten</b> by the awayswinger. Lewis looks to defend from the crease and it nowhere near this
"<b>struck on the pad</b> as he gets squared up. This looks very good actually, but no one interested. Did that pitch outside? He was looking to defend on the leg stump line and was completely lost as it hooped away"
"...and he slants it across him, good length. Suryakumar doesn't have to do much. Stays tall in the crease and punches through cover"
"short of a length at leg stump, climbs on him as he dabs this uppishly into the leg side"
length ball fired in at the pads. Taps it wide of mid-on
"short of a length just outside off, punched to mid-off off the back foot"
"good length on middle stump, defended on the front foot"
"short of a length on middle stump, punched off the back foot, straight to mid-on"
"short of a length outside off, more confidence than he's shown all innings on this occasion. Gets nicely behind and drills this through cover off the back foot"
"good length outswinger, draws him forward - only half a stride complete - and forces him to feel for it. Beaten on the outside edge"
<b>beats the outside edge</b> and gets him on the back leg. Squares him up once again. This is not easy living for Lewis. Looking to tap that through midwicket and he's struck outside off on the back thigh
"full awayswinger in the corridor, defended to point off the outside half"
"<b>leading edge lobs up for point.</b> This seems to be the worst delivery of the over on first glance. Full ball outside leg stump, not a lot of swing on it. Surely going wide if he doesn't attempt a shot, surely there for a tickle if he stays in the crease. But Lewis decides to walk down the pitch to cut out all the swing he's been seeing. Reaches out for it outside leg and is through the shot early. Easy take for Pandey"
good length outswinger in the channel. Blocked solidly on the front foot
"short of a length on middle stump, punched to mid-off off the back foot"
short of a length on middle stump. He shapes to punch through cover but has to adjust for the turn. Gets it to mid-on at the last moment
"<b>through mid-off.</b> Makes room this time and pummels this short of a length ball past the non-striker. Thampi is very late on his slide to the right and despite making his ground, allows this to pass"
"length on leg stump, nudged to deep square off the front foot"
"tossed up at off stump, defended into the covers off the front foot"
"<b>taken at long-off!</b> Oh boy, is there a match here? Mumbai are trying hard to make one! Poor shot from Kishan. This is floated up at off stump, and he gets down the track. Beaten in flight and he ends up chipping and easy one for the fielder there as he tries to go inside-out"
short of a length and shaping into the corridor. Drags it to midwicket's right with a closed face
"good length just outside off, defended to point from the crease"
"length outside off, leans into a drive but can't beat mid-off to his left"
"full at middle stump, defended into the leg side"
"shot. But intercepted by a couple of the cover fielder's fingers. It's a flowy back foot punch, chasing one outside off. Right off the middle but point chases it down and keeps it to two"
"full on middle stump, pushed to mid-on off the front foot"
floated up at middle stump and drilled off the front foot. Thampi tumbles to his left at mid-on to stop
"<b>it's worked!</b> Shakib lobs one up for Rohit and gets him to try and drive through cover. No feet whatsoever. It pitches and spins away, a hint of climb, and he's nowhere near the pitch of this. Easy one for Dhawan at slip"
"floated up at middle stump, leans in and flicks to deep midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, defended off the back foot"
<b>arm ball</b> nearly sneaks past the inside edge. Suryakumar solid on the front foot though as he defends this
"<b>another arm ball</b> that is just kept out. Sliding in at off stump and he just manages to block it, from very deep in the crease"
"short of a length in the corridor, gets on top of the bounce and steers it to third man"
"short of a length just outside off, whips to deep square off the back foot"
"length outside off, uses the angle to jab towards third man"
full and a hint of late swing away. But he's behind this as he drives to mid-on
"well played, but Williamson gets across quickly at mid-off to keep it to a single. It's a length ball and he drives handsomely on the up"
"good length outside off, looks to drive on the up but is beaten. Bat was well inside the line of that one"
"floated up at leg stump, drives towards long-on but can't get past midwicket"
"short of a length outside off, gets on the back foot and punches to sweeper cover"
"length on leg stump, nudged into the open midwicket region off the front foot"
"nice. Very very nice. Hangs deep in the crease, anticipates the angle across him from around the wicket and waits before running this past short third man off the face"
<b>shot!</b> He's bringing out the class now. Makes room this time. He's greeted with a slider and he has plenty of pace as he shifts the weight back and punches it to the extra cover boundary
so he whips one through midwicket. Nabi goes around the wicket and slants one across again but Suryakumar leans in and gets this between long-on and deep midwicket. Bit of a fumble out there as the two fielders converge
"<b>glorious!</b> Krunal with the shot of the evening. I said it might look different when Kaul bowls. Length ball skids on nicely outside off, no movement. He leans in, full balance and crunches a drive past mid-off"
well bowled. Bangs it into the corridor at a length and gets it to jag away. Krunal hangs the bat out and is beaten
"length on off stump, punched to mid-on on the up"
<b>who needs swing?</b> Kaul consigns Krunal to his backside. A sharp bouncer as he shuffles back and across. It's climbing up at his helmet and he quickly gets under it and can't hold his balance
oh yes. What a contest this is. Krunal with the rebuttal...so to speak. This is short of a length across the corridor and he gets on the back foot to swat this wide of mid-on
"the batsman wins this battle. Kaul offers a full toss on off stump, Krunal probably smirks internally as he bludgeons this straight down the ground"
"length ball pushed through just outside off, defended solidly on the front foot"
"<b>googly not picked.</b> Suryakumar scythes at this length ball outside off, expecting it to turn away. Ends up chopping it past leg stump and straight to short fine"
<b>beaten.</b> Another googly. This one spinning into the corridor from back of a length. He goes for the late cut - even though a slip is there - and misses
googly. Tossed up outside off on a length. Defended off the under-edge
quicker one dropped very short. Gets away. Suryakumar hurried on the pull and can't get power to beat deep midwicket to his right
"googly, back of a length outside off. Punched to long-on off the back foot"
"floated full on leg stump, leans in and flicks to deep midwicket"
"<b>misses the arm ball</b> and is struck on the back thigh as he looks to pull. Was very deep in the crease at the point of contact, but this was going down"
"tossed up on middle stump, flicked to long-on's right"
<B>beaten in flight</b> more by himself than the bowler. Steps out way too early and just manages to stab this length ball away outside off
"good length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
length ball pushed flat outside off. Flicked to long-on
juicy full toss on the pads. Punches it straight to deep midwicket
<b>dropped.</b> Rashid's movement in his follow through has completely blinded him it seems. Length ball driven back at him and his hands are barely in place as it fizzes past him and goes to long-off
"poor ball. Googly, short and wide outside off. Chopped away to the backward point boundary. Too easy"
"good length on off stump, defended on the front foot"
"<b>review.</b> Lbw review. This back of a length ball rips into Krunal and beats him on the back foot punch. Hit him on the back leg. It's given not out. He's on the back foot, very deep in the crease...it looks very out right now as we wait for the tracker. There's no edge on it....<b>it's out!</b> Decision will be overtuned. S Ravi gets a fairly straightforward one wrong. Krunal is gone, that's hitting middle and off."
<b>Pandey leaps to his right at long-on</b> after completely misjudging this. Pollard splices this off the inside half of the bat as he looks to slog the full one on leg stump
"good length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
"<b>see ya!</b> Pollard's brief evident. Shakib goes loopy, he goes full, he goes leg stump. Pollard goes smash to send it over long-on"
"arm ball. Pushed through flat and Pollard has no clue about this. Looking to punch through cover, gets an inside edge to fine leg"
"full on leg stump, clips to deep midwicket from the crease"
"length on leg stump, gets on the back foot and tickles it to long leg"
"nicely played but some quality fielding out at long-on. Full ball on leg stump is drilled between long-on and deep midwicket. A slide to the right from long-on and a quick pick up and throw from deep midwicket, both of whom had to be inch perfect to avoid a collision"
"<b>guides it to slip!</b> Second batsman tonight to attempt a late cut with a slip in place. First to make connection. He's gone. Got to question that shot. It was a short slider outside off and he can't get it wide of Dhawan. That was travelling quickly, he did well to keep his balance"
length ball outside off. Zips off the surface as Pandya leaves. Saha does well to hold on
"ah, poor. Drops it very very short. Hardik taps to sweeper cover"
"full outside off. Goes too hard on the cover drive, gets it out to long-on off the inside half of the bat"
"googly just outside off, defended on the front foot"
<b>bounces past off stump!</b> Rashid rips a googly in and Hardik is caught on the move as he looks to make room for a punch through cover. He can't do it. Under-edges int the turf and <i>just</i> survives
"full on middle stump, sweetly timed drive to long-on"
"length on leg stump, leans in and flicks straight to short midwicket"
"length on off stump, defended from the crease"
<b>run out chance missed.</b> Shakib fails to pick up the ball at extra cover after running in. The batsmen are only just crossing over halfway down the pitch. Hardik dropped this pitch side with soft hands
"<b>picks out deep square!</b> This is disastrous for Mumbai! It was an incredible shot -  a short arm whip off his hips at this length ball on leg stump. But he's launched it straight to the fielder there! Oh dear, this is getting tense...Suryakumar has done superbly to keep reaasuring Mumbai so far. Now he's gone."
length ball just outside off. Tempts him to have a poke. He leaves it alone
short and in the corridor. Gets behind and dabs it to third man's left
<b>he's given him!</b> Mitch falls over as he tries to flick and is trapped right in front. Consults and reviews. Has that pitched outside leg? Looks like it's pitched in line...<b>yes it has!</b> Dead. Right in front of middle. Mumbai are folding quickly now! <b>They have lost their review.</b>
"length ball just outside off, steered to third man from the crease"
"length just outside off, a tentative push to extra cover from the crease"
length on leg stump. Looks to flick but cops it on the thigh guard. Steals a single pitch side on the leg side
<b>plumb!</b> Markande is gone! Kaul has put the fear truly into Wankhede now! It's a full ball on middle. Markande plants the front leg across and tries to flick behind square. He's not good enough to do that. There is no doubt in this one
length ball outside off. Leans in to a drive to long-off. <b>Refuses the run</b>
"length ball outside off, stabs at it outside off and is <b>beaten.</b> Revs. Such revs."
googly. Length ball outside off. Blocked solidly on the front foot
"length on leg stump, flicked straight to short fine. Refuses the run again"
"length ball at off stump, pushes it to point off the front foot"
<b>maiden.</b> Hardik fails to get off strike. It's a length ball outside off. Looks like he wanted to tickle this through square leg but it spins away.
<b>Dhawan flies to his right and can't hold on!</b> Oh what a catch that would have been! Kaul gets it to rise in the corridor and Bumrah fends at it with hard hands. It is sailing high and very wide of Dhawan at wide slip. He does superbly to even reach it. But can only parry it to third man
"<b>looks to swat it away</b> but he's beaten by pace. You won't spot any faces at Wankhede, they are all covered with nervous palms. Short of a length 'heavy ball' outside off shoots past the attempted slog"
"<b>misses again!</b> Looks to go leg side again. Short of a length ball outside off and it's too quick again. There are gaps over extra cover and mid-off, but he's aiming midwicket right now"
"<b>aims midwicket again and that's curtains!</b> Hardik Pandya has sliced one to third man! Same line and length three balls in a row, same shot offered with no result. You've got to question that strategy. But it's also superb bowling from Kaul. He has now picked up three wickets in under two overs. 3 off 19 balls for Pandya. This will be tough to get over. Mumbai on the verge of a stunning defeat."
"<b>oh there's life here still.</b> Just about. Short of a length ball in at the hips. Bumrah swings cleanly and connects to drag this to fine leg's left. The slide won't help, it's four"
<b>inside edge</b> it appears. Length ball outside off. Gets on his back knee and looks to drive but this ends up with the keeper
length ball in the corridor. He backs away to try and lift it over extra cover. Beaten
<b>chipped</b> wide of midwicket as he looks to pull. Length ball is too quick as it angles into him
short of a length ball in the corridor. Swipes from under it and can't connect
bunts one over the non-striker as he backs away to slog. Thampi just too quick off the surface for these two
"<b>is that it?</b> Yes it is! Deepak Hooda not in the XI today, but he has the opportunity to be on the field for a very, very famous moment. Gets under it at midwicket and completes a catch. Mustafiz looks to pull and gets it off the high part of the bat. A slice - no danger. Mumbai's innings was no danger, to be fair. A feeble end but a fitting one"
