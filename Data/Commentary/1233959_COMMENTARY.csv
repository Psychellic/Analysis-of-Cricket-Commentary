"<b>skids on</b> and strikes him on the pad. Rizwan, backing away to access the off side, is badly cramped and takes it on the thigh."
"<b>so close to being bowled</b>! Again, it's Santner targeting the stumps, sliding the ball through with the arm with the seam bolt upright. So clearly he doesn't want it to spin, but maybe swing a bit. Rizwan is out with another make-room cut shot and gets an inside edge for four to fine leg"
"touch slower through the air, and short enough for Rizwan to rock back and pull to deep midwicket"
"rapid delivery targeting the top of off stump, Rizwan is ready for it this time, as he cuts into the covers, with a straighter bat"
"<b>hint of turn</b> on the full ball which Rizwan adjusts to very well, opening the face of the bat and blocking it towards point"
carts a short ball on middle and leg away to deep square leg
"<b>flies to his left, looking to grab a one-handed stunner</b> but it just evades him! A firmly struck drive from Rizwan beats the bowler's athletic effort and goes to mid-off"
cuts the back of a length ball outside off behind point
"<b>beats the edge</b>. This is what Duffy is known for. Hitting the deck and getting movement. Eden Park is normally bouncy so it looks really good, flying past Shafiq and through to the keeper"
"<b>taken at mid-on! Duffy strikes in his first over!</b>. Comes off the pitch just a little slower than he expects, but just the tiniest bit of extra bounce! And as a result, the flick shot, that he means to hit more or less along the ground through midwicket, pops up in the air much much straighter. Great start for the rookie!"
defends a fuller delivery on off stump
cracks it over third man! That's how you gotta play here. Short boundaries. Throw the bat at it. Rizwan gets a thick edge to a wide ball and it carries to the fence
"<b>just over point</b>! Pakistan living very very dangerously. And it's extra bounce again! Haider Ali is not ready for the back of a length ball rearing at him. Takes the shoulder of his bat as he tries to defend, all squared up, and it flies to Phillips, who leaps up, sticks his left hand out and behind him, but the ball lands beyond his reach"
hits the deck and gets it to climb up towards Rizwan's chest. He knocks it down by his feet
"<b>when it's full, it comes onto the bat a little slower. when it's short, it seems to hurry them</b>. This one's full and Rizwan, trying to drive through the line, sees his bat turn in his hand and the mis-hit to mid-off gets only one. He was looking to access the gap at extra cover"
<b>flies through</b> as he hits the deck again. Haider is a shot-maker. He sees one he can get under and goes for the slog. Misses
"<b>beats him</b> with a gorgeous ball, back of a length on off stump, and straightening past the outside edge. This is tough stuff out there."
"<b>launches it over midwicket</b>. Haider's shots are usually jaw dropping. This one isn't quite as well timed, but the ferocious intent behind it, is something to see. Bowl length to him at your peril!"
"pushes outside off stump, but the fuller ball decks past his reach. Duffy draws seam movement away from the bat again"
<b>lovely shot!</b> All he has to do is give it direction. And he does. A full ball on leg stump is lifted to the fine leg boundary with a touch of class!
blocks a good length ball on middle
"<b>dropped</b> by the bowler! It's a tough chance, demanding that he go the wrong way to his follow through and dive to his right. Again, the ball seems to hold up just a bit when it's pitched up and Rizwan, looking to drive down the ground and on the up, is nearly done."
"<b>taken by one of two short covers</b>! Oh this is great bowling. This is a sign of a domestic player in top form. Duffy captains Otago. He's been around for years and years. And the moment he sees a batsman charging at him, he drags his line wide, hiding the ball from his reach. Rizwan still tries to reach for the ball and only toe-ends it to the straighter fielder Phillips"
<b>taken at mid-on</b>! Eish! He's skittish against the bounce. But he goes for the pull nonetheless. The fact that he hasn't put everything into the shot is apparent in how the ball floats down the ground. Terrible mis-hit. Comes off almost the splice of the bat. And is easily taken by a backtracking Chapman
"<b>Extra bounce! Extra bounce!</b>They can't handle the extra bounce! Haider is looking to whip a back of a length ball through the leg side. But in addition to the ball coming up at a height he doesn't expect, it also doesn't come on to his bat. All of that means he gets a leading edge which the bowler himself runs up and takes. Spectacular spell of bowling by New Zealand. They really are very good at understanding conditions and exploiting them at double quick time."
"back of a length and outside off, pushes into the covers"
"full and outside off, Shah tries to smear it through the covers, but a hint of inswing gets his inside edge"
"full and outside off, eases it to mid-off"
"<b>lovely batting</b>! Shah waits for the ball, he waits for it to get as high up as it would, then he hits it on top of that bounce and cuts it away to the boundary"
defends a back of a length ball into the midwicket region to keep the strike. That is the best bit of cricket Pakistan have played so far.
"full, straight and swinging into the stumps. And once again, Shah shows excellent balance at the crease, waiting for the ball to get under his eyes and flicking it off the middle of the bat through midwicket."
shortish and outside off and once again he looks unhurried. Calmly glides it to cover
"looks for the drive on the up, places it to the left of mid-off and sprints through for a single"
back of a length delivery slips down leg side
"full on middle, Shadab pushes down the pitch"
"<b>gets it to straighten</b> and Shadab is wary of the threat, making sure he steps forward to it and blocks with a very straight, very firm defensive bat"
"looks to nudge the back of a length ball through midwicket, but again it doesn't come onto the bat as well as he expects and Shadab's groan of disappointment tells it all as he watches the ball pop back down the pitch"
it's short. it's a googly. he rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket
"<b>inside edge</b> as Shadab is drawn into playing an expansive drive through the off side, but the tossed up legbreak drifts in just enough and dips on him to secure the mis-hit"
defends a flighted delivery on off stump
stands up tall against a googly outside off and pushes into the covers
<b>slides under the bat this time</b> as Sodhi keeps going googlies against the left-hander. Shah goes to cut and misses
"waits nicely on the quicker, shorter ball on off stump and dabs it through point"
"<b>starts with a bouncer</b> from around the wicket. Shah looks to hook it, but it's past him, around head high."
"full and outside off, he hits to mid-off"
"goes round-arm and as a result the ball strays onto the pads, Shah loves that, flicking it away to the fine leg boundary"
<b>carves it to the sweeper</b>! It's full. It's wide. It's inviting and Shah laces it to the Phillips. He's been hitting the middle right from ball one. This game might rest on his shoulders now
dabs a shortish delivery outside off to third man
drives smoothly down the ground and long-on running to his right picks it up
"rocks back and cuts the googly, but he hits it straight to cover. Either side of him, and it would have been four"
"<b>taken at point</b>! Oh, the best of them is gone now. And once again, it's the result of an ill-advised shot. The square boundaries at Eden Park are big (enough). That's why Sodhi keeps bowling short and spinning the ball away from the left-hander. Here he ventures a little fuller, specifically to draw the false shot. And he does. A slog sweep to a ball outside off stump. Shah can't drag it and only gets an edge that goes straight up and comes down to settle safely in Guptill's hands"
pulls to long-on
nudges a good length ball on middle through square leg
doesn't quite pick the googly and gets an inside edge to a good length ball that is looking to topple his off stump
whips a shortish legbreak from outside off to long-on
"back of a length on middle, defends"
works a fuller ball on off stump through midwicket
"looks to glance a back of a length ball to fine leg, but again, with it not coming onto to the bat, he pops it up to where square leg might have been standing"
punches a shortish delivery outside off to point
"<b>ooooh myyy gawwwddd!! Jaaaaccooooobb Duffeeeeeeeyyyyy</b> This could have been one THE greatest boundary catches I have EVER seen! Shades of Daniel Vettori in the 2015 World Cup. This could have been even better. He's at deep third man. He's watching an upper cut that is going for six for all money. Shadab has nailed it. But Duffy is not giving up on it. He leaps up, sticks up his right hand, the ball sticks in it, he comes down, slides towards the boundary, and as he does so, the tip of his finger in his left hand brushes against the advertising triangles and robs the world of one of the most amazing catches ever."
"looks for another upper cut, but this time Shadab is beaten for pace and bounce"
gets a single to the onside
defended
"darted through, flicked to the onside. They think about a run but the field is too tight"
he's really zipping that through with little flight. Shadab uses his feet to squeeze a single through the offside
driven straight back to the bowler
"flicked to cow corner, that over can't have taken more than a minute, surely. Pressure piling on Pakistan"
"that's the googly, and IMad fell for it hook line and sinker! Slogged, gets a thick edge down to deep extra, and Glenn Phillips puts down what was really a straightforward catch. Pakistan riding their luck a little bit"
worked down to long-on and Imad gets himself off strike
"that was wide and tossed up, and Shadab won't miss out on that. <strong>Tonks this back over his head</strong> for six"
"fuller, less flight, and paddled down to fine leg for a single"
"Imad tees off now, but he doesn't quite time it as well. Runs along to wide long-on for one"
"that's not the best delivery, and Shadab cashes in! Zipped through on his pads, sat up nicely and he helps it above the man in the circle at fine leg for four. Finally a big over for Pakistan; they need many, many more of those"
opens the face and runs down to the man at 45
nearly a mix-up. Hit to mid-on and Santner runs around the non-striker to cut off the single option. Shadab had to scamper to get back in time
"slightly wider, cut away and the pair exchange ends"
"loose delivery, there to be hit. Darted in and got a half-volley, which he dispatches adeptly through extra for a boundary"
""
"gave that one more air, and Shadab was a little uncertain about his footwork. Strong finish to the over"
Imad greets him with a brilliantly worked cut shot behind backward point. Decent shot to squeeze that between both the ring and boundary fielder. Wasn't all that much width on offer there either
"full and straight, and Imad drives down to long-off for one"
"angling into him, cramped Shadab up for room. Fends it off and gets Imad back on strike"
"<strong>and that's broken the partnership!</strong> You can see what he's trying to do but that's still a soft, soft way to end the innings. Short and wide, and Imad tried to help it above the third man fielder for six. Instead gives him the easiest catch he might have wished for"
greets him with a 138kph short delivery that he got nowhere near. Tried to pull it away but wasn't in the same post code
"well, that was sweetly timed! Waited for the overpitched delivery and elegantly lofts it over the cover fielders and watches it race away. Confident-looking shot and spoils the over for NZ somewhat"
"might be the worst delivery of the innings that. Dragged it down, and Shadab had time to put the kettle on before setting up and <strong>clobbering it over square leg for a big six</strong>"
gets on the back foot and slashes it away to sweeper cover
"wrong'un, driven down to long-off"
"nicely cut away, beats the point fielder and has time to come back for two"
"<strong>another long hop, Shadab is playing a blinder for Pakistan here</strong>. Sat up to allow Shadab to whack him back over his head for a huge six!"
"straight to the fielder, but even so, 16 off the over. Pakistan will be looking to finish strongly now"
"cramps him for room from around the wicket, driven back to him"
"<strong>mix-up, and that should have been a run-out</strong>. Sliced down to Ish Sodhi at extra cover who collected and got it back to Santner with Shadab well stranded. Santner couldn't quite hold on and Shadab escapes again"
"fill and claps him on the pads. New Zealand appeal, and even review, though it's clear to every man and his dog, surely, that that pitched outside leg. And the review confirms it"
"darted into Faheem, gets an inside edge. Tight over so far"
"claps him on the pads again, Faheem can't quite work him out"
"and gets a single to prevent the maiden, but what an over that's been from Santner. Made up for Sodhi's sloppiness in the previous one"
"Tickner begins with a wide down legside. Good pace though, touching 140, and Faheem hasn't really got going yet"
"good batting, drops it dead and gets Shadab back on strike"
squired away down to third man and they come back for a couple. Shadab's batting intelligently but he'll continue to need support from the other end
"just short of a length, played on the up over cover and down to the sweeper"
"bit sloppy from Tickner, Faheem was looking to help it over fine leg"
"leg stump line, and all Faheem can do is get a legbye and get Shadab back on for the last couple of deliveries"
"slower ball, Shadab lets out a grunt of frustration as he fails to middle. The slash to cover only fetches him one"
"well that's put a cheery tune on the over for Pakistan. Short and sat up for Faheem Ashraf, right in his arc. That's perhaps the shot he plays best, as he gets in line and <b>lofts it over square leg for a six</b>"
"<strong>Sodhi makes amends! What a superb catch that is, and Duffy's fantasy evening continues!</strong> It wasn't the best delivery, in truth, down leg side from around the wicket. But Shadab got a top edge that hovered in the atmosphere around the man at 45. Sodhi had to run backwards and put in the dive, but he got the job done. Lethal blow to the solar plexus of Pakistan's hopes"
"takes the pace off it, and Faheem guides it down to third man. NZ won't mind putting Wahab on strike"
"he didn't mean that, but ask him if he cares! Short and Wahab pulled and hoped for the best. The sheer pace on the delivery took it over the keeper's head and <strong>straight down to the boundary for six</strong>"
"another ungainly pull, not the prettiest, but gets Faheem on strike"
<strong>what an exquisite shot that is!</strong> Almost like he brushed the back of the ball and caresses it over extra cover al the way for six. That was an oil painting of a cricket shot
and follows it up with another six! That might have taken the sheen off Duffy's evening a little bit. Poor delivery dragged down leg side and he helps it down to fine leg for another maximum! 20 off the over
""
"short and Wahab swings for the fences again, but doesn't really come close to making contact"
"<strong>and finally Wahab's luck runs out</strong>He'd been swinging, as they say, like a rusty gate, and this time a thick edge carries down to long-ff for a straightforward catch. Kuggeleijn gets his third"
Faheem gets another boundary - <strong>these are precious runs for Pakistan</strong> Short and slightly wide and he scythes it over backward point for four
"this time ensures he doesn't have any room. Faheem can only drive back at him, but a misfield allows them to take a single"
"lovely finish to the over. Yorker that Shaheen digs out brilliantly. Keeps the strike, which I'm not sure Pkaistan will have wanted"
"<strong>Ho ho ho! If you put it in the slot to Shaheen, apparently he'll whack it back 80m or so too</strong>! Gets it right in the middle and it sails over long-on"
"clever change-up. The slower ball beats him, but Pakistan come through for a bye"
"<strong>and Guptill finally gets rid of Faheem on the boundary!</strong> That looked for all the world as if it was sailing over for six, but that's the longest boundary and Guptill was perched right on the edge. Wobbled out of his hands, but gets it safely on the second attempt"
Shaheen continues to go for the big hits. Another big top edge and it sails into the stratosphere. No fielder underneath it and they come back for two
short and quick. Pakistan pick up a single to give Haris Rauf the final delivery
"short and Haris swings without getting close to it. They run the bye, and Pakistan <strong>finish with 152</strong> This is probably <em>below par</em>, but from 20/4, you bet Pakistan will walk off somewhat relieved. They got a little bit of momentum in that onslaught from Shadab and Faheem at the end, and with their bowling line-up, they may just make it tricky for New Zealand. join us in about 15 minutes to see how New Zealand go"
"<b>strikes him high on the thigh</b> as he pitches it on a good length and gets it to nip in off middle stump. Guptill, looking to nudge it towards mid-on, doesn't connect"
"lashes it to mid-off, plenty of bottom hand on the shot as Shaheen gifts the batsman a half-volley to wallop. Guptill will be very peeved he hasn't hit the gap there"
knocks a back of a length ball on leg stump to midwicket
allows the short ball on off stump to come to him and gently taps it in front and to the right of point. Lovely shot for a well judged single.
"<b>inside edge nearly onto the stumps</b>! At 144 kph, this is a serious nut. Full, dead-on at the base of off stump. He's looking to knock it out of the ground but Seifert's bat gets in the way just in time"
"kisses the pad and goes through to the keeper as Guptill tries a flick. Shadab is looking for inputs on whether to go for a review, someone wisely says no."
"good stuff. You need to play Imad with a straight bat and Seifert does, stepping forward and pushing to long-off"
blocks a full ball angling into leg stump
"stops on the pitch does this short and wide ball, ruining Guptill's timing as he goes for a cut"
<b>nails the cut this time</b>. There's a little bit of width on this. There's plenty of pace. So Guptill shifts his weight back and finds the gap behind point
"quicker, flatter and tighter on middle. Guptill is ready for it, nudging a single through midwicket"
"goes back to block a shortish ball to the right of the pitch, looking for a single. Eventually they decide not to go for it with Imad racing for the ball"
"<b>oooh hooo hooo. This is a supremely good catch. This is Shadab Khan at his absolute, shining, pristine, beautiful best</b>! Running back from mid-off at FULL speed. Tracking a big hit down the ground - that when they come off Martin Guptill's bat usually go for six - but Shadab doesn't let up. He keeps his eyes on it - which is so hard because he has to look over his left shoulder. He realises it might beat him at the last minute and so dives headlong after the ball, reaching out both hands, and he takes it so very cleanly. Such a difficult catch and he made it look as if it was destined to be out. Pakistan have their early wicket. They become a far more terrifying bowling side now."
"full toss on off stump, clips it through midwicket"
blocks a full ball on off stump to cover
<b>too quick</b> as Seifert looks to pull a short ball down leg away to the fine leg boundary. Doesn't make contact
<b>magnificent shot</b>. Sometimes Seifert goes at the ball a little too hard. Sometimes he forgets about orthodox cricket. Here he doesn't make those mistakes. The ball is pitched up on off stump. He simply extends a defensive push and collects a straight driven boundary
"width on offer, Seifert uses it with an angled bat to find a single to third man"
"full on middle and leg, he works it to mid-on"
""
beautiful delivery. Conway was lucky to be beaten. Huge appeal from Pakistan and they review. Replay shows it juust missed the bat. <strong>Conway survives</strong>
"Not for long, he's got him this time! That was soft. Played it straight back to the bowler, who completes a smart catch in his follow through. <strong>Pakistan flying</strong>"
"145kph, steers a very quick, back of a length delivery outside off to point"
carves a short ball outside off to the point boundary. He is naturally strong square of the wicket and he looked very very good playing this shot
"covers the line of a shortish bal on off stump and blocks. That, oddly enough, was only 136kph."
"full and outside off, he drives to point"
"a little too full and straight, allowing the batsman to clip it behind square leg"
"shortish and outside off, he knocks it back down the pitch"
"<b>needs the dive to prevent the run-out</b>. Fortunately there wasn't a direct hit. Hafeez at cover, swooping down on the ball, defying his age. Phillips' block and run into the off side just about works out"
slashes a short ball outside off to deep third man
"opens the face and guides it towards point. Phillips is doing this well so far, staying deep in his crease to give himself time to deal with the extra bounce."
"<b>poor start</b>. It's short. It's down leg. It has hit me all over it and Phillips obliges with a pull shot. With fine leg up, that is horrible bowling."
"slower ball on a good length on off stump, he shifts across to it, knocks it down into the off side and sprints through for a quick single"
"back of a length and outside off, pushes to the right of cover."
<b>away over point</b>! Seifert on the charge! He races out of his crease. The bowler tries to one-up him by going full and wide and beyond his reach. But the right-hander catches up with it
"nearly pops a catch to midwicket, running in from the circle. Again, hit back of a length and you get extra bounce and a lack of pace."
"short, but doesn't rise high enough to trouble the batsman, on leg stump. Neat little flick past the right of short fine leg."
<b>launches it</b> over wide long-on! Picks up the short ball so early. Rocks back and simply puts all of his power behind the shot. This is brutal.
<b>excellent timing now</b> as he keeps back in his crease to a flatter ball on leg stump and pulls it behind square leg
"goes back to block a very full ball on leg stump and since long-on is back, they get a single"
"shortish and outside off, he drags it to deep midwicket"
"<b>oooh, how did that go there</b>?! This is one of Shadab's ripping legbreaks and Phillips is trying to work it against the turn through midwicket. Only it is a mis-hit and it goes to fine leg"
clips a shortish ball on leg stump to deep midwicket
"lovely cut shot from Seifert. It looks like he's been given a talking to, either staring into a mirror, or into a coach's face. He's batting well within himself, not attempting wild shots"
stays back and cracks a shortish delivery outside off through the covers
"width outside off, he goes for the cut shot, doesn't connect. Misses out there."
<b>huuuuuuuuuuuuge</b>! The second he sees the ball pitched up - the second he sees it tossed up - he plants his front leg down the pitch and launches it over wide long-on. Monster hit.
"good length ball outside off, slices it to point"
another glide to third man as Imad attacks off stump
<b>swings and misses outside off</b>. Faheem Ashraf's medium pace too gets extra bounce. Eden Park offering plenty
"slices a shortish delivery outside off to point. Very determined to play only off the back foot, is Phillips. What will Pakistan do to disrupt that?"
"back of a length on off stump, he goes big, looking for midwicket, but ends up with the ball striking his back instead of his bat and going to point"
cuts a short ball outside off to the sweeper
"<b>glorious drive</b> through extra cover. This is Seifert batting within himself and yet he has so many shots. He has so much talent. He meets a good length ball, a perfectly good length ball on off stump, and just times the pants off it."
"rises with the short ball that kicks up off the pitch, meaning to topple him, but tonight he isn't so quick to give up. Gets on top of the ball, both feet off the ground, and knocks it to point"
"<b>taken at deep midwicket</b>. That's the long boundary. He's hit it cleanly. He's hit it high. He's looking for six. But as much timing as he gets, he still can't beat Shah. A cross-seam ball from Rauf, hitting a good length on middle and off stump, works the treat."
"back of a length and outside off, steers it to third man"
"clips a shortish delivery on middle to midwicket. Boy, this is tense!"
blocks a short ball on middle and leg
"<b>beautiful</b>! He sees it short. He sees it wide. He sees it has plenty of pace. So he simply gives it direction, down to the third man boundary"
blocks a shortish ball through the covers for a single
"full and slapped back to the bowler. Bowler, batsman and umpire all had to get out of of the way of that as it raced to long-on"
opens the face and helps it down to third man
driven on the up above cover into a safe area. Khushdil on the boundaries comes across to deep point o cut it off
"cleverly placed. Opens the face, uses the pace and guides it past the keeper. No slips so as long as he meant that, it's a relatively safe shot"
"wicket-to-wicket, Seifert watchfully defends that one"
"similar delivery, this time he bunts it and tries to steal a single. It required a dive but they get it. Absorbing over"
<strong>misfield</strong>! That is criminally sloppy and it's the captain at fault. Needed to collect calmly at mid-off and lets it slip from underneath him. Priceless boundary for New Zealand
eased down to third man
"works it down to square leg. Having got tghat first ball boundary, NZ are relatively settled this over"
"uses the wrists to flick off the pads and gets himself a couple, and <strong>brings up his 4th T20I half century</strong>"
short of a length. Pushes him back and he fends it off
worked down to fine leg and they come back for another couple. 10 off the over without really taking any risk
"slightly short. Wrong'un, Chapman pulls it away and gets his senior partner on strike"
"uppish, Seifert had to reach for that outside off stump. Some excitement from Pakistan, but it was always falling short of deep cover point"
worked away for a single
"short and wide, slapped down to seep point and they come back for one more"
"not the best delivery, and Chapman pounces on it with a brutal swipe across his body. Races past fine leg and that relieves the pressure"
brilliant work from Chapman. Flicks it down to the onside and scampers back for two. Shadab's chasing it himself and seemed to pull a muscle. Might be worth keeping an eye on that
wallops it through the offside. A foot either side of that backward point fielder and that was four
pokes it into the offside and calls Chapman for a single
"got big on Chapman, but he kept his eyes on that at all times and manages to work it down to fine leg for one"
gets underneath that short ball and hooks it on the bounce to fine leg
"<strong>four! FOUR!</strong> That was quick. 144kph and Chapman opens up his wrists and angles it down to third man, where a despairing dive from Wahab Riaz can't cut it off. Priceless runs"
a flick off the hips and Chapman keeps the strike. Eight off the over. NZ taking control now
nice start to the over. Shaheen opens up with a yorker and Chapman's finally forced to play a dot ball
"another dot, this might be the over to put NZ under a bit of pressure again. Poked to the offside"
"short ball, that grew big on Chapman. Suspect it might have been a wide if he left it. Gets a run down to long-on though"
"<strong>Shaheen strikes. The big wicket of Seifert!</strong> You wondered if it was better to just see off Shaheen, but Seifert was done by the slower pace and went through the shot early. Faheem Ashraf completes a smart catch running back to the boundary"
right in the blockhole at 142 kph. Dug out down to long-on
"nervously hangs his bat out at it, lucky it didn't take the edge along on its way through to Rizwan. Brilliant over from Shaheen"
"135.5 kph, pulled down to deep square. Neesham needs to settle in quickly and give Chapman a hand here"
opens the face and picks up a single
"slower ball, but Chapman read that all along. Sat back, waited for it and <strong>wallops it over long-on for six!</strong> Brilliant batting from Chapman"
<strong>and he's been dropped</strong>! That's as as straightforward a catch as there's been all evening! Faheem the culprit! Short and he got a top edge on that as it sailed down Faheem's throat at fine leg! Faheem lets it pop out and wobble away for four! This will be costly
defended
"<strong>absolutely glorious batting from Chapman</strong> Moves away, creates some room and slaps Wahab over extra cover for a boundary! Expensive over that included some exquisite cricket from Chapman and a costly error from Faheem. NZ need under 7 an over now"
digs it out and hands Champan the strike
wide down legside. Pakistan can ill-afford this sloppiness right now
"<strong>full toss smashes into the from pad, and it's given! New Zealand review, but Chapman will be lucky to survive that</strong>. Yep, hit him in line, which was the only question, and Chapman's on his way"
"short, it pops up into the air. He had no control over that shot. Lucky not to see it go straight to a fielder"
dabbled to short third. Another tight over as the asking rate climbs slightly again
runs it down to third man
"flicked away deftly through the onside, and the cap off the over with a couple"
"<strong>whoa, that's classy</strong>. Rare occasion that Shaheen misses his length, and Neesham gets it right off the middle over Shaheen's head. Lands square on the rope and he's begun the over with six! Asking rate under six for the first time now"
"slower ball, Neesham watchfully defends"
"bouncer, but he's taken it too far. Well above his head and the umpire calls wide"
"slower ball Neesham tried to poke it down to third man, but finds himself beaten"
In the slot - this has been a poor over from the usually dependable Shaheen. Right in the slot and Neesham clobbers it over cow corner. <strong>Sails into the stands for a maximum</strong>
"angling down legside, and he gets a legbye down for a single. Seems to have rolled his ankle, though. <strong>Pakistan review</strong>, but I can tell you in advance, that's not out"
"gives himself room, Afridi follows him but it's smashed back to long-on. Expensive over, and NZ need just 6 off 2 overs now"
Tried to make room for himself but Wahab bowls a yorker outside off
chipped over  cover and they jog back for a couple. New Zealand a boundary away now
"bouncer. Nearly took the NZ captain's helmet off with it. Decent pace, too"
"hits him on the pads. Another dot ball. This is a tight over from Wahab, though you suspect it's come too late"
"<strong>gets underneath this one, and finishes it off with a flourish!</strong> Another bouncer from Wahab and Santner was waiting for this one. Helped it on its way and watched it sail over fine leg. <strong>NZ go 1-0 up in the series</strong>"
