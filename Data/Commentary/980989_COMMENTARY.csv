"ah, we have a lbw appeal to kick us off. Russell lands it on a good length on middle, gets it to move into the right-handed Rahane, who tries a flick but is struck on the pad. Would have slid down"
"shortish on off stump, defended solidly"
"good bounce from Russell as he goes back of a length on middle. Khawaja is quite capable of handling those. Gets on top of the bounce, rolls his wrists and finds a couple behind square leg"
width on offer and Khawaja slaps it through point. Lovely balance
"back of a length on off stump, straight bat answers"
"steps forward to a shortish delivery on off stump, steered to point."
"oopsy, that's the second over that starts with an extra. And this one is from the awful pile. Morkel has delivered a good length ball on off stump, which has been defended to mid-off. Except the bowler had also overstepped and it will be a free hit"
"banged in short, Khawaja is waiting on the back foot, expecting that very length, and smacks it to the square leg boundary. Excellent pull shot, especially in making such a strong connection to a ball rising up to his left shoulder"
eases forward nicely and drives to cover
that's a nice constricting length. Morkel targets off stump and makes sure the batsman has to be on the back foot with the bounce he generates. Rahane turns it square on the leg side
"aha! We were expecting a spinning pitch, perhaps Khawaja was as well. Except Morkel beats him with seam movement and bounce. The angle is across the left-hander, who pokes because he can't collect dot balls in this format"
walks into a good length ball and drills it to mid-off. Didn't even care that the ball was on its way up when he met it
"fine end to the over, and Morkel throws a glance at Khawaja after the batsman had tried to rudely clip a perfectly good ball outside off stump towards square leg. The away movement off the pitch defeats the purpose"
shuffles closer to a short delivery outside off and runs it to deep third man
"that's dismissive! Almost like we're at the Sydney Thunder nets, for whom these two play for in the BBL. Runs down the track and smacks a back of a length delivery past mid-on's left"
"oh, gorgeous! Keeps to his crease because the line is on the pads. Keeps a strong base and flicks the ball away to deep midwicket. A sprawling dive from Surya Yadav saves the boundary"
"timbeeerrrrrr! Rahane slogs across the line, and only gets an inside edge for his trouble. The ball then ricochets onto off stump, which them topples the middle stump as well. Love these chain reactions"
"this is getting fun! Beaten first ball by some extra bounce. He hits a line just outside off, makes the ball straighten past Bailey's outside edge"
"full on off stump, driven into the covers"
"pace on the ball is music to his ears! A touch fuller from Morkel and outside off, Khawaja lifts it over the covers. Beautiful timing"
steps forward and drums and good length ball into the covers. Khawaja is not holding back!
"huge appeal for caught behind, not to mention from the crowd as well. But umpire Oxenford does not agree. Extra bounce puts the batsman in trouble. He was moving towards the back of a length ball, hoping to simple guide it to third man. But once it got big on him, he loses control. Kisses the outside edge, I think, and goes through to the keeper"
hacked to mid-on for a quick single
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
lovely end to the over. Keeps a fine line on middle stump and keeps the new batsman on the back foot too. Knocked to midwicket. Hostile bowling from Morkel
"he seemed to have opened his stance here, to assist his strokeplay through leg side. Whips a flatter delivery through midwicket"
"flighted on middle, Bailey steps forward and clips to deep midwicket"
"didn't even have to move! Surya Yadav was on the square leg boundary, had already made a fine save earlier, and now takes a dolly of a catch. It was flighted on off stump, Khawaja felt he could take on the long boundary because he was hitting with the turn. Probably would have been a six at the Chinnaswamy, but here, on your way."
"flighted on off stump, turned through midwicket"
"goes back, in response to a shortish length from Shakib, cut to cover"
"ooooh, you gotta love this KKR attack! A slider from Shakib nearly gets Bailey. The batsman was setting up for a cut again, having seen the ball short. Wonder if the left-arm spinner set him up for this with the last ball. That spun away, this one angles in and could well have led to another inside edge toppling the stumps"
"back of a length and outside off, left alone. That won't happen too many times"
reaches out towards the shortish delivery angles across him and chops a single to point
rocks back and cuts a short delivery to point - had plenty of room and should really have put that away. I don't normally buy into this lack of confidence leads to problems with form. But it is apparent for RPS
"frenetic stroke from Bailey, and it pays off! Didn't quite move his feet, but he did throw his hands at a back of a length delivery. The best thing he did though was keep it straight and he gets a four through extra cover. Nicely timed"
"back of a length and outside off, makes Bailey climb up on his toes to chop it"
"take that, you mean fast bowler! Tiwary has thumped a pull shot to the midwicket boundary. See, now I can go back to knowing confidence, or lack of it, does not affect play. Tiwary saw a bad ball - short and allowing him room - and he pulled it"
"slower through the air, Bailey tries a sweep, but he is unable to make a connection. Beaten by the dip on middle stump"
"tossed up on leg stump, driven to long-on"
"a little too full, so Tiwary doesn't have to worry about the turn. Smothers it with a drive to long-on"
"he's taken guard on leg stump, and Shakib, perhaps noting that, flights it up just outside off to counter it. Bailey makes his job difficult by playing a sweep - against the turn and having to reach out for the ball. Mis-hit to long-on"
worked off his legs to fine leg
"nice shot! This time he goes with the turn over extra. Ran down at Shakib, which isn't the easiest thing to do normally. Got to the pitch of the ball and lifted it. Concentrated only on timing and finding the gap."
"back of a length on off stump, Tiwary defends and sets off."
"another neat shot from Bailey. It was a shortish delivery just outside off, but his closed stance allows him to take those kinds of balls and whip them to midwicket"
"inside edge to the fine leg boundary. Bailey was making room, Rajpoot follows him with a back of a length ball and cramps him. All for very little"
"short and wide, pasted away to deep point"
"targets the body again, but it doesn't bounce high enough. Nudged to fine leg"
"finishes with the fuller one, Bailey drives to long-off"
"he's getting into the swing of things. Get it? Oh, of course you don't. I have to describe the shot first to show you what a great pun it was. Bailey comes down the track and unleashes a full <em>swing</em> of his straight bat"
"fired in quicker and flatter on middle, defended"
"on the pads this time, and its been whipped to deep square leg"
"flighted on off stump, driven to long-on. Looks like the singles are coming at a better frequency now"
"races down the track, nearly gets too close to the ball, but his bottom-handed grip helps him shovel the ball down to long-off"
"flighted on off stump, driven to long-off. Course, the field going back must help rotating strike. Also, time out."
"easy put away, but I guess he is concentrating on the leg stump because that's the longer boundary. Full ball, flicked to deep square leg"
"offcutter outside off, worked away to deep square leg for a couple, again that closed stance comes into play"
"tapped to long-on, Bailey's become very mobile. His footwork's excellent"
"umpire Oxenford nods and Tiwary has to go. He went searching for the ball, which was shortish and angled across him. The open face of the bat just about caught up with the ball and the outside edge carried comfortably to the keeper"
"on the pads, clips the pads and dribbles through to the keeper. Oh dear, it's been called a wide? Weird."
"aha, change of pace. The new batsman could not recognize the slower ball early enough. Goes for a pull too early, gets hit on the body, is then dragged for a single by Bailey. Pathan isn't that quick between the wickets, and he would have been out had Pandey, running in from point, had hit the stumps at the bowler's end"
punched to long-on
"beautiful bowling from Chawla. He doesn't normally turn his legbreak, but this one does. Lovely, slow pace, lots of revs on the ball, and drifting into the right-hander as well. Bailey closes the face, looking for a single to midwicket, gets an outside edge that almost scurries to the third man boundary. Morkel came up with a good chase"
"backs away to try and cut the ball, but Chawla's slower pace is causing some problems. This time it is extra bounce. Pathan does well to check his shot"
"does him in! Gorgeous legspin bowling. Bailey looks to play to leg again, not learning from the previous instance, and now he doesn't even make any contact. Worse still, he had lunged down the track and is left stranded once the ball rips past his outside edge. Uthappa does the rest."
"and he nearly gets out first ball! Dhoni goes back, trying to play an uncertain defensive shot. But he is beaten by the slowness of Chawla. Then the ball dribbles off his pad and nearly hits the stumps"
"stays back, reading the spin of the ball off the pitch and defends"
"lunges as far forward as he can to play a defensive stroke, but he does so outside the line of the ball and it hits his pad"
worked away towards square leg
"short ball outside off, cut to cover"
big appeal for lbw after Dhoni misreads the offbreak and is caught in front of the stumps. But the ball was turning too far down leg
lunges forward and defends into the covers to get off the strike
"flighted on leg stump, pushed back at the bowler"
"read the offspinner, went back and cuts it through the covers"
"flighted onto middle stump, Dhoni winds up and drills it to long-off"
"driven to long-off. Didn't quite connect properly. Perhaps he's not certain how he should play. Attack, or defend"
"misfield at cover. It was short, and Chawla's turn works against him. Affords room for Dhoni to smash it"
"strides down the track, trying to throw those three fielders in his eyeline off. But Chawla does well, pulling his flight back and keeping it to a single through point"
"that was the googly, I think. Pathan had set up on the back foot, and mis-hits to long-off. I think he had been hoping to pull it initially"
"tossed up on middle, Dhoni digs it out to midwicket. Time out again."
stays back to a good length ball and steers it to deep point
"neatly done. For once there was only one fielder near the bat, and it is him who has to run after the lap sweep. Shakib races after the ball from and stops it from reaching the boundary"
"lbw appeal, but Oxenford signals there was bat and indeed there was. It was the offspinner that pitched on off stump, Dhoni lunged forward to defend"
"shortish and outside off, punched back down the pitch"
"confusion, chaos, wicket! Dhoni did not read the spin on the ball - in that there was no spin - he reaches across to pat the ball towards point and runs right away. His partner Irfan took off at first, and then just froze. He didn't say no. He just stopped. By the time Dhoni realised, he was halfway down. The Supergiants captain jumps and yells in frustration, knowing he was about to be dismissed, but then Irfan takes a few steps down, crosses Dhoni and sacrifices his wicket"
"shortish and outside off, cut to deep point"
"tossed up outside off, driven to cover"
"looped up on off stump, drilled to long-off"
"flight, dip, turn and bounce! All of that should have fetched a wicket, but after beating Perera, it bounces over the stumps. Drew Thisara forward, then it drifted in, sunk below the inside edge of his bat"
"flighted outside off, driven to cover"
"shortish and outside off, cut to deep point"
"picks the googly, backs away and cuts to point"
goes back to a shortish ball outside off and punches it to long-off
"drifts across the left-hander, Thisara has to reach out for it and slaps it to cover"
"another ball that zips away outside off, Thisara goes back and cuts to cover again"
"flighted on the stumps, defended"
"swept away to deep midwicket. Perera went for the shot and banked on his power, rather than reading the turn"
picked away towards short midwicket
"whack! Pune need a few of these, and Perera knows a lot of it has to come from him. Races down the pitch and belts a six straight down the ground"
"a smirk adorns the spinner's face. It screams, 'hahaha.' Chawla loops the ball outside off, and it's the googly, so if the batsman slugs into the leg side, thinking it was a legspinner, chances are he may get a top edge. And that's exactly what happens. It carries all the way to Pandey at long-off, and he had to take a couple of steps back and was nearly treading on the boundary when he took it. Key word, nearly."
stays back to block a flatter legbreak
"shortish and outside off, steered to point"
"pushed into the covers, no flight again."
"and there's the ball he was setting the batsman up for. Ashwin has been pushed on the back foot, Chawla knows it and loops it up. The batsman pokes at the turning ball and his outside edge wanders wide of slip"
"tossed up outside off, defended"
"good length ball on middle, defended and Narine is running back to his mark. <b>There is rain at Eden</b>"
turned to midwicket
heaved away to long-on. Moves to 8... off 22 balls.
absolutely no spin. A good length ball comes onto the bat perfectly and Uthappa crunches it through the covers. All he did was pick the gap
"loads and loads of turn for the second ball! The ump chimes in that it is a wide, but Pune don't care. Ashwin tossed this one up and it drifted in at the batsman. That is why Uthappa came forward, looking to nudge through midwicket. But the ball rips right across his pads, and Dhoni completes a sharp stumping"
"overpitched and Pandey caresses it through extra cover. Tiwary was terribly sluggish after the ball, probably one of the reasons it travelled nearly all the way"
"another one! Gambhir is furious! But I think he was plumb! He was caught in the crease, unsure which way the ball would turn. If that was the case, Ashwin has done very well. Gambhir is an excellent player of spin. He inched forward, waited until the ball pitched to read the direction it took. But by that time, it skidded onto him, hits on middle and leg and umpire Oxenford sends him on his way"
"huge appeal for lbw, that's an excellent carrom ball! But perhaps it had pitched outside leg? Oxenford is the one who has to take the call, and its a tough one. Yusuf was stuck on the crease and he cannot bring his bat down in time to make contact with another skidder"
"goes for the sweep, which has often been a batsman's safety net when he doesn't know which way the ball is going"
"flighted outside off, tucked to midwicket"
opens up the right-hander with a back of a length delivery that cuts away from him.
"they needed that. Something to calm the dressing room, and the batsmen at the crease down. Dinda doesn't bowl it too short, but Yusuf keeps back and pulls through midwicket"
opens the face and secures a single to deep third man
"very wide outside off, so much that Pandey had to use all of his reach to get there. Cut to deep point"
"thick outside edge leaps to the third man boundary. DInda goes for the outswinger, but the line is very very wide. Pandey manages to catch up with it and gets lucky"
"amazing timing, and some amazing footwork at third man by Perera. Dinda is bowling as fast as he can on a slow, turning pitch. That means the batsman has all the pace he needs to work with. Pandey plants the open face of the bat on it and was set for a boundary until the fielder planted a big old boot in front of the ball"
"thumped! Final over of the Powerplay, so he can take those risks and hit over the top. It was a a flatter delivery, so he could get under it and swing it over long-on"
"a touch fuller and following the batsman moving down leg, immediate adjustment from Ashwin, And that means Yusuf, who was waiting on the back foot, was cramped. Leg bye thanks to Pandey's alertness"
"powerful sweep shot from Pandey, but there is a man at deep square leg"
picked the carrom ball! Yusuf waded forward and launched the ball straight down the ground. Pure power.
"now he bowls the offspinner, and Yusuf has picked that too. Slog swept it to deep square leg. The moment the match was reduced to nine overs, we were in Yusuf country"
"attempted the one that spins away, but it was right in the slot for Yusuf. Heaves it over mid-off and ends the Powerplay in a flourish"
"shortish, quick and outside off, chopped through the covers. Khawaja slipped as he was getting to the ball."
"another flatter delivery, wide outside off to deny Pathan the chance to reach it, or at least make him mistime it. And it is the latter that happens"
"googly, zips past Pathan down leg"
"wanted a big, booming drive over cover, has to accept a four through third man. The man was up inside the circle in that region"
"fired flat and quick down leg, Dhoni manages to weave to his left, and despite being blinded momentarily by the batsman, takes it by his ankle. Great work"
"pushed through on leg stump, Pathan blocks and gets a pad to it"
"half-volley and Yusuf has smacked it over long-off. No mucking about, after those two early wickets"
"shortish and outside off, cut to point"
"starts with the flipper on middle and off, Pandey had been sucked in thinking it was a short ball set to turn away. Had to hurry into a cut"
"ah, unfortunate. Zampa slides a leggie down leg, Dhoni cannot move across in time. Four byes brings up the fifty stand"
goes back and punches a flatter delivery to long-off
stays back to a good length ball on off stump and steers it to point
"flighted on middle and leg, Pandey doesn't read the googly, just about manages to get it off to short fine leg"
"tossed up on middle and leg, Yusuf presents the perfect forward defence"
"swept away, that's the single they wanted, its a bye. Yusuf leaps up after completing the run and punches his first. Well, he should. Knight Riders move up to 14 points and second place with an eight-wicket drubbing of Rising Pune Supergiants"
