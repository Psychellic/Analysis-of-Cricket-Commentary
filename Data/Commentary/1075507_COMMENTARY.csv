"oh, that's quite short and de Kock loads up an almighty pull. But his timing deserts him as the ball skews away to long-on"
"slides on with the arm as Shakib tosses it up, Amla (the real one) drives serenely to long-off"
"picks it up and deposits it to the square leg boundary. Very little wrong with the ball - on a length and outside off - but with only two fielders on the fence, de Kock indulges and the slog sweep comes out perfectly"
"races down the track, clearly eager to upset the spin bowler, and drives to long-on"
"goes flatter and quicker on off stump, Amla taps it through midwicket"
and long-on is tested with de Kock flicking a short delivery to the left of the man
"tosses it up on middle and leg, Amla clips it through to deep midwicket"
misses out - a short ball is cut straight to point
"fires it in on off stump, de Kock drives through extra cover and by the time long-off covers the distance, South Africa have an easy two."
lifts it over the infield and away she goes to the cover boundary. Brilliant shot. And there's nothing agricultural about it. Just a positive stride and a straight bat
"goes flat on middle, de Kock makes room and punches it to the left of short cover"
bowls him! Amla perishes as a result of his making too much room. He's standing on leg stump. Then he clears the front leg to try and open up the off side. But a good length ball pitches on off stump and takes it by skidding through.
"length and outside off, de Kock drills it to mid-off, from where Shakib delivers a direct hit"
chops a shortish delivery on middle and off behind square with soft hands
"fierce drive down the ground, and credit to Rubel to get his hand down to intercept the ball and he's down, he's wringing his hand, and it appears <b>his right thumb has taken quite a hit</b>"
"back of a length and outside off, de Villiers sways back from it so he has extra room to slice behind point"
"more evidence of the kind of belter we have at Bloemfontein. De Kock premeditates by walking yards across outside off and pulls a short ball, that actually surprises him for pace, to the long leg boundary"
"full, looking to topple the stumps, just in case de Kock walks across again. But his radar's a bit wonky. Wide down leg"
bunts a short of a good length delivery outside off to mid-off
"that's been shot out of a cannon! And should, by right, have made a hole in the advertising boards behind mid-off and gone off down the freeway. A blood-thirsty drive from de Kock"
"walks right across to heave into the leg side - but he gets the worst ball possible. Too full, and angling across him. In the end, he seems to inside edge a ball he could well have lifted over mid-off"
carves a shortish delivery but it goes straight to point. Good fielding from Sabbir.
"walks at the fast bowler, who then adjusts his length and bowls short. He also pulls down his pace, and the 111 kph delivery is nudged to midwicket"
works a shortish delivery on off stump to deep square leg
goes around the wicket to tuck the left-hander up. And all de Kock can do against the 140 kph short delivery coming for his chest is drop it down by his feet and pinch a single
on the up and screams away to the extra cover boundary. This is a sensational batting pitch and Rubel bowls a lovely pace for it. The ball comes nicely onto the bat and de Kock simply flays it to the right of mid-off
"143kph, 1on the pads and de Kock whips it away to deep square leg"
"offcutter outside off, de Villiers drives to mid-off"
"143kph, opens the face to spear the short of a length delivery to cover"
"goes for the wide yorker and with de Villiers, hanging on leg stump to have room to free the arms, he can't reach that far. In any case, it's too far says the umpire"
"ball, meet middle of bat. This is flat, it's hard, and it thuds into the midwicket boundary with a vengeance. A pull shot of pure disdain"
"threads the gap at cover. It's an overpitched ball, and de Villiers pulls that pesky front leg away and smears it through with an angled bat. Buh-listering hit."
"offcutter, pitching full on leg stump, de Kock blocks and runs. It's a risky single, but Shafiul is unable to pick the ball up after moving quickly to his right"
"fine leg is up inside the circle and he bowls wide down leg. Wouldn't have hit an easier boundary, and the flick brings up South Africa's fifty too"
"slants it into the pads again, and de Villiers, this time, misses out in trying to help the ball over fine leg."
"back of a length offcutter, and the lack of pace ensures de Villiers can't pick the gap despite his powerful, flat-bat drive"
"<b>misfield at fine leg</b>. That's South Africa's highest poweprlay score in T20Is this year. Taskin is the culprit, basically falling on top of the ball that AB pulls - he mistimes it actually, and yet..."
"he's sent an attempted yorker away to the long leg boundary! First, he feints to go leg side, to lure the bowler to target the blockhole, then he moves across, gets down on one knee and sweeps it away with love"
launches it over extra cover! <b>That's six fours in seven legal balls for AB</b>. And this one is imperious. Takes it on top of the bounce and pummels it over the infield
pulls a short ball on middle stump to deep midwicket
"powerful drive, but it's stopped by Shakib at short cover, and his hands must sting. The ball was flying off of AB's bat."
"legcutter, outside off, AB lashes it away to the sweeper, where Sarkar misfields and for several seconds, he thinks its already gone to the boundary. Yells follow him to say it's still in play and he recovers finally"
"full toss outside off, AB pulverises it through cover. Sarkar this time, standing a few yards inside the boundary for some inexplicable reason, is beaten on his right"
full and wide doesn't work either as de Villers catches up with it with an angled bat and carves it to the point boundary. He's hitting <b>a four every two balls</b>
"full and outside off, spanks it long-on to retain strike. Next bowler, please!"
"tosses it up on middle, clips it away to deep midwicket"
"<b>excellent fielding at point</b> from Saifuddin. Runs to his right, dives and stops a well timed cut from going away to the boundary"
gets too  close to the ball as he advances and as a result his drive to long-on has to go along the ground
"<b>lovely bowling</b>. Goes around the wicket, plants it full and on leg stump, de Kock can only drive through cover"
steps out and clips a fuller delivery on leg stump to deep midwicket
"gets down the track and, with a whirl of his wrist, sends a flighted delivery to long-on. <b>That's the first over tonight without a boundary</b>"
"long hop, but de Kock picks out deep midwicket with his pull shot"
"<b>well bowled</b>. He pulls the pace off, pitches it on a good length, and targets off stump. AB, even after making room, has to hit it with a straight bat to long-off"
"lashes it down the ground, and the drive singes the turf to the right of Shakib. I won't blame him if he doesn't reach for the catch"
"shortish and outside off, AB backs away, waits the extra second since Shakib has slowed it down, and smashes it to deep point. It should only be a single, but Sarkar misfields, and sends in a throw on the half-volley which Shakib really has no chance of collecting"
"tosses it up outside off, smashes it away to the sweeper cover"
sees the batsman advancing and lines up a good length delivery well outside off. De Kock is able to adjust to the shift in line and slaps it to the sweeper cover
"good work from Mehedy, cramping de Kock with a flatter delivery on leg stump. The batsman tries desperately to make his own room, but has to settle for a single to the right of the bowler"
lifts a fuller delivery on leg stump to wide long-on
targets middle and leg and AB whips it away to long-on again
"attempts a reverse sweep, with Mehidy targeting leg stump. Good thinking from de Kock, but he finds short third man"
backs away for a tossed up delivery outside off and jabs it through extra cover. That looks like a legbreak
"taken at long-off! Long boundaries comes in handy and AB falls one short of fifty! Beautiful bowling from Mehidy. He keeps it flat, targets the stumps, does his job to cramp the batsman. AB backs away, and in doing so, his weight shifts on the back foot and he isn't able to get the flow into the shot that will bring it the power needed to clear the boundary"
"tapped in front of square towards a non-existent midwicket for a single, full on middle and easily maneuvered"
"worked off his hips to the deep on the leg side, full just outside off and Duminy rocks back and whips the ball square"
"backs away and cuts furiously, but straight to point. Good length on off stump and QDK had made the room, but just not the placement"
"chipped over the bowler's head for a couple more, <b>And that's the team hundred</b>. Charges down the wicket and just lifts the ball through its line"
"muscled towards cow corner, good length on middle, backs away and just pulls in front of square"
"overpitched just outside off, Duminy can't get it away. Tries to cut square, but it's too close to his body anyway"
"punched down to long off, full just outside off and an easily single on offer. Charged down the ground for that"
"<b>Loud appeal!</b> But not given. Full on middle and leg, and Duminy can't work this to the leg side. Hits him on the pad but would've probably gone down leg side"
"<b>Hammered!</b> It's a full toss in front of his eyes and he pulls it. Great timing on that, and flies over cow corner for a maximum"
"full outside off stump, punches the ball to long off. Calls early for the quick double"
"full on middle, can't whip this square on the leg side. Misses the shot completely as the ball hits his pad"
"overpitched on off stump, driven down the ground"
"<b>Direct hit!</b> And we're going upstairs. It was a good-length delivery on off stump and Duminy made room to pull this along the ground to deep midwicket, they were quick to call for the double but the throw in is good. <b>Seems like Shakib touched the stumps with his finger, but only one bail was dislodged by that. Looks like the ball dislodges the second bail.</b> This should be interesting, especially since QDK's bat is on the line. And not out says the umpire. Mighty close, that."
walks across to the off side and clips the ball off his hips towards the leg side. They walk through for the single
"<b>Dispatched!</b> Down on one knee and slogged over midwicket for another maximum. It was darted in straight outside off stump, no real spin and de Kock really got underneath that ball. <b>Fifty for him too.</b>"
"driven towards long on, smart cricket, deciding to rotate after the six"
"<b>Kayes recovers very well!</b> It's all happening. Full outside off and Duminy hits hard and well. It's flat over the bowler's head, but long off races to his left and jumps to take the catch. Can't hold on to it on his first attempt, but recovers well to hold on during his second attempt. It's all happening."
"good length on middle, tapped square on the leg side. Will keep the strike"
"good length just outside off, makes room to cut square, but straight to the fielder at point"
"overpitched on leg stump, played with soft hands towards the leg side but ensures the ball stays inside the circle. No one in that region, and allows them to easily run two"
"turns the ball square onto the leg side, waits and waits before using his wrists to work the ball towards the sweeper-fielder on the leg side"
"full and wide outside off, cut straight to the fielder in the deep. Straight to him really"
punched off the back foot to the off side. More work for the sweeper-fielder
"taps the ball to long on this time, goes deep into his crease and caresses the ball back past the bowler's left"
"full on off stump, misses the slog competely. Tried to dispatched that over midwicket again, but can't get under the ball this time. Goes past his swinging bat's outside edge"
"full toss, and nicked one-bounce to the keeper. He backed away to make room and the bowler is lucky to get away with a dot ball"
"low full toss in front of middle stump, bunted along the ground, from the top-half of the bat, down to long off. First run of the over"
"slower ball full toss, hits him on the pad, but Miller can't tuck this behind, Deceived"
"once again misses the clip off his toes, very full on leg stump and hits him just outside leg stump. They scamper through for the single, but Rubel's appeal was much louder this time"
"the captain is not happy. It's called a wide, but the batsman walked to the off side to paddle the ball fine behind square. Goes juuust past the outside of leg stump. A rough call"
"<b>Fourth time lucky Rubel!</b> Hits him almost full on his toes, just on or outside leg, and he can't get this one away. Tried to sweep, but can't connect. Rubel appeals and the umpire raises his finger after a really long time. QDK is furious at the decision, but does not review. Did he forget he could've gone up? He screams into his helmet before walking off."
"tucked off his hips to backward square, quick run and the throw is flat as well. But the batsman's safe"
"full outside off, bunted to long on. Not much feet movement, nor the power generated for that shot"
muscled square on the leg side. Good length on middle stump and he just pulls furiously. Dissects the two fielders in the deep
"tapped past the bowler to long off, full on middle and off"
"good length outside off stump, punched in front of square on the off side. Deep extra cover positioned there"
"caressed past cover for more runs, full outside off, and just drives the ball past the diving infielder for more runs. Good chase by long off to keep that to only two"
"yorker on off stump, can only manage to squeeze the ball towards mid off. Good comeback from the visitors"
"oh my, my. Full toss that goes past Behardien's leg side. The keeper dives to his left, but can't hold on either. No ball for the height as well. Behardien does well to get away"
"punched to deep extra cover, good length outside off and drives off the back foot"
"can't get the timing on this shot, looks to drive straight but the bat turns in his hand, goes to the sweeper-fielder on the leg side"
"very full just outside leg, cramps the batsman for room and he can't free his arms. Pinged straight to the fielder at cow corner"
"tapped to long on for a single, full outside off and he simply directs the ball along the ground with soft hands. Wasn't looking for power there"
"clipped off his toes and runs behind square on the leg side, goes past the short fine-leg fielder, but deep square leg covers a lot of ground to retrieve that. After conceding his first two overs for 22, Rubel finishes with 1-38"
"played down the ground to long off, fullish outside off and once again played past the non-striker"
"full toss on middle, whips it off his pads for two, long on and deep square converge to try and field it, Sabbir gets to it first"
"<b>Crunched</b>, but straight to deep extra cover. Full on off and Miller drills it to the fielder in the deep"
"squeezed away to the sweeper on the off side, overpitched just outside off and tries to free his arms"
"hoicked away to cow corner, uses his wrists to whip the ball towards the leg side. Goes just past midwicket's left"
"<b>Inside out!</b> A six to end the over, gets down on one knee and sends the length ball into the crowd. Straight over deep extra cover. What a glorious shot from Behardien to end the over. Bring out the action replay!"
"slower ball to start off, can only muscle the short-ish delivery to long on. Miller can't get the ball away the way he wanted to. Has to settle for two"
"cuts, and cuts late! Waits for the slower delivery this time, it's back of a length on middle and Miller cuts dissects gully and deep point to perfection"
"can't pull it away, hits the bat's sticker area. It was short and on middle and leg, but too close to his body for him to generate any power. Looks disappointed"
"more slower deliveries, tapped down the ground to long on. Seems like that's Behardien's go-to spot for the easy single"
"driven straight back to the bowler, and it almost goes past him for more runs, but Islam does well to stick his hand out, plugs the single"
"<b>Ridiculous shot!</b> Gets down on one knee, and sends it behind square and over the square-leg umpire's head for six more. Just waits for the ball to come to him before simply gently lifting the ball on the leg side. It's timed to perfection, and the only person to catch that is in the stands"
"through the shot too early, low full toss on leg stump, hits his angle just outside leg stump, looked to drill the ball square on the leg side but the pace fooled the batsman. He wobbles away for the leg bye"
"it's a leg cutter but Behardien is waiting for exactly that! Picks the slower ball off the hand, and muscles the ball over midwicket. The sweeper-fielder racers to his left, and dives as well, but can't stop the four"
"drilled to deep extra, full and on the fourth-stump line just outside off. Only a single"
"yorker on leg stump, bunted down the ground to mid off. That sort of delivery is impossible to put away"
"full toss on off stump, squeezed away to short cover"
"full outside leg, Miller has minimal feet movement and he can only dig it to midwicket for the single. <b>SA finish on 195 for 4.</b> A good recovery from Bangladesh, but South Africa won't mind that performance"
riiiight then. Big chase. Playing away from home. Having to score more runs in an innings than they ever have. Who cares? Imrul gets forward to a length ball and lofts it over mid-off. Clean as!
"143 kph, pulls his length back and cramps him on leg stump, Kayes nudges it away"
"short and at the body, Kayes helps it to midwicket with an awkward looking pull shot. If Miller hits the stumps direct, he would have had a wicket"
holds his shape against a short ball on leg stump and times it away through square leg. Brilliant strike. Miller's newly-recovered groin gets a proper work out
"143 kph bouncer and it beats Kayes for pace! This is high quality bowling, getting it up to the batsman's ear as he tries in vain to hook"
"charges out, making room to a <b>147 kph delivery</b>, and skews it away to deep third man"
"pitches it up, gets the new ball to swing into the left-hander. Kayes attempts a flick but doesn't make contact"
steers a short delivery outside off to deep third man
"another bouncer and it thuds into de Kock's gloves, so much that he has to wring his right hand. Soars over the left-hander's ear as he tries to hook. Too much height for him to do so"
"stand and deeeeeeeliver! And the ball flies, absolutely flies, over the long-on boundary. On a good pitch, with even pace, against the new ball with a medium pacer come in, lifting the ball over the infield is the way to go"
"good length ball sliding down leg. <b>De Kock</b> dives to his right to try and get to the ball, and it strikes him on the fingertips to run away. He's <b>struggling with something</b>"
plants his front leg across on off stump and slogs a full-length slower ball out to deep square leg
"yorker on leg stump, pins the batsman on the toes. Hendricks goes up in appeal, but that would be going down leg"
"looks to pull off the front foot, but the 144 kph delivery, hitting the deck, beats the batsman for pure pace"
"gets this one away, the pull shot working perfectly against a short ball at only 138 kph. Amla at midwicket only ushers it to the boundary"
"<b>outside edge</b> wanders out to the third man boundary. Sarkar believes there is two in this, considering the long boundaries, and he drags his partner on. Phehlukwayo could possibly have done better there"
"back of a length on middle and leg, defends"
"offline and Sarkar punishes him for it, four to deep backward square leg. He has a good plan, bowl short and cramp the left-hander. But this one sits up for the pull shot"
"swing as he pitches the ball up, and it takes the ball wide down leg. De Kock throws himself to his right and gets a glove on the ball. Otherwise it would have been five wides. There is something definitely wrong with his right hand. He keeps looking at it, angrily"
up there for the drive and Kayes smashes it back at the bowler. Good on Paterson to take the pace off it
"slower ball outside off, Kayes tries to lash it over cover, but ends up with an outside edge to third man"
"excellent shot, behind square leg, a la Sanath Jayasuriya! Shuffles onto off stump and whips the ball off his hips with the greatest of ease"
"even better, with the ball sailing over cover! Hendricks has let himself down bowling length and outside off and Sarkar only has to hit through the line"
takes the pace off - it's the ball off the back of the hand - and Sarkar pulls it to deep square leg
he sends a full toss down the throat of deep square leg! The ball was there to be tossed into the junk pile outside the boundary. Especially considering there can be only two fielders out there now. And Kayes picks out one of them with a flick shot
"lots of heat on this short delivery, a shade outside off. Shakib tries to use that pace and bounce to his advantage, trying an upper cut. But he's too late on the shot"
starts with a slower ball that somehow holds in the pitch and surprises Sarkar. Rears up at his chest and he does well to block it down the pitch
"back of a length on leg stump, clips it to midwicket"
"tries to glide a back of a length delivery to third man, but he can't connect"
"can't bowl short at his pace, can't bowl it down leg at his pace. Sarkar swivels on the back foot and finds the boundary behind square leg - and there is protection down there, all for naught"
"gets down the track, but seeing that he doesn't have the room to have a free swing, he taps the shortish delivery down to mid-off"
"mid-off is up and though Shakib doesn't time the ball, he is able to get enough to clear the infield. Bangladesh are keeping up with the required run-rate. But they're going to have to go at 10s for the entire innings."
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</B> but that might have pitched outside leg. It's the slower ball to start, which is a very good idea on this pitch, especially when it is at a full length. Sarkar shapes to flick but he isn't able to pull it off"
"full toss on middle, Sarkar has positioned himself beside it, and even then, he hits cover"
"another missed opportunity, with a slower ball on leg stump, and Sarkar finds short fine leg. A little to either side and it would have been four"
"wanders outside leg, which prompts Phehlukwayo to follow him with a slower ball. That's exactly what Shakib wants as he then shifts back in line with the stumps and sweeps to fine leg"
"full on middle and leg, Sarkar drives inside out to cover"
"races down the track for a heave over long-on, but fresh air is all he meets"
"strikes him on the thigh! This one is at 134 kph, cramping Sarkar on off stump. The batsman tries to pull, but the ball sneaks under his bat, suggesting it isn't all that short"
"113 kph, on the pads, and a lot slower, Sarkar clips it to long leg"
"places the swipe wide of long-on and finds the boundary. Shakib backs away, he gambles that the bowler is going to bowl short, he's ready for it and hoists the ball over the infield"
"length on leg stump, heaves it to deep midwicket. Shakib is picking his spots superbly. Last ball, mid-on was up. This ball, midwicket is up and South Africa pay for it"
"slower delivery on leg stump, Shakib backs away to slog it and misses altogether"
"he's skied it, it's going to be a tough catch, and AB's the man running back from mid-off and he takes it without any fuss whatsoever. Frylinck has his maiden T20I wicket, and he's worked it out with a slower ball. It's in line with the stumps and Shakib, eager to keep the boundaries going, lifts it over the off side. It was a good plan, considering the off side fence was less protected. But he can't get enough power in the shot and AB races across the turn, tracking the ball all the way, and snaffling it so very easily"
"tosses it up on off stump, flicks it to long-on"
gets down the pitch to clip a good length ball on middle through midwicket.
stays back to a fuller delivery and tries to flick all around it. Inside edge saves him from an lbw
"spears it in off a round-arm action, which slides down the leg side as Sarkar sweeps"
flicks the length ball neatly to deep midwicket
"tosses it up on off stump, Mushfiqur blitzes it to cover"
"slog sweeps it over the midwicket boundary. B-e-a-utiful hit. Spots the length ball so very early, gets across on off stump to open up the leg side and connects perfectly"
"starts around the wicket to the left-hander, who sweeps the good length ball on leg stump to short fine leg"
"fierce sweep, but there is a deep square leg in place for that shot"
"tosses it up outside off, Mushfiqur lunges forward and flicks it to long-on"
"in the hitting arc, and Sarkar swings it away to the midwicket boundary. Gets momentum into the shot by running down the track, taking it off a length and sending it soaring"
"flatter delivery on off stump, Sarkar flicks it through midwicket"
"short third man and point are up, and Mushfiqur premeditates, and nails, a reverse sweep! If Phangiso had pitched this ball a few inches fuller, he wouldn't have been able to get under the ball. Such a risky shot."
"full and targeting middle, and it pins the advancing Sarkar on the pads while playing a flick across the line. Out comes a <b>huge lbw appeal</b>, but the umpire reckons its not out. South Africa discuss and they go up for <b>the review</b>. The question is about impact - is it in line - and whether the batsman is too far down the track. And DRS gives three reds! Umpire Holdstock has to reverse his decision and the local fans celebrate"
defends the shortish delivery on off stump to point
"goes short and targets Sabbir's body, but the ball slithers down leg"
"full on off stump, defends to mid-off, who is on the edge of the circle for a quick single"
tailing into the pads and Mushfiqur sends it flying to deep square leg
"comes down the track, but Andile spots int and sends down a quick and short delivery. Sabbir is wary of the scary piece of leather coming to his chest and awkwardly fends it to point"
"another short ball - but it's off target, slipping down leg"
drives to mid-off to keep the strike
"tapped to short cover first up, tossed up outside off, and defended"
"worked off the hips towards midwicket, no one inside the circle in front of square and the bowler has to race across the green to retrieve that"
"follows the batsman down the leg side, good length on middle and leg, and cramps Mushfiqur, can't whip the ball away"
"<b>Shouts of catch it, and taken by AB!</b> Pitched up full on middle and the batsman can't resist the slog. Goes down on one knee but can't get the elevation. South Africa kept their best fielder at that spot, and the dividends have been rich"
"uppishly hit over the bowler's head for a couple, dances down the pitch and tries to launch one, but takes the toe end of the bat. Falls safely ahead of long on and long off. Because the shot was mistimed, did he manage to get the two though"
"tucked square on the leg side off his hips, goes to the sweeper-fielder on the leg side"
"pokes at it and goes past his outside edge, good length ball just outside off, tries to cut late but cannot make the desired contact"
"<b>In the air! And another one gone.</b> Back of a length this time, and Mahmudullah looks to slog over the leg side. The bat turns, and takes the leading edge. Amla, near point, has to get under the ball, and manages to take the catch while running backwards. Settled himself right in time before tumbling"
"slow full toss on middle, punched down the ground for a single"
"driven towards mid on for a single, can't make the connection he's looking for. Quick call for the run"
"short on middle and leg, worked off his hips to deep midwicket. A great over from Phehlukwayo, but one ball to go"
"full toss just outside off, manages to get this on the leg side, midwicket races in and ensures it stays down to one"
"back of a length just outside off, tapped to long on with soft hands. The slowness allows for the extra run"
"worked in front of square on the leg side, the fielder at cow corner races in. But the big gaps on the leg side are allowing for easy singles"
"<b>Into the stands!</b> Dances down the pitch and picks this delivery from outside off. Full swing of the bat, along with the arm's extension. Gets the distance. Straight over long off"
"<b>That's AB, baby!</b> He can't take the catch, but saves a certain six! Slogged towards the leg side, but De Villiers races to his left, and times his jump perfectly. AB doesn't risk it, he throws the ball back before going over the ropes. Saves some runs for certain. Will go down as <b>dropped</b> though"
"goes down the leg side, good length on middle, but angling down"
punched off the back foot towards cover
tucked off the hips behind square for one
"dances down the wicket, and punched back to Hendricks"
"overpitched outside off, almost near the batting crease and despite the batsman making some room, he can't squeeze it behind square. Goes through to de Kock"
"<b>Beautiful!</b> Just lifted it over Hendricks' head, and the arm's extension takes it all the way. As straight as possible, and that goes just over the rope between the two fielders at long on and off. A good length ball that was converted into something slightly fuller by charging down"
"full outside off, cannot get the loose ball away, play-and-miss"
"back of the hand this time, it's very short and no pace on that delivery. Sabbir is through his shot too early, and his bat turns upwards while trying to slog over extra. He manages to slice it, and mid off has no trouble swallowing that"
"very full just outside off, squeezed away to cover for a quick run"
"back of a length outside off, opens the bat's face and punches square off the back foot. Goes past point's right and four crucial runs"
"takes the pace off the ball, spongy bounce through to Mehidy, can only slice the ball towards Amla at point"
"drops his hands and takes off for the single, full outside off"
"tucked behind square for a single, full on leg stump, but can't play it as fine as he would've liked. Just to short fine leg's left"
"muscled past point for a single, charged down the wicket but hit the high part of the bat, dribbles away towards deep extra"
"slower ball to end the over, good length on leg stump and he fails to get any connection. Has to settle for leg byes"
"back of a length outside off stump, waits for it and cuts from near his body to short third man. Smart bowling, the pace is off"
"uses the width of the crease and angles it into the right hander, the batsman shuffles to the leg side but the bowler follows him, cramped for room and only manages to muscle the ball towards short midwicket"
"gets the boundary, but probably not how he had it planned. Tried to slog the ball over extra  but the bat's angle takes it over short third man for four"
"full just outside off, misses the big heave"
"low full toss on off stump, Miller at cover gets a knock on his finger while trying to field that"
"slow delivery, and equally short, but the batsman is up to the challenge. Wild slog towards the leg side, but goes straight over long on for six. Duminy almost considered going for the catch, but the ball sailed oh-so-slowly over his head. Useful runs"
"can't get this short-ish ball away, mistimed and Paterson races to his left after his followthrough to restrict"
"<b>The leg stump is off!</b> Tries to shuffle towards the off side to paddle the ball fine behind square, but can't get bat to ball and the delivery crashes onto the third pole. Went too far across, exposing all three wickets. 'You miss, I hit' stuff from Paterson"
"a beautiful yorker on middle stump, smacks him near his toe, a ripper to the new batsman and Paterson appeals. Not out, says the umpire, but they're going for the <b>review.</b> It was a peach first up, replays show it hit him boot-first in front of leg stump. This one's going to crash into middle stump. The umpire reverses his decision. <b>Paterson on a hat-trick</b>"
"somehow dug away, almost a yorker on off stump, takes the leading edge and the ball goes towards the leg side instead"
"slower one, worked around the corner to fine leg. Full on leg stump. Singles won't do it any more"
"good length just outside off, a big tail-ender slog from the batsman. Goes past his outside edge and through to QDK"
"more slower deliveries, full just on off, cut square along the ground to the the fielder in the deep. <b>That's Bangladesh's 150</b> but still 46 to go"
"uppishly driven, and sliced over cover...well almost. Miller at cover races back and holds on to the ball that might have been swirling in the air. Makes the catch look easy"
"<b>Timed!</b> Pulled in front of square, and just past the fielder at cow corner. Short on middle and that shot made the noise off the bat that would've made any top order batsman proud"
"full on leg, goes just past leg stump as the batsman tries to make room to play it. Eventually the ball is too close to his body, and he can't make contact"
<b>Well held by QDK!</b> Full on leg and angling down the leg side. The keeper does really well to throw himself at the ball
"slower ball, back of a length just outside off, all the batsman can do is tuck it to the sweeper in the deep on the leg side"
"slower ball to end his maiden outing. Full on off stump, defended back to Frylinck"
"perfect yorker first up, right on leg stump, Saifuddin does extremely well to keep the ball away"
"backs away to the leg side to hoick this, the bowler follows him, pitching full outside leg, takes the inside edge and flies away to fine leg"
"short outside leg stump, it's the offcutter, and it loops over the batsman's shoulder as he tries to cut it away behind point"
"yorker on leg stump, squeezed away to long on. Calls early for the double"
"full toss on middle, bunted back to Paterson"
"short one to finish his spell, gets big onto the lower-order batsman. Does well to get his face out of the delivery's way"
"full on off, driven to cover and called early for the single, direct-hit from Miller at the non-striker's, but the batsman was home"
"my, my, a six! Pitched up on middle and leg, and Saif brings out the short-arm jab. Over cow corner for a six. Too little, too late. Or is it?"
"back of a length just outside edge, tries to pull over deep midwicket, but can't get the connection. Top edges, and falls just in short of the fielder in the deep"
"short outside off, brings out the tennis-bat smash over the bowler's head and through to long on"
"short and wide outside off, cut square and the sweeper-fielder has it covered. <b>Oh no, he doesn't.</b> It's misfielded, the ball goes between his legs as he tries to field"
"full on middle, punched to mid of for some runs and that's it! <b>South Africa win by twenty runs.</b>"
