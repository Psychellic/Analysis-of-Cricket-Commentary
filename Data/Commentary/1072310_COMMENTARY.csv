"goes fuller, back of a length at middle, takes the splice of the bat as Warner is slightly hurried"
"did cover get a hand on that?! A short, wide delivery, Warner plays square and can't keep the ball down, Morgan flies high to his right but it's just fingertips to it"
"short of a length at off stump, 141kph/87mph, defended on the back foot"
"got him! The short ball gets Warner...this is a beauty from Wood. Short of a length at 142kph/88mph, climbs sharply, Warner taken by surprise, and takes the splice of the bat, loops into the slips where second gets around for a simple catch. The impact of pace"
"short of a length outside off, 145kph/90mph...first time been able to say for an England bowler in a while, played square into the off side"
"short of a length, angled down the leg side, glances wide of a diving Buttler...fine leg does very well to flick it back. Well, looks like that took the face of the bat. Buttler got a glove to it"

"full, wide, a slower delivery...stand and deliver from Smith as he flays it through the covers. Woakes has been inconsistent"
"back of a length outside off, pushed to mid-off"

"uses his feet, this drifts outside leg stump, pushed into the on side"
"short on leg stump, think Smith was trying to leave this for the wide but it takes his body"
this one is way down the leg side
"he's got Smith! What a strike for Rashid. Gets it outside off, just a hint of turn, and a thin nick to Buttler. He actually played outside this, away from his body, and got an inside edge. Not sure Buttler took it entirely cleanly, but it stayed in"

"short of a length outside off, cut through point wide of third man"
"full outside off, onto the front foot and punches to cover"

"pulls the length back, at off stump, defended to the bowler"

"dragged on! We saw a few of those in the Test match here. Good length, outside off, aiming to play square through the off side and gets a bottom edge into the timber. The seventh ball of the over proves a bonus for England!"
"outside leg stump, the line has been inconsistent so far, flicked to short fine leg"
"huge appeal for lbw! Not sure he picked the googly. Morgan has called the <b>review</b>. Gets forward, spins past the bat and front pad. Actually takes the back leg. And it's done too much, missing leg stump"

"on the back foot, leg-sided, nudged to mid-on"

defended into the leg side
fully into line and blocked back down the pitch

"on the toes, clipped with sweet, sweet timing once more through the leg side, two men give chase and just about haul it back inside the rope"
