"excellent finish to an excellent over. Sharp bouncer, angling in from wide of the crease, homing in on Hardik's helmet. Keeps his eye on the ball and sways out of the way. A less quick bowler may have given him time to attempt a ramp, but not so in Archer's case"
"full, angling across towards off stump, punched to the left of long-off"
"back of a length slower one, aiming to tuck Pollard up. Worked quietly off the hip through backward square leg"
"<b>dropped</b>. Archer puts down his second of the match. It seemed to be in the slot for the big hit from Hardik, full and angling across towards off stump. Clears his front leg and goes for it, but it's the slower cutter and he doesn't quite time it. Archer comes in off the deep midwicket boundary, slides forward and gets his hands under the ball, but can't hold on"
"back of a length on off stump, clears his front leg and hoicks it away, effortlessly, over the midwicket boundary"
"got him, huge wicket. Another slower cutter, aiming at middle stump. Pollard gets on the front foot for another big hit, plays slightly across it - looking to go over midwicket rather than long-on - and ends up playing early, creating a big gap for the ball to barge through"
"what a shot that is! Slower ball, back of a length, fifth-stump line, and you'd think there's very little pace for Cutting to work with, but he lets it come on, and just dabs it away to the left of backward point, and somehow sends it speeding away over the outfield even as the fielder gives chase"

"stump-high full-toss on off stump. Was looking for the yorker but missed his length. Still a hard ball to deal with at Archer's pace, and all Cutting can do is jab it back to the bowler"
"now the slower short ball, considerably slower than the previous ball, outside off. Swings too early through his pull and fails to make contact. Concedes just five off the over despite starting it with a boundary"
"looks for the wide yorker, ends up slanting it way too wide. Hardik leaves it alone - not much else he could have done"
"slower ball, back of a length, slanting away from off stump. Flat-batted to the left of long-off, no real power on it"
"wide and full, and Hardik throws his bat at it and gets a thick edge on it. Third man is up in the circle and the ball flies between that fielder and the diving Samson behind the stumps"

"in the blockhole on off stump, jams his bat down to dig it out to extra-cover"
"another slower ball, nipping away towards off stump. Cutting clears his front leg and looks to hit over the leg side. Miscues, slices off the outside half of the bat, but it lands well short of the fielder coming in off the long-on boundary"
"well, we have a review for lbw first ball! Yorker, and Pandya plays all around it, looking to flick it away. Given not out, and Smith reviews without too much hesitation. Hits him on the front boot... Impact in line with middle and leg, and ball-tracking says it'll crash into leg stump. Bye bye, Hardik"
"back of a length, straightens a little in the corridor close to off stump. Lets it come on and drops it into the cover point region for a quick single"

"back of a length on off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and carves it away to deep point"
"shortish, wide of off. Grips on the pitch and nips away a little like a legcutter. Slashes hard and is beaten by the movement and lack of pace"
"length ball angling into off stump, and finally Cutting gets one right in his zone. Clears his front leg and absolutely wallops this over the forward square leg boundary. Mighty hit to end the innings, and it takes Mumbai past 160 on a slow, tricky pitch"

"fired in as a low full toss, clipped to the leg side"
wonderful shot! That's so classy...takes a step outside leg stump then drives inside-out over extra cover. Could watch that all day
"that's just as good! He's looking a million dollars at the moment. Stays still this time, drives with a slightly open face and threads the gap through the covers, wide of long-off. Such timing."
"full at the stumps, defended to the bowler"
"short of a length, big appeal for lbw from Malinga as Rahane whips across the line and Rohit calls the <b>review</b> with a few seconds to spare. Looked high to start with and it looks even higher on the replay, and he's almost off the ground as he plays it. Poor review. Going miles over the stumps"
"oops! A lovely slower ball, defeats Samson's attempt to angle it away, reaches de Kock on the second bounce and he can't take it. Bonus runs"

"shortish, again goes wide of the crease to angle it in. Not as short as Smith would like, and he inside-edges the pull into his back thigh pad"
"and again, angles it in from wide of the crease. This time he sits leg-side of the ball and looks to slap it through point, but the ball stops on him and he hits it into the covers without much power at all"
"length ball angling into off stump, shuffles across to work it through square leg"
"big shout for lbw, but is there an inside edge? Rohit Sharma thinks so, so there's no review. Smartly bowled by Bumrah - he knows Parag has been sitting deep in his crease, looking to set himself up for the pull.

"back of a length, angling in towards off stump. Looks to make room but the angle cramps him, and he ends up flat-batting it back to the bowler. Wanted to hit it through cover"
"shot. The pressure was mounting on Parag, and he finds a way to the boundary. Pandya was getting a little predictable with his length and angle in from wide of the crease, and Parag just jumped across his stumps and used that angle to scoop the ball over short fine leg"

misses the yorker length and ends up bowling a half-volley outside off. Parag clatters it away with a bottom-handed drive over extra-cover
"bouncer in the fourth-stump channel, and Parag brings that bottom hand into play again, plays a tennis-style swat into the gap to the left of deep midwicket"
"back of a length close to off stump, and that's sensational timing from Smith. Stays a little leg-side of the ball, and meets it with an open face and sends it racing away to the right of third man. Not too much distance for the fielder to cover, but it just blazed past him"
"full, on the pads, clipped to long leg"
"bouncer, rising head-high and angling in from wide of the crease. Steps across to hook, and he's beaten for pace. Off the badge of the helmet, and it pops up and drops down into the long leg region"
"looks for the off-stump yorker, ends up bowling a low full-toss. Smith jabs it to short cover with a straight bat"
"full outside off, angling in from wide of the crease. Smith leans forward, looking for the cover drive. Plays a little early and the angle causes the ball to run away through midwicket off the inside half of the bat. That shot brings up his fifty"

"length ball angling into off stump, clipped away to the left of deep midwicket, and is that a run-out at the bowler's end? They risk a second run against Ben Cutting's rocket arm, and even though it isn't a direct hit, the throw is so flat and accurate, straight into Pandya's hands near the stumps, that Parag is at least six inches short"
"that's a pressure-relieving boundary. Short, just a bit of width, and Smith leans back and cracks a square-cut past the left hand of the diving backward point fielder"
"full outside off, driven to the right of sweeper cover"
"make that 0, 0, 0, 0. Bumrah's deadly inward angle and skiddiness does in another batsman. Turner's front leg moves half-forward and across the stumps, and he ends up playing around his front pad looking to work it into the leg side. The angle beats his inside edge, and it's the plumblest of lbw decisions thereafter"
"shortish, angling into the front hip, tucked away into the square leg region"
"back of a length, angling into off stump. Smith pushes to the right of backward point and sets off for a quick single. Not too far from the fielder, Pollard, and he throws with his right arm... <b>Direct hit at the non-striker's end</b>, but Smith is home, just about"
