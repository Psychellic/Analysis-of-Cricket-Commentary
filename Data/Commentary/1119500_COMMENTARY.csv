"poor start, on the pads and Warner flicks through midwicket easily for a couple to open his account. 134 kph gentle loosener"
"full and straight again, much fuller than the previous one, worked to square leg this time"
"good length around off, Warner stays in his crease and defends"
"edged but just short of wide slip. Full delivery outside off, angled across, a thick outside edge dies in front of Rohit"

"walks right across to put Bhuvi's length off, shovels his caress to square leg"
"good length around off, getting that ball to seam back in, worked to mid-on"

"terrific length, around off, on a length, blocked"
"finds extra cover. Full on off, the ball coming back in, Finch tries to work it through a gap, instead of go over it. Hits the fielder"

"a maiden to start from Bumrah. Discipline already. Good length outside off, punched to mid-off"

"superb bowling this, on a length around middle, defended back"
"133 kph, around off on a length, tapped quietly towards point for a quick single. Well run"
a tad short. Warner picks the length and pulls down to fine leg. Wanted that through square leg
"struggling for timing early. Good length outside off, pushed to mid-on, tries to muscle that through cover"
"picks that a'right. Slightly short, an Finch knows the field. He can see that no one is there if he clears square leg, so he pulls well over the fielder"
"ooh, lightning outfield. These aren't short boundaries, nor are they pulled in, but this raced away. Short on middle and leg, Finch pulls through square leg, along the ground this time. Fine leg has no chance"
"good length outside off, punched up towards mid-off"
"good end. A tight delivery on middle, defended back to Bumrah, who picks up and feigns a throw back to Finch, doesn't let it go, never intended to"
"that's where Warner wanted to hit the first ball of the previous delivery. On a length on leg, Warner pulls through square leg with ease. Perfectly placed"

"another slower delivery, Warner picked it yesterday, on the pads and nonchalantly whipped through midwicket for two"

"full and straight, some seam movement back in, defended back. Bumrah is appealing for absolutely no reason"
"good length delivery on middle and leg, a thick inside edge to square leg"
"just over midwicket. Shortish on off, Warner has picked everything Bumrah has dished out. Stays back and jabs a stab over midwicket, didn't go through with the shot, let his muscle do that for him"
"shot of the day! Sensational batting. Short outside off, the ball coming back in, but Warner like he does so many times in the IPL, creates room by exposing his stumps (not a back away, just a subtle change) and powers a drive through extra cover."

"another slower ball outside off, Warner stays in the crease and deflects the ball down to third man"
"on the pads again, and when you beat the infield in India, it's tough to cut it off. Finch clips this behind square for four. Short fine leg has no chance"

"good length outside off, punched on the up to mid-off"
"on a length around off, played into the off side"
"a good stop by cover. A short slow delivery outside off, hit towards cover's right, who gets down and stops the ball from racing past. Mid-off gets around top clean up"

"on the pads again, nurdled down to fine leg"
"mis-timed and gone. Australia's man in touch is gone. A full delivery outside off from Pandya, Finch tries to go over mid-off, the right ball to hit, but can only skew the ball off the outside half towards Bumrah at mid-off, who rusn to his left, takes the catch, but the ball pops out. The ball is rolling all over his legs like an insect, but Bumrah uses his feel, not his sight, to hold on somehow. Made a simple catch look very tough. Excellent plan from Finch, just flawed execution"

"gone! Jadhav does it again! A dangerous, dangerous shot, sweeping from the stumps - because of Jadhav's low arm, the ball follows a stump-to-stump trajectory right from the time it leaves his hand, when he's bowling from over the stumps. It's fairly flat, and it doesn't give him too much time to get down on one knee, and he's in a half-crouch when he swipes at it and misses, and he's struck absolutely plumb in front. The low bounce he generates is another reason to think twice about going across the line. That's pitching middle, hitting middle. Barely any turn."

"run-out! A 123 kph slower ball wide outside off, Faulkner can only mis-time it to long-on, he wants to retain strike for the final ball, and runs back but was never going to make it. Dhoni collects the ball and removes the bails with Faulkner a foot short"
"misses a full, straight ball. 138 kph, full on off, Coulter-Nile winds up and looks to unfurl a big swing, but fails to connect at all. The off stump is uprooted"

"length ball close to off stump, defended into the covers"

"back of a length on off stump, defended to mid-on"

"back of a length, angling into middle and off, clipped to square leg"

"back of a length, fourth-stump line. Looks for that single to third man again, and Smith dives left from backward point to deny him. We saw a lot of this in Bengaluru too"

"fullish on off stump, driven crisply to mid-off"

"and now he's off the mark. Overpitched, for once, angling into off stump, and all he has to do is meet it with the full face and drive back past the bowler, to the right of mid-off"
"two in two. Not overpitched like the previous one, but full nonetheless, and he extends his arms through another drive to hit over the top, to the right of mid-off"

"short again, this one sits up at waist height on off stump. Pulled straight to square leg"

"loopy full-toss wide of off, driven to the right of sweeper cover"

"good stop again. Shortish outside off, bunted away towards cover, who gets across to his right"
"127 kph, slower delivery on middle and leg, Rahane comes charging at Faulkner and goes through with a nothing hoick. Luckily for him, it is badly timed. The fielder takes it on the bounce"

into the gap behind square for another boundary. Full and straight. Rahane flicks and finds the gap at the backward square leg boundary
"and out, says umpire Erasmus. On a length on middle, Rahane misses a flick and is struck on the pad. Was he moving across too far? Was it sliding down leg? <strong>Rahane opts to review.</strong> No bat on that, so an umpire's call will do for Australia. Two reds, and clipping the bails, so Rahane will have to go. Had just shuffled across too far"

"down the track, and that's nicely done. Gets fairly close to the pitch of this flighted ball outside off, and uses his bottom hand to whip it over midwicket"

"length ball on the pads, clipped towards backward square leg"

"fullish on off stump, blocked to mid-off"
"there it is. Finally a short ball gets up to a reasonable height, on or around off stump, and he pulls it away over midwicket and it carries all the way to bring up his 14th ODI hundred. This has been a superb innings in difficult conditions for someone who really relishes the ball coming on to the bat"
