"<b>that's into the top tier! 104 metres.</b> Comes down the wicket and hammers this over the cow-corner boundary.

"big appeal, but turned down. Pitches just outside leg stump and straightening after pitching. Denly's defending down the wrong line as it hits his pad. Impact on leg stump but would've gone down the leg side. <b>They're reviewing</b> but that's a waste. Let's move on."

"short and wide outside of, Denly has to reach at it once more, but manages to make enough contact. Cut square, and once again between the two infielders behind square"
"quicker ball, and it's a skyer. <b>Taken!</b> Yasir Shah's over the moon. A fast, half-tracker on leg stump, and Denly tries to lift it over square leg. Deceived by the extra pace and top edged. Smart take from the fielder running from short fine leg"
<b>gone first ball!</b> Full on middle stump and straightens. Babar is trapped right in front of the wicket. He's not going to review this. Plumb. Late movement gets him for a golden duck

great work from Agha in the deep. Drives this full ball once again past cover. The dive in the deep ensures the ball doesn't go for four. Applause from the bowler

"full on leg stump and going straight through. Hits his front pad, but would've gone down the leg side"

"full and wide outside off, big stride forward but the drive doesn't come off. Mistimed to the bowler"

"good length just outside off, goes straight through this time. Bopara sticks his bat out and pokes towards point"
"too full on leg stump, and it's swept well! Beats short third man, but can't get the better of Sohail in the deep. Races across to his left from deep backward square to parry this back. Excellent from the big man"

"a volleyball catch. But excellently done by Shaheen Afridi and Umar Akmal. The legbreak on middle and leg, Ingram gets underneath the length, nails his sweep, but gets far more elevation than distance. Shaheen sets himself up at deep midwicket, but doesn't realise he has far more time and room than he thinks. He, to his credit, keeps his eyes on the ball, backtracks slightly (with a metre of ground behind him), and volleys - like a swat - the ball towards Akmal, who has ran towards him from long-on. Excellent relay catch. One terrific catch from Shahid this tournament, one terrific assist from Shaheen."
nudged into the gap at midwicket. A needlessly hurried throw to the bowler's end results in an overthrow.
Rizwan walks right across and sweeps the ball to deep midwicket
"full outside off, clipped to deep midwicket"
"taken? Yes, says McCullum. Another carrom ball outside off, it bounces and spins away, Rizwan guides the ball to slip off the open face. McCullum stays low and takes a good, low catch with both hands. But the umpires just want confirmation from the TV umpire. The <strong>soft signal is out</strong>. McCullum gets his hands underneath the ball, but is there some part of the ball touching the ground. These are those iffy ones, but the TV umpire says not enough evidence to overturn that."

"good finish, sees Imad coming so he shortens the length of the delivery, pushed to long-on for one"
"that's an awful delivery, a full toss on the pads, square leg is up, would you want it anywhere else? Flicked easily over square leg for six. Just picked up."
"beautifully bowled, the back of the hand slower ball down leg, it doesn't get to Imad. He waits and waits before making contact, the ball lobs back to Sohail's left in his follow-through. He holds on, which is followed by a stare at Karachi's captain"
"six first ball! That's the T20 way, it's Afridi's way. It's a full delivery outside off, Afridi gets across and swivels into a heave over midwicket. What's the fuss about?"
"the back of the hand slower ball again, too wide outside off, called a wide"
"6 off 2! That's Afridi's batting contribution this game. Another short ball, the change in length hurries Afridi. He also has to drag this from wide outside off, so there isn't great timing. It takes the leading edge, high in the air, and into the hands of deep square leg."
"another slower ball, too predictable, outside off, carved to Shaheen Afridi at deep point, who gets across to his left, but the ball pops out and makes its way to the boundary"

<b>Is that edged?</b> Narine goes for a golden duck. Good length on off stump and Narine backs away to slap this to cover. Goes for a big heave and the ball takes the outside edge. The pinch-hit tactic does not work out tonight

Ramdin cuts fiercely towards backward point. Denly dives to his right, he tries to reach the ball with both hands, but at some point during his dive (with both feet off the air), he realises he can't get there, so he goes with one. And holds on with one hand. That ball was travelling too. A fraction of a second to react but there was so much thinking to do in that."

"Usman Khan looking for a one-hander when he didn't have to. Everyone can't be Joe Denly. A bouncer down leg, Yasir is not in control of his pull, takes the leading edge towards fine leg.
