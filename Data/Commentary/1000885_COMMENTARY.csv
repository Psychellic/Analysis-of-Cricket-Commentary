"good length outside off, some nip back in. Chopped towards the keeper"
"back of a length outside off, swatted down to mid-on for three. Nowhere near the middle but enough"
"128 kph, clears his front leg, gets a bouncer and pulls down to fine leg"
"144 kph, shortish delivery on off, hammered to deep square leg"
"a wide yorker outside off, some reverse maybe? Moving away late. Guided to deep point. Oh wait, the leg bail is dislodged. The third umpire is being called for. Never seen that before. Sarfraz lets out a tired yelp of 'how's that.' Handscomb went really deep in the crease, and had to stretch out for that. In trying to get to the ball from his position outside leg, his bat swing just grazed the leg stump and the leg bail came off before he made contact. I actually couldn't see discernible contact, but it was so close it could have just been the air from the bat swing knocking the leg bail off? Either way, it was definitely out and Handscomb is given. End of a superb innings. Snicko has a spike."
"definite reverse swing. 146 kph, yorker outside off. Goes through bat and pad"

"darted in on leg, 87 kph. Starc misses his heave"
"the wrong un, muscled down to deep backward square leg"
"and another one falls. Flat delivery from Azhar and full. Maybe a touch too full for Wade to be sweeping. Fails to get over the line. Takes a thick leading edge and carries to short fine leg. All eyes were on Azam considering Pakistan's fielding woes, but he settles safely underneath and takes the catcg"
"eeks. Flat delivery on off, in Starc's arc and the heave sends the ball way over midwicket"
"what a catch. Lovely take from Mohammad Rizwan. <strong>Australia have declared too</strong>. Wahab is injured in the process too. That was always Rizwan's catch, not sure what Wahab was doing. It was the full, flat dart on leg. Starc was through his stroke and the ball just lobbed up towards deep midwicket. Wahab, at deep square leg, and Rizwan, from deep midwicket, sprinted in. Rizwan's eyes were always on the ball, Wahab's too. Not sure if there was a call. Rizwan hangs on, while Wahab makes contact with Rizwan and falls over."

"edged and gone! A poor stroke from Sharjeel. Nice catch from Renshaw too. A good length delivery a set of stumps outside off. Absolutely no need to play, but Sharjeel doesn't leave too many. Has a leaden-footed waft at that. Not nearly wide enough to be cutting. Gets a thick outside edge which carries at chest height to Renshaw, who takes a good reverse-cupped catch"

"135 kph, close to off on a full length. Steered to point"
"close to off on a good length, defended into the off side"
"given immediately. Beaten for pace. Azam walks off. Australia have two early wickets. Hazlewood goes wide of the crease and bowls one full and straight, the ball seaming back in. Azam plays around his front foot, his bat makes contact with his boot. The ball has its sights set on Azam's front pad. Raps into it flush in front of middle. A saved review because that was plumb"

"oh no. Misbah, what have you done, again? He always wanted to tee off against the spin of Lyon. Flat delivery with a bit of drift, it doesn't stop Misbah. He goes down on one knee and aims for a heave over midwicket, in typical Misbah style. Like he did against Moeen in the England summer, he mis-times one. Hangs in the air for a while. Bird circles around the catch but settles underneath and completes an easy catch."

The ball deflects to Handscomb's gloves, which in turn ricochets towards Smith's right at first slip. He dives away and takes a stunning catch one-handed catch. That was full and straight too, so not sure if it was given lbw because umpire Ravi's finger was up rather quickly. Definitely out so doesn't really matter"

Flat and wide outside off, Khawaja comes down, Yasir darts it wider. Khawaja can't lay bat on his steer. Just grazes Sarfraz's gloves on the way to third man. His gloves hardly moved.

wanted a very fine paddle sweep. Misses the connection. Lots of turn
"and again. Tries the paddle sweep, <strong>Misbah wants to review</strong>. Smith shakes his head to indicate no glove. Sarfraz was up immediately. Another flat delivery down leg, Smith gets his hands through the shot a tad late, the ball is very close to the glove. Does thee ball kiss the glove? A very very thin spike as ball passes glove. A flatline interspersed by one thin spike is enough for the decision to be overturned. Great catch from Sarfraz, moves well. Another quality Smith knock ends. A little mark on HotSpot too, good decision from the third umpire."

"bowled. 'Naaaaiiisss Gaarryyyy,' yells Wade. Some flight on off, defended"
"aargh. Another pathetic stroke from a frontline Pakistan batsman. Lots of flight on middle and leg, what was Sharjeel trying to do? Not even a percentage stroke. He looks to flick the ball over midwicket, against the spin, with a fielder in place there. Fails to keep it down, fails top clear the infield. Warner is patrolling that area and he picks the fielder out. Low-percentage cricket. Playing with the spin was a better option. Was looking so good too"

"and Australia have their first in the first over of the morning. Hazlewood strikes. Exaaactly what Australia needed, and just the opposite for Pakistan. A fullish delivery tailing back in. The length was slightly shorter than the previous deliveries, Azhar wanted to work the ball into the leg side but the ball stops on him and he just bunts a ball back to the bowler. Easy return catch for Hazlewood."

"strays down leg, 135 kph. Azam misses a flick"
"one more. Azam falls over one again. The same mode of dismissal like the first innings. That's bad batting. Doesn't bother reviewing, good thing too because that was plumb. Full and straight, the ball seams back in and hits Azam right in front of middle as Azam can't get his bat on his flick. Should have learned from his dismissal in the first innings. Hazlewood set him up for that, bowling wide outside off with the occasional bouncer to push him back. Fantastic bowling"

"defended into the off side, towards cover, for one. Another quality single"
"where was he going? Cartwright had a lot more time than he thought. Off the pads, ricochets towards short leg who goes back to field. Yasir meanwhile has gone meandering down the pitch for a non-existent run. <strong>Cartwright misses the stumps at the batsman's end</strong>"

"uh oh. Younis the one to play a false stroke this time. Undone by Lyon's magnificent pace variations. Runs down to the pitch but doesn't quite get there because the length is shorter. Goes through with a heave into the leg side. The ball stops on him and lobs up towards mid-on off the outside half of the bat. Hazlewood has his sights on the ball, gets underneath it and takes the catch. Just reward for some excellent bowling this morning"

We saw something like this given yesterday, Steven Smith the victim. Yes, that is enough evidence and O'Keefe strikes. What a beautiful delivery though.
