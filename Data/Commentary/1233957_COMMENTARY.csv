"excellent line to start with, in the corridor and Latham confident enough to leave it, even though it's coming in with the angle. That went very close to off stump"
"extravagant movement after pitching, but this is well outside off. Pitches very full and swerves away"
"good lines by Roach, pitches outside off and seams away. Latham lets it go"

"very full and well wide of off, left alone"
"fuller length, but still on a sixth-seventh stump line, left alone"
"In channel and nipping back, Young goes half cock in defence and is struck on the pads. Big appeal not given, and <b>Gabriel has convinced Holder to review</b>. I think it has struck him outside the line. And the review confirms that, struck outside the line. Good ball though, pitched on a length and seamed in, beat his inside edge."
"very full and well outside off, easily left alone"
"length in the channel, good carry after pitching but left alone comfortably"
"full around off, defended to gully"
"<b>stroked nicely through cover</b> but the fielder runs back and pulls it in just in front of the boundary. Too full from Roach outside off, and he leans into the drive to get New Zealand's first runs."
"<b>past the outside edge</b>. Good length, straightens after pitching and he's coming forward to defend but the ball goes past the edge"
"fullish and strays on the pads and <s>first runs for Will Young in Tests</s>. Came off the pad, to fine leg"
"full on the stumps, full face of the bat shown while defending it back down the pitch"
"good length outside off, left alone"
<b>dropped just short of gully</b>. Swerved into him on a full length and Latham gets a leading edge as he's trying to flick it. Almost carries to the fielder but drops just short
full outside off and crisply punched through cover point. And that's Will Young off the mark in Tests.
"too full outside off, and Latham punches this through cover elegantly to get the first boundary of the innings"
"back of a length outside off, seams away sharply and bounces a fair bit too. But easy enough to leave for Latham, well away from him"
"back of a length angling into him, lets it go through, bouncing over the stumps anyway. Fumble behind the stumps means the ball goes to fine leg for a bye"
"<b>dropped by Dowrich</b>. That's a proper chance put down. Great ball by Gabriel, pitches on a length and spits away to take the outside edge as he's defending from the crease. Dowrich had to move to his right to get it, and moved towards it but pulled out. Darren Bravo at first slip saw him moving so was taking evasive action"
"<b>gets him a ball later</b>. Dowrich will be the happiest, marginally more than bowler Gabriel himself. Very full, swinging in and raps him on the back foot, right in front of the stumps. Young's first Test innings ends quickly.  Gabriel is all smiles. He was frowning darkly a ball ago, but that's forgotten."

"first bumper of the day, dug in outside off, Kane arches his back to keep well out of the way"
"goes down the legside, trying for that something extra perhaps. A one-day wide. Uh oh it's a no-ball - a problem Gabriel's had often - because he has over-stepped."
"good length nipping in from off, defended from the crease towards point"

"fuller outside off, and this one moves away now. But it's too far outside off to cause worries to the batsman"

"He does, but not enough to make Latham play at it. Good length and a bit closer to off, angling further in, but it's not threatening the stumps and Latham lets it go again"

"good length in the channel, nipping in, but Williamson has covered his off stump well and leaves it"
"length outside off again, nips in after pitching but not enough to threaten the stumps or interest Williamson in getting his bat near it"

"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"<b>lovely shot</b>. Too full this time and closer to off, Williamson leans on the front foot, opens the bat face and drives it pleasingly through cover. Slow outfield so the ball will be pulled in, but that was stroked nicely"
"<b>appeal for a catch in the slips</b>. But that came off the thigh pad. Good ball from Roach, that's the area he wants to be bowling, on a length and targetting the stumps, straightens after pitching and leaves Latham squared up. Misses the bat and goes to Holder at second slip off the thigh pad"
"too full and too straight, clips the pad and goes very fine for a boundary"
"<b>outside edge</b> but drops short of third slip. Holder gets it to bounce more than Williamson was expecting and nips away off the seam, pitching on middle, kisses the edge and bounces to third slip. He took his hand off the bat quickly and that helped the ball die quickly"

"length on the stumps, seemed to stick a bit in the pitch and Williamson was early into the shot, ended up adjusting and pushing it down instead of flicking"
"full on off, defended towards cover"
bounced a bit more off a length than he expected. Williamson had to rear up and defend it on off stump
"back of a length outside off, punched off the back foot but Chase at point dives to his right and stops it"
<b>beats him</b> with Williamson going through an out-of-body experience as his hands push at a back of a length ball wide enough outside off to let go. Rare for the NZ captain to play so far away from himself
that's more like him. Judges a good length ball to be outside off - only slightly - so protects his stumps with his front leg moving across and lets it go
"too wide outside off the interest the batsman, who then goes down to the pitch and taps it down a bit. Some balls are biting into it and taking the grass off, forming indents"
"<b>sharp stuff!</b> at 140 kph as well. A few back of a length balls are rearing up off this pitch. It's not quite as quick as it can be, but even so, this one hurries onto Williamson, who gets up on his tiptoes to blunt the ball."
"too wide, too easy to leave, next please."
rises off his feet again to deal with a 143 kph shortish delivery on off stump. Promising start to a new spell from Gabriel.
slides off the outside half of the bat as Latham steps forward to defend one on a good length on off stump
<b>beats him</b> and Latham looks utterly disappointed at himself for putting himself in that situation. He's been leaving on length so well. And this was short and angled across him. It was not going to hit the stumps.
turns it off his hips behind square leg and gets across to the other end. Good batting on a tough pitch
spots the bouncer early and squats under it.
"waits for the back of a length ball to arrive on off stump and, with the soft hands that you'll use to handle a care package, he sends it to cover"
drifts down leg and Williamson is only too happy to keep away from it
"half an appeal for leg before as Gabriel pitches it up and targets middle and leg stump. Latham probably manages an inside edge as he goes for a flick. And even if not, it definitely pitches outside leg stump"
works a short one off his hips to long leg
covers the line of a short ball on middle stump and nudges it to square leg
clips a back of a length ball a shade outside off to square leg. Steven Smith lite.
"<b>ohhhhh that is b-e-a-utiful!</b>! There is extra bounce here. It should be surprising the batsman. It should be thrilling the bowler. But since it's Williamson, he's able to get on top of the ball, a shade outside off stump, and slice it behind point for a boundary. Brilliant technique."
"And inevitably, when the full ball follows the short ball, he's ready with a front foot stride and a straight bat. Sweetly driven four through mid-off. He's only got 25, but it's already been quality"
"brings down a straight(ish) bat to a full ball on off stump. The face closes at the last second, sending the ball, which is angled across him, back where it came from"
another conspicuously full ball that is targeting the stumps - perhaps West Indies have caught on to that shortcoming in the first hour - and Latham is forced to defend again
"good length on off stump, Latham plays it late and lets it run off the face to point"
gets a touch squared up as he deals with a short ball that pitches leg stump and darts away.
gets a biig stride forward - which is rare for Latham - and steers a fuller ball to point.
"off his more comfortable back foot this time, but still finds point."
"shortish and angled into him, and perhaps judging this is a bit too close to his body, and that he might not be able to get on top of it, he simply lets it go"
"back of a length and outside off, Williamson watches it nestle in the keeper's gloves with great content."
pitches it fuller - the sucker ball outside off - Williamson is the last man to ever indulge in something like that
"scary bouncer - mostly for the keeper, because not only is it making him stretch full length off his feet, it swings away to his right. Good work from Dowrich to grab it in the end"
"<b>wicked bouncer</b> and <b>even better batting</b>! Gabriel hits the deck hard, just a shade outside off, and the ball seams into the right-hander, climbing up to his chest, threatening his body. Williamson watches the ball all through. He bends his knees. He bends his torso back and he avoids and ridiculously dangerous delivery with the utmost ease"
"back of a length, outside off, no shot. Next!"
"good length, outside off, defends"
"reaches away from his body and halfway through the shot realises his mistake and in the end he's only half committing to the shot, a weird little glide to point, where the ball hits the bat more than the other way around. Immediately practices the leave"
"full and on off stump, drives to mid-off"
"defends to the left of point and sprints through for a single. Well judged, like one of his leaves."
now it's Williamson's turn to be disappointed with a shot. An inside edge to an airy drive to a near half volley outside off. He's annoyed because his feet didn't move across to the ball to cover the line.

"back of a length on off stump, taps it into the covers"
bouncer but it's off target. Too far down leg.
"<b>leading edge! Run-out chance!</b> All safe for NZ in the end. Latham is a bit hurried as a back of a length ball seams away from him. He'd closed the face of the bat, thinking he'd have runs through midwicket. He still thinks he can get some, which draws Williamson out of his crease, allowing cover to take aim and throw. It's off target"

back of a length and down the leg side. Latham ignores it like he owes it money
"<b>that's lovely control</b>. He may not have Kane's flair, but he does subscribe to the same school of batting. Meets the ball so late. And as a result of that, he's able to do whatever he wants to the ball - in this case pick the gap between point and gully."
"shifts back around the wicket and strays onto the pads, which Latham is quite thankful for as he works it away behind square leg. <b>That's drinks</b>"
"leans into the drive and does it well, sending the full ball outside off into the covers off the middle of the bat"
"another that is pitched up, teasing the batsman into the drive. Latham makes sure he is playing close to the body and finds cover again"
"a short ball to follow two full ones, Latham picks it up early and gets under it"
<b>gorgeous shot</b> but <b>Blackwood is electric at point</b>. Latham loves it short and wide. It's one of the few shots he plays with nothing holding him back. But here he can't get it wide enough of the fielder
"<b>brings up the fifty partnership</b> with a sublime hit over point. Once more the bowler gives him width and Latham, this time, is able to play with a straighter bat, angling it just a bit to lift it over the fielder"
that's much better. Pitched up and angled across on fifth stump. A lesser batsman might have pushed at that and nicked off. Not Latham
lovely bowling. He's been a threat all morning. Pitches it up to see if Williamson fancies a drive. He doesn't. What a battle.
"if there's anything that WI should be criticised for, it's that they haven't hit the same spot over and over again. Like here, Gabriel immediately goes too straight after he sees the batsman leave, and Williamson gets an easy flick to midwicket"
"short and wide - see they're not hitting the same spot, not packing a good length at the stumps - and that means there is no pressure on New Zealand. Williamson cuts to point. He'll be disappointed he didn't pick the gap"
"good length, outside off - finally it makes an appearance, though he could still bowl closer to the stumps - Williamson leaves"
drives sweetly to the right of point as Gabriel floats one up a shade outside off stump
"<B>away movement</b>! This one off the pitch. The more dangerous kind. It has Williamson in a tangle. The batsman originally commits to the angle, looking to hit perhaps mid-on, but then has to square himself up and make sure he plays with a straight bat as well, his body twisting in all sorts of ways to block the ball. <b>Gabriel vs Williamson. Get out that popcorn</b>"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
taps a back of a length ball outside off with soft enough hands that it wanders harmlessly back behind the wicket
defends a good length ball right under his eyes. Excellent discipline.
"<b>breathtaking hit</b>! He's been quite restrained today. That's been his motto to survive on a tough pitch. But here, the moment he gets a short ball, he throws caution to the wind and even though there are two men in the deep at square leg and fine leg, he pulls and pulls right into the gap."
another bouncer. He's too good at it. He spots it early. He loads up the pull. Once again he doesn't care about the fielders because he clears them easy. That's the short boundary which makes this very clever batting. He's earned this little spree with all those leaves.
"back of a length and outside off, ignores it"
"back of a length and outside off stump, lets it go like a bad memory"
"pitches it up on off stump, Williamson is forward as he slides the ball to gully"

"another short ball, but Williamson can see it early, it's also sliding down leg so letting it go is quite easy"
sweetly done. He sees another short one. He sees an opportunity. Gets across his stumps so that he can ever so gently glance it to the fine leg boundary.<b>Minimalist beauty.</b>

"lovely length, making Williamson just a touch nervous, as he blocks in front of off stump. The ball bounces by his feet and goes to slip"
too wide outside off. West Indies haven't been able to string an over of good balls together. They'll be sorely disappointed with that
"there, keep going full, keep targeting the stumps. Williamson is able to defend well. But perhaps there will be some movement, some strangeness, and he might not be so lucky next time"

"back of a length and outside off, Williamson is happy to see it pass"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> but looks like there might be an inside edge.

Well, almost. He does still get a nick onto his pad"
"good length ball outside off, no shot"
goes wide of the crease to angle a fuller ball into Williamson's middle stump. He turns it over to midwicket
"<b>suh-weeeeet</b>! He got tangled up thanks to a full delivery not too long ago. Roach is searching for it. Looking to produce the same false shot. But Williamson isn't in that frame of mind anymore. He's forgotten about it. He sees this as an opportunity for runs, shifts his weight forward into a glorious drive and finds four past mid-off"
"back of a length and outside off, ignores it"
"<b>appeal from first slip</b> (Darren Bravo) and no one else for caught behind. Latham will be mortified that he went after such a wide delivery. Either that or that he's not cut a long hop to the boundary. <b>The only thing is, there was a noise as ball passed bat and ultra edge confirms there was a nick</b>. Wow! West Indies!"

"back of a length outside off, chopped to point. He has been leaving these balls, but perhaps looking to open out now"
"fuller on a fourth stump line, pushed to cover on the front foot"
nicely behind it to offer a straight bat to mid-on to this fuller one on the stumps. Swung into him
"well outside off and angling away, left alone"
"back of a length outside off, punched forcefully but straight to point"
"fuller outside off, leans forward to drive, but doesn't time it. Rolls to cover"
"back of a length angling into him, moves across and punches to mid-on"
"bouncer, dug in very short so he saw it coming and ducked under"
"<b>sharp bouncer</b>, and Dowrich had to dive to his left as it kept going away from him. Got two gloves to it but couldn't stop it cleanly. Delivered from wide of the crease and targetting Williamson's head, who arched out of the way"
"another short ball, Gabriel working up a bit of steam. Latham has to go on his tip toes and defend it from in front of his throat"
"another short one, skidded on to him quickly and he had to jab it down hurriedly. Took the outside half of the bat as it was coming down to bounce towards gully"
short enough for him to rock back and punch through cover and raise his <b>33rd Test fifty</b>. Entirely fuss free. I know he spent a long time on 49 but it didn't <em>feel</em> like it.
"too short outside off, and given room, allows Latham to latch on to it and cut it through point crisply"
"not as short but still short and wide enough for him to cut away, but Roach at point manages to tumble to his right and make the save"
"tossed up on the stumps, comes on the front foot to defend."
"good length on the stumps, angling into him, comes to the pitch with a stride to defend"
too full outside off and he goes down to lap it behind square with a deft touch
"<b>dropped by Dowrich</b>. or was it? Maybe it just swung late. Good ball by Gabriel, pitched back of a length and was going away from Latham who followed it with his hands. Millimetres from the outside edge and going further away. Dowrich gets both gloves to it diving to his left but spills it. Luckily ultra edge shows no spike, so <b>it's not a drop</b>. But not a clean collection"
"length outside off, pushed to point"
"length on the pads, and glanced fine with minimum fuss to get a boundary. He's so adept at these deflections that get maximum effect"
"bouncer on leg, too short to trouble him, ducks under"
"back of a length on off, tapped towards point and he's thinking about the quick single, but they decide against it"
"length down leg side, he was looking to glance it fine but doesn't connect. Uh oh, Gabriel has overstepped again. Another no-ball"
"another one down leg, tries to move across to flick it fine again, but it takes the pad on the way to the keeper"
"length outside off, cut to cover"
"tossed up on the stumps, comes on the front foot and works it to square leg"
"back of a length outside off, stays back and punches through cover"
"strays down leg, and Dowrich does well to move to his left and gather"
"good length outside off, defended into the offside"
"<b>elegance</b>. Makes a bit of room and late cuts this length ball through backward point. Not that bad a ball, but some width and some space, and he's able to put it away"
"back of a length going across him, keeps moving while it's past the batsman and another fumbled take by Dowrich moving to his left"
"length on the pads, clipped nicely but straight to short leg. Another no-ball from Gabriel."
"<b>run out chance missed at the striker's end</b>. Good back of length ball rising awkwardly to his midriff, tucked down to short leg, who fumbles. Latham sets off for a run but is sent back. He's miles out but short leg - Shamarh Brooks - misses with his shy at the stumps"
<b>edge flies for four</b>. Back of a length going across him but very close to his body. Latham was looking to leave it but was late to lift his bat and get it out of the way. The ball was close enough to body that it pings off the bottom edge  even as he's lifting the bat up and flies over the slips
"length on the stumps, pushed into the offside"
"short ball at the ribs again on leg stump, but negotiated well, stays still and taps it down into the legside"
"length on the pads, easily tucked to fine leg"
"tossed up, he's skipped down the track and pushed it to mid-off"
"tossed up again, but fuller, clipped to long-off"
"<b>masterly</b>. Kane is a magician with bat and hands. Slightly short, not all that wide, but he's perfectly balanced as he essays a delicate cut through point"
tapped back down the pitch
"<b>disdainful</b> now. Dances down the track, gets to the pitch and flicks it to the deep midwicket boundary. Not much turn on this pitch, so he's safe in venturing down the track"
"tossed up, ends up as a full toss outside off, he mis-times his punch to mid-off"
"back of a length on off, and seaming away, left alone"
"<b>through him</b>. That was a good ball, Pitched on a fullish length from around the wicket, and it moves just a touch as Latham is coming forward to defend, nicks his inside edge and crashes into the stumps. Roach sinks to his knees and looks at the pitch, perhaps in remembrance of his father."
"<b>top edged four straightaway</b>. Too close to his body to cut, but he goes for it and it flies off the top edge over the slip cordon"
"length outside off, seaming in, he leaves it alone"
"well outside off, lets it go comfortably"
"full ball tailing into him, he jams his bat down in time to squirt it to square leg"
back of a length and too far outside off stump to draw Williamson into a shot
outstanding delivery. He pitches it up. It's angled into off stump. Maybe a shade outside. Williamson plants his front leg across to cover his sticks and then lets go outside his eyeline
goes back to his usual shortish length and it's easy for Williamson to ignore it
nudges a full ball on middle into the midwicket region
taps a shortish delivery off his hips to the left of square leg
"full on off stump, defends"
"sharp movement into the right-hander! And it even prompts a change in shot. Williamson is set up for the cut, but with the red ball veering so far, he has to be more circumspect"
"back of a length and a considerable distance outside off. Williamson lets go, switches off and gets ready for the next challenge"
<b>gorgeous cover drive</b>. It's a cheat-code ball. The half-volley with plenty of room. But his putaway is so regal that it makes you forget that the bowler's made a mistake. It makes you think Williamson has performed magic
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
<b>that's a peach!</b> The angle in makes him play. The movement away leaves him behind. If only West Indies had camped in this spot in the afternoon.
"falls over as he tries to deal with a ball angled into him, quite sharply, and swings away, quite late. Having originally wanted to flick it through midwicket, he realises the danger he's in and is forced to square himself up and play straighter. Gets a leading edge to gully"
pushes into the covers
"ooooh, West Indies. Why? You've been piling on the pressure. Now there's been a half-volley last over. And another one now. To a new batsman, which is worse. Taylor punches it down the ground and gets a gift of a boundary"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"<b>beats him</b> with a lovely ball, just back of a length, angled into Taylor. He's squared up as he tries to defend and the ball straightens past the edge."
"sliding down leg - what a follow up - and Taylor is able to whip it away to fine leg. Six balls in the same spot, around fourth stump. West Indies just haven't done that."
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"appeal for lbw, presuming it hit pad before bat. The umpire isn't interested. So Williamson will get his single after a flick to deep square leg. Not before a run-out scare though, which is par for this batting pair"
scythes it through point. A touch too full outside off - it's better erring there on a green pitch - and Taylor and his fast hands send it scurrying away
he gets width. He goes for the cut. It's not entirely controlled. Goes off the edge and through the gap between second slip and gully
goes full and outside off and gets ample inswing. Williamson observes it all as he lets the ball go to the keeper
"<b>ridiculously good bowling</b>. He's just turned Williamson inside out. Roach is spectacular with his ability to get the ball to straighten no matter how steep he angles a ball into a right-hander. That's what he does here, off a good length, and he has the NZ captain totally squared up and beats his outside edge"
blocks a fuller delivery on middle.
attacks the stumps again - while also pitching it up - Taylor defends to cover.
"flashes at a short and not quite so wide one, but Taylor is such a good cutter that it probably doesn't matter (except in this case it did because he's beaten)"
nudges a full ball on middle to the right of mid-on. Holder willing himself to keep bowling full. Good signs
"good length on off stump, defends"
"back of a length and outside off, he lets it go"
taps the short ball on top of the bounce and guides it through point
turns a good length ball on off stump behind square leg
lovely stuff. He's full. He's straight. He has Taylor falling over his front pad as he looks to flick. Could easily have been lbw
strays in line and Taylor needs no second invitation to indulge in his favourite shot - the cut behind point and it is so fierce.
goes for the cut again - and the ball is there for it - but Joseph is able to get some extra bounce and escape punishment
"<b>right through him</b>! Taylor wants to flick a ball outside off stump through wide mid-on, but the ball, though it is steeply angled in, generates away movement in the air and beats him. <b>Special stuff from Joseph</B>"
a touch too legsidish - though once again Holder makes a point to pitch it up - Williamson flicks it behind square leg
determinedly behind a good length ball that straightens on off stump. Williamson looks to be re-setting. Getting more compact in response to West Indies upping their game
"full on off stump, defends"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
rises up with the shortish ball on off stump and guides it to point
"short and outside off, no need to worry about those. <b>Especially with drinks on the field</b>"
"the wide of the crease tactic is certainly catching on. The fact that they're going full and at the stumps is also helping. Joseph gets a hint of away movement, forcing Taylor to offer a straight bat, even if he doesn't move his feet"
blocks a full ball angled into middle
defends a good length ball looking for the top of off stump
"he's missed out there. Taylor's a genius against short balls. But this one, he's a bit too eager. Goes for the pull. Goes too early and only ends up bunting to mid-on"
"good length, outside off, doesn't play it"
"blocks a shortish ball that straightens on off stump in slightly awkward fashion. Taylor's not really the kind to play close to his body, but that's what he's being forced to do by West Indies keeping their discipline"
"pitches it up on off stump, Williamson welcomes it with soft hands"
blocks a full ball outside off
defends a full ball on off stump
appeal for lbw as Williamson shuffles across and turns a good length ball straying into his pads behind squar leg. Would've gone down leg
blocks a fullish delivery on off stump to mid-on
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"fullish and shaping away just a touch. Williamson only commits to the first line, with the softest hands, which is why the outside edge goes down before it reaches gully"
"back of a length and outside off, doesn't bother with it"
good length and very far outside off stump to even register in Williamson's mind as a thing.

"flirts with a shortish ball outside off and is lucky not to nick off. Joseph, late in the day, is posing serious menace. And he's getting the ball to move almost every time. This one darts away"

"tosses it up outside off, Taylor gets forward to block"
nudges a good length ball to midwicket
drifts down leg.
"<b>outside edge</b> falls short of slip because of Williamson's soft hands. The bowler can only throw his head back in disappointment. He pitched the ball up. He got it to move away. He squared the batsman up and got the false shot. But in the end, he is hit for four"
turns it through square leg
blocks a shortish delivery on off stump.
gets up off his toes to deal with a back of a length ball on middle
"<b>superb bowling</b>! West Indies have somehow discovered something that is making this pitch work for them. Going wide of the crease, they have consistently beaten the outside edge with the ball straightening off the angle. NZ have been lucky this session"

goes back to work the ball on top of the bounce past the left of the newly installed short leg fielder.
"tosses it up on off stump, Williamson drives down the ground"
"it's barely more than a defensive push, but the fielder is pushed to the limit trying to stop it from reaching the cover boundary. Williamson's touch play against spin really is something else"

"drifts down leg and Williamson, as he has done all innings, picks away the bad ball into a gap, this time behind square leg"
"the trigger movement is to shuffle across, then wait for the ball to be right under his eyes before blocking it. Roach concentrating on bowling as full as possible"

"testing delivery again, in line with the stumps, demanding that Taylor play"
strays into the pads and Taylor is able to flick it well enough through midwicket.
sprays it down the leg side
terrible start for Gabriel. He's gifted another hit-me ball on Taylor's pads and he's only too happy to flick it away to the long leg boundary
"<b>appeal for caught behind</b> and the umpires are going to check about whether it's carried. Chris Gaffaney goes for the review, with a <b>soft signal of out</b>. So it all starts with a very full ball - almost a yorker - shade outside the off stump. Taylor is drawn playing at it because of the length. But he doesn't move his feet forward. He gets a clear outside edge. It carries through to the keeper. It is not a bump ball. And West Indies have a wicket in the second over of the day, and equally importantly one over before the new ball becomes available."
"greets him with a low full toss from around the wicket. Nicholls, barely moving his feet, guides it to point"
"good length on off stump, Nicholls tries to block but gets an inside edge onto body"

blocks a back of a length delivery right under his eyes
"fullish on off stump, Williamson is forward with a firm defensive push"
"<b>It's No. 22. It's the number on his back. And it's the number of centuries he now has</b>! Gets there with a trademark, off his toes, punch through point as the bowler errs by going too short. Simple celebration. Then immediately back to work. It's been nine months since he last played Test cricket. You wouldn't have known it the way he's batted."
"a shade short of a length and a good distance outside off, allowing Williamson a lovely sighter"
"<b>outstanding ball</b>. It beats Williamson all ends up. The only good thing he does - which he always does - is not follow it as it straightens off the angle and away from his outside edge. But seriously, a pitched up ball like that, in line with the stumps, that's the kiss of death"
"good length on middle, knocks it down gamely"
solidly behind a full ball on off stump
lets go of a good length ball outside off.
"angled into the left-hander, which he makes use of as he turns it to midwicket"

"fullish delivery outside off, Williamson will not be tempted into playing"

"sweetly hit through square leg. The urge to attack the stumps - the right urge - makes Joseph's line go just a little way off. Even so, Williamson is in perfect position to exploit it, head over the ball, hands close to body, all necessary precautions while closing the face of the bat on a green pitch"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
he goes for the drive - strong hard hands into the shot - but finds mid-on
"gorgeous shot through point, this time off the front foot. See, he is just too good. He knows the new ball will be taken soon enough. He sees a floated delivery so far wide outside off stump and so he leans into a square drive and his timing is absolutely pristine"
drives with an open face and sends a full length delivery on off stump to cover
steps forward and drives a good length ball through cover point again. There's protection there now
"flirts with a shortish delivery outside off - he didn't need to have played it, but he's still new to the crease and those mistakes happen. It's why Latham's innings yesterday was so good. He steadfastly left those."
works a back of a length delivery off his pads behind square leg
"a hint of away movement off the pitch, but Williamson spots it, opens the face for it as he runs it down to second slip. Soft hands, bat face pointing down, virtually no chance of it going in the air"
he's looking for inswing - he managed that against Latham yesterday - and he's not far off here against Nicholls. Has him playing around his front pad as he flicks to midwicket
defends a pitched up ball on middle and off stump
"blocks a good length ball outside off, but without his front leg going across to cover the line, it looks like he's playing away from his body."

"back of a length and outside off, no interest from Williamson"
"shortish on off stump, defends"
"<b>glorious drive</b>! Through extra cover this time. And it's just a push. It's pretty much a block. Except, on point of contact, he probably abandons his favourite soft-hand technique and adds a little power with the bottom one."
"glides a shortish ball into the cordon, and he's able to do that because he makes certain to play ever so close to his body"

"oh yes, he's getting into his innings now. The feet are moving. First across his crease. Then nice and forward to a good length ball on off stump. Solid defence"
"<b>excellent rebound catch</b>! Just as Nicholls was getting some confidence, he's gone. He's been sucked into the sucker ball. Full. Wide. So very inviting. The left-hander goes full throttle after it and gets a very thick edge. It flies to second slip. Holder's there, reaching both hands up and to the right of him. He doesn't get it on the first, but he's good with the second."
"turns a good length ball on middle and leg behind square leg, quite awkwardly at that"
"huge appeal for lbw as he goes full and gets sharp swing into Williamson. The right-hander is looking to nudge it through square leg, but the movement is too much for him. Too much to hit the stumps too"

lovely start. It's full. It's looking for the drive. Williamson will not be so easily tempted
a touch too wide of off stump to even make Williamson think about playing
"a touch too straight, definitely too short, and Williamson, clever player that he is, just scootches across his crease to play a beautiful little leg glance."
"good length, outside off, no shot"
<b>review for lbw as Williamson leaves</b>. He's leaving a good length ball that nibbles in just a touch to strike him on the knee-roll. Williamson did not expect that. Umpire Wayne Knights says it is not coming back in far enough to hit the stumps and HawkEye agrees.

"gorgeous way to get off the mark! Much like Williamson, Blundell too lets the ball come to him, and he doesn't overhit. Outstanding technique to result in a classy on drive."

"back of a length outside off, punched to cover on the back foot"
"jags in sharply but is bowled on a sixth stump line, so he's comfortable enough leaving"
"<b>leading edge drops short of cover</b>. Blundell was late on the shot, pushed back very deep in his crease to a back of length ball that's darting in, tries to whip it, but gets a leading edge. Pops up but drops down short of the fielder"
<b>that's a tight leave</b>. Length outside off and seaming in sharply. I don't think he expected it to cut back so much. Just about misses off stump. Roach is on his knees in disbelief

"fuller outside off, Williamson was drawn into poking at it, and it goes past. He withdrew the bat almost as soon as he played that shot, but it's a minor victory for Roach in drawing an error"

"loses his line, strays well down legside, too far away for Williamson to flick"

"<b>big shout</b> but not given. Holder's asking his fielders if Blundell hit it, and they say no, so he goes for the review. This could be close. Length ball seams into him from outside off, Blundell's completely beaten on the inside edge, playing down the wrong line. Struck on the knee roll, but  <b>it's bouncing over the stumps</b>.

"<b>pins him lbw</b>! But it looks like Blundell is going to review. This is a fast, straight, skiddy delivery. And the batsman, who has a penchant to want to hit everything into the leg side, is caught across his stumps, looking to hit across both his pads. He's beaten for pace. He's hit just in line with the knee-roll. HawkEye says it will clang into leg stump. Umpire Gaffaney's on-field decision stands."

"excellent shot, past the right of mid-on. He tried to play a similar one last ball and got done in. But that's the last ball. He's put that out of his mind. This one is coming into his pads. The right shot to play is the flick. So he goes for it and he benefits this time. <b>Sublime batting</b>"

"oh well, I'll just do it second ball says Kane Williamson, unfurling another cover drive, opening the bat face a bit more to go wider of the cover fielder. <b>third double century for him</b>. What a magnificent innings it has been. He's come off two months of intense 20-overs cricket and batted in this game as if he's been playing Test cricket once a week for the past 9 months."

"low full toss outside off, carved square"
"length well outside off, left alone"
"<b>caught at second slip</b>. Roach deserved that wicket. He's bowled well without much reward. Pitches this on a length on off, Mitchell is sitting back, he's trying to Kane the ball - play with soft hands and play it late - but the movement that Roach gets away from the right-hander means it snaffles the edge and goes straight to Holder."

"<b>past Holder at first slip</b>. Rare false shot from Kane, and you have to latch on to those but this was tough. Wide outside off, and he slashes at it with feet not moving, gets a top edge. Holder has his considerably long arm stretched out to his left over his head but the ball goes millimetres from his fingertips. He's standing quite a bit away from the keeper - could he have got it if he was at a more traditional first slip?"
<b>applaud</b> because that's what you should do to a shot like that. Full on the stumps and he uses wrist power to flick this very straight and bullet speed past the bowler

"<b>drama, unbelievable drama. He's got Williamson nicking behind but he's overstepped</b>. The celebrations turn to disbelief in an instant. Roach has only himself to blame. This was not close enough to cut, but Williamson is in a mood to attack and goes for it. Gets a clear edge to the keeper. Roach and West Indies are ecstatic. And then comes the third umpire's call. Nothing behind the line. Ecstasy turns to despair."

"<b>dispatched</b>. This is even better. It was actually a better short ball from Holder, rising up to his throat, but he gets inside the line and swivels to hook it over deep backward square leg. Maybe Holder will be better off not bowling short to a man of Jamieson's height and batting ability?"

"more movement into the left-hander, and this time, since the length is extra full, Campbell has to yank his boot out of the way, make it point towards wide-mid-on, so he can bring down a straight bat. <b>Concentrating hard, and he has to</b>"
"<b>excellent bowling</b>. The length is near perfect. Fuller than good, but not quite drivable. The inswing is also a potential problem. Campbell is managing it by playing late and playing straight."
"<b>oh he's thrown it away</b>! He left 40% of his deliveries. Ian Bishop of commentary suggested more of his West Indian team-mates should follow that template. Well, he himself has ripped it apart. He's thrust his hands at a virtual sucker ball, angled across him this time. It's a total mis-hit. And it's been caught by Williamson running back at extra cover. Excellent instincts from Southee, smothering Campbell with inswing and then darting one outside off to see if he fancied a go. He did. And now he's gone."
"<b>lovely late swing again</b>! They say the danger for the batsmen in Hamilton, far more than the pitch and its colour, is when the ball starts moving in the air. Well it is. Big time. Southee gets it in the off stump corridor. And to Brooks' credit, he's good enough to leave that grenade"
it is so hard to get Brathwaite onto the front foot. That's where he's vulnerable. And he perhaps knows it. Stays back in his crease to even a good length ball on off stump and works it through square leg
"spears one right across the right-hander, who is only too happy to leave"

pitches it up but it's a touch wide outside off to interest the batsman
"<b>he is so so good</b>! Southee is just so so good when he hits rhythm like this. Remember when I kept banging on about how you had to hit the same spot over and over again and be patient? It's not about balls hitting the stumps. Its about being consistent and asking the same questions and waiting for the batsman to run out of answers. Well Brooks has run out of answers. A gorgeous delivery, full in length, close to off stump, demanding that he plays, then snagging the outside edge with ferocious outswing. <b>This is class bowling</b>"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> as Southee continues to jag the ball at will. Now that it's a left-hander out there, it moves into him, taking his inside edge as he tries to defend from the crease. Incredible bowling. Incredible discipline"
"he indulges in the sucker ball early, angling one at good length well past the off stump. Bravo won't be drawn into this battle"
he has to be careful playing around his front pad as Southee bowls full and straight and generates dangerous inswing again.
"he's camped deep in the crease, not quite willing to step forward just yet, even though Southee is teasing him with fuller lengths. Adjusts with those lovely hands and blocks out a ball in line with the stumps"
"<b>they've got rid of the glue in this WI line-up</B>. This is unrelenting bowling. This is ever ball being an event. This one is relatively simple. It is good length - an in-between length, not short or full, which is perfect against a batsman who always camps back. It pitches on leg stump and moves across the right-hander. But Brathwaite, knowing Boult is able to nip those back into him, is drawn into a shot and edges through to the keeper. Slightly tame end to a batsman with a lot more to offer"
<b>rams into the pads</b> with that inswing. And it's late. Chase is falling over a bit as he tries to flick. Probably would have been sliding down leg though
"good length and outside off, drives to mid-off"

"good length ball, pitching on off stump and darting away past the outside edge again as Bravo defends from the crease."
"another lovely ball, pitched up there, asking for the drive outside off. Bravo negotiates it very well too, his front foot moving across and then the bat coming nowhere close to the ball"
shifts across his stumps to block out a good length ball that hits leg stump and nips away.
"shortish on off stump, defends capably"
"knocks him out lbw <b>but Bravo reviews</b>. Oh, this whole over was built for this ball. Southee has been generating prodigious inswing. And it looks like it might actually go against him this time. Might be too much swing, taking the ball down leg. <b>Yep, HawkEye agrees, showing wickets missing</b> and umpire Knights has to reverse his decision. Bravo, covering all three stumps and often stuck in his crease, not wanting to press forward, is an lbw candidate. Southee manages to get it full enough, he gets it to nip past the inside edge, it looked close, but not close enough"

"good length outside off drags him forward as he tries to block. This one might just have held in the pitch, making him skew his shot to midwicket"
"now it's Boult's turn to search for the lbw, going full and straight and getting inswing. But Chase is able to pull his front leg back and present the full face of his bat. <b>Lovely stuff.</b>"
kisses the pad as Bravo looks for the leg glance and runs away for four leg byes to fine leg
"sweet little drive, through the covers. He's in perfect control of the shot, a consequence of his moving the front leg across to get closer to a full ball outside off. That makes sure he's right on top of it on impact."

"digs it in outside off, Bravo drops his wrists. Good technique"
"<b>oooh, indecision!</b>. First wants to play. Then wants to leave. And in the end a good length ball shaping away from him thuds into his bat and wanders away towards the slips"

"<b>how do you play that?!</b> Honestly?!

"fluent little cover drive from Chase, the front foot getting nice and forward in response to a full ball outside off."
"<b>wide of the crease just works the treat</b>. He's searching for the edge. It might just be a matter of time. But for now, Chase is surviving. He keeps coming forward, hopeful of putting bat to ball. He has to, because the angle is onto off stump. But try as he might, the away swing is too much"
"full and outside off, Chase leaves well."

"shortish and angled across the right-hander, Chase wants nothing to do with it"
<b>yorker on middle and off stump</b>. Keeps it out

"back of a length and outside off, no shot again. Excellent discipline from Bravo"
"<b>new challenge for Bravo</b>. He's survived Southee's inswing. He's been good against Boult. Now he has to deal with scary bounce from Jamieson. This is just a back of a length ball, the kind that he routinely flicks through midiwcket, but as he tries to do it, it rears up at him and strikes his glove"
"shortish and angled across, Bravo leaves well"
"<b>absolute ripper</b>. Jamieson is a ridiculous bowler to face. Especially when you've already been knocked on the glove. The very obviously extra bounce threat plays on the batsman's mind. It tailors his game. It colours his game. And Jamieson always exploits it. He is 6'8' tall and he bowls one of the most devastating fuller deliveries in this New Zealand attack. Here's another one. Bravo does not expect it. He does not see it coming. He's late on the shot. He's panicking. He's lost his shape. He's falling over. And the inswing allows the ball, pitching on off stump, to straighten just enough to hit target. <b>New Zealand relentless, but they do have to stop for drinks</b>"
"<b>huge appeal</b> and it's denied but Kane is going up for a review. Wagner seemed bemused that wasn't given, short discussion between Williamson and him on whether the batsman hit that. They decide he hasn't, so want to review. And it looks like pad first. This could be mighty close. <b>And it's out</b>. Good length on middle and it straightens into Chase, who is playing outside the line. Hits the front pad first, and that is dead in line. Bat was close to pad, which might have made the umpire think it was bat first."
"another one that's nipping into the batsman. Wagner, the short ball master, is keeping it up and swinging it in to the right-hander. How do you deal with it as a batsman? This one was going down leg so the appeal is only half-hearted"

"<b>how good is that!</b> The off stump is in real danger. No one really understands how it's still standing. Boult has produced a jaffa here. It starts by swinging into the right-hander.

"good length, outside off, no shot"
"<b.he just couldn't help himself, could he?</b>. Blackwood is a sublime hitter over the off side... in conditions where the ball doesn't move laterally. It's a strength. It's a bulwark of his game. It's how he gets his runs. So the second he sees a full and wide delivery outside off, he throws his hands at it, and only gets a thick outside edge to second slip. Poor decision making."
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
goes wide of the crease and presents a good length ball that nips away late. Joseph is careful not to be sucked into the trap
"<b>taken at third slip this time</b>! The wide of the crease trick works. It does more often than not with Southee, who has been unplayable today. If you're a right-hander, you're just waiting to be put out of your misery. Joseph here, as well as he tried to avoid the trap, can't help but get sucked into it. Why? Because the ball is straight. He knows he has to play it. But the ball is also swinging and it takes his outside edge and goes low to Mitchell, who picks up a fine catch"
"back of a length and outside off, Holder is squared up as he tries to block, it seems as if he's worried about Boult's inswing. Outside edge falls short of the cordon"
looks for the pull - he kind has to because the short balls are the only ones that seem harmless - but he doesn't connect

"goes for the pull shot with the ball slanting into him, but he doesn't connect quite as well as he'd like. Poor Holder. He probably thinks everything is going against his team in this Test, apart from the toss"
<b>so so good</B>. The consistency of line - around the off stump - the swing away - and how late it is - all combine to make sure Holder's defensive press is useless

"angled into the right-hander, who is able to flick it through midwicket"

"<b>the Jamieson fuller ball strikes again</b>! No one seems ready for it. Roach is stuck in the crease. He should be coming forward when the ball is in that 4m area. But since he isn't, his hands are leading the body, which creates a gap between bat and pad and then poof goes the off stump"

"back of a length and skiddy, holds its line and pings Gabriel on the back leg. Might just have been too high to be lbw"

"<b>dropped</b> by Santner running to his left at long leg. The Wagner short ball gets a poorly controlled hook shot in response. Holder is dragging the ball from high over his right shoulder. That's never good. It goes up. It's catchable. And though Santner is a good fielder, and he puts in a big dive, it doesn't come off"
"<b>traps him lbw</b> but Gabriel, after consulting with Holder, has decided to review. This is very full. It pings the back pad in line with off stump. Gabriel, on the drive, doesn't get any bat on it and HawkEye says it's umpire's call on hitting. So umpire Gaffaney's on-field call stands and West Indies are done. Dowrich will not bat because of his hand injury"

"<b>caught at second slip</b> but there's some doubt about it being clean. Soft signal is out. beauty of  a delivery, over the wicket angling into him, forces him to play. Pitches and moves away to take the edge. It's touch and go whether Tom Latham at second slip has caught it. But given that the soft signal is out, you'd think the benefit goes to the bowler. He seems to have his hands clasped around the ball with fingers splayed out, but the images make it impossible to judge whether the ball was grounded or not. Plus there's the danger of viewing 3D images in 2D screens, they don't always render well. And the third umpire concludes he doesn't have enough to overturn the decision, so New Zealand have their first wicket."

"<b>edged to second slip</b> Probably didn't need to play at that, but Bravo has been looking to be more positive in this innings. Length ball in the channel, poked at it but with feet not moving. Southee at second slip moves to his left and tumbles while holding on to a smart catch."
"fuller going across him, left alone"
"full ball, was looking to trap him lbw, but it's turned into a half volley that he flicks off his pads to deep square leg"
"bumper on middle stump, he crouches under it"
"<b>caught at square leg</b>. He's not going to be happy with that dismissal. Full ball on the pads, and he goes back to flick it off his pads with good timing. Didn't bother to keep it down though and Conway - subbing for Boult - at square leg, jumps up and holds it with both hands. Brooks won't be wanting to watch that on the replay. Double-wicket over for Wagner."
"<b>and another one goes</b>. This is carnage. Brathwaite has lost his concentration with the rush of wickets. Short ball outside off, rising up and he tried an uncharacteristic ramp/slash at it. Gets the top edge for an easy catch to the keeper."

"huuuuuuuuge appeal for caught behind, the umpire gives it, but <b>Blackwood reviews immediately</b>. Lots of excitement from the NZ fielders after they watch a scorching short ball from Wagner, not the kind that balloons over the batsman, but the one that comes for his chest and neck area. Blackwood gets down on one knee to try and evade it, and evade it he does. Replays show the ball touched nothing as it went through to the keeper and so umpire Knights will have to overturn his decision"

"huuuuge appeal for lbw and it's been given but <b>Chase wants to review</b>. Ferocious inswing from Jamieson. The broadcast said he had developed this ball only this season. How is he able to get so much movement then?! It starts way outside off stump. Chase is prepared to drive it through mid-off until the ball careens into his pads. He is trying to get them out of the way so he can bring the bat down on it. He knows <b>this is a killer delivery</b>.

"climbing up towards his chest, on and around off stump, Blackwood tries to punch past the bowler's right and get off strike"

"back of a length on off stump, works it down to long leg"
"<b>dropped by first slip</b>. It's a real tough one. A full blooded cut shot coming at him and demanding that he leaps high in the air. Taylor does all that and even gets a strong right hand to it to parry the ball up, but it is also parried behind him and no one has a chance to get the rebound"

"<b>well directed bumper this time</b> and because of that, Blackwood simply crumples his body under it and gets out of its way. To class batting"
"shortish on off stump, blocks it to the bowler. Wagner, a very pumped up Wagner, threatens to throw down the batsman's stumps."
"oooh, he makes him hop. And this bouncer really would have brought short leg into play if not for the fact Blackwood gets on top of it and uses soft hands to blunt it"
"pulls powerfully to the midwicket boundary.. Yep, this is new for Wagner. He's faced a lot of batsmen who have tried to take on his short ball. But here he's got one who's not only doing that, he's also keeping the good ones out"

"<b>dropped by point</b> diving to his left. It's Young over there. He's fairly close but he has the time to see it clearly into his hands. He even gets two of them to it but just isn't able to hold on. Full ball, outside off, draws him into the drive even as he's still only coming forward. The lack of balance is why it goes up in the air but NZ can't capitalise"

"<b>he's given it away</b>. He's slumped on his bat and he knows he's given it away. Gets sucked into the drivable ball from a bowler who's only meant to give the frontliners a bit of a breather. Instead, he has the No. 1 allrounder in the world caught at cover. <b>There's a check for no-ball though and it is a no-ball</b>. Holder's been out twice to a no-ball in the same day"
whips a back of a length ball on middle through midwicket
"<b>has he got him? Well we have to wait for the review</b>. Holder goes for it straight away after trying to loft a good length ball on off stump over midwicket. It's the kind of shot you only play against the change bowler. You don't care it's good length. You don't care it's in line with the stumps. You just slog. Replays show he does not get any bat on it. Ball-tracking says umpire's call on hitting the stumps. Holder is gone, after getting two no-ball reprieves and being dropped twice in two balls. Mitchell's first Test wicket as well."

"<b>Jamieson can't reach the ball running back from mid-on</b>. Strange period of play for New Zealand. This was a proper miscue by Blackwood who spliced it up in the air while intending to to over extra cover.

"back of a length on off, jabbed towards square leg, was almost falling over while playing the shot because he was moving across"
<b>gorgeous shot</b>. Full on off and he leans into the off-drive and beats extra cover to his right comfortably. Super shot.

"fuller on off, he's been very sure in his front foot defence there and blocks it again"
"<b>valiant attempt by Young at deep point</b> but that's past him. Fuller outside off and Joseph throws his hands at it again, gets it off the top edge to the fielder there, and Young dives to his left full length, he doesn't have much time to react to it, still gets hands on it, but can't hold on.

"<b>almost fended to silly point</b>. Banged in short on off, and he's hopping on the back foot, can't get bat high enough and it hits the splice to pop up. Just out of reach to silly point's left"
"back of a length angling across on off, he keeps bat close to body and steers to point"
"another bouncer, over leg stump, he ducks under"
"almost a yorker on leg stump, stays calm and flicks it to midwicket"
"in the channel outside off, but even though he's been a bit troubled by the short stuff, he's not scrambled enough to not know where his off stump is. Lets it go"
"bouncer over leg stump, ducks under"
"full ball tailing into him from around the wicket, and he goes for the big drive, but inside edges to pad and rolls to point"

"fuller on the stumps, punched to short midwicket"
"fullish around off, shaping away from him, pushed to mid-off"
"tight leave outside off, but safe. Bowled on the fourth stump and holds its line"

"fuller on off, coming into him now, nudged through midwicket"
"fuller on off, hint of shape away, steered towards point"
"a bit wider of the crease and a full ball outside off, defended"
"another full ball on off, driven on the front foot, bounces into the ground and over the bowler's head. Williamson at mid-off cuts it off"
"wider of the crease and bowled full on off again, defended"
"good work by Will Young at deep square leg. Length ball on the pads that is tucked square off his pads. Young runs to his right, dives and stops the ball"
"length ball outside off, steered to point"
"slightly back of a length going across him to end on off stump, he goes back and opens the face to steer towards point"

"<b>lovely shot</b>. First boundary of the morning. Full outside off, great use of the wrists to drive through point"
"length on off, defended back down the pitch"
"<b>dropped at second slip</b> That's a dolly. New Zealand's catching woes continue. Lovely from Southee, who has kept it in the channel and gets this one to move away. Blackwood goes for the punch, gets a healthy edge that goes at comfortable height to Taylor. Inexplicably, he shells it."
"fuller on the stumps, defended back down the pitch"
"bouncer on leg stump, ducks under"

"back of a length on off, defended on the back foot down the pitch"
"shaping into him, on a length outside off, left alone"

"good length in the channel, left alone."
"in the air, but lands short of mid-off. Was hanging on the back foot, and this was full on off, he drove from that position, got it on the toe end of the bat. Hangs in the air, but lands safe"
"length on the stumps, punched to midwicket"
"length on off, defended"
"full angling into him, defended"

"back of a length on off, punched through cover on the back foot"
"<b>boom</b>. That is a mighty thump. He might have shown some vulnerability to the short ball, but it has to be well targetted. This one sat up, and he rocked back to pull it over midwicket"
"length on the stumps, defended"
"length outside off, turned through midwicket on the back foot"
"good length in the channel, lets it go through"
"good leave, that one was closer to off, and shaping away a tad, but he's clearly sure of where his off stump is, and lets it go through"
"goes wider of the crease and tries to bowl at the stumps, ends up on the pads, flicked to fine leg. Boult sprints to his right and dives to flick it back with one hand and save the boundary. Superbly done."

"shaping away appreciably but from a fullish line on fifth stump, and left alone"

"length on the pads, flicked to deep square leg"
"length on off, pushed to mid-off with bat close to body"
"yorker on off, dug out to midwicket"

"length outside off, on a fifth stump line, he shoulders arms"
"fuller outside off, punched through point"
full but swinging down leg side. He shapes to flick but it's too far from him

"<b>waft and a miss</b>. Southee hangs this full outside off, tempting him into the drive and he goes for it, but it shapes away and misses the outside edge"
"another one, swings and misses. This is full and very wide outside off. Alzarri goes for a big booming drive at that, but can't connect, it goes just past his bottom edge"
"full on the stumps, punched with a straight face to midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, punched through cover. Goes to 98"

"length ball shaping away from him, inviting him to cover drive but Blackwood shoulders arms"
"length ball outside off, gets it to bounce a bit, but he lets it go again"

"closer to off stump this time, still some shape away, comes on the front foot and drives. But can't beat short cover"
"fuller and closer to off stump, driven again. But again to short cover"
"back of a length outside off, and he punches it towards point, not timed well but there's no fielder so he gets one and moves to 99"
"<b>he's got to his second Test century</b>. Outstanding innings. Full ball on the stumps, he's falling over a bit as he flicks off his toes to midwicket. Quick single but safe one and he's pumped."

"back of a length outside off, and he stays legside of it and steers through backward point"
"length ball coming in from outside off, defended carefully to cover"
back of a length outside off and punched through point.
"back of a length outside off, and he lets it go"
ducks under a short ball on middle and off
"<b>mis-hit</b> pull shot. He's been very good at picking those up, but this is a Wagner short ball. It's on him too quickly. It's at chest high. It gets a top edge but doesn't carry through to backward square leg"
"short and on leg stump, doesn't need to play"
shifts across his stumps as he pulls a short ball down leg stump to long leg.
"bouncer down leg, he gets out of the way"
"half a pull shot, virtually nothing more than him protecting his body from being hit by the bouncer. That's why there's no power in the shot as he lobs it over short leg, but it doesn't carry to leg gully"
"<b>one-handed effort, but he can't hold on</b>! Joseph clearly has no problems playing his shots even as his hundred looms. This one is an expansive off drive that goes to the left of mid-off. Kane Williamson is there, racing towards the ball, he's never gonna get there, he dives, wanting to put two hands to it, but then he realises he has to stretch so he goes one-handed - his strong hand, the left hand - and somehow gets his fingertips to it"
<b>taken at deep point</b>! His strokeplay has been stunning. His drives fluent. His pulls downright dominant. But here he goes after a full and wide delivery and gets pretty much the bottom of the bat on it. Santner runs up off the boundary and takes a simple catch. That's the end of a special innings and a partnership that will give West Indies momentum going into the next Test
dabs a shortish delivery outside off to the sweeper
"full on middle, he pushes to mid-on"
"outside edge doesn't carry to third slip. It's that fuller length from Jamieson again, causing problems"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"<b>taken at square leg</b>! The Wagner short ball finally takes down the man it was after for all innings. It's too close to his body. It doesn't give him the room to free the arms and add power into the pull shot. It also hits the bat very high and as a result Blackwood only picks out backward square leg. Still, a beautiful counterattacking hundred and Hamilton stands up to applaud his effort."
"looks for the yorker this time, but it slides down leg"
"bouncer on middle and off, Gabriel gets out of the way"
short and skiddy. Gabriel swivels on his back foot to try and work it behind square leg. Looks very awkward doing so
middle stump out of the ground. <b>New Zealand win by an innings and 134 runs</b>. Gabriel loads up a big swing down the ground. He misses. Wagner hits
