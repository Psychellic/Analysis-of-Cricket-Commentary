"hints of swing back in from length on middle, deflects off the thigh pad to square leg. Beaten for pace first up"
"skiddly length ball on middle, this one nips back in, tucked to midwicket. 136kph"
risky single. Tapped to Jadhav at square leg as they scampered through. Direct hit wouldn't have mattered as Lewis was just in. The fielder was slightly late to move to his right that time
hops back and across to punch the length ball on middle to mid-on
uses the depth of the crease to bunt this one to the short cover region
"short of length down leg, helped to fine leg. Didn't get hold of it as much as he would've liked."
"shapes to cut, no timing whatsoever. Chopped to the man coming in from point as they scamper through"
"poor ball. Errs in line this time. Slides a short of length delivery down leg, Hope tickles it fine. No chance for fine leg. Got enough bat on it. Easy pickings"
"too short outside off, he rocks back and frees his arms to flay this behind point. Dinesh Karthik with a sliding stop at square third man. Full-length dive across the turf"
risky. Hops across to whip this to square leg. This one kept a touch low. Would've been plumb in front had he missed it
sprays this way outside off at length. Perhaps slipped out of his hand. Stiff breeze across the ground may have played its part

angles a back of length delivery across the left-hander who defends firmly off the backfoot

"this one nipped away late, Hope looked to work it to the leg side but got it on the outer half of the bat as it rolled to cover"
"delightful timing, even better placement. The outfield may be slow but it would've needed a superhuman effort from the cover fielder to pull it back in. Once again, too short from Umesh. He just punched that away, nice, high elbow when he made contact"

bunts a length ball outside off to Jadeja at point
"picks the length early, punched away but straight to Jadhav at cover point"
"length and just outside off, punched to mid-off"
what a tame dismissal. Looking to hit this length ball over mid-off but there's no power behind that whatsoever. Got it off the top part of the bat as it lobbed to Kohli. As easy as they come. Lewis has wasted an opportunity on a batting belter.
"floats this full on off from wide of the crease, solidly defended"
"<b> nearly chopped on! </b> Poking at a length delivery outside the line, gets a thick inside-edge onto the pad"

"back of length delivery outside off, not much deviation off the deck, left alone"
dabbed wide of Dhawan at slip as they scamper across for a single
cracking stroke! Picked the length early and forced this into the gap between cover and point. Off the backfoot. Crunching sound as bat met ball
"this is a juicy half-volley, Kyle Hope presents the full face of the bat as he plays this bullet drive past mid-off. Delightful"
"<b> snorter. </b> Plenty of effort. Speed gun just clocks 134kph but it troubled him. Good technique by Shai, who drops his gloves and ways out of the way"
Jadhav once again a little slow to come in from deep square leg. This was no more than a gentle whip towards the leg side. Excellent running. The throw was a touch wayward too.

pulled imperiously in front of square. One bounce into the midwicket boundary. Fetched it from outside off. Umesh's having a shocker today
"drifts in a length ball on middle, turned to midwicket"
"picks out Dhawan at midwicket. This wasn't all that short, he'd premeditated the pull, went through with it off the frontfoot and hit it straight into the hands of him there. Start wasted. Not the kind of delivery that deserved a wicket but Umesh will take it."
"and he's gone first ball! Unless his review overturns Leslie Reifer's on-field verdict. Full and straight right up, with a little bit of late inswing. He plays across the line, around his front pad. Ball is full enough to sneak under his bat. Impact around middle and leg, and he barely took a stride forward, so it's no surprise that ball-tracking says it's crashing into a good chunk of leg stump"

"flighted on off stump, a touch too full, driven to the left of long-off. We have a run-out appeal here. Umesh, firstly, does very well to sprint around, stop with his boot, and throw at the far end, the keeper's end. Wow, what seemed like a comfortable two ends up as a very tight one for Mohammed, who just beats Dhoni clipping the bails off with a desperate dive"

"gone! Kedar Jadhav keeps getting wickets with utter filth, because sometimes utter filth is utterly difficult to combat. This is a shortish ball, not a long-hop, just short enough to provoke the batsman to rock back and look to slap it away into the covers.

"length ball, angling down leg. Rahane misses the flick and it hits his thigh pad"

Kohli wants two right from the start, Karthik is a little slow to respond. He just about makes it at the bowler's end before the bails go off"
"a lovely way to bring up his 28th ODI hundred. A bit of a gift from Williams, overpitched on middle stump, and he simply leans into the ball and clips it between mid-on and midwicket. Big, angry roar after he takes off his helmet, as always"
