"fuller, at the stumps, clubbed to mid-on. Doesn't seem very easy to time it"
"another short ball, 140kph, good wheels, and Lynn can't make connection with the pull, it just bobbles to the leg side off glove"

"superb running! Gentle nudge into the leg side, deep midwicket had to come in a long way by which time Rana had made it"
"<strong>holed out to long-on</strong> and Tahir is on a celebratory run, like he does always. Right intent, wrong execution. This one dipped on him a touch and spun a touch extra to take the inside half of the bat. Easy catch."
works this down to long-on for an easy single
"<strong>Faf, you absolute ripper! What a magical catch.</strong> Uthappa doesn't read the legbreak properly, looks to go straighter but this turns to take the leading edge. Went high, really high, and Faf had to run it a good 20-25 yards from the long-off fence. Having done all the hard work, he then realised this will dip on him and so he puts in a full-stretch dive and gets his fingers completely underneath the ball as it descends. Stunning, absolutely stunning."

"slower length ball, punched to extra cover at the edge of the ring"
"shaped to flat-bat this over the bowler's head, but ended up bunting it into the off side"
"<strong>hit on the helmet</strong>, lobs wide of point. DK was through with the pull even before the ball arrived."
"<strong>pulled into the stands at fine leg!</strong> Too short, slipping down leg and that's like giving Lynn some <em>rosogullas.</em> All he had to do was use the pace. Much-needed for KKR"

gentle bunt into the covers
"steps out to loft but yorked himself as Santner fired it in, squeezed wide of midwicket"

"makes room again, this time Jadeja looks to fire it into the body but drops short again, Lynn muscles this over deep midwicket. Sensational"
"two short-balls, how about going full thinks Jadeja. It's a good idea, except Lynn knows what's coming. He stays inside the crease, waits for this and drills it over long-on. <strong>Three in a row!</strong>"

"spins away from way outside off, Lynn looks to reach out but leaves. Wide called"
"he's hit this to deep square, where Shardul Thakur takes an excellent catch moving to his right. Lynn went across a touch and then swung acoss the line, didn't quite middle it as well as he would've liked."
"belts the first ball to the deep midwicket boundary. No timing even though he went really hard, looked like it came off a thickish inside edge. No holding back. This is DreRuss time, buckle up"
"defended back, Tahir sprints to his left to stop"
"<strong>gone, fetch that from the High Court!</strong> The long-on fielder was looking away. This was absolutely muscled. Too much flight, Russell gets down on one knee and whacks this against the turn."
"Tahir has his revenge! Russell looks to go big again, the length is a touch shorter so he doesn't quite get the same elevation. Dhruv Shorey the substitute fielder runs in, this is flat mind you, and he has to be mindful of this whacking his face at that pace. But no worries, he still manages to dive fully forward to complete a super catch. The crowd goes quiet."

turns this length delivery down to long-on
"slices high in the air, but only as far as long-off. It's Faf the man again. Excellent change of pace from Shardul, went for a knuckleball that he's been working on for a while. DK doesn't quite get under the length, which means he gets more elevation than distance."

"sliced over cover, down to Jadhav in the deep on the bounce, excellent running"
drilled on the bounce to mid-off
pulled but straight down Jadeja's throat at deep midwicket. Gill looked to clear the biggest boundary at Eden.
"magnificent yorker! Curved in late to scythe through the gap between bat and pad. Dhoni lobs the ball back to Shardul, who effects a run-out at the bowler's end as Kuldeep was nearly at the other end looking for a bye."

"short of a length, steered through point to the sweeper"
"another good delivery, nips back from short of a length, takes du Plessis on the thigh pad"

"goes a touch fuller, but it's back-to-back boundaries as du Plessis dismissively swings across the line off the front foot"
"brilliant batting! Not great bowling. It's short again, this time du Plessis walks across the crease and scoops it over his shoulder to fine leg"

"a slower ball, straight, worked off the stumps down to long leg"
"<B>another lbw, but Raina has reviewed!</b> Over the wicket, good length and straight, takes Raina on the knee roll. Oh, wait! There's an inside edge. Raina did review straightaway. Umpire Tucker smiles and indicates he had no chance of hearing that"

taps a length delivery into point
"goes right back to defend, this one keeps a touch low and Jadhav nearly dragged one back"

drops short and he clobbers this! Rocks back and wallops it between deep midwicket and long-on

He's well outside the line on the forward push, the ball beats the inside edge to hit the pad. Portion of leg stump visible at the point of impact. Ball tracker says this would've smashed leg stump. Excellent decision from umpire Rod Tucker. We criticise umpires when they don't get it right, so you have to give them credit where due."
"spins back in from length on off, defended"

"too short, he whips this to deep backward square leg"
backs away and punches this into the gap at deep cover to bring up the winning runs. <b> Chennai Super Kings consolidate their position at the top. </b> Seventh win in eight games for them. KKR slump to their third straight loss and have a lot of soul-searching to do. They concerns will multiply further as Andre Russell didn't take the field after hobbling off early in the chase.
