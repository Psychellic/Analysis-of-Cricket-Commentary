full inswinger coming towards leg stump. Lynn shuffles around a little before managing to get the bat down to block it
short ball climbing up and into the corridor. Leaps off the ground and runs it straight to short third man
"good length on off stump, punched on the up to cover"
"short of a length just outside off, wafts at it on the up but misses"
"<b>beats the off stump!</b> Lynn exposes the stumps and it looks like he's anticipating the ball to swing into him from an off stump line. Wants to drill it through cover, but this ball goes straight through with the angle"
"full toss outside off, drilled straight to cover. <b>That's a maiden</b>, against Lynn. The first one of the season."
short of a length in the corridor. More lift off the surface than he anticipates as he tries to stab it through the off side. Gets a thick inside edge to dribble through square leg
"<b>beaten</b> on the inside edge. Morris bangs it in again, gets it to nip back off the seam. It's waist height as Lynn backs away to try and swat this behind square."
"short of a length again, cramped at chest height this time. Swats and makes connection this time, but it's straight to midwicket off the inside half of the bat"
"<b>off the mark</b> with a six, but it's not well-timed. Length ball at leg stump and that's what he needs to bring in the slog. Drags it over the midwicket boundary"
beaten again. Length ball jags away from off stump. Lynn gets too far leg side of it and is swishing aimlessly in the end
"short of a length just outside off, mistimed punch on the up, straight to mid-off"
"<b>yorker</b> speared in at middle stump. Narine backs away and tries to squeeze it behind point, but he can only jam it into the leg side"
nicely done. Bouncer at an off stump line. Narine backs away again to try and slice over slip. Well beaten
"<b>Pant lobs it up, slip completes the catch.</b> Is it the second bouncer? The umpires are checking....it's just under the shoulder. We all know the theory. Short ball to Narine. Boult goes with that, cramps him on the hook and gets it to tickle the top edge. Pant leaps up, one-handed, but he can't hold on. Slip has a few yards to cover behind and completes a simple catch"
good length and past the outside edge. Uthappa late on the forward push as this slants away
"short of a length in the corridor, watchfully poked on the up and he gets it out to third man off the thick outside edge"
<b>slap.</b> Lynn gets room outside off and he duly sends it flying over point. Right off the middle this time. Short from Boult but not climbing up enough to cause trouble
length ball pushed in at middle stump from around the wicket. Plants the front leg across and taps it through the open midwicket region
length and skidding in at middle stump. Backs away and pushes to mid-off
dropped marginally short on a leg stump line. He backs away and slaps it through cover
slider at leg stump. Skidding in from a length and gets the inside half of the bat and dribbles past non-striker. He was looking to punch through the off side
"short of a length on leg stump, tapped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
<b>grip off the pitch and a leading edge</b> as Lynn tries to flick through midwicket. Loopy length ball on off stump and he closes the face too early
"good length on leg stump, tapped straight to short midwicket"
<b>beaten</b> as he looks to run this past slip. Length ball in the corridor
"shot. Classic Uthappa. Length ball on middle stump, half a stride across off stump and a clean punch straight over the bowler on the up"
"short of a length just outside off, drops it into the off side with soft hands and steals a run"
<b>inside half</b> but hit well enough to find the long-off boundary. Length ball coming in at off stump. He backs away and hammers it past the bowler
"<b>mis-hit</b>. <i>Again.</i>. It's a full toss on middle and he goes across the line and lifts this in long-on's direction but Morris, running in, can't get there or get his body behind to stop it"
"<b>beats the outside edge</b> with a nicely landed length ball, drifting in at off stump and spinning sharply away"
oh yes. Right off the middle. Nadeem goes flat and on a length at leg stump. It skids through unlike the previous ball and Uthappa hits cleanly through the line to send this far over deep midwicket
"short of a length on leg stump, gets behind the line and taps it to deep midwicket's right. Works hard to come back for the second"
<b>hammers it straight</b> over the bowler's head off the back foot. Incredible shot. Not a lot of pace from the spinner but he gets it to clear the fence easily as he gets behind the line in front of off stump
<b>deft.</b> Nadeem in panic mode. Looks for the arm ball but drops it very short and very wide. Uthappa lets it come on and caresses it past cover point
"good length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
"tossed up at middle stump, allows it to come on and nudges it to deep midwicket from the crease"
"<b>he isn't taking kindly to the demotion!</b> In the mood today, Uthappa. No nudging around - puts a big front foot stride out and meets it as it lands on the pitch to send the slog sweep into orbit"
<b>top edge lands between short third and short fine.</b> Lucky. It's a very slow short ball and he's through the pull too early. Keeper doesn't know where it is as this lifts over his head and the fielders can't reach it
"length on middle, flicked to deep midwicket"
"short of a length, bowled with the front of the hand. Gets on the back foot and punches to long-on"
"googly on a middle stump line, pushed anxiously back down the pitch"
"short of a length outside off, low skidder. Gets on the back foot and drags this to long-on's right"
"short ball outside off, backs away and cuts to sweeper cover"
<b>top edge is taken this time.</b> Looks like Uthappa was late on the slog sweep this time. Nadeem gets some grip from a good length and marginal turn away from off stump. He completes a simple catch too
"short of a length on off stump, backs away and taps to extra cover on the up"
arm ball hurries him as he backs into the leg side. Just manages to chop this to sweeper cover
short of a length and spinning in at off stump. Gets deep in the crease and pushes through midwicket
"short of a length just outside off, opens the face and runs it straight to short third man"
<b>thick outside edge</b> against the googly. Looks to drive this length ball through cover and is reaching out a long way with his hands in the end
"length on off stump, pushed to extra cover off the front foot"
"<B>this is high</b> and it's far enough. Length ball on middle and he gets down for the slog sweep. Appears to have got too far under it, but he has hit it cleanly"
length ball outside off. Gets down and looks for the reverse-whip. But he's through it early and cops it on the body
"good length on leg stump, big stride and he tickles it to short fine"
"short, and though it spins into him, there's enough room to open up for a hard slap to the right of sweeper cover"
"Nadeem fires this one a length, and Rana advances down the ground and launches this over long-on"
floats this up around the fourth-stump channel and Rana sweeps with the turn to backward square leg
advances down the ground and drills this to long-on
"short of a length, straightening around middle, Lynn backs away and slaps it to sweeper cover"
"Nadeem belts out an appeal for a leg before as Rana gets down to sweep and is hit on the pad. Not out is the on-field call, and it seems as though the impact may be outside off, but Nadeem convinces Gambhir to go for the review. Oops, seems like it may be well outside off. Also got to rule out the under-edge on the sweep. That seems alright, and the impact is miles outside off. Horrific review"
"short of good length, angled into the body, turned away into the leg side"
"short and angled across, a bit of extra bounce as he slaps it off the upper portion of the bat to deep backward point"
"short of a length, backs away and absolutely shovels it, reaches Boult in seconds and he does well to stop it at deep point"
"back of a length, angled into him, backs away and swings across the line to get beaten"
"good catch from Jason Roy at long-on. Again no room for Lynn as Shami angles in a knuckle ball to his middle and leg stumps. Lynn miscues it, gets no power behind it, and Roy dives in front to snaffle a smart catch"
"slower short ball, gets up too much, and called a wide"
"short of a length, stops on him a little as he closes the face early and gets an inside edge into the pad"
"starts off neatly with a fuller one on the stumps, clipped into the leg side"
"short of a length, no pace, and again stops on him a little as he swivels and pulls to deep square leg"
on the pads this time as Rana flicks to backward square leg and slips in his hurry to get back for the second. Has to settle for one
"shortish, angled in and tucked up for room, and Karthik gets the top-edge on the pull as he steps down, and sends it soaring over deep backward square leg"
"length ball around off, punched into the covers for one"
"moves across and tries to clip a leg-stump fuller one, gets hit on the pad as it rolls to the keeper. Appeal for leg before withheld"
given! Shami hits the pad of Karthik and it seemed pretty plumb. But Karthik has no hesitation in going for the review. Could he have got an inside edge? This may be too high. Shami gets this to skid in off a length and Karthik has indeed got an inside edge on the flick. And it seems as though the ball may have gone over as well
plays across another skiddy fullish length ball and gets a leading edge through the covers. Boult fires in a quick throw running in from the sweeper boundary
"good length around off, lets it come on before opening the face to run it down to third man"
"back of a length around off, waits and opens the face to third man"
"has that swung away? Karthik throws his hands hard at a length ball, it's a swipe across the line. It's a kuckle ball and lobs in the air off the outside edge"
hangs back to a length ball and opens the face to third man
"slower length ball around middle and leg, drops it into the off side for a quick one"
"fullish length, flicked off the pads, just a pick-up shot over midwicket"
"one ball after being dispatched for four, Morris offers the same delivery again, and Karthik responds with the same shot. Through midwicket"
"and attempts a third hit through the same region, but Gambhir had Boult from square leg after those two boundaries, and Karthik knocks it straight into the hands of the fielder there"
"that's another poor delivery. Morris is nicely feeding to the batsmen's strengths here. Lots of room outside off, and all he swings across without moving his feet but still manages good meat to clear long-on by a distance"
tapped to point and he is sent back
"back of a length, nips away outside off, dropped into cover for one"
"slower ball again, finds the inside edge of Rana's bat as he tries to drill it through the off side"
"shot! A short one that climbs into him hurriedly, and Russell jumps and flays it over the third man region with a well-timed ramp"
"<b>dropped</b>. Roy gets around it but does not time his dive well. Russell gets a top-edge on this slow short delivery and with no room, he skewed it off the toe-end"
"full on off-stump, gives himself a little room, and he lifts it straight over long-off with a straight bat"
"oh, that's huge! That's a massive strike. So much power in those arms as he backs away to a short one and lofts it over deep midwicket with the angle. Miles into the stands"
"short ball, angled across him, and Rana flays a pull over midwicket. Another massive hit"
"short of a length, backs away and tries to ramp it over and the ball shoots over the bat"
"slower short ball, Rana does superbly to hold his shape. Front foot out of the way and a gentle glide over backward point. Picks the gap nicely"
"yorker outside off, backs away and ekes out an inside edge into the leg side"
makes some room to a back of a length delivery and deftly opens the face to drop it to short third man
"goes too hard at this fullish length ball and loses shape as he swings, skewed off the toe-end into the off side"
"<b>carves it over sweeper cover!</b> There's no pace on that. It's a knuckle ball floating away. But he makes room, gets under it on one knee and lifts it cleanly over the fielder there"
"yorker on off stump, backs away and jams it to long-off"
"slower ball, back of a length on off stump. Backs away and pushes straight to extra cover"
"full ball outside off, gets low and lofts a drive uppishly towards sweeper cover"
"<b>pumped</b> deep into the stands. Shami feeds the swing outside off with a slower ball on a good length. Russell pummels it 102 metres, far behind deep midwicket"
"<b>clears long-off</b> off the toe-end! Bouncer just outside off, backs away and looks to go over the leg side. He's cramped and gets it right off the bottom but it clears the fielder easily"
"extremely full, straightish around off, and he gets a leading edge as he closes his face. <b>Fifty for Rana</b>"
"bowled him! Very good delivery from Boult, almost the perfect delivery to Russell. Fires it in around leg stump and rolls his fingers over it to slow it up. It then dips really late with Russell swinging for the fences, and takes out leg stump"
"oh, shot. Terrific strike from Gill first ball as he pulls it with lots of bottom hand power through midwicket"
"fullish around off, drilled extremely hard one-bounce to long-off"
"that's a stunning shot. Beautifully done, backs away to a middle-stump yorker and jams the bat down before opening the face to glide it smartly through third man"
"full, angled into him and dips on him, flicked through square leg"
"full, drifts it a long way across, and called a wide"
"that's amazing: power, wristwork and bat speed. Had everything. Full and wide from Morris and he carts it through backward point as it breezes past the sweeper running to his right at the boundary"
goes deep in his crease and tries to jab it through point but gets the bottom edge and rolls down the pitch
"slower ball, miscues as he tries to loft it over the off side and sends it soaring into the sky. Gambhir settles under it at cover. End of a top innings"
"full, drifts into the pads, clipped through backward square leg"
"full and angling in towards off, jabbed too straight down the ground as it crashes into the stumps at the non-striker's end"
"full toss, he stays really back in the crease and just makes use of the angle to help it along to fine leg"
"short of a length, spinning in, punched away through the covers"
"tame! Very soft dismissal. A bit of room outside off and he flays this with a flat bat, but picks out point. Gill having a tough start to his IPL career"
gets down for a big sweep to a completely wrong length and line. Not full by any means and slanted a long way across
"really slows it up and gets it to skid across without turn, Chawla swings and misses"
"Chawla comes down the track for a big hit. A non-turner again, pretty wide of Chawla, and he was probably expecting it to turn into him, but as he doesn't, he skews it in the air off the outside of the bat and the keeper settles under it"
"and another wicket. What a last over this has been Curran steps down the track and chips this in the air, straight into the hands of long-on"
"full on leg stump, flicked straight to deep midwicket"
"full ball outside off, plants the front leg out and yorks himself. Looks to flick and gets it into his toe"
"slider, full and in at leg stump. Leans in and flicks to deep midiwicket"
"googly, floated full on middle stump. Gets the front leg out of the way and drives to Russell's left at mid-off"
"slider, short of a length outside off. Looks to cut and under-edges into the pitch"
<b>leg-side stumping!</b> Roy loses his balance completely. It's a slider down leg side that keeps going away from him as he walks down the pitch for some reason. Has to reach out a long way for the flick and he won't get there. Karthik's toughest task there is gathering the ball. He does that properly and then the stumping is relatively easy
"googly, spinning in towards middle stump from a good length. Stays in the crease and taps it into the leg side"
"length ball on middle stump, stands tall in the crease and punches straight to mid-off"
"overpitched ball just outside off. Front leg out of the way and carved through cover. No fuss, too simple."
<b>falls short of fine leg.</b> Hit that better than he expected. Short ball on the hips and he whips it uppishly towards Mavi
short and wide outside off. Sits up perfectly with a lot of width and he slaps it through cover point
"<b>Rana leaps to his left and holds on.</b> Iyer stuck in a strange position for the late cut. It's a short ball just outside off. It looks like he changes his mind on the late cut very late and wants to just defend it. In the end, hangs the bat out and it's a sharp catch"
full ball fired down leg side. Lets it go
attempted bouncer. Too far down leg side again. Pant ducks it
"full on middle stump, stays still in the crease and drills this straight to mid-on"
"short of a length on leg stump, allows it to come on and whips to fine leg"
"good length just outside off, tapped towards mid-off on the up"
bouncer. Too short. Well down leg side. He looks to whip this away but it's too wide
"<b>top edge</b> on the pull. He's hurried on that shot. Short one at the hips. Luckily for him, he gets it well in front of square"
drops it too short and is punished. Attempted offcutter but there's a lot of time to adjust. Reaches out and steers it wide of short fine
bouncer at his front shoulder. Falls away into the leg side awkwardly and gets cramped on the hook. Takes one hand off as well as this rolls into the square leg area
"<b>chops it on!</b> Mavi has Gambhir, Delhi has panic! 144kph hour, short and just outside off, in the corridor. Gambhir leaps off the ground to try and cut, but it's too close and too quick. He's cramped and he's out."
bizzare shot. Length ball on off. He looks to reverse-ramp this. Awfuly position for the shot and he cops it on the back thigh
"nicely done. Full ball on off stump, drilled straight past the non-striker and there's no stopping that"
bouncer lifting sharply just outside leg stump. Late on the hook. Karthik (and me) think there's a sound there. Umpire has his arms spread to signal wide
"full outside off, front foot pointed into the leg side and head falling away as he tries to cream this over cover. Get it off the outside half and finds the boundary anyway"
"length on off stump, taps it in front of cover point and steals a quick single"
"good length outside off, tapped straight to mid-off on the up"
"<b>just clears cover.</b> Maxwell backing away at this short ball, has got this cut off the toe-end. It loops over the infield. Lucky"
"length ball slanted wide outside off, slashes and misses"
"length on leg stump, looks to flick but it pings off the thigh guard through the open square leg region"
short of a length and in at off stump. Looks to flick but he misses too. Deflected into the off side off the thigh guard
slower ball. Floated full on leg stump and clipped to deep square leg
short and wide outside off. Small step back aaaaaand chop. Through point
"slower bouncer foxes Maxwell. He wants to leave it, just outside off. But he realises it's a slower one and thinks momentarily about trying to jab it over the keeper. It's too late and he's unhappy:  'oh nooooooo'"
"full on middle stump, gets down and drags a sweep to deep midwicket's left"
short of a length outside off. Gets deep in the crease and wants to punch through midwicket. Gets it to short fine off the inside edge
"oh good shot. Mid-on is in, strangely. Pant meets this length ball on the pitch outside off and drills it wide of him"
"length ball on middle stump, gets down and sweeps between short fine and square leg"
"length ball floated up at off stump, defended down the pitch"
length ball spinning away from off and he does well not to let it go past him. He's beaten in flight as he steps out but manages to tuck it into the midwicket region
full ball floated up with a lot of room outside off. Reaches out and slices it over extra cover to find the boundary
well played. It's a quicker one from Chawla and he's a little late getting back on this. Chops it very very late to get it past backward point
googly at a good length outside off. Leaves it alone and half-apologises to himself
"slider, back of a length on middle stump. Drags it to deep square's left with a pull off the inside half"
"short ball outside off, looks to slice it past short third man but Lynn gets down quickly to his right, making extra sure he doesn't land on his problematic shoulder"
"length ball outside leg, a googly. Looks to sweep but gets it towards short fine off the thigh guard"
overpitched with a lot of room outside off. Pant lives for this. Stays tall and drills it past extra cover
"short of a length outside off, chops it to point's left"
<b>top edge</b> flies fine. It's a short ball angled down leg. He's cramped on the pull but fine leg is in and he makes no effort to try and control this
good length and in at off stump. Tapped to extra cover from the crease
"length on off stump, stays in the crease and nudges to long-on"
slower short ball. Makes up his mind early to leave this and it loops over him as he adjusts to get out of the way after ducking
slow length ball pushed across off stump. Swivels to get in position for the reverse sweep and just manages to get bat on it to get it past short third
"googly, short and wide outside off. Cut straight to sweeper cover"
<b>finds deep midwicket!</b> It's a short ball. Very short. Turning away from off. Pant gets behind and wallops this flat to find Chawla out there. He is not happy getting out like that. Could have hit it wide of the fielder without too much effort. A good innings ends
googly. Length and spinnning in from off stump. Tewatia watchful as he taps it through midwicket
googly outside off. Shuffles right across to get behind it and pull wide of long-on
"length ball outside off, looks to drive with no feet. Thick outside edge between backward point and short third"
"that's a woeful ball. Dropped short, a slower ball, on leg stump. Maxwell swivels and sends this flying over the fine leg region with a hoick"
"another slower ball. Short and wide outside off, cut straight to sweeper cover"
"<b>straight toe extra cover.</b> The Tewatia experiment ends quickly. It's a length ball outside off and he can get neither power, or elevation as he tries to clear the fielder there. Russell, the man, slightly wrongfooted - moving to his left - but holds on above his right shoulder"
short of a length and in at leg stump. Gets deep in the crease and nudges it towards fine leg
"legcutter, length and just outside off. Slices on the up towards sweeper cover"
"good length outside off, defends towards point off the front foot"
"googly, pushed flat and across off stump. Maxwell gets behind it and thumps it hard to long-on's right. Mavi does superbly to get down and behind that"
"length ball outside off, spins in sharply and beats him as he looks to play the reverse sweep"
<b>Mavi lobs it over the boundary!</b> Oh so close. Kuldeep tosses this right up and Maxwell has to think twice before pulling out the slog. Doesn't get a lot of bat on it. Mavi is behind it at long-on but looks like he's panicked right at the end
"<b>huge!</b> Gigantic. What power from Mawell. Length ball pushed through flat at leg stump and he slogs it what must, surely, be at least a 100 metres over the midwicket region"
"<b>short ball, downfall.</b> Another batsman finds the fielder off a half-tracker. It's the pace that's doing it. So slow from Kuldeep, halfway down the pitch. It's a googly but at that length it doesn't matter. Maxwell just has to generate too much power on this occasion. Mis-times and finds deep midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, leans in and drives to long-on"
"length on middle stump, stays still and taps it to deep midwicket"
short of a length and turning away outside off. Nudges to deep midwicket off the back foot
"<b>bowled him.</b> Narine with a nice loopy offbreak on length, not a harmful delivery. The kind you block with a smile in a Test match. Morris has a mission though, and a steep target. Makes room and tries to go over extra cover. Misses it completely. <b>That's his 100th IPL wicket</b>"
length ball on middle stump. Dabbed through square leg off the back foot
"<b>loud appeal for lbw.</b> It's given. Shankar will review this. He's caught on the back foot trying to flick. He's shuffled too. Middle and leg stump visible. This will be plumb if he hasn't got bat on it. Pitching outside off, spinning back in...and hitting off stump."
"full floater outside off, guided straight to deep point"
"full toss on leg stump, laboured drive to long-on"
"<b>high in the air</b> before it plonks some five yards inside the circle. Too far from long-on. The bowler should have gone for that, really. It's a googly, and he gets a top edge as he looks to clobber it over midwicket"
"length on off, pushed to extra cover off the front foot"
"short googly outside off, under-edge on the cut through cover"
"googly. Short of a length outside off. Sets up for the slog, adjusts for the cut. Doesn't get bat on it in the end"
"<b>sails over first slip.</b> A googly, full outside off. Once again, he's looking to go midwicket. It's a top edge"
good length on middle stump. Spins into the pads as he looks to flick
"short of a length just outside off, nudged past cover off the back foot"
"short of a length outside off, steps out and jabs it through point"
"length on middle stump, leans in and flicks to deep midwicket"
"<b>taken at midwicket.</b> Length ball at off stump, turning away from him. Steps out as it climbs on him. Looks to go over the leg side but ends up slicing it high into the air"
"length ball outside off, shuffles across and blocks on the front foot. A gorgeous forward block from Boult, as always."
full ball floated wide outside off. Lifts it inside-out to sweeper cover
"<b>chips it back at the bowler.</b> And that's the game for KKR. A googly, lobbed up nicely on middle stump. Boult wants to flick through midwicket but he's done by the turn and finds the bowler"
