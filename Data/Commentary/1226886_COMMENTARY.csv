"uses his feet again, comes at the bowler and pushes a full delivery to the covers"
"good length at off stump, worked rather awkwardly to deep square leg. Will that be it for Bartlett's night? There was certainly some swing"
"that's big! Short of a length outside off, Livingstone pulls it handsomely over deep midwicket"
"full on the pads, whipped wide of mid-on and this one races away...he's up and running"

"fuller, at the stumps, pushed to mid-on"

"that's better, gets it full at off stump, driven to long-off"
"starts with a low full toss on the pads, swept to deep square leg...and that's an overthrow. Messy from the Heat"

"back of a length, straight, tucked into the leg side that's <strong>a 27-ball fifty</strong>. Superbly played"
"very well played, moves outside leg stump, it's a good-length slower ball in the slot, lofts it inside-out over mid-off"

<strong>over the leg side...over the stand!</strong> Goes down on the back knee to a full delivery and slog sweeps it miles

another one very wide outside off...the wheels are getting loose here

"high full toss on the stumps, flicks it off his waist to deep square leg"
"length outside off, glides it off the bat and though backward point puts in a dive, the ball beats him and third man has to run to his right to field"
"<b>caught at deep midwicket</b>. The ball was there to be hit, but Livingstone didn't get the placement right. Dragged short by Swepson, and he rocked back, essayed a flat pull with decent connection, but Labuschagne at the boundary holds on. The Livingstone Entertainment show is over and the Heat can breathe more freely"
"beaten. Loopy legbreak outside off, brings him on the front foot to drive and turns away"
worked through square leg
"down the track and over the bowler's head. Didn't try to hit it too hard, and it just about eluded a leaping Swepson's fingertips. Not enough power to carry to the boundary"

"tossed up on off, driven back gently to the bowler's left, who tumbles and fields the ball"

"tossed up, gets some drift and dips on leg stump, comes on the front foot to defend"
"length ball skidding on, goes back and flat-bats it through square leg"
was giving himself room but Swepson does well to bowl it flatter and quicker into him. He can only punch it to long-off
"quicker one again, dragged short but skids on a bit too quickly for him to pull, he ends up prodding it to mid-on"
"length on the stumps, goes back and picks it off his pads through square leg"
"not the best ball to bowl with only two fielders out, short and sits up, Marsh swats it to the deep midwicket boundary. Didn't time it perfectly but hit it hard enough"
"full outside off, and Marsh goes down on one knee to launch this over the in-field square on the off-side, one bounce into the point fence"
"back of a length on the stumps, goes back and pulls. Too close to his body to pull effectively but he gets enough to send it over the square leg fielder"
"bouncer, dug in too short outside off, and the batsman pulls out of his attempted pull. Wide called. Went too high"
"<b>magnificent</b>. Too full on the stumps and Marsh essays a Tendulkar-esque lofted straight drive that sails over the bowler's head and bounces into the straight boundary. Full bat face, pose held."
"yorker length on off, driven to mid-off on the front foot"
<b>cracker of a shot</b>. Made room and drilled this full ball through cover. Perfect timing and placement. Means 22 runs have come off the first over of the Power Surge.
"full outside off, swatted down the ground off the toe-end of the bat. The lack of timing means the ball's travelling slow enough to long-off's right for them to pinch two"
"<b>technically a drop</b> but he's lucky he didn't injure himself. Full outside off and absolutely thumped back to the bowler. He barely had time to react and gets a blow on the body, just above waist"
"too far down leg, that's a wide"
"Mitchell Marsh's showing off his power. Laughlin misses the yorker by a bit, ends up as a low full toss and Marsh uses bottom hand and wrists to whip it to the backward square leg boundary"
"fuller outside off, driven to mid-on"
"<b>boom</b>. Effortless almost. Full on the stumps and he goes straight again, over the bowler's head and flat, into the straight boundary"
"good finish, sharp bouncer that Marsh is too late to pull, and can't connect"
keeps it wide outside off but goes just outside the tram-line so he'll have to rebowl that.
"<b>toe-ended but lands safe</b>. Another full ball wide outside off, he has to reach for it and can't connect properly with his intended cover drive. The ball loops up but drops short of the long-off fielder"
"comes off the end of the bat again, through cover. They sprint two"
"fuller on the stumps, driven firmly to cover. He manages to stop it but the throw is off and they end up getting a single off the over throw"
"walking down the track and looking to launch it over long-on, but doesn't connect"
<b>thrashed through cover</b>. Full toss outside off and he just swung hard at it to crash it through
"another full toss, he's moving across and slugs across the line to deep midwicket, who has to run to his right to collect"
"innovative, Goes across and scoops it fine. Not perfect connection so fine leg has time to field it"
"another full toss, they're probably not able to grip the ball all that well with  a bit of rain about. Thumped to long-on"
beaten on the cover drive to a full one outside off.
"<b>outside edge goes for four and Bancroft gets to his 50</b>. Was making room, Morkel kept it wide outside off, and Bancroft threw his bat at it. Gets the edge that goes fine"
"good bowling, full ball swinging into him, and he's tucked up for room, pushes it to long-on"

"full toss outside off and Bancroft throws his hands at it, thrashes it through extra cover to find the boundary"
"big swinger to start with, full outside off and shapes in at Lynn...actually a slower ball from Richardson. Defended"
"this is shorter and full pace, Lynn was coming down the pitch and let it go through"
"nips back from a good length, beats the inside edge and takes the pad"
"comes down the pitch, another slower ball that swings, driven to mid-off for a scampered single"
"short of a length, a whip-pull goes to deep square and they make it back for the second"
"full, angling into Denly as he gives himself room outside off, doesn't make contact and takes the pad. Outstanding over from Richardson"

"short of a length at leg stump, squats on him a little and he pulls to deep square"
"back of a length at leg stump, takes the inside edge into the thigh pad"

"back of a length, straight, has a huge swing to leg and gets a bottom edge into the crease"
"lofted straight down the ground, not out of the middle, but it skips over the damp outfield"
"<b>nearly drags on, should have been run out!</b> A slower ball, takes the bottom edge into the pads, they got for the run and Denly was miles out if Behrendorff had managed to hit with an underarm from his follow through"
"<strong>superbly bowled! </strong>Completely done by the slower ball. It comes out as a low full toss, Denly tries to flick it over midwicket but can only send it straight up in the air"
"<strong>cleaned him up! Two in two balls</strong> Massive swing in the game. It's another slower ball, full and straight, Lynn giving himself room and misses a leg-side swing by a long way. Behrendorff is pumped"

"walking across his stumps and is served a full toss on off, not as much room to free arms but he clubs it over the bowler's head. Not timed well enough which allows long-on to run to his left, slide and stop. Behrendorff the fielder"
"<b>he's caught at deep midwicket</b>. Another full toss, quite high at just around waist level. but Peirson didn't generate enough power on the swat across the line, ends up mis-timing it so that the ball loops up and settles comfortably into the fielder's hands"
"full, swinging away, he's beaten on the cover drive"
