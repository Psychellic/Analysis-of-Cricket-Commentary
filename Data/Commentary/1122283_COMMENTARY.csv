"<b>ample carry</b>, which will excite the fast bowlers, as Morkel hits back of a length. Dhawan leaves outside off"
"pitches it up, testing if Dhawan might be loose enough to drive on the up. He doesn't."
this one scoots through at ankle-height to the wicketkeeper as Dhawan lets it go again
"nice and tight on middle stump, Dhawan looks to turn it through midwicket but doesn't quite pull it off."
"good length ball outside off, flashes and misses."
fearsome hit to cover as Dhawan leans forward and unleashes a drive that will make Morkel think twice about giving him room.
"makes him hop as he hits the deck, but Rohit is able to nudge the ball to midwicket"
"<b>142 kph, and it hurtles in at the right-hander</b>, catching Rohit on the crease! The impact is high - so much that it leaps over the pad and strikes the thigh."
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"<b>inside edge</b> as Rohit reaches in front of him, tentatively. The straight bat comes down the wrong line as Rabada gets some inward movement off the pitch. 'Nipping around, boys. Nipping around,' is the shout from behind the stumps"
pins him on the crease with a good length ball aimed at the top of off stump. Dhawan negotiates it with an open face
flays it through extra cover! It comes down at 143 kph but Dhawan takes a defiant stride forward and slams the ball through the gap like he as a score to settle with it
"138 kph and with the effort Morkel puts into the ball, it seams in off the pitch too. Rohit doesn't want to flirt with those just yet"
"that's <b>good bowling</b>, forcing Rohit to play with his hands. The length is just perfect, not allowing Rohit to come forward, and then the ball straightens as well."
"gets nicely forward to defend a fullish delivery on off stump. That's good stuff from Rohit, he is right over the ball"
"136kph, rises with the shortish delivery outside off and runs it down to backward point"
"his feet are moving. Confident push forward to a pitched up delivery on middle. Then down comes the bat, perfectly straight"
"brings his length back, keeps the line on off stump, Rohit can only block and Morkel finishes up his second maiden in a row"
<b>nearly 150kph</b>! allows the short delivery to come to him so that he can tap it to point and search for a quick single. The fielder doesn't allow it
cramps him again with another back of a length delivery - <b>at 148 kph</b> - Dhawan knocks it down to cover
"that's absolutely sensational! He no longer lets bowlers dictate terms with the short ball. This come comes up above his chest, on middle and leg, but he picks the length early, swivels on the back foot and pulls it handsomely to the square leg boundary"
"fullish on off stump, Dhawan smacks it to cover"
"<b>goes over second slip</b>! It's the captain there, Markram, who pulled off a ripper in the last match, leaping up at cover. He has to leap up again, and only gets a fingertip as Dhawan cuts a ball that bounces a bit more for him to control properly"
"pristine hit to extra cover! He is in form! And he's being allowed his offside shots, unlike the last game. South Africa figure with seam movement available, the outside edge is back in play. But that means they are gambling with a man who plays the square and cover drives so well"
<b>beaten</b> as he goes to hammer a good length ball on the up over mid-off. But Morkel gets the ball to dance past the outside edge
"short of a length and outside off, Rohit ignores it"
"bangs it in, outside off, no shot"
waits on the back of a length delivery on off stump and turns it to midwicket as PE's brass band starts work for the day
gets up on his tippy-toes to glide a short delivery outside off to cover point
"spears it through point, and majestically to boot. Morkel gives the man under pressure a hint of room and Rohit latches onto it with a great ferocity. First runs off the fast bowler."
"drills it back down the ground, past the right hand of Rabada, who is bowling around the wicket. Immense timing on the shot, doesn't even allow the bowler a chance."
chops the short ball outside off to third man
"a 145 kph delivery angles into Rohit's body, who bunts it down the pitch"
<b>thaaaaaaaaat's outta here</b>. He doesn't like the way he's come across on this tour. He wants to take it to the man who's been troubling him. And so he comes down the track and launches the express pace of Rabada so far over long-on
"<b>strikes him on the box</b>! The grass in the pitch is allowing the fast bowlers to get enough seam movement. Dig it into the pitch, on a decent length, at high pace, and you can bet the batsman can't adjust. That's the case with Rohit, who sees a ball fractionally outside off, sets up to hit it, but then suddenly finds himself cramped"
nudges through midwicket as a good length ball strays into the pads
superb drive down the ground! There is nothing to this shot bar the straight bat. Comes down to punish a perfectly good length ball outside off.
"<b>just over the wicketkeeper</b> as Dhawan goes for the hook. He doesn't have much room for the shot, the ball is up at his neck as well, denying him control. He gloves it to the right of Klaasen, who puts in a massive dive, but can't get there"
"fullish and fast on leg stump, Dhawan tries a flick, but doesn't connect"
width on offer and Dhawan tucks into it like he's the guest of honour. Lashes a short and wide delivery over point
"opens the face and uses Morkel's pace and bounce to his advantage, picking up a single to third man"
"he seems to be getting the measure of this pitch. Waits on the shortish delivery outside off, and ever so deftly steers it to point."
"fast and short, but it's also down the leg side. Dhawan pulls, can't connect"
"<B>the trap is set, but Dhawan evades it by a whisker</b>. With the bounce and carry on offer, South Africa have posted a gully and Rabada bowling around the wicket to a batsman who is a compulsive cutter makes him an important position."
"puuuuuuuullllls straight down deep square leg's throat! Rabada waves at Dhawan, and then points him to the dressing room. That might catch the match ref's attention. In any case, this is a good bouncer, angling into Dhawan's body, rising up towards his chest. From that line, with that much height, he has little chance of keeping his pulls down"
"fullish on middle, Kohli whips it to midwicket"
clips of the pad and beats the dive from Klaasen as well. Rabada consciously targeting Kohli's stumps
"the front leg is across, in prime position to be lbw. But even with Rabada's pace, especially when he pitches it up, Kohli's wrists are quick enough to pull him out of trouble"
"148 kph, nudges it off his hip to square leg."
"can't give width! Morkel was the epitome of that virtue in his early overs. But now he's leaking runs. Too short, too wide, slaps it away"
"shortish on middle and off, Rohit gets right behind it"
"presents the high elbow as he crunches the short ball off the back foot. Perfectly vertical bat, gives him splendid timing, but short point does well"
"back of a length and outside off, doesn't care for it"
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> but height seems to be an issue. He does well to trap Rohit at the crease, the skid off the pitch and the slight inward movement making the batsman hit across the line."
"tests Kohli's restraint outside off on a pitch that is affording him just a hint of movement. Knowing he is new at the crease, the India captain shies away from the threat"
"<b>extra bounce surprises Rohit</b> and the 149 kph delivery wanders down to third man. Good from Rohit to soften the way he holds his bat to ensure even if he outside edges the jaffa, it goes down"
"<b>beats him</b> with a peach at 145 kph! It's in line with off stump, the angle makes Kohli push at it. The pitch gives him a little extra to take the ball past the edge"
"147 kph, clips the fullish delivery on middle away to deep midwicket."
covers the line of a good length ball outside off and blocks towards point
strides forward to meet the 144 kph good length ball outside off and runs it to point
"blocks to cover and pinches a single. Doesn't matter it comes in at 142 kph, Kohli reads that it is short, sets up for the shot early and executes it perfectly"
brings him forward outside off and Kohli angles the face and runs the good length ball down to third man
blocks the 137 kph short delivery angled into middle and off.
"don't test Rohit on the short ball! He's possibly the best puller in the XI and he shows it off. The ball comes up to his chest, he swivels on his back foot and launches it over deep square leg"
"shortish and outside off, steers it to deep third man"
<b>gets it to kick up a bit off the pitch</b> and Kohli's penchant to come forward to even back of a length ball has him in a bit of bother. Has to yank the bottom hand off to keep the ball down
"opens the face when he makes contact with a shortish delivery outside off. It's a risky shot, but he does very well to play it only after the ball is within his reach"
"Kohli's been less than cordial to Phehlukwayo all series, and here he greets him with a couple of strides down the pitch and a slap through cover. Not the best idea bringing the allrounder with Kohli new at the crease"
nudges it to midwicket for a quick single
"shortish and outside off, carves it to the sweeper cover"
"hits the deck, while pulling pace off the ball, and Kohli's attempt to force the through point doesn't pan out"
<b>inside edge onto boot</b> as Kohli is early into the cut shot. Seems the chance of pace isn't the worst option. It's holding up in the pitch as the ball gets older
"back of a length and outside off, dabs it to third man"
"fullish and outside off, Kohli defends to cover"
"fetches a shortish delivery from outside off with naught more than a shuffle across and a roll of his wrists. A spectacular shot through midwicket, executed with minimum effort"
"pulls, gently, the short ball outside off to deep midwicket, concentrating on keeping the ball down, and to the left of the fielder"
gets right behind a good length delivery on and around off stump
"short ball comes up towards Kohli's throat, but at a pace slow enough that the batsman can adjust and block to cover."
"<b>that's a beaut</b>! A little extra effort to hit the deck, and it offers him seam movement past the bat of Virat Kohli. That's truly special"
plays the late cut to send a shortish delivery outside off to third man
"full and outside off, Kohli laces it to the sweeper cover"
"looks for the legcutter on middle, Rohit punches to the left of midwicket"
allows the back of a length delivery to come to him and chops it down to third man
blocks a good length ball on off stump
"throws his hands at a good length ball outside off and it rockets away towards the boundary, at least until Morkel races across to his right and puts in an awkward tumble"
closes the bat face early and gets a leading edge as Ngidi's fuller delivery on middle stump nearly produces a wicket. Could still have with Rohit looking for a single that isn't there
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"terrible bowling. And Rohit picks up the short ball earlier than most. The back lift goes high, the back foot swivels, the bat comes down with a vengeance and the ball disappears behind square leg"
"another short ball, this one rising up a bit more, and Rohit pulls it again, down to long leg"
"full on off stump, Kohli reaches in front of him to drive to mid-on"
gets up off his toes to blunt a short ball outside off through midwicket
"hacks a short ball outside off to the left of short midwicket, his bottom hand working overtime"
"fullish and outside off, Kohli forces it to point"
"<b>lovely cricket</b>, right down to the running between the wickets. Where other batsman would have come forward and blocked this, Kohli hangs back and glides it to the left of third man, which is Morkel, who isn't one of South Africa's best fielders"
"pulls a short ball from outside off to deep square leg. Rabada does well to stop a boundary, diving to his right"
"looks for a cut, but Phehlukwayo gets the ball to angle steep enough into the right-hander that he mistimes the shot."
"good length on middle, Kohli opens the face and sends it to point"
"a shade short, a smidge wide, and Rohit escorts it to the point boundary. Ever the gentleman. <b>That's the fifty partnership</b>"
"defends from the crease, but the straight bat comes down outside the line of the ball, meaning it pings off the inside edge"
"the offcutter, outside off, Rohit leaves it"
"walks at the bowler, who does well to dig it into the pitch, and hike up his pace. The 138 kph delivery bounces more at Rohit, who ends up mis-hitting to mid-off."
takes the ball outside off for a ride to third man
gets up off his feet to try and place a short ball to the right of midwicket. Doesn't quite manage it.
"<b>good placement</b>, but only just as Rohit goes for a cut and a hint of extra bounce nearly messes with his shot. He wants to cut the ball well behind point, but it ends up only a few inches away"
"short and wide again, Rohit dabs it to the point boundary with nothing more than the opening of the face. <b>Exquisite timing</b>"
it's wide - that's why Rohit goes for the cut - but the line is fuller and the pace is quicker. The batsman is beaten
"tosses it up outside off, Rohit pushes it down to long-off"
"whips a flighted ball from outside off to long-on, all along the ground"
too wide outside off and Rohit is happy to collect the extra
rocks back and punches the flatter delivery outside off to deep point

"back of a length at off stump, punched straight to midwicket"
"back of a length and coming in at middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
"well, Duminy makes it easy for him. Drops it at bouncer length way down the pitch. Spinning into Rohit who just has to connect with the pull. It goes way over midwicket"
"god length outside off, driven on the up to long-off"
"floated full outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
short ball pushed through flat on the pads. Keeps low as he looks to flick. He gets it out to midwicket
length ball skids in at off stump and he gets on his back foot with an open face to guide this past slip. Backward point cleans up
<b>Klaasen thinks he has Kohli stumped.</b> Shamsi beats him on the outside edge as he stretches forward to defend. He hasn't stepped out...but his back leg is very close to straying out. There are two angles on the replay - one makes it look like half a spike is in. The other <b>shows nothing behind the line.</b> Third umpire has a difficult decision to make...and he says it's <b>not out.</b>

"good length in the corridor, opens the face and runs this to the third man boundary with minimal fuss"

"<b>it's another Rohit-Kohli run out.</b> Kohli runs till the short of a good length area from the non-striker's end and has no chance of making it back after Rohit refuses the run. It's a length ball tapped pitch side off the back foot, in front of the stumps. Rohit takes a big step before realising he probably won't make it and calls no. By now, Kohli is already on his way.

"extra bounce as Rabada hits the deck at 140 kph, but Iyer rides it nicely to third man"

"<b>dropped by Shamsi</b>! And it's a pretty straighforward catch too, needing him to move to his left, coming down straight into his lap. And it plops out.

"<b>another yes-no sitch</b> but this time South Africa do not convert the chance. It all starts with Rohit getting an inside edge onto pad. He takes a step out, looking for a single. Iyer takes a little time to respond. That's the little interval for the fielder to exploit. But Duminy is unable to do so. The ball hits Rohit as he stretches to make his ground at the non-strikers', and since he hasn't changed direction to complete the run, he won't be out obstructing the field"

"slants into the right-hander, with Bhuvi making room. The batsman hits to midwicket"
"goes short, and angles it at Bhuvi's head. The batsman basically takes evasive action, and somehow gets some bat to find a single at deep square leg"

"taken at mid-off, and Ngidi is over the moon! He's taken out his IPL captain. The short delivery, off-pace as well, cramps the batsman for room. Dhoni still goes for a slash, gets it high on the bat and as a result the ball skews straighter than he wants it to. Markram runs to his left, puts in a full-length dive and takes another special catch"

"full and outside off, Kuldeep runs it to short third man"
"another slower ball outside off, Bhuvi glides it to deep third man"
"too much pace for Kuldeep to deal with. Nevertheless, he tries to cut the big fast bowler and comes up second best. Ngidi finishes his spell with 4 for 51, all of those wickets taken in the final 10 overs to turn the match on its head"

"good length and in at off stump, defended watchfully into the off side"
"good length and angled into the pads. That ball's not there for the flick when it starts off, but Amla's lack of feet movement means he doesn't get trapped. The ball nips back in and he has time to adjust his wrists and nudge this through square leg"

"good length on off stump, defended solidly from the crease"

"length outside off, looks to drive but he isn't close to the ball with the stride. Gets it into the leg side off the inside half"

superb shot for two. Length ball in at leg stump and he plants the front leg across to chip this wide of mid-on
"legcutter again, back of a length on leg stump. Looks to whip this but can't time it. It trickles fine and Dhoni gives chase"
back of a length and in at leg stump. Allows it to come on and closes the face to run this past square leg. Bhuvneshwar sprints to his left and puts in a sliding tackle to stop it with his left foot
<b>dropped at extra cover.</b> Shreyas Iyer is the man. It's gone straight to him and he has reacted late. Hands are awkwardly up in self-defence mode as a reflex. There isn't enough time to recover. Makram got good connection on this cover drive on the up but it was straight to the fielder

"well, if there's one thing he's doing today - he's taking risks. Full ball outside off and he goes with hard hands and intent to lift this. Ends up chipping it off the toe-end, into the covers"

"offcutter, back of a length outside off. Tapped into the covers off the back foot"

good length and in at leg stump. Leans in and pushes this on the up into the leg side
oh what a shot. But said field allows India to save the four. Overpitched ball outside off and this drive is absolutely nailed to extra cover
"gets this swipe off the inside half. An ugly shot, but he's found the square leg boundary. Length ball at middle stump, heaves and beats midwicket"
"<b>nailed.</b> Stunning hit from Markram. Length ball with some width and he puts in a half-stride to help his full swing. Hammers it on the up through cover point. That shot might have been heard a kilometre away, the connection was that good"

"back of a length outside off, tapped on the up to extra cover"
"<b>taken at mid-off.</b> Markram's budding affair with the toe-end has cost him a wicket on Valentine's eve. Yet another off the bottom of the bat as he looks to chip. Looked to go with the angle this time, over mdiwicket, but was through early and this length ball pings off the bat to find Kohli"

"<b>taken at slip!</b> Pandya gets it to move off the seam, Duminy follows with his hands and this ends up flying at Rohit's mid-riff.

"pulls out the reverse sweep, doing his best to reach as far down the pitch as he can. That allows him to smother the turn"
"pushes it through on off stump, Miller enjoys the change in pace as he shifts back and whips it to square leg. Half a chance for a run-out with Amla coming down the pitch"
"<b>massive lbw shout</b>, umpire George says no and Kohli chooses to review. It does look close, but it also spins a lot. Chahal's given it a proper rip, getting the ball to drift away, which is the reason why Miller plays down the wrong line and is beaten on the inside edge. Hawk-Eye predicts the ball is turning past leg stump and India have lost their review. Kohli is flabbergasted, and upon seeing that on the big screen the crowd boos."

holds his length back and Miller is good enough to block it
"picks the shortish length early, shifts back, waits as he should on this pitch, and flicks to square leg"
tosses it up - seems like the straighter one - and Miller is well in control of it
"the line is on leg stump, Miller goes down to sweep it, sees there is no pace on the ball, knows it is a trap for the top edge, and so plays the shot as gently as he could"

"gets it out the front of the hand, but the length goes short as a result. Miller cuts to deep point"
"<b>smashes it back at the bowler and Chahal is hurt</b>! He's quite the daring fellow trying to intercept the bludgeon; comes to him on the full, hits the left hand, doesn't stick - there's no point calling that a catch. It's just too hard to pull off. Out comes the physio to provide running repairs, and he's ready to go again"
the ball strays onto leg and Miller deflects it to long leg
"<b>beats him</b> both by length and the turn. The ball is full, but the trajectory is flat, forcing Amla to keep to his crease. He tries to adjust to the ball off the pitch, but Chahal gets it to rip sharply past the outside edge"

lets the short ball come on and slices it to deep third man
"steps out of his crease, takes the flighted ball on the full and smashes it to long-on. Plenty of effort, all for a single"
"falls short of Iyer running in from sweeper cover! It's a dreadful <b>mis-hit from Amla</b>, yielding to the pressure. He sees the ball tossed up, and drifing away from him. Throws his hands at it and gets a thick outside edge. Iyer does well, sprinting forward and to his right. But he just can't get there"
flicks it to long leg
kicks the front leg away so he can turn a flatter delivery on middle to square leg
"looks to play a leg glance, with the ball pitching outside leg stump. Turns past the bat"
"sweeps the loopy delivery outside off, but because Chahal isn't putting any pace on the ball, Miller ends up reaching too far for it and mistimes it to square leg"
"looks for a flick again, but the turn beats the inside edge and lobs off his pad into Dhoni's waiting gloves"
"full on off stump, defends"
"a ball pitching in Pandya's own half <b>keeps so low</b> and Amla is struck on the pads as he looks for the pull. Luckily for him, it isn't straight"
"<b>dropped</b> by Rahane at short point. The cut shot goes straight at him, asking him to reach above his head, but since he is standing so very close to stop the single, he misses out on the catch"
crunches it to sweeper cover
"goes for the pull again, this time the back of a length ball straight enough to merit an <b>lbw appeal</b>. Still, it is too high"

goes for the lap sweep and sends it trickling away to the long leg boundary. Places it well to the right of the fielder inside the circle
rocks back and cuts the shortish delivery off the stumps to deep point
goes back to block a good length ball on leg stump. This is the googly and he only reads it off the pitch
"knocks him over, and Chahal puts his finger on his lip as if to tell the crowd to shush! It's the lack of pace. It's so so slow and Miller, racing down the pitch, is through his shot so early. It morphs into a slog as he tries desperately to connect with the ball. Misses it altogether and looks back to see his stumps in disarray. It's the kind of wicket that will make a batsman hide in the bathroom when the replays come on."
taps it to short cover
defends in front of his pad on leg stump and gets a leading edge through to long leg
"fullish on off stump, Klaasen keeps it out"

"cuts in off the seam, and rather late too, which leaves Klaasen inside edging again as he looks to drive on the up"
"good bouncer, climbing up over his shoulder, on and around off stump. Klaasen drops his wrists and leaves it alone"
looks to slash a full and wide delivery - without much footwork - and <b>is beaten</b>. Seems to get skid off the track
"has him dangling his bat out, and it looks like a toothpick as Chahal gets the ball to turn wildly past the edge"
"pushes it through on middle and leg, looking for the ball to break off the pitch again. Doesn't do so quite as much and Amla blocks"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> but umpire George says no and Kohli walks right up to the umpire and questions the decision for a full minute. This is a legbreak, off the front of the bat, straightening past the sweep shot. Traps Amla in front of middle, it pitches on leg stump, so that's fine too, and <b>HawkEye shows it's hitting</b> too"
""
"chips it over the bowler's head, having originally been beaten in flight - or rather the pace. He's set to smash the ball straight down the ground an age before it arrives. <b>That is Amla's fifty</b>, and like this shot, it's been a very hard working effort, most of it revolving around trying to get himself and his team out of trouble"
"shortish and on off stump, dabs it to point"

"lunges forward to sweep a good length ball outside off flat and hard to the square leg boundary. Good footwork, amazing power"
tosses it up again - not caring his last ball was a four - and he gets the inside edge as a result. Klaasen defends down the wrong line with the ball drifting in
"goes for the scoop, but when there is only 78 kph on the ball, the shot doesn't really carry too far"
"chips a tossed up delivery - reaching well in front of his body, suggesting he is beaten in flight, but is adjusting as best he could - and finds a couple straight down the ground"
"that's short, and it spins hard enough to let him free the arms with the cut shot"
that's the quicker ball - but the length remains full. Amla gets forward to block
very slow and very short. Klaasen's pull shot goes off the bottom of the bat to long-on. The mis-hit is because the ball doesn't come on to his bat

"gets it past mid-off! That's a special shot.That's the kind of shot that's been impossible to play, the drive on the up. But Amla stays leg side of the ball, waits that extra second longer and then smears it to the fielder's left"

Tell you what, this isn't too different from the Kohli stumping decision earlier. The margin is that close. Umpire's deliberating....<b>he's given.</b> Amla is out. Punches this to mid-off off the back foot and takes off for a run and is deemed short by a millimeter. Is that India's opening?"

"<b>got him!</b> Kuldeep picks up another three-wicket haul and this looks like the match and the series for India. Pushes a googly wide outside off.

"Pandya in character, adding more flair than needed as he plucks this one-handed catch from in front of Dhawan's throat. It's a length ball floated up at middle stump.
