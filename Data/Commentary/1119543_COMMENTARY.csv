"<B>outside edge</b> past slip. A lot of swing, but also a lot of width. Very short. Dhawan chucks his hand out of at it for the cut and can't control it"
<b>brings it in</b> but Roy is alert to this. Slightly wider start with the line and he gauges that. Gets the bat down in the corridor and chops it wide of third man off the back foot
back of a length outswinger outside off. Shuffles into the off side but can't get his body behind this for the flick. It rolls into the midwicket region
drops it too short outside off. Roy waits on it and taps it late to beat cover to his left and point to his right.
"<b>shot!</b> Walks down at him again and this is the fullest of the lot. Angles in nicely at him and he whips with the angle, no reason to keep it down. One bounce and into the square leg boundary"
stopped but no entirely at point. Another length ball in the corridor that's timed neatly off the back foot with an open face
<b>whoooosh!</b> Down the pitch to realise Yadav's a little quicker. Looks to swing away into the leg side but he's cramped and beaten and this rises over the stumps
"so he stays on the back foot next ball and destroys this. Short of a length and wide outside off. Climbs onto it, half a front foot stride, and crashes it on the up through cover point"
full and into the pads. Clipped to deep square
short of a length ball skids in sharply and thumps him on the thigh guard
"short of a length outside off, punched to mid-off from the crease"
<b>oh yeah!</b> Top anticipation. The full ball had to come. Buttler was ready - walking across to expose his stumps before scooping this over the keeper
short ball wide outside off. Walks down the pitch and looks to send this over deep square leg. Beaten
<b>narrowly misses off stump.</b> Length ball angled into the corridor. He's down the pitch again to loft this over midwicket but he's a long way away from the ball. Beaten on the inside leg
"chips the slower ball wide of long-on. Length and at off stump, neat little jump down the pitch before placing this"
"<b>thick outside edge</b> over short third man. Slower ball again, this one short of a length outside off. Swipes hard at it and is rewarded for his intent<sup>TM</sup>"
nicely timed. Short of a length outside off and firmly punched to long-on's right off the back foot
<b>beaten again.</b> Short of a length ball climbs over middle stump as he looks to swing across the line
"length ball, sliding up at leg stump. Pushed back to the bowler off the front front foot"
"slow, short of a length on leg stump. Flicks to deep square from the crease"
"<b>just clears backward point.</b> It's a full toss and he might have put this over midwicket if it weren't for his history against legspin. It's the reverse sweep that comes out because of that reality, but he manages to slice it over that fielder"
"length ball at leg stump. Steps out and doesn't make the pitch of the ball. Taps it against the turn, on the up, to mid-on's right"
"drilled. It's the IPL again. Buttler is down the track to meet Chahal at the pitch and has cleared the long-on boundary with no fuss, hitting against the turn"
<b>short.</b> Poor ball from a clearly nervous bowler. Short and very wide outside off and it's crashed to the cover boundary
nicely bowled. Nails the yorker at an off stump line and Roy can only bunt this to point
ugly hoick and a single. It's a full toss outside off and it's just Roy chucking his bat at this now. Inside edge out to deep square
<b>over mid-on.</b> Waits on the slower ball to lob into his zone and puts in a full swing. Slightly off the inside-half of the bat but this is the Powerplay
short of a length at the stumps. Backs away and cuts straight to cover
"<b>high up for fine leg</b> where Chahal still looks to be a bit bloodied by that last over. It's a short ball that Buttler is very late on for the pull. Sliced up and Chahal doesn't run in quickly or, indeed, in the right path. Lands well short of him."
<b>bowled him!</b> Yadav's liking this pace off the surface. It's just short of a length and outside off. Roy is done by length because this has skidded low - too low for the pull anyway. It's off the inside edge as he looks to pull. He hasn't picked the length for that shot at all today. This time it costs him a wicket
short of a length at the hips. Hangs back in the crease and taps it to deep square's right with enough finesse for a comfortable second
short of a length on the hips again. Dabbed to fine leg off the back foot
a knock on the box to start. Pandya gets one to skid back and past the inside edge as Hales looks to fend with hard hands
<b>fizzes through.</b> It's a bouncer outside off and it flies past the attempted hook
length ball at the stumps. Backs away to try and drive but it's a mis-hit into the covers
length ball cramps him at leg stump. He nudges it straight to midwicket.
"length ball sliding outside off, chopped firmly to sweeper cover"
"yorker length outside off, jams it out to long-off off the front foot"
"full on off stump, full face of the bat as he drives to long-off"
"short of a length outside off, a subdued pull to deep midwicket"
short of a length and tossed up very slow outside. Backs away too far and toe-ends the cut to extra cover
"<b>a run out appeal</b> but he should be in. Yes, he is. Should have been a single bu shoddy work by sweeper cover. The length ball was slapped straight at him and he failed to collect it cleanly. Buttler was open to the opportunity, it was a long throw"
"short of a length outside off, opens the face to run it to third man"
<B>leading edge</b> as Buttler hops into the off side to try and scoop one. It's a slower ball dug in short that cramps him. A single down at third man at the end of it all
<b>well bowled.</b> Flummoxes Hales with a slower ball at yorker length. Hales is shaping to drive but has to quickly get the bat down to tap this to midwicket
<B>another flier.</b> Some spice in this pitch. Pandya gets this to climb past Hales attempted cut outside off
"short of a length into the pads, shovelled to deep square's right"
"<B>loose.</b> Attempts another one of those full slower balls, but this is overcooked. It's a thigh-high full toss and Buttler gets his front leg out of the way to swat this behind square"
"short of a length, wide, and very slow. No pace for his cut shot which is an under-cut in the end"
<b>beats him in flight.</b> Hales shuffles into the off side. Chahal follows with a loopy leg break on length outside off that spins past the attempted slog sweep
follows him down leg side this time. Chahal pushes it flat and Hales can only drive to long-on
"it's a different game with Buttler. Nice length ball, loopy outside off, would have probably beaten him if he looked to hit him straight. But Buttler is in position for the reverse sweep and he gets it over short third"
<b>under edge</b> into the pitch. Quicker length ball this time and he does go with a straight bat
tossed up down leg side. Completely messes it up for the reverse sweep for him. It trickles out to sweeper over
"<B>welcome to the party.</b> Kuldeep floats one up at off stump and Buttler duly puts him away, beating both deep midwicket and long-on who are converging on that long boundary there"
"length outside off, tapped to extra cover"
"<b>wrong'un</b> picked late, but negotiated. It's at a length on off stump and Buttler adjusts to block on the front foot"
pushes a fast yorker through at off stump. Buttler jams it to extra cover
"this is a sensational comeback. Masterful from the young man. Googly, going away towards off stump from a length. He can't drive it past extra cover"
he does. Yorker and fast. Outside off. Buttler hurriedly drives to long-off
well he's certainly played that like a furious man. Slower ball goes wrong again for Pandya. Far too too short outside off and he pummels this wide of long-on off the back foot
"<b>fifty!</b> That's how much that shot should be worth, too. Short of a length and in at the stumps. Gets the front leg out of the way and slaughters it over deep square. Unreal hitting."
"slapped wide of mid-off. England back on the rise. Buttler has had enough. Staying deep in the crease and putting them away, whatever pace they are. It's a slower ball this time. It's outside off, it's four."
"<b>misses out.</b> Short one on the stumps, the room is made for the pull, but he gets it off the under-edge"
follows him down leg side with a yorker. He tickles it out to fine leg
full toss on middle stump and he mistimes this slog out to deep midwicket. It's been that kind of an evening for Hales
"googly, short of a length at leg stump. Doesn't pick it. Taps it into the leg side"
"another googly. Pushed wide, anticipating the step down from the batsman. That's what he does too. Beaten in flight and is forced to push it to extra cover"
"<b>it was coming.</b> We could see it coming a few overs ago. And it was the only outcome possible as Hales exposed his stumps - far too early. You could tell this would hit the stumps. He was down before the ball, he was swinging for the sweep while it was too full."
"tossed up outside off, gets a big stride down to smother the turn and tap it fine. Nicely done. Lot of work for deep backward square"
"length ball pushed across off stump, tapped to extra cover with the angle"
"short of a length on leg stump, nudged with soft hands through square leg to steal a cute second"
"short and wide outside off, reaches out and cuts to sweeper cover. That didn't turn back in"
length ball wide outside off. Buttler shuffles and leaves. Umpire says that was hittable
"short of a length outside off, cut hard, straight to sweeper cover"
"<b>beaten</b> but this time it is called wide. Skids straight through from a length, wide outside off. He slashes from under it"
"length on middle stump, swept to short fine's right. Good effort by the fielder, gets down and parries it to deep backward square's left"
floated up at middle stump. Gets on the front foot and is forced to push this weakly into the leg side
"full outside off, driven to long-on off the front foot"
<b>it's that time.</b> When India's spinners try and impose themselves in the middle overs. And they're certainly managing to do that. Kuldeep tempts Morgan into getting under this one too early through a very rapid dip on this full ball ball. Morgan doesn't get to the pitch and it spins ever so slightly away. Ends up a slice and an easy take for deep midwicket
"googly, short of a length at leg stump. Flicked to deep midwicket off the back foot"
"<b>oh what a ball!</b> Bairstow had no clue. Kuldeep is turning it on! Draws him into a drive on the up. He would've struggled whichever way that turned, because he was nowhere near the pitch. As it turns out, it's a wrong'un. His back leg is out. Dhoni does what he does. I've used this word before already but it's got to be used again - masterful. Too good from Kuldeep."
"<b>another one!</b> Kuldeep has made England's two best Test batsmen in recent history look very very ordinary. Lobbed up at the exact same line and length again, just outside off. Root also playing for the one that turns in. Surprise surprise - it doesn't. He's walked a long way down the wicket. He's given up. Dhoni  fumbles and uses his helmet to recover. That wouldn't have been out a year ago. No problem this time."
"<b>inside edge</b> but there's no short leg in place. Another wrong'un from Kuldeep, asking Moeen to push into the covers off the front foot. It's exactly what he tries"
"googly, back of a length at leg stump. Tapped into the leg side off the back foot"
<b>hint of inswing</b> in this full ball headed for the stumps. Driven hurriedly to sweeper cover off the outside half
length and some shape away again. Goes on the back foot and taps it into the leg side
"short ball at the hips, turned down to fine leg off the inside edge"
"full outside off, driven to sweeper's right"
<b>jumps up</b> from a length. It's moving and it's climbing. Seems like a good day to be a Yadav. Moeen watchfully drops this into the off side
full ball shaping away from middle stump. Stays deep in the crease and taps to mid-off
"short of a length at leg stump, tapped to long-on off the back foot"
nicely done. Mooen makes use of the freebie. Offcutter gone wrong from Pandya again. It's full and on the pads and it's whipped to deep backward square
"<b>creamed</b> but straight to the fielder at extra cover. Length ball is met nicely outside off, on the up"
<B>oh dear.</b> Moeen does the slice to mid-off again. Short ball slanted across him and he's gone with hard hands for a slog that looks silly by the end of it all. Extra cover pedals backwards and claims it
"length at the body, stabbed into the leg side"
"short of a length outside off, punched to mid-off on the rise"
oh nicely done. This batting line-up is far from dead. It's a poor ball from Bhuvneshwar. Knuckle ball dropped very short outside leg stump and he slaps it over fine leg
slanted into the body at a length and he jabs it wide of deep midwicekt
"slower ball at a length on off stump, adjusts after picking it late and defends it"
"nicely done. Makes room early. It's another slower ball at a length on the stumps, but this time he has the room to slap it wide of mid-off"
"<b>misfield by Chahal</b> at short fine. An overpitched ball on the pads, angled in from around the wicket. He whips it slightly to Chahal's right and the leggie dives over it"
it gets worse for Bhuvneshwar. Fires an overpitched ball down leg side
and again. Can't find that yorker. Can't find the stumps. It's fired down leg side again
full one headed down leg side again. He looks to whip it behind square but it pings into the open leg side off his pad
"short of a length on leg stump, tapped to deep square off the back foot"
"<b>dropped.</b> KL Rahul goes for one that isn't his. Runs back from extra cover as Buttler fluffs a slog against the googly. Dhawan, running in from long-off, doesn't go for it. Kuldeep could have had his fifth. He's furious."
"wrong'un, defended down the pitch off the front foot"
"<b>that's his first five-for!</b> Kuldeep had only just managed his best figures, against Ireland last week. But through sensational use of the wrong'un and flight, he had ripped right through England today. Buttler looks to long and straight once more and is beaten in flight again by a googly. This time it's for long-on to take. Kohli does it."
<b>ufffff that's huge.</b> Willey in the mood. Length ball spinning away but he's used his reach to nail this slog sweep
"front-of-the-hand, fired full at the stumps. Flicked into the leg side"
""
"yorker outside off, jammed into the covers"
<b>easy take for the bowler.</b> He's bowled a juicy full toss and Jordan has managed to get a big inside edge onto front pad that lobs up harmlessly for Umesh. A wicket handed much like the rest of the innings was handed - delicately.
short of a length angled in at the corridor. Sliced to point off the back foot
full and wide outside off. Gets the front leg out of the way to try and slash behind point. Beaten
full and very fast. Barely manages to shovel this out to long-on
<b>Dhoni leaps to his right</b> to stop this inside edge from sneaking through for four. It's a length ball outside off that he's trying to drill through extra cover
full ball darting in at the stumps. Inside edge onto the pad and it rolls back down the pitch
full inswinger at leg stump. Driven past the non-striker on the up
length ball very wide outside off. Can't reach that

"length ball wide outside off, can't reach it to connect off the middle. Ends up slicing it to deep point's left and comes back for the second"

full inswinger on the pads. Stands tall and flicks to deep square
"length ball wide outside off, left alone"
"<b>glorious.</b> This guy is possibly the next Rahul who might one day make the Hall of Fame. It's an outswinger at a length, a little wide outside off. He leans in, opens the face, lifts it over cover and clears the fence. While somehow keeping his elbow high and his balance perfect."
"another classy shot, straight to cover. Gets his hands through this outswinger, on the up"
"shot. Length ball on the stumps. Limited stride to keep his head right on top of it as he tucks it wide of mid-on. Good work from the fielder though, pulls it back in at the boundary with a slide"

"<b>caressed</b> through cover point. Length ball wide outside off. Big stride into the shot, deft hands, head still. On the up and into the boundary rope"

"easy runs. No swing, full and outside leg stump. Stands tall, tickles it fine"

"length ball on off stump, defended very late, into the pitch"
<b>jams it into the pitch</b> and gets it over point. Very full ball outside off and he's kind of yorked himself with a big stride. Adjusts nicely with the wrists though and gets the timing right

"<b>inside edge</b> past the stumps. Short ball, slower ball. Sticks in the pitch and Rohit is swatting at it while losing control of his bottom hand"
