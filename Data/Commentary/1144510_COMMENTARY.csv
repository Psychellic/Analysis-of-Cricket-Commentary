Rashid jogs to his right, picks up the ball, and has a clear chance of a run-out at the bowler's end. In fact, Rashid has way too much time, and he rolls the ball along the ground so that Gulbadin - running in from mid off - can remove the bails. But Gulbadin expected a faster throw, and he's on the floor, with the ball dribbling past his left."

"yorker, and he plays it back towards Bumrah. Collected on the bump, but the crowd gets excited as it looks a bit like a return catch"
"full ball, and he has pushed this away towards sweeper cover"
"straight, and full, and it's been given leg-before. Afghanistan want to review this, and <strong>have gone for it</strong>! There's no edge on this, the ball comes in and hits him <b>OUTSIDE THE LINE</b>. Not out, this will be then!"
"full ball, and he digs it out towards deep midwicket. Can only take one"
"short, angles across him. He looks to pull this away, but cannot get close to it. <strong>Delivered at 139kph</strong>"
"short, and he dabs it down at the stumps. Shami is quick to get to the ball"
"short, and might be called a wide. Not given actually, as Ikram allows this to get through"
"short, and he swings across the line towards midwicket. They will come back for two, so Nabi can retain strike for Bumrah"
"full, fast, and he can only dig it out towards point. Chooses not to take the single that could have been on offer"
"full ball, and he has dropped this towards extra cover. Long off, Rahul, gets around to it, and cannot prevent the couple"
"yorker, and he can only chop it down towards midwicket. Just a single..."
"around the wicket, a full toss, but fast, and it goes straight towards Rohit Sharma at short midwicket"
"full ball again, and he backs away and gets it out towards deep backward point"
"yorker, and he can only dig this out towards square leg. Keeps strike, but what an over from Bumrah!"
"<strong>drilled down the ground for four!</strong> He looks for the yorker, but misses his length, Nabi backs away and hits it straight down towards long on. Fifty for Nabi"
"full ball, and he has hit this towards deep midwicket. Refuses the single"
"<strong>yorker, and he has hit this down long on's throat! India come close to winning a thriller!</strong> Shami chases Nabi as he backs away, and plays a lofted drive, but it goes down Pandya's throat. India surely favourites from here?"
"<strong>THROUGH THE DEFENCE!</strong> Yorker, and he has got this perfectly. Alam backs away and tries to swipe this down the ground, but it crashes into middle and leg. <strong>Fast, straight and deathly accurate!</strong>"
"<strong>that's the hat-trick!</strong> Full, fast, and goes through the batsman again. Chetan Sharma did it in 1987, and 32 years on, here's Mohammad Shami, finishing off with two perfect yorkers, to win it for India! Mujeeb backs away and tries to go down the ground, but there was searing accuracy about that ball. <b>India get their 50th World Cup win with that, but well played Afghanistan!</b>"
