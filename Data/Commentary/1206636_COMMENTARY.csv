"<strong>absolute ripper cleans him up!</strong> A near perfect delivery, particularly to someone reluctant to come forward and cover the line completely, nice and full around off, threatening to keep coming in with the angle, straightens audaciously late and whizzes past the tentative prod to take out the off stump. Out comes an under pressure Azhar Ali"
"length and nice and tight around off stump, Azhar watches it through to the keeper"
"<strong>knocks out the captain with a cracker now!</strong> The length was the key again, it was full and shaping back in, Azhar Ali was rooted to the crease and played outside the line, in a manner you'd expect someone who hasn't made a fifty in over 12 innings, make it 13 now, as Azhar falls for a two-ball duck."

"length around off, defended, he's comfortable there"
"seems to be a concerted effort to go really straight at Babar, are they trying to knock his leg stump out? He continues to shuffle a fair bit, misses the leg glance this time as the full one slides down the leg side"

"full around off, better ball, defended"
"<strong>short and angled in and he hammers a pull behind square this time!</strong> They are checking if it's a four or a six, looks like it's gone all the way, and that's really what that ball deserved. Dimuth started well but is soon discovering the tiny margin for error he has at his pace"

"fuller and closer to off, left alone"
"tight leave but a good one in the end, it was length around off and straightening ever so slightly, the bowler had his hands on his head as Abid let it through. Pretty close but safe"
"length and too straight, tucked away towards midwicket for one"
"<strong>misses a full toss and given!</strong> It was really full and swinging back in, Babar was probably surprised by how full it was, no other explanation for why he missed that, but he also reviews straight away, which probably means he didn't miss it completely, after all. And yes, replays confirm an inside edge, Babar survives, Pakistan breathe"
"drops this massively short, and turns away. Abid goes back and cuts this away towards deep point"
"short again, and <strong>given the treatment again</strong>! Rocks back and that gives him time and space to place it where he wants. Goes a bit forward of square on the off-side this time"

"full, angles across him, and he lets this go through to the keeper"
"full, wide and he is lulled into a drive. Misses out on contact. No feet movement, and that's why he was playing well away from his body. <strong>Good bowling again from Vishwa!</strong>"

"short, turns across him, and he goes back and tucks this away to the right of short mid-wicket"
"skips down the wicket, and ends up yorking himself. Tries to drive it past mid-on, but that was fired in towards his leg. No room to get it past the fielder"
"length, nips back from outside off, as he <strong>stretches forward to defend</strong>. Loud appeal for leg-before, but a healthy inside edge on that"
"fuller, straighter, and he drives this hard. Fielded by mid-on, diving away to his left"
"this is good. It has nipped back in from outside off and pegged him on the pads. Given out, and <strong>Abid refers this</strong>! Beaten for pace as he played from the crease. The inward movement started from just outside off. No inside edge on this, all down to tracking now! It's three reds, and Abid falls to Lahiru Kumara"

"fuller around off this time, better stride forward and defends"

"<strong>snorter and Babar's lucky to survive!</strong> Another short one, this one kept following him, Babar, who was keen to come forward had no answers as he fended in hope, and luckily for him the ball, even though it had plenty of hang time fell right in no man's land."

"quicker, shorter and flatter, defended"
"pushed through again, full around off, Babar defends with bat and pad close, resulting in a massive appeal from behind the stumps but only bat there"

"flighted, and he looks to defend with a press forward. Takes the outer part of the bat, but pops up on the unprotected off side"
"presses forward and defends towards short leg, instead"
"presses forward and drives this towards mid-on. Vishwa Fernando is a bit deep, and that allows the single, even though it was to his natural throwing arm"
"<strong>ooh, this looks good. And it's given leg before!</strong> The batsmen consult, and Sohail decides to review. This looks a good decision at first glance. Length ball from around the wicket, that was tossed up around off, and turned back in, and struck him quite low. Sohail simply played down the wrong line, and that's the subtle variations that the left-armer has got in his armoury. Unless he's got an inside edge, he should be gone. It misses the bat, on replays! Three reds, and another wicket for Embuldeniya. Review lost by Pakistan too!"
"he goes down the leg side, and he sweeps this towards fine leg. Gets good bat on it"
"rising delivery at the body, well handled by Shafiq, who nudges it towards deep square leg to bring up a hard fought fifty"
"<strong>knocks him over!</strong> Perfect delivery for a bowler who tends to bring it back in to the right hander. Pitched just outside off, ideal length to hit top of off and that's exactly what it does as it bursts through the yawning gap between Rizwan's bat and pad"
"<strong>full, fast and straight and Kumara is hastening the end here!</strong> Yasir was caught slightly off balance as that fast inducker struck him on the base of the front pad, dead in front of the stumps. Kumara on a hat-trick"
"ohhh, another full and fast one, just outside off maybe, Abbas jams his bat down and keeps it out"
"<strong>that's nasty!</strong> Banged it in, followed Abbas who wanted to get out of the way but was beaten by pace. It did not rise as much as he expected and struck him on the front thigh. Sri Lanka take the review, and lose it as the replays show the ball would have missed the stumps"
"another fast, short one, following Abbas all the way, but he manages to duck out of its way this time"
"full around off, pushed to long-off, he refuses the single"
"tossed up on around off, comes forward and defends"
"a little short, didn't get on top of the bounce as he attempted the cut but the point is deep and this time they take the one. The field comes in"
"quicker and angled in, presumably going for the front pad, comes forward and defends"
"tossed up on middle, Abbas defends tentatively causing excitement around the bat"
"big appeal but would have gone down. It was the arm ball, Abbas missed it and was struck on the pad but the line was a little too leg side"
"full outside off, he leans into it and caresses it through the off side, beats the diving long-off to his left and earns four much needed runs"
"short around off, Shafiq ducks under it safely"
"full around off, nips back in, Shafiq nudges it to the leg side but refuses the run, not keen to expose Abbas to the pace of Kumara"
"length around off, pushes it into the vast vacant space on the off side, and this time they take the single"
"he goes length around off, the perfect top of the off length, Abbas stands tall and defends safe to the off side"
this one's a similar length but jags back sharply off the seam from around off and would have gone over as Abbas is struck high on the thigh
"draws him forward, he obliges and defends"
"full on middle, defended"
"angled in and full, defended"
"full toss on off, swatted away to long-off for one"
"<strong>cracking delivery, the perfect foil for Kumara's pace!</strong> Lovely loop, hangs forever in the air as Abbas pushes forward and isn't quite there to the pitch, there's a bit of turn that takes the outside edge and the easiest catch to slip"
"that lovely loop again, draws him forward and isn't quite there, Shaheen manages to defend it safely away from silly point though"
"full on the pads, he likes it there, clips it nicely in front of square for a couple"
"length outside off, gets on his toes, on top of the bounce and punches it through point for a couple"
"full around off, comes forward and pushes it back to the bowler"
"pulls his length back a little, Shafiq defends to the off side"
"length around off, defended solidly again"
"short ball, he swivels and helps it along to fine leg for one, strange that the field didn't come up but maybe they'll try and keep him at the spinner's end and attack Shaheen with Kumara's pace"
"tossed up around off, defended"
"tossed up on middle, defended"
"full around off, reaches out and defends"
"pulls his length back and angles it in, defended"
full and angled in and he managed to find the gap at square leg for one
"tossed up around middle and off, Shaheen lunges forward and defends back to the bowler"
"<strong>four for Lahiru and Shafiq falls to a soft dismissal!</strong> It was really a half tracker, Shafiq tried to help it along with the angle into him, it seemed to stick in the surface which meant Shafiq was through the stroke a fraction early, which resulted in a top edge safely taken at fine leg"
"full and straight, kept out, pushed into the off side, and they take one"
"length around off, punched to point"
"full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"length outside off, he goes feeling for it as rears disconcertingly, beaten"
"full and angled in, nudged to fine leg for one"
"fired across him, defends from the crease"
"tossed up this time, Shaheen takes the invitation, goes down on one knee and picks him up towards deep square leg for four"
"<strong>four for Embuldeniya and a brilliant catch from Mathews!</strong> It was tossed up and angled across this time, Shaheen came dancing down to launch over the leg side, got a massive top edge, Mathews had to run back from mid-off, which is never easy but he kept his eyes on the steepler throughout, and finally put in a dive to hold on"
"length, zips back in but from middle. Would have swung down leg, but there is <strong>some movement on offer</strong> for Afridi straight away"
"down the leg side, and Fernando looks to whip this away. Off the pad, and through to fine leg for four"
"fuller, from outside off, swinging back in, and he presses forward to defend this close to his left toe"
"fuller, and driven straight back down the ground. Beats Afridi in his follow through, and mid-on has to pedal back towards the fence and pull this back"
"short, and he <strong>somehow negotiates it well</strong>. Takes his hand off and allows this to go off his arm towards square leg. Short leg goes to his right to field, but they pinch a single"
"length, swings away from outside off, and he leaves"
presses forward to defend a delivery on a length just around off
"length, just around off, and he presses forward to defend"
"strays down the pads, and Fernando looks to whip this away. Off his pads to the right of square leg. Karunaratne wants the leg bye, and makes it quite easily"
"length, just around off, and he defends this from the crease without much ado"
"short, a bit wide, and he drives this but cannot place it well enough. Straight along the ground to point"
"<strong>a jaffa!</strong> Angles across him from a good length and beats him. He looks for a defensive prod, and misses out on connection"
"length, angles in towards the pads, and he looks to flick. Off the pad, and pops up towards square leg. They get a single"
"full, wide of off, and he looks to drive. Off the edge, and runs away between the gap between third slip and gully. Uppish, to be fair, and would probably have needed an exceptional catch from fourth slip, had he been there"
"length, and he defends from the crease"
"length, outside off, and he lets this pass"
"length, outside off, nibbles further away and he leaves"
"fuller, just outside off, and he looks to play straight. Almost falls over, and ends up skewing a shot towards cover. Fielded by the fieldsman away to his right. Good bowling from Afridi, who is looking to get him to over-balance"
"length, and he presses forward to defend this towards short mid-wicket"
"length, outside off, nips away a touch. Left alone by Fernando"
"length, and he comes forward to drop this dead at his feet"
Fernando presses forward to defend a length ball on the line of off
"length, just around off, nibbles away. Fernando has a tentative poke at it, and <strong>is beaten</strong>!"
"length, and he presses forward and defends compactly"
"length, just around off, nips back in, and Karunaratne defends. Seems a little unsure of which way to go with his feet. He's not enjoying facing Afridi at all"
"fuller, wider, and he drives with <strong>bat away from body</strong>! Flies off the edge and goes through the point region. Well played, you have to admit, as he knew where he wanted to put this. Square enough past gully and fine enough past the man at the point position"
"length, around off, and defends from the crease"
"fuller, a touch of swing away, and <strong>Karunaratne overbalances</strong> a touch again! Off the outer part of the bat, but he does well to keep it down. Through towards gully"
"full, outside off, and he presses forward a bit better. Drives towards mid-off"
"full, angles in to the stumps, looking for that leg before, but Karunaratne does well to flick this away towards long leg"
"length around off, and he defends with a slight forward press"
"length, but angles down leg. He plays this late, and keeps it low to get it down towards fine leg"
"length, angles across him, and he plays it with a straight bat towards cover"
"length, and he goes back and punches this towards point. Bowled at <strong>127.8kph</strong>"
"full, and just around off, and he leans into this. <strong>Gorgeous, as it goes past Abbas and hurries through to the long-off boundary</strong>"
"length, and he flicks this wide of square leg. Some hard running fetches them two easily"
"short of a length, angles across him, and he drops his wrist to let this get out of the way"
"full, wide, and he drives for this. Pakistan review for caught behind, but <strong>it's not been given</strong>! Seems to have beaten him at first glance, but Rizwan is convinced there is a feather edge. Good length, and lured him in to a drive, with his front leg going nowhere. <strong>They are seeing a spike as the ball passes!</strong> That's the first breakthrough, and terrific bowling from Afridi"
"length, just around off and middle, and he has to defend this after getting behind the line. Precise start from the bowler"
"full, angles away from him. He looks to drive, and chops it on to his front leg. Drops dead just by his feet"
"length, outside off, and he leaves it alone"

"length, angles away from him, and he defends from the crease, hopping to ride the bounce on offer"
"full, just across him, and beats him for pace as well as movement. Karunaratne is late with his attempted drive, as it thuds through to Rizwan. <strong>Delivered at 143kph</strong>"
"length, but starts from wide of off, and he can leave this alone. Cranked up to <strong>143.6kph</strong>"
"a bit shorter, and he looks to flog this through the off side. Beaten for pace again, as it hurries through with some pace to Rizwan"
"length, straighter, and he can whip this towards mid-wicket. Abbas has some running across to do to his left, and they take an easy single"
"length, just outside off, and bounces further away through to Rizwan. <strong>Went at 144.4kph</strong>"
"<strong>that could be close!</strong> Fullish ball, and strikes him on the pad, but the angle would probably have taken it down leg, as Karunaratne played back. Not given, and Afridi is talked out of reviewing this by his senior colleagues"
"full, slanting down leg, and he flicks this away towards long leg"
"full, angles across and he leaves"
"short, and he swivel-pulls this towards square leg. Hurries on to him a touch, and he can only get it towards deep square leg"
"length, and he lets it angle across him. A bit of late swing back in, but comfortably after crossing the batsman"
"length, straight, and he defends with a straight bat"
"full, wide, and he leans into a <strong>gorgeous extra cover drive</strong>. Vacant slot there, and that's where Karunaratne cashes in, with a big stride to get close to the ball. <em>Right </em>off the middle"
"<strong>beaten!</strong> Just got the length to pull back a touch, and angles it across him. Karunaratne has a poke at it, but fails to make contact. Good, fast bowling"
"short, and wide, and he leaves. <strong>Delivered at 145kph</strong>, but the direction could have been much better"
"a touch short and he looks to cut this away. Cannot beat point, though"
"<strong>beauty!</strong> Angles away from him with good pace again, and he can't lay a bat on it, looking for a defensive prod"
"length, and he looks to defend from the crease. From the inside of the bat towards short mid-wicket"
"length, around off, and he presses forward to defend"

"fuller, just around off, and he drives this to mid-off"
"length, outside off, bounces away as it seams across him, and he leaves"
"length, but down the pads, and he whips it away towards square-leg. Easy single as the fielder has to go across to his left"
"dug in short, and he ducks under this one. Fast and well-directed, as it forces Karunaratne to let it go across, and keep his bat as low as possible"
"back of a length, angles across him, and he defends from the crease"
"length, just around off, and he defends, pressing forward a touch"
"length, and he flicks this to the left of mid-on. Afridi goes across quickly and stops this from getting past him, but he cannot prevent an easy single"
"length, just around off, with a bit of seam movement away. Defended from the crease itself"
"length, across him, and he leaves"
"<strong>oh, he's played on!</strong> FDM will be disappointed with that, as it wasn't the best ball bowled yet. Abbas gets one to just grip a bit around off, and he looks to cut one that was far too close for that shot. Off the inside edge, and goes on to rattle timber. Timely wicket for Pakistan"
"length and probing away around off, Mathews gets nicely behind the line, back and across and defends"
"length around off again, nips back as Mathews shuffles again and tucks it around to deep square leg's right for a couple to get underway"
"<strong>squares him up with a legcutter!</strong> Same length, around off, Mathews shuffled and closed the face early, the thick edge bisected the cordon"

"short one, wasted delivery so far outside off, left alone"
"length and nipping back in, Mendis pushes it towards midwicket"

"full around off, good length to Mathews who likes to hang back, pushed into the off side for a quick single"
"length on the pads, pushed to midwicket"
"that's fuller and angling in, Mendis drives but drives a little early reaching out with his hands a little but manages to find the gap between midwicket and mid-on for three"
"great length, drawing him forward, around off, lunges and defends"
"same length again and he's getting it to nibble a little either way, this one was a leg cutter and nearly induced a leading edge as Mendis defended on the walk, keen to get to the ball"
"slightly shorter and much wider, left alone"
"length on middle, behind that nicely, defends back to the bowler"
"<strong>lovely leg cutter, teasing line and length beats the outside edge!</strong> Mendis is keen to get the ball but the length is always slightly shorter than he expects, shapes away after pitching"
"straighter this time, slightly shorter, defended more confidently. Probing over"
"short and wild, rather than wide, wayyyyyy down the leg side, the keeper saw it early but had no chance"

"length on middle, nicely behind that and defends"
"length and nipping back in, Mathews tucks it away to deep backward square leg for one"
"length again, pitches around middle and off before nipping back in, nudged to deep backward square leg for one"
"length outside off, too wide and left alone"
"short and wide, unlike Abbas, Mendis pounces on it, goes hard and up and over point for four"
"<strong>great ball and an excellent catch at slip!</strong> It's the legcutter again, Mendis goes searching for it with his hands as it isn't full enough, nips away as he makes contact, taking the edge and carrying quite low to Haris Sohail at slip, who had his fingers underneath the ball, by the look of it. Mendis, unsure, stands his ground, but the replays confirm it was a clean catch and Pakistan are well and truly back into the game now"
"length around middle, Embuldeniya defends but the bounce beats him, strikes him on the thigh as the ball lobs up to short leg"
"short one, he knew very little about that as he took his eyes off it but left his bat hanging, and even at Abbas' pace, it was well directed, just eludes his gloves"

"perfect straight up, gentle delivery but on the money, length that hits the top of off, in the channel, Mathews hangs back and guides it along the ground to the cordon"
"short and wide, very unlike Abbas, Mathews has an equally uncharacteristic slash it and is beaten. It was there for the shot but Mathews has hardly played a shot so far in this innings, here he went at it on instinct and missed"

"length outside off, hint of width and he uses Naseem's pace to guide it through the cordon for an easy two"
"<strong>knocked him over? No, in fact it's narrowly, inexplicably missed the stumps!</strong> It was a length ball that jagged back sharply and burst through the gate before taking a bit of the inside edge, flicking the flap of the pad, but went over the stumps to even beat the diving keeper with the exaggerated movement"
"gets this one to move away off the seam from a similar area, beats the bat"

"continues probing away on that length and line around off, Mathews skips down the wicket and defends, it's a teasing length"
"he was shaping to step down again, keen to get closer to the ball, the length as Mendis found out yesterday is never quite full enough, , this one's a bit wider and left alone"
"more poor fielding costs Pakistan, this was straighter, Mathews clipped it through midwicket and called for two, there was some hesitation which would have had Embuldeniya in deep trouble at the non striker's end on the second run but a wild throw saves him"
