"back of a length outside leg, and there's the bouncer for the new batsman to welcome him into international cricket. The left-hander ducks"
"good length on off, and he sticks his bat out to edge a tentative cut past the slip cordon. His first international runs as third man runs around the boundary"
"<b>and the debutant's gone!</b> Jarvis loves the angle across the left-hander, and his length ball on middle is not full enough to drive. Slashes at it away from his body, and the ball going across takes the outside edge. No mistake from first slip"

"<b>back-to-back boundaries!</b> Full outside off, and he bends his knee to cut this perfectly through the backward point region. Third man is too fine"
"a good comeback! Back of a length outside off, and coming into the batsman's body. He tried to flick towards midwicket, but the ball hits his bat and then almost rolls back onto the stumps. Almost"
"<b>top edged to deep midwicket!</b> And this is a big wicket for Zimbabwe. Quick on off, and the length ball isn't high enough for the pull. Eventually slices a grounded pull-shot over to the leg side and Chibhabha takes a smart catch running forward"

"good length on off, but zipping inwards. Doesn't have time to go onto the back foot for the cut. Slapped to point"
