"looking for the lap scoop. Flat and straight on middle and leg, Heazlett gets low, looking to sccop the ball over the keeper. Toe-ends it to midwicket instead"
"quality catch from Bailey. That was exceptional wristspin bowling from Boyce. He anticipated McCullum coming out so what he did to improve his chances of a wicket was loop it up, but dragged the length back, effectively bowling on a 16-18 yard pitch. McCullum doesn't quite get there, and the ball spins away. Takes the outside edge and lobs towards cover, went really high in the air. Watchful catch"

"good defensive bowling. A wide yorker outside off, hit away to the sweeper cover"
"flat and wide outside off, spins past the cut"

"another sweep, 90 kph, stays low and nails it, to deep square leg"
"Short strikes. What a spell this is turning out to be. Full around middle and leg, Heazlett walks right across, but it's full and quick, disallowing Heazlett from getting underneath the length. The ball hits him right in front of middle and leg. Plumb."

"a high full toss around off, hit to long-on. 1 for 20 and 122 off 69, life is sweet"
"oops, he misses his length. Looking for the yorker, he ends up dishing out a full toss. Easily heaved over square leg for a massive six. Great start to the over"
"goes short, and wide, Ross drags a pull to deep midwicket"
"147 kph, Archer takes a one-handed stunner! It's full and straight, Cutting clears his front leg and nails it back towards Archer, who sticks out his right hand, picks it out of the air and stares down Cutting. What an athlete. I can think of a few bowlers who would have hurriedly ducked out of the way"
"a good wide yorker outside off, Labuschagne can't lay bat on the ball"
"full and wide outside off, hit away to mid-off. 149 kph, beating the batsmen for pace"

"<strong>Wade misses a stumping and concedes four byes</strong>. Flat down leg, Labuschagne comes down but misses his swing, the ball goes through, past leg stump and past Wade"
"miscommunication. More flight around off, skewed away towards backward point. Ross wants one, then he thinks again, then goes through. Labuschagne is left mid-pitch. He finally has to go to the bowler's end. Backward point threw to the keeper, who threw it to the bowler on the bounce. Boyce was behind the stumps, took off the bails easily. Simple basics"
"flat on leg, Ross backs away and carves the ball towards point. This asking rate going up"
"terrific bowling, it's loopy but short, slapped to cover"
"85 kph, driven down to long-on. Superb spell from Boyce too, 4-0-23-2"
"the slower one, on off, driven to cover."
"a good short delivery outside off, hurries Ross for pace, who failed to get bat on his cut. Beaten for pace"

"full and wide outside off, Ross clears his front leg and nails a lofted drive over mid-off. Picked his area, and executed well."
"down the line forehand winner. Full and wide outside off, Ross backs away and swats it past mid-off. Power, fierce hit"
"short around off, 136 kph, pulled to deep midwicket. The throw is so bad that the ball hits the batsman as he tries to dive in and then hits the stumps. The third umpire confirms the batsman has just made it. That was weird. Actually, hearing they are also <strong>checking for obstructing the field</strong>. Did Ross get in the way or did he just try to get out of the way? Don't think he could have done much. He was seeing the fielder as he tried to make his ground, and the ball deflected onto the stumps via the batsman. Never seen that before. Wait a second, the third umpire has given that! A subjective decision, but for me, there is no way he intentionally came in the way of the throw because he was so close to the crease anyway. Bizarre decision. He did deviate in his running path, but that was surely to avoid the throw?"
"full and wide outside off, driven down to long-off"
"smashed for six. Flat around off, Steketee goes back and swats the heave over long-on. Enough timing"

"six more. In the slot, Peirson gets underneath the length and nails a drive right back at the bowler, smashes the sightscreen and does some equipment damage."

"150 kph, so quick it goes underneath the bat. A wide yorker outside off, beats Steketee. Wade takes one glove off and fires a throw to the batsman's end, misses, the ball goes to Archer, who has plenty of time to take off the bails."
"144 kph, another wide yorker, but this is deemed too wide for legality"
"swatted for four. Under 20 required now. Short delivery outside off, Peirson is hurried for pace but hits the ball past mid-off for four. He looked to hit that over mid-off, but that pace meant he was late on the shot"
"carved away over point for a couple. Full and wide outside off, Peirson carves a cut over the point fielder. Race back for two."
"they get four,wow, surely heat are favourites now. A low full toss, Peirson backs away, and drills a drive right back, picked his area, smashed for four."
"a slower delivery drifts down leg, wide. Peirson goes through for the run. Wade misses at the batsman's end. Christian runs lackadaisically towards the bowler's end, chooses not to throw and allows an extra run. He had to throw, there was no way Peirson would have come back if he missed. Poor game awareness"
"full around off, jammed away past the stumps for a couple to long-on."
"just one that time. Or a run and a run-out? Good length delivery around off, skewed to long-off. The throw to Christian, who takes his time, decides not to throw, then changes his mind and hits the stumps at the batsman's end. Doggett makes it with another acrobatic full-length dive. Wild finish"
"113 kph, offcutter around off, driven to long-off. Good result for Hurricanes."
"another offcutter, another bye, 116 kph, goes past Peirson's flick. Looked like he wanted two. But they will get one. Haven't seen so many dives at a swimming pool"
"a low full toss, shovelled away through midwicket for two. Peirson chooses to come back for the second."
"117 kph, taken at long-on. Another cutter on middle and leg, let's be honest, that was right in the slot. Smashed down to long-on, where Archer takes a catch running in. <b>Hobart Hurricanes win four games on the bounce</b> for the first time since their first four games since existence"
