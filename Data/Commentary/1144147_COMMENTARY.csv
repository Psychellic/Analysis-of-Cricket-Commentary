<b>beats</b> the outside edge as Elgar fishes inside the line of this length ball. It's on an eighth stump line. No swing on that
"swing in this time but Elgar handles it deftly. It's late and it's marginal, but he has to get the bat in front of his bat at a middle stump line quickly. He does so with plenty of balance and then gives mid-on a teasing sprint backwards before beating him at the line"
"another inswinger, but this starts down leg and Elgar leaves"

short and pushed wide outside off. Left alone
outswinger starts outside leg and hoops towards the stump. But it doesn't do enough. Goes past the pad down leg side
length ball skids low onto the pad. He goes deep in the crease and tickles it to fine leg off the bottom-edge
"<b>outside edge</b> carries through to Taylor and Elgar's habit of pushing inside the line has cost him his wicket. Looks like he was defending on the front foot for the one that comes back in, but this holds the line and slants across. He's not played this close to the body and it just carries to the keeper"

short ball in the corridor. A mistimed chop to point
<b>another one jumps</b> from a length. Not easy to gauge this pitch so far. He's forced to get on his toes to defend this
<b>keeps low</b> from a similar length this time. It's on an off stump and Markram has to reach downwards to get an inside edge on this to protect his stumps
nicely done. So important to make use of the bad balls during difficult batting periods. Markram doesn't miss out on this full ball on the pads. Allows it to come on and rolls the wrists to get the flick behind square leg
"length on middle stump, thuds his thigh guard as he looks to defend"

length and in at leg stump. Defended to mid-on off the front foot
<b>finds midwicket!</b> Klaasen picks the wrong ball to play a release shot. It's not there for the pull - just a tad too full. It's a strangely angled bat as a result. The ball has slanted in as well as he looks to go off the front foot. It's off the inside half and Mire lunges to his right and holds on
"<b>beaten.</b> That's...slow-mo vicious. Hoops in, pitches on off and zips past the outside edge. An anxious poke in front of the body from Zondo"

"superb. What a talent this guy is. Full ball outside off, late swing on it but he's in great position as it lands and drills it to the cover fence"
<b>outside edge</b> but down to third man. Not in control at all this time. Length ball wide outside off and he chucks his hands at this. Thick edge
"short and wide outside off, caresses a cut to point"
short of a length and in at middle stump. Can't get bat on this flick. It deflects towards third man off the thigh guard
"<b>can't hit the stumps!</b> Markram was halfway down the pitch as cover put this throw in at the striker's end. Terrible running from South Africa. Zondo gets a nice connection on this back foot punch and as a result, it bounces nicely to cover. So his call for yes is a bad one. Markram doesn't intervene and goes along. Poor stuff, but they've got away with it."

"length on middle stump, clipped in front of deep square off the inside half"
<b>got him!</b> Tiripano has done it. Markram doesn't last long after surviving the run-out chance. It's a short and wide ball outside off and he's looked to whack the leather off it. But it looks like that has extra climb on it and he's not able to adjust for that. Big edge to Taylor's right
"full on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"length ball in at leg stump, blocked on the front foot"

"back of a length and on the stumps, defended to cover"
"<b>Phehlukwayo plucks it out of the air</b> Steyn has two wickets now to go with his 60. Dug this in short, and he tried to pull it, but the fielder at short midwicket flies to his right to hold on with both hands. That came off the toe-end of the bat"

"length on off stump, looks to jab through the cover, but it drops into the off side off the bat-pad"
"yorker at off stump, jammed towards mid-off"
sweetly struck. This is full and in at off stump. He skips into the leg side and drills this between bowler and mid-off

<b>appeal for stumping</b> as Tahir rips a googly past Williams' outside edge. Klaasen looks confident. And it appears the base of WIlliams' foot has lifted and the toe isn't behind the line...<b>that's out.</b> Quick work from Klaasen after Tahir completely flummoxes the batsman after drawing him forward.

"short of a length outside off, stretches out and jabs to get it down to third man off the thick outside edge"
"length on off stump, defended off the back foot"
<b>straight to second slip!</b> This is falling apart quickly for Zimbabwe. Chigumbura is their last specialist batsman. He's looked to get a single at third man but his late cut is a lazy waft in the end and he has guided a simple catch for Hendricks. It was a short of a length ball with not enough room outside off for the cut
bouncer at an off stump line
<b>that's plumb.</b> Moor doesn't put in any sort of a stride against this full ball. It's a slider on leg stump. He's playing an off stump line. It's very soft and very meek - it's an embodiment of this chase. <b>Tahir is on a hat-trick.</b>
"<b>hat-trick!</b> Tahir has burst through Mavuta's defence with a googly and tonked his off stump. Fourth South African to do it after Langeveldt, Duminy and Rabada. It was on a length, it drew the batsman forward, and it was too good for him."

"<b>bowled him!</b> Jarvis with a heave across the line and he's lost leg stump. Among other things. It's another googly, at a length. Lobbed up slow, front leg out of the way. Misses. Just as well - the fast bowlers were waiting to have a go at Jarvis next over, no doubt. <b>Tahir gets his third five-wicket haul in ODIs.</b>"

"<b>beats the outside edge</b> and off stump. A slider, too quick for the batsman who is going back to try and cut this"
dropped short and very wide. He cuts aerially but this is safely wide of short third man
"floated up at a length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
<b>runs the hell</b> away from strike. Chatara backs away and jabs a length ball into the off side. Says yes and looks one way.
