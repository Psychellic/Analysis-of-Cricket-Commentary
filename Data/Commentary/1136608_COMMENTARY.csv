<b>swing.</b> Late away swing in the corridor. Rahul on the front foot and jabbing at this with soft hands. Gets it into his body off the inside edge
"good length at off stump, defended off the back foot"
late swing again. Length ball hooping away and Rahul stabs at it away from the body to run is uppishly towards third man
full and swinging in fast at middle stump. Gets the bat down in time to keep this out
"<b>dropped!</b> Parthiv Patel can't hold on with a one-handed dive to his left. Gayle and he are both expecting this to swing in. It does through the air before straightening. Gayle defends inside the line to get the edge, Parthiv takes a step to his right before leaping one-handed. Can't take it"
<b>ouch.</b> Gayle doesn't know about this one either. A bouncer slanted across his stumps that he's expecting to nip away. Expect it thuds him under the left shoulder
"length ball just outside, defended watchfully on the front foot"
"good length, some shape away in the corridor. Goes deep in the crease and defends down the pitch with soft hands"
"length ball at off stump, gets right behind it to defend into the covers"
Rahul walks into the leg side to expose the stumps. Southee follows him with a length ball and forces him to defend
"length ball slanted in at the stumps. Once again, can't do more than defend down the pitch"
"<b>swiped away.</b> Southee goes marginally short and with his stump-to-stump line, Rahul has the freedom to go behind square. He's got the ability to get on the back foot quickly too. Sends it over square leg"
<B>beats the outside edge</b> as Gayle is stranded. No feet as he hangs the bat out in the corridor. It fizzes past him
<b>struck on the thigh</b> and looking for a quick single! Yadav has Gayle rattled. Short of a length and into his body. He's very very late on the attempted pull and there's no run at short leg
<b>cramped</b> but he gets bat on this. Short of a length ball climbing up at his ribs as he looks to cut
"guides the yorker down to third man. Almost expects this ball from fast bowlers, Gayle. Stands tall in the crease and digs it out"
"<b>shot!</b> Cannot bowl short to Rahul this season! His game behind the wicket has improved dramatically. It's at his head, but slightly down leg side. He has no issues getting slightly inside the line and hooking over fine leg"
<b>falls short of AB</b> at mid-off. Rahul backs away to open up the off side. They haven't given him any room today. He's off balance as he tries to punch on the up while moving down leg side. Chips it and AB puts in a full length dive to his right and forward. Won't get there
"<b>hammered.</b> Poor ball. Short, very wide. Gayle pummels it well in front of cover"
yorker at off stump. Deep in the crease as he punches it back at the bowler who stops it with his left boot
"back of a length on the pads, whipped away to deep square off the back foot"
"short of a length on the pads. Looks to play the glance, gets it into the square leg region"
too short. Southee can't get that to climb at Gayle's chest and that means plenty of room for the batsman to swivel and swat this on the bounce to the midwicket boundary
"<b>full toss</b> this time and Punjab have a sensational over. Gayle has his front foot out of the way as he's backing into the off side. Gets behind the line, chips it over mid-off"
"<b>deft</b> from Rahul. Length ball at middle stump, gets right on top of the bounce and tickles it through the open square leg region"
"<b>see ya!</b> Umesh tries to become the wristspinning Yadav and fails woefully. A half-tacker, sits up nicely at off stump Rahul slogs it over midwicket"
"<b>taken at deep square!</b> Another short ball that looks to be on its way, but Colin de Grandhomme is stationed at deep square to snap this high to his right. He's five yards in from the boundary for some reason - strange on this small ground. But he's done the job. A <i>huge</i> wicket. Not the greatest ball - short and heading into the body"
"short of a length outside off, opens the face and runs it to third man"
<b>two-handed forehand</b> wide of mid-off. That is creamed. Short of a length and the first semblance of room Umesh has offered. Gayle backs away and slaps away
"<b>at deep square again!</b> Umesh's extended spell has yielded both openers. Short ball at off stump, he gets too far under it for the hook and it sails high. Siraj is calm under it and takes with the reverse cup. Umesh has done everything that was asked of him by his captain. Superb spell"
"full and in at off stump, tapped straight to mid-off"
"<b>he's guided it straight to slip!</b> Oh this is turning bad very fast for Punjab. Short of a length ball outside off and he's looking for the single to third man. It's not done too much - no crazy movement, no extra bounce. It's just a supremely placed shot to Kohli at second-ish slip"
"short of a length just outside off, opens the face and chops it to third man's right"
<b>just keeps it out.</b> Length ball speared in at off stump. No forward press as he defends this
oh lovely. Leans in as he caresses this through the covers. Length ball just outside off and the weight transfer through this is what gets him the runs
length and in at off stump. Jabbed into the off side from the crease
"short and wide outside off, cut straight to deep point"
floated up at off stump and he gets down quickly for the reverse sweep. Siraj cleans up to his left at short third man
"short of a length slider at off stump, backs away and gets the punch straight to extra cover"
dropped very short outside off but he can only get the pull straight to long-on
<b>bowled him!</b> Good old spinner's wicket - keep the single option open to a nervous batsman and bowl at his stumps. Stoinis looks like he wants to push it through covers but has pushed his front foot too far forward in anticipation. Yorks himself and loses his off stump
"tossed up at off stump again, driven back on the bounce to the bowler"
<b>beaten.</b> Length ball skidding through outside off and is too much for the attempted drive on the up
"short of a length just outside off, gets on his toes and taps it to point"
"full and just outside off. Front foot plant, sweetly timed drive to sweeper cover"
"short of a length just outside off, gets inside the line and slices to third man"
"full on off stump, driven straight to mid-off"
<b>oh what a shot!</b> Finch has generated an unbelievable amount of power for a straight-batted shot to clear the extra cover boundary. Very full and just outside off and this is so smooth - a clean lift to clear the ground
"offcutter, short and very wide. He doesn't move his feet and can't get the middle of the bat with the cut as a result. Gets it straight to extra cover"
"length and in at middle stump, clipped to deep square from the crease"
length ball slanted down leg side. He can't get bat on that
"length ball angled in at leg stump. Looks to dab it through midwicket and only manages to chip it into that region, closes the face too early"
"short of a length outside off, front-foot pull straight to short midwicket"
<b>is there a touch on that?</b> Sounded like it! Parthiv thinks it's out too as he goes down leg side to complete a take. Mayank looking to flick this. The umpire goes to the leg umpire...so he thinks there's a touch on this. <b>Asks for the third umpire with a soft signal out.</b> This doesn't look good for Mayank. Full ball down leg side and the bat is enough of a distance away to prove there's no pads involved. Parthiv has taken it cleanly too.
"back of a length, tucked into the leg side"
"back of a length, straightening around off, backs away and cuts to point"
"full and sliding into the pads, clipped away through square leg"
"drifts it onto the pads, tries to flick it away but gets hit on the pad. Pitching outside leg"
"length on middle and off, blocked off the front foot"
"back of a length, backs away and punches it out to sweeper cover"
"floats it up a little on leg, clipped off the pads to deep backward square leg"
"back of a length around off, punched down the ground to the left of mid-off"
sprays it down the leg side
"short of a length, cuts away late slightly, waits before tapping it through point for one"
"back of a length outside off, flat-batted to sweeper cover"
"just back of a length, tries to glance it fine but the ball grazes the pad on its way to Parthiv behind the stumps"
"full and angled in, flicked to deep midwicket"
"short of a length, angled across on off, Axar shuffles across and blocks down the pitch"
backs away and Moeen follows him with a shortish delivery. The angle only helps Finch as he swivels and mows a pull over deep midwicket
"slides on outside off, Finch backs away and chops it to the right of cover"
"back of a length, flat trajectories, shovelled flat on the bounce to deep square leg"
"short of a length around off, Axar punches off the backfoot to long-off"
"and he's picked out deep midwicket. Kings XI falling apart here. Finch picks up this length ball from middle and off and fails to get hold of this slog, skews it straight into the hands of Kohli in the deep"
"has Ashwin run himself out here? He's put in a dive that may have just saved him, No, in fact, it hasn't. That's pretty incredible. A wide, bad throw but Ashwin is nowhere in the frame as Parthiv breaks the stumps. The Kings XI captain dropped this length ball into the covers and just set off for the single but was sent back by an uninterested Axar. Kings XI in quite the mess here"
"back of a length, tucked to square leg"
"fuller around leg, pushed down the pitch"
"<b>ripper that nearly shaves the outside edge</b>. Short of a length, opening him up as it jags away ever-so-slightly off the deck"
"has he nicked off here? Yes, sounded like a feather. Tye tries to pull this shortish one that gets a little too big on him outside off and gets a mild top-edge that goes through to the keeper. Seems like he wanted to review that. At least that was the signal to the umpire but he ends up walking right past him"
"back of a length around off, drops it into covers for one"
"full, angled across off, Axar leans forward into a drive to the covers"
flicked uppishly through square leg
"fullish outside off, punched down to long-off"
"back of a length, spins in, tucked to square leg"
"straight on middle, flicked to deep midwicket"
"pitched up outside off, drills this uppishy towards mid-off"
"length ball that keeps a little low around off, worked away to mid-on where there's a misfield and they decide to try and capitalise on it by stealing a second. Not a bad plan, except that they don't account for the fielder recovering in time and firing a dead accurate throw that grazes Moeen's hand and takes out the stumps. Mohit is just short of his ground. Oh, and the fielder was AB de Villiers!"
punches a length ball into the covers
tries to pull a short one and misses as it gets big on him
swings and misses at a fuller ball
"length around off, punches towards mid-on and takes on the fielder for another quick run. No direct throw this time"
"bowled down the leg side, Axar swings and misses"
"short, angled across off, Axar drags a pull to long-on"
"length on off, stands tall and punches into the covers with bat and pad close together. An aesthetically pleasing shot, but quite useless in the situation"
"back of a length outside off, punched between wide long-on and deep midwicket. They try to push back for the second and has there been another run out? Yes. The bat's in the air as the zingers light up. Axar pays the price for failing to drag the bat across. Simply hangs it loose in the air and then tries to plant it down. But it's too late and he has to continue running in that direction towards the change rooms"
length ball pushed into the pads and he whips to deep square off the back foot
pushes a slider in at a good length on middle stump. Parthiv makes room and pushes to mid-off
"length on off stump, flicked to long-on off the front foot"
"length ball at off stump, stays in the crease and punches to mid-off with the turn"
length ball pushed into the pads. Flicked to square leg's left
oh well played. Goes deep in the crease as this skids into him. Stand tall though and keeps his head still to punch it wide of mid-on off the back foot
<b>leading edge.</b> Kohli walks down the track to try and flick a length ball that's swinging away in the corridor
"stays in the crease this time and punches nicely to find point. Short of a length in the corridor this time, no movement"
"<b>close call!</b> Length ball at middle stump, flicked straight to mid-on. It's timed well and Kohli has misjudged this one. Ashwin is onto it quickly to his right and fires a throw at the non-striker's end. <b>Kohli would have been short</b>"
whipped. So easy. Overpitched on the leg stump and he gets it wide of short fine
"<b>glorious.</b> Shot of the evening. The perfect cover drive. Length ball just outside off and Parthiv is quickly onto the front foot, leaning in to drill this between cover and extra cover"
short of a length just outside off. Chopped to backward point who parries it to his right after tumbling. They sneak a single because of it...and then they take an overthrow as mid-on tries to get to the throw backing up
"<b>boom!</b> Kohli was setting up for that shot with Rajpoot still two metres away from delivering. Length ball on middle stump, he has taken a tiny step into the leg side and whipped this well over the midwicket boundary"
"now he stays still and goes along the ground through midwicket. Short of a length ball at off stump, a short-arm pull past mid-on. Not timed too well, but it's a small ground"
"length on middle stump, taps it to mid-on's right on the up"
"length ball pushed well down leg side, won't get bat on it, will get a run"
<B>slices over the off-side infield.</b> Rajpoot getting special treatment. Length ball on off stump and Kohli is jumping down the pitch before if lands. Makes room and carves it over point
<b>dropped.</b> Finch lunges to his right at mid-off but can't hold onto this miscued shot. Kohli steps out again and turns this into a full toss. But his attempted shot is right off the toe-end and he ends up chipping it
well bowled. Length ball in the corridor beats the inside edge as Parthiv opens the face for the square drive
<b>beaten in pace</b> as he steps out. It's a knuckle ball from Tye that stops on him and he's forced to fend into the covers off the outside half
<b>slashes and misses.</b> Knuckle ball again. Grips on the pitch and climbs over his attempted square drive on the up
"length ball just outside off, pulls but it's too quick. Hits the high part of the bat and trickles out to mid-on"
bouncer climbs over his right shoulder. Nice height on that. Too steep for Kohli to try and hook
"<b>oh this looks plumb.</b> It's not given and Ashwin reviews straight away. If there's no bat on this, I reckon Kohli will be in some trouble. Misses a length ball headed for leg stump as he plants the front foot across...oh it's going down! That looked closer in real time. Turns out it's a very good decision. Among other things, Kings XI have lost their review now as well"
<b>inside edge</b> trickles past the stumps and rolls to short fine. Parthiv looking to flay one behind point but it's a knuckle ball
slower ball to start. Short of a length and just outside off. Pulls to deep midwicket off the inside half
drilled. Parthiv lives for this - a full ball with lots of width outside off. Half a stride before getting very fast hands through this to get it to the cover boundary
short ball skids on too quickly for him. Attempted hook deflected towards short fine off the glove
full toss on middle stump and he manages only a feeble push out to deep midwicket
"<b>nicely done Parthiv.</b> Top skill to adjust for the slower ball after getting in position for the hook. He's falling into the off side a tad, but he keeps his eyes on it and steers it past short fine"
a whip that's blazed away to the backward square boundary! Mohit drops it short and can't get enough height on the attempted bouncer
steps out and yorks himself. Length ball outside off and he's forced to jam it into the covers
"length ball at the stumps, punched down to long-on"
"<b>inside edge</b> onto pad, into the midwicket region. Parthiv looking to go behind square again. It's a full ball on middle stump"
"<b>lovely bouncer</b> has Kohli falling away into the leg side to get his head out of the way as he leaves. Of course, then he appears incensed that isn't a wide"
"<b>easy. </b> Short ball just outside off, third man is in. Opens the face and beats him"
"<b>ohhhhh yesssss!</b> Last ball of the Powerplay crunched over the long-off boundary. Kohli backs away to get full swinging room at this overpitched ball on off. Brings out the full swing too to lift this, flat"
"short ball just outside off, pulled on the up to long-on's left. Supremely timed"
short and wide. Waits for it to arrive. Opens the face very late to get it past point
"length on the stumps, tapped to long-on"
<b>falls short of Mayank</b> at deep midwicket. Parthiv miscues a pull. That gets too big on him. Slices it uppishly and it hangs enticingly for the fielder who pauses just a fraction before sprinting in and putting in a dive forward
"length on middle stump, looks to whip it, deflected pitch side off the pad"
a short ball just outside off. Kohli onto the front foot to pummel this to deep midwicket's left with a flat bat
"short of a length just outside off, dabs it to third man off the outside half"
"knuckle ball at a length, wide outside off. Steps out and mistimes a drive to long-off"
<b>beaten.</b> Another slower ball dying on the batsman from back of a length. Patel swings and it skids through from under his bat
<b>guided.</b> Bouncer in the corridor. Parthiv arches backwards to make room and ramps it to the third man boundary
"slower short ball at middle stump, hangs back and pulls to deep square"
"full on off stump, drives to long-on"
"<b>dropped</b> but it's also a no-ball. Kohli doesn't run. It's high and outside off, he lifts a simple catch for long-off who comes in, makes the ground, gets to the ball and then fails to hold on. Would have been game over if he had run there"
"<b>that's the win.</b> A bouncer wide outside off, he looks to hook, it's too big on him. Top edge over the keeper"
