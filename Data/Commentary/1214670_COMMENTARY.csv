"length on off, solidly blocked on the front foot"
"length on leg stump, clipped to short fine's right"
"length on off stump, flicks with the turn to square leg"
"<b>swiped over the midwicket boundary!</b> And on he goes, Liton. Length ball pushed at off stump, he gets under it and hurriedly gets the slog sweep out. Didn't quite have the swinging room but managed to clear the fielder anyway"
"sweetly done! Full ball outside off, puts out a big stride and offers the full face to loft this over the bowler"
"<b>wrong line</b>, and all Tamim has to do is put bat to ball to glance it to the fine leg boundary. Easy as you like"
"<b>good comeback</b>, Mumba pulls his length back and surprises Tamim with some extra lift outside off, beating the outside edge"
"Mumba's line drifts towards the pads again, this time just a single to midwicket as Tamim flicks"
"<b>cracking delivery</b>, angling in and shaping away through the air to beat a somewhat flat-footed poke outsidde off"
"but Liton's form is too good to miss out on these sorts of deliveries. Mumba floats up a full one, on his toes, and Liton just leans over it with a wristy flick to collect four"
"not quite as full this time, and it can't be put away"
"Tamim flings his hands out at a drive, bottom edging the ball behind him. Liton wants a single, and he's halfway down before he's sent back. No harm done though"
"rising off a length, outside off. Tamim rides the bounce, but can't beat backward point with a guide"
"<b>beaten!</b> Tiripano's made a good start with the ball here. He comes around the stumps, draws Tamim into a shot on the angle, then beats the outside edge with movement. There's something for the quicks in this pitch. Certainly good bounce and carry"
"just short of a length, it's punched off the back foot but straight to cover"
"wide outside off, and he runs it down to third man for one"
"Tiripano aims full, but his line drifts down leg and he's glanced out to deep backward square for a couple"
"short, rising over leg stump, Tamim's up on one leg to aim a Calypso pull down to the man at fine leg"
"this one is aimed full, at the stumps, and is pushed towards mid on. Quick single"
"mistimed, but safely so! Tamim aims a heave to the leg side, but the ball comes off the splice and only just clears the infield"
"another short one, but it's way too short and balloons well over Tamim's head"
"punched firmly, but straight to the cover fielder"
"<b>thrashed through cover!</b> Tamim backs away before the ball is even delivered, opening up the off side. He gets an excellent connection, and picks the gap too"
"<b>sliced over third man</b>, not where he intended but it goes all the way. Tamim backed away again and swung wildly at some width. He was aiming over cover, but the ball is sliced over third man - and carries all the way!"
"<b>majestic stroke</b>, Liton has the knack of scoring quickly without losing his poise or shape in the crease. The ball isn't a great one, slipping in towards his legs, but he makes the most of it with a sumptuous flick over short fine leg's head"
"<b>and this is just a gift</b>. Tiripano was perhaps aiming for the yorker, but it comes out as a full toss and is helped on its way down to fine leg"
"crunched firmly to cover, but Madhevere dives to his right to cut it off and stop the run. Tamim wanted a single, but he's sent back. And Tiripano's not back at the stumps either - had he immediately got into position, Tamim could well have been run out!"
"slower offcutter, and it's worked into the leg side with the angle"
"pitched right up to him, clipped to leg for one"
"chopped down towards gully, but easily stopped"
"he starts around the stumps, angling the ball in full. Tamim drives to cover, where the ball bursts through Raza's hands, allowing a single. <b>Replays show Mpofu had nothing behind the line</b>, the umpires have missed a no ball"
"very full, curving in through the air, and he's struck on the pad! Mpofu belts out an appeal, but the umpire is unmoved. <b>Zimbabwe ask for the review</b>. There's no bat involved, but ball-tracking shows it's umpire's call, so the decision stays. And Zimbabwe keep their review. And as they've run a leg bye, <b>the fifty comes up</b>"
tip-and-run single into the covers
<b>fiercely struck!</b> Liton steps forward and fetches the ball brutally over deep square leg. Timed it supremely
"nudged just to the left of mid on, quick single"
"worked off the hips into the leg side, using the angle"
"<b>and he's immediately biffed over long off!</b> Tamim wastes no time, charging the young bowler and thrashing a 78-metre six back over his head"
"speared down flat and fast, and it's punched to long on for one"
"glanced with the spin, out to deep square leg"
"Tamim telegraphs his intentions, getting down very early to paddle-sweep, but can't beat the man at short fine leg"
"hurled way down the leg side, huge wide"
"<b>appeal for lbw!</b> Liton swings across the line at a quicker one, but it's through him and hits the pad. The umpire says no, and <b>Zimbabwe review another one!</b> It looked to have pitched outside leg to the naked eye, with Madhevere having coming around the stumps. And indeed, replays show it pitched well outside. That's a waste"
"another quicker one, fuller this time, and Liton's paddle sweep is stopped by Taylor at short fine leg"
"speared down at his pads, glanced just behind square"
"attempted reverse sweep, but he misses it and it scoots past outside off"
"there's some grip and turn for Williams, but Tamim backs away to cut to the sweeper"
"Liton makes room, but a chopped cut is stopped by a diving point fielder"
"<b>swept, and it carries all the way!</b> There was a hint of top edge about this, but he's hitting towards the short boundary. In fact, it's caught by the fielder, but he's over the boundary when he takes it!"
"another sweep, along the ground this time"
"pushed through flat, aiming at leg stump, he backs away and cuts to cover"
"floated up outside off, a drive is stopped at extra cover"
"Tamim skips down the track, but Raza spots him coming and pulls his length back"
"too short, and it sits up to be hit but Liton picks out deep backward square with his pull"
""
"floated full, outside off. Liton unfurls a neat cover drive, but it's cleanly stopped in the infield"
"Tamim jumps out, and Williams spears a full one down the leg side, trying to get it past him. Tamim thrusts a pad out to stop it"
"<b>neatly glanced</b>, down to fine leg, and it has the beating of Taylor. Nicely played, using the pace on the ball"
"Tamim sets himself for another paddle, but Williams pulls his length back and he can only nudge to midwicket"
"floated up with much more flight, eased down to long on"
"a touch short, punched out to the cover sweeper"
"he drives down to long off, just the one"
"length and wide outside off, sliced on the up to sweeper cover"
"<b>taken at extra cover but they're checking for no-ball.</b> It's very very close. If he has managed to get anything behind the line, then it's by a few centimeters. But it doesn't look like he has any part of the heel behind it. Tamim stepped out and looked to whip one on the up over the leg side. Got an thick edge that lobbed up easily for the extra cover fielder. <b>He's been told he's out.</b> So the third umpire couldn't conclusively say that was a no-ball. A good start provided, nonetheless. And a nice first wicket to get in on debuts in T20Is for 19-year-old Madhevere"
"length ball outside off, opens the face and dabs this to short third's left"
"full on leg stump, flicked through midwicket"
"<b>another fifty.</b> Length ball on the pads, gets forward and clips it to deep backward square"
short of a length and pushed through quickly outside off. Looks to carve square on the off side and is beaten
"<b>big appeal for lbw</b> is turned down. That looked close. Length ball from around the wicket, middle stump line. Catches him on the back thigh as he misses on the slog sweep. Height?"

"yorker length at middle stump, jammed to short fine off the thick inside edge"
"<b>past the edge.</b> Length, drifted in and furiously spinning past the outside edge as he gets forward"
"full on leg stump, tickled to short fine with the angle"
"<b>scooped</b> past short fine. Tossed up outside off, walks into the leg side and gets this past the keeper down leg side. Taylor's laborious sprint at it from short fine will not get him to it"
"<b>given lbw.</b> Liton walks off, then turns around and changes his mind to get the review in with one second on the clock. A wristspin release from Raza but this slides straight on from a good length. Liton maybe expected that to spin away and was pushing outside off. He's also shuffled. Beaten on the inside edge, and struck right in front of off stump. Tracking confirms that is plumb"
"<b>smoked over the midwicket boundary!</b> Length on middle stump, steps out and gets the full swing from underneath it. Goes high but also 80 metres back"
"length on leg stump, poked through square leg with soft hands"

"full on off stump, driven to cover's right on the front foot"
"length on off stump, wristpinner again. Looks to flick but is through it early. It bobs down the pitch"
"short of a length outside off, steps out and chops to point who is caught flat-footed and puts in a terrible throw in panic. Rahim was a few yards short but the keeper could only put his pads together to try and stop that"
"dropped short at the stumps, pulled to deep square"
"<b>what a shot that is!</b> A slog sweep, dragged over the long leg boundary. Sensational. Length ball on off, shuffles and gets low and goes full-blooded"
"short at middle, pulled down to fine leg"
"short and wide outside off. Allows that to come on, opens the face and bisects backward point and short third man expertly"
"bouncer at a middle stump line. Sails over his head, left alone"
full and wide outside off. Looks to carve that between point and short third again and is beaten. <b>Given wide</b> and perhaps a bit harsh
"full and wide outside off, shuffles to shape for the ramp. Cops it on the leg and it's a single at short fine"
<b>oh not there.</b> Full toss on leg stump. Rahim just swivels and carts that over the long leg boundary
"<b>taken at mid-off.</b> Full ball slanted across him. Gets his weight on the back foot and looks to scoop it over the infield there, but it's off the low part of the bat and taken at the circle"

"legcutter, dropped short and slow at the ribs. Gets behind it and tickles it to fine leg"
"low full toss outside off, gets low and slaps it like it's a hockey ball, wide of long-on and over him too"
yorker at middle stump. Splits his legs and gets low to try and whip this behind square on the leg side. It trickles towards the keeper off his leg. Got an inside edge before that
walks down leg side to make room. Bowler follows him and lands it full. He's beaten on the attempted inside-out loft
"dropped short at the hips, pulled down to fine leg. Taylor fumbles there after getting his hands to it but the batsmen are not alert to the extra run on offer there"
"full at the stumps, driven to deep midwicket"
low full toss in the corridor. Soumya wayyyyy down leg side and is reaching out and flapping for this from there. Under-edge through to the keeper on the bounce
"slower ball, short of a length and into the hips. Waits on it this time and uses the angle to tickle it fine"
slower ball at a length and following him down leg side. Whips it to fine leg
"length and wide outside off. Looks for the slog sweep, gets a thick inside edge to short fine"
slower length ball outside off. Steps out and has a slog after reaching out. Lands feebly in front of deep midwicket after coming off the toe-end
"length ball wide outside off, looks to drag in the midwicket direction with a slog. Gets it to long-on off the toe-end"
"short ball at the front shoulder, stays put and has a hoick at it. Off the glove and into the fine leg boundary"
"slower ball at a length and going down leg side. Looks to sweep, gets it off the glove to fine leg's right"
<b>clears long-off!</b> Much better batting. No shuffling or moving around. Stays still and gets a full ball just outside off. Half a stride into the leg side and a clean swing with the full face offered at first
"<b>beats the outside edge with a cutter.</b> Length ball, ripping away from the corridor as he looks to tuck this into the leg side with the angle"
"full and wide outside off, mistimed drive into the extra cover region, but it will <b>bring him his second T20I fifty.</b> The first one came in February 2018"
"full outside off, clears the front leg and slugs it along the floor, down to long-on"
<b>sends it far over long-on!</b> Full and in at the stumps. Makes some room by getting into the leg side and gets under it before slogging  it cleanly
<B>slaps this over the midwicket boundary!</b> That brings up 200 for Bangladesh. Follows him with a short ball and he's up to it as he smokes it right off the middle. A lovely sound and a lovely sight at the end of it too
"<b>that'll do!</b> Well, Tinashe Kamunhukamwe was slammed the first ball straight down the ground for four. He opened up his stance, and smeared it back past the bowler"
"<b>over extra cover now</b>, again he opens up his stance, clearing the front leg, and whipping his hands through the line. He doesn't bother keeping it down, lifting the ball over the cover field"
"sprayed down the leg side, even as Kamunhukamwe walks across to the off side to set himself for a scoop over short fine"
"short and wide, and the batsman <b>swings and misses</b> at the ball"
"just short of a length, and this time he's back and across to defend"
"on a length, he aims for a straight drive but mistimes it. Mustafizur took the pace off this one"
"another huge heave, but again he hits only fresh air. Kamunhukamwe's not going to die wondering!"
"<b>could have been run out!</b> What was Taylor thinking? He tapped this to mid on and just set off. The fielder swooped and hurled at the stumps, and had it hit he would have been out by several yards"
"<b>and now at the other end</b>, Kamunhukamwe nudging the ball to midwicket as they steal another quick single. Taylor almost collides with the bowler, which slows him down, and the throw at the striker's end goes wide. It's all happening"
"driven on the up, but without much timing, into the covers"
"seaming in off the track, and honing in on the off stump. Taylor defends, cramped for room"
"Taylor shuffles across to the off side and fetches the ball towards short fine leg, but picks out the fielder again"
"<b>flicked uppishly, caught!</b> Taylor's troubles continue, and his dismissal tonight is very similar to that in the Sylhet ODI. Taylor makes room, Shafiul follows him with a length delivery, and he flaps it in the air to be easily snaffled by the man at midwicket"
"zippy yorker to start with, and Kamunhukamwe has to hurry to dig it out"
"pushed too far down the leg side, and Mushfiqur fumbles his take to let them through for a single as well"
"<b>welcome back!</b> Well, Ervine looks like he's back to full health as he leans into a flowing cover drive at his very first ball, thumping the ball through the gap and out to the cover boundary"
"angled across him from around the stumps, Ervine hangs his bat out and the ball zips past his edge"
"straighter this time, Ervine tucks it off the hip for one"
"very full, but headed down the leg side. Kamunhukamwe misses his glance, but the run a single off the pad"
"very full once again, Ervine nudges off his toes for a quick single"
"nicely straight, and leaping at him off a length. Ervine's cramped for room as he defends"
"<b>quick run!</b> The ball took the bottom edge of Ervine's poke outside off, landing near the stumps, and Kamunhukamwe charges through. It's tight, but he's safely home"
"dug in very short indeed as the batsman gives him the charge, the ball balloons off the surface over the batsman and the keeper too"
"punched firmly off the back foot, but he can't find a way through the covers"
"<b>smeared back past him!</b> Not the prettiest shot by any means, but mighty effective. He clears the left leg out of the way and swings through the line to slice it back over the bowler"
"<b>big appeal for lbw</b>, but the umpire's not interested. And it did seem there were two sounds as Kamunhukamwe jabbed down on a nippy yorker. No review asked for"
"neat little punch from Ervine, who can't quite get it through the covers but places it well enough to pinch a single"
"slugged hard into the covers, but he pings the field"
"<b>Ervine's trapped in front!</b> He walks into a flick into the leg side, but plays over a ball that zips in to him through the air and off the track. It's nicely full, and looked to be heading for middle and off"
<b>snorter!</b> The ball is dug in and shoots across him on the angle to beat the shoulder of the bat
"chipped up and over point, young Wesley working with the angle as the plays a scooped drive. Doesn't have the legs to reach the boundary though"
"another rising delivery outside off, but this time he's up on his tippy toes to ride the bounce and get it down to third man"
"short again, Kamunhukamwe's up on one leg to pull it and connects well, but there's a man positioned at deep square leg to cut it off"
"flat and fast to start, and it's hurled down the leg side. Seven wides in the innings already"
"this one's aimed at his pads, and is worked through midwicket to turn the strike over"
"Madhevere hops back to leg in his peculiar fashion, but misses a flashing square drive"
"<b>is he run out here?</b> This looks very tight! The ball is tucked into the leg side, and they push hard for a second run. But the throw from the deep is a good one, as is the take from Mushfiqur. He collects it in front of the stumps, whipping his gloves back in a flash to disturb the stumps with Madhevere just short of his ground. Bangladesh have a third strike inside the Powerplay, and they're bossing this"
"he comes around the stumps to Williams, who is forward to defend"
"speared in to the toes, Williams glances and there's a slight misfield at midwicket, allowing a quick single"
"short, but it's crunched straight to point"
"<b>carved through cover!</b> He starts with a quicker one, but it's short and wide outside off and Williams leans back to hammer it through the off side"
"that's better, fuller and straighter. There's some grip in the surface too, cramping Williams for room"
"another legbreak, Williams uses the turn to find a single in the leg side"
"the batsman waits very deep in his crease and swipes across the ball to place it into the leg side, another single"
"offers a little more flight on this delivery, which lands close to Williams and is driven down to long on for one"
"landing wide, and going wider with the spin. Kamunhukamwe waits for it, and then crunches a punch off the back foot to collect another boundary. That was a freebie"
"nice line to the left hander, Hasan comes around the stumps and tests Williams in the channel. Defended to cover"
"floated up on the breeze, Williams is forward to push it to point"
"<b>biffed over cow corner!</b> Williams skips out to get close to it and swings cleanly through the line. Pings out the middle, and goes all the way"
"again Williams is on the charge, but can't quite get to the pitch this time, driving to long off along the ground"
"width offered outside off, but the cut is intercepted by the sweeper"
<b>slog swept into the stands!</b> Williams bends low into a mighty shot that clears the rope with ease. Zimbabwe need more of this!
"<b>Kamunhukamwe follows suit!</b> This was too full, landing in the slot, and he swung it straight back over his head"
"<b>gone this time!</b> He was aiming for another maximum, but the connection just wasn't there. This one was also a little too full, and he couldn't get underneath it enough. Long off makes no mistake"
"<b>caught off a full toss!</b> Williams is livid. It was a high full toss, and he could have hit this almost anywhere. Instead, he picks out the man at deep square leg, directly. Soumya barely had to move before the ball landed in his lap. Suddenly, Aminul's on a hat-trick!"
"well, the full toss worked against Williams, but Mutumbami isn't suckered in by it, whipping a high full toss out to deep midwicket, and making sure to keep it down as he does so"
"full and wide, outside off, and it's pushed to point"
"width offered, outside off, and he cuts out into the deep"
"chopped down behind square, but he can't beat short third man"
"<b>sliced in the air!</b> More width was offered, and this time Raza flung his hands through the shot with rather more vim. The ball goes in the air, but just past the diving fielder at short third man, who had just been moved!"
"spinning sharply in, beating a whip to leg"
"and now this one keeps low, Raza bottom edging a cut"
"spinning in from outside off, Raza bottom edges another attempted glide to short third man"
"crunched hard, straight to mid off, five dots in the over!"
"lenth outside off, jabbed through covers on the front foot"
"beaten. Slammed in, short of a length outside off. Looks to guide that down to third man"
"length on middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
"yorker length just outside off, jammed down to third man"
<b>chipped wide of mid-off</b> and that runs away from Liton who gives chase. Length and in at the stumps. Makes room and just punches on the up. In the air but safely wide of Liton
length and in at leg stump. Looks to flick and gets a leading edge towards mid-off
short of a length and pushed across off stump. Backs away and mistimes the cut towards mid-off
is that <b>dropped?</b> Seems so. Short of a length and turning back into the corridor. Looks for the late cut and it looks like it has come off the outside part of the bat and into Rahim's body as he grabs for it
"<b>taken.</b> On the second attempt. Short of a length, slides straight on in the corridor but keeps low. Raza looks to punch through the covers but it takes a feather of an under-edge and he's gone"
"length outside off, gets forward and flicks into the leg side. Bowler tidies up and doesn't let them get a single"
"short of a length at off, punched to sweeper cover off the back foot"
"full outside off, gets well forward and flicks to deep square"
"full at the stumps, clears the front leg and drills it down to long-on"
"length at off, steps out and flicks to long-on"
"length at middle stump, big stride out and a clean swing with the slog sweep. Gets it square and clears the ropes too"

"tossed up full and wide outside off, driven aerially to sweeper cover"
"<b>taken at short third man.</b> Tossed up outside off and he takes the bait. Skips down the pitch to try and go over the off side, but ends up getting a thick outside edge that's straight to the man positioned there"
"short of a length outside off, chopped to backward point's right"
"length at off stump, pushed back down the pitch on the front foot"
"full on leg stump, driven to long-on with the turn"
"length and pushed through outside off. Looks to drive through the line, beaten on the inside edge"
"<b>wow!< How'd he clear the rope there?/b> Stunning power. Length and pushed through flat outside off. Doesn't turn but he goes through the line, on the up, and it flies flat over the extra cover boundary like it was a fast bowler who delivered that ball"
"full at off stump, jammed down the pitch"
"<b>wonderfully taken at extra cover.</b> Liton Das runs backwards and gets the reverse cup out to take a difficult one. Full ball outside off, probably a cutter. Lines up and looks to slog it over the leg side. Ends up slicing it high, it'd land in front of long-off if there wasn't anyone there. But Liton keeps his eyes on it and lunges backwards to hold on"
"short of a length and wide outside off, slashes at that and is well beaten"
"cutter, short of a length in the corridor. Has a swish at it and is beaten"
smartly done. Jumped into the off side to negate the line which will always be across him from Mustafizur. Then dropped his shoulder and ramped this to the fine leg boundary. It's hit the boundary padding and the third umpire deems it has hit it on the full after fairly long deliberation
"yorker outside off, just inside the tramline. Left alone"
another yorker wide outside off. Has a hack at it but it's too far away for contact
"short outside off and absolutely spanked off the back foot, well in front of sweeper cover who doesn't even bother"
"length outside off, beaten on the attempted slog sweep"
"length on middle stump, clipped to long-on off the front foot"
"length ball wide outside off, beaten on the reverse sweep"

"length on off, leans out and drives to long-off"
"<b>sliced high and dropped at long-on.</b> Length ball across off. Looks for the slog sweep but gets too far underneath it. Carved high. Soumya covers a lot of ground to his right, running in, gets to it and then puts it down"
"length on off stump, driven on the rise to extra cover"
"full on of stump, mistimed slog trickles down to long-on"
full and dipping in at the stumps. Jammed down to long-on
"<b>dragged onto the stumps. But has he overstepped?</b> No, looks just okay. Slower ball at a length, skids low and he's through the attempted slog too early. Gets an inside edge and he's gone"
"yorker at off stump, hurriedly chopped down to fine leg off the inside edge"
"short of a length on off stump, punched to sweeper cover off the back foot"
"<b>sweeper cover over-runs that.</b> Looks like Saifuddin. Full slower ball outside off, clears the front leg and scythes that. Takes a turn late as it fizzes through the outfield and beats him to his left"
"short at middle stump, beaten on the heave"
full slower ball on middle stump. Thick inside edge towards deep square as he looks to slog

"short of a length, cutting away from the attempted slog outside off"
"short and wide outside off, beaten on the upper cut"
"short and cutting away outside off, beaten on the pull"
"<b>taken at long-off</b> and Bangladesh are into the lead in the series. Cutter at a length in the corridor, looks for the long hit again, ends up slicing that high and harmlessly for Liton there"
