"length on the stumps, turned to midwicket gently"
strays on the pads that time and is tickled to backward square leg comfortably
<b>glorious</b> a little wide and full and he leans into a peachy looking cover drive that threads the in-field.
"given room and he goes back and across to cut it, doesn't try to hit too hard, but doesn't find the gap, straight to point"
"fuller and closer to off stump now, patted down the ground to long-off"
"missed out, Washington strayed on the pads and he's flicked it, but straight to short fine leg"
"fuller outside off, not much swing first up, stroked into the covers but not in the gap"
"and there's the swing Chahar gets. Moving away from Hendricks to square him up, takes a thick outside edge off his forward prod to roll towards cover"
"<b>beaten</b> and good carry to the keeper. Pitches on off and jags away in the channel, leaving the batsman feeling for the ball"
"bad ball and Hendricks takes advantage gratefully. Strays on the pads on a length and it's easy pickings with fine leg in the circle, clipped off his hips to the boundary"
"after the first one carried well, this one died on the way to Pant. But same result as earlier, with the ball going past edge. Back to his off stump line, and he goes for the drive but is beaten on it"
"fuller on the fourth stumps, mis-times his drive to mid-off"
"thick edge from an attempted drive outside off, and it flies over where second slip would be into the third man boundary"
"<b>speared through extra cover</b>. Not much follow through to speak of, but great timing by de Kock, who drives this on the up from outside off"
<b>he's picking them all over</b>. Too full on the stumps and he effortlessly flicks this through midwicket to the boundary. 3 in 3! all to different parts of the ground
given room outside off and he unleashes a free-flowing drive but this time it's to the fielder at cover
"length ball, on the stumps, glided to third man. Stayed still in his crease and played it late"
"beaten on the punch. Length outside off and hint of movement inwards, snakes past the inside edge, with bat well away from body and feet not really moving"
"<b>imperious</b>. Down on one knee and square drives this through point and threads the gap again. Given room outside off and he could free his arms, but did it so pleasingly"
"too full on leg stump, clipped off his pads to deep square leg. This is looking like a batting beauty - or perhaps it's just de Kock who's making it look so"
"length ball, tight line on the stumps, tucked to midwicket with soft hands to run through for a quick single"
"too full outside off, and unleashes a powerful drive, but extra cover moves to his right and intercepts"
"<b>taken at mid-on</b>. That was an ugly looking shot, especially in contrast with de Kock going so well at the other end. Fuller on the stumps, mis-times his hoick badly and ends up toe-ending to the fielder who was at the edge of the circle."
"length ball on a tight off-stump line, defended watchfully into the off-side"
"darting into the stumps, pushed towards cover and the bowler runs across to his right to field"
"quicker one at 97 kph on the stumps, jabs it back towards the bowler"
"given a bit more room outside off and he square drives it, but straight to point"
came down the track but ended up yorking himself to one that was given more air
"length on middle and leg, he goes back and whips it through midwicket"
"oooh, draws an outside edge. that went with the arm and Bavuma was playing for the turn, pushing it towards mid-off but it squirts to short third man"
"<b>just clears Kohli running back from mid-on</b>. Good ball from Chahar, who bowls a surprise short one and gets it to climb a bit higher than de Kock anticipated. He goes for the pull but ends up toe-ending it over mid-on. Kohli's quick but it falls just over him"
"gives himself room to try and lash it through the offside but Chahar keeps it on a length and on the stumps, and he under-edges it down"
<b>smoked</b>. Stays in his crease and goes back to drive this powerfully through extra cover.
"angled into him, almost a yorker, he makes room and opens the face of the bat to drive, but a good tumbling shot from Dhawan at point prevents a run"
"length ball on the stumps, clearing his leg again, hoicks it to a wide mid-on. Doesn't play it in the air"
"walks across to whip this length ball from outside off, but straight to midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, slapped to deep point"
"full on middle and off, gets forward and clips to deep midwicket. No one saving the single in front of square on the leg side"
length ball turning in towards off stump. Shuffles across and tucks it just behind square on the leg side
"full on middle stump, clipped to long-on"
"full again, angling in towards off stump from slightly wide of the crease. Whipped away towards long-on"
"length ball sliding on with the angle towards leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"shortish, wide-ish, gets on his toes and carves it away to deep point"
"full, on middle and leg. Goes for the leg-side whip, goes too early, and the ball dribbles away into the off side off the leading edge"
"shortish slower ball, pulled to deep square leg"
"short, down the leg side, but he has protection at fine leg to mop up as de Kock swivels and pulls"
"short again, not the slower one this time, and Bavuma has monstered it over deep forward square leg. Picks the length nice and early and pulls it deliberately in the air, easily clearing the boundary"
"short again, but much slower this time, and wider outside off. Loopy bounce beats Bavuma's bat as he looks for the uppercut"
"shortish outside off, pulled with the turn to deep midwicket"
"fullish, angling into middle and leg, clipped to deep midwicket"
"lbw shout as de Kock misses the reverse-sweep, but he had shuffled across and the impact was outside off stump. The ball rolls away off the pad into the midwicket region"
"shuffles down the track against this slower, flighted off-stump ball and clips it to deep midwicket"
"shortish, at the hip, and de Kock whips it over the top and finds the backward square leg boundary"
"fuller now, clipped away through square leg"
"full-toss - was it above waist height? Tucked off the hip into the leg side, not called no ball"
"length ball close to off stump, nice use of the wrists to steer this away to deep point, where a fumble from Shreyas Iyer allows the second run. Then his throw at the bowler's end isn't backed up by anyone, and they run a third too"
"fullish on middle and off, driven down to the left of mid-off"
"slower short ball, but too much width on this occasion, and Bavuma has all the time and room in the world to slap it away to the left of the deep point fielder"
"another short ball, and again it's got too much width on it. Successive freebies, successive slaps to the left of deep point"
"fuller, angling into off stump, pushed towards mid-off"
"fullish on middle and leg, clipped down the ground to long-on"
"length ball, a little slower than usual, swiped away to long-on"
"tossed up full outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
"short, turning down leg, and de Kock whips it away off his hip and just about manages to beat Saini diving to his right at the deep backward square leg boundary. Brings up his half-century too"
"just short of a length on off stump, opens up at the hips and pulls to long-on"
"full on middle stump, clipped into that vacant midwicket region again. Jadeja's been happy to give Bavuma the single there, and Bavuma's been happy to take it"
"back of a length on off stump, angling in. Hops back and jabs gently into the cover point region"
"what. A. Catch. Kohli takes it, running to his left from mid-off and then finishing with a tumble. It's just short of a length from Saini, an offcutter angling across the stumps. De Kock clears his front leg and looks to go over midwicket, and ends up slicing it back over the bowler's head instead, a little to the off side, and Kohli had a lot of ground to cover, but he makes it up with a brilliant bit of athleticism"
"length ball angling into off stump, clipped to the left of midwicket, and there's a brief moment of hesitation as Washington scurries in to field it. Van der dussen is briefly out of his crease at the non-striker's end but all's well in the end, with the throw fairly wide of the stumps"
"off-stump yorker, dug out to point"
"full, angling into middle and leg, whipped away to fine leg, off the inside half of the bat"
"back of a length, close to off stump, punched to deep point"
"gone, another excellent catch. It looks less spectacular when Jadeja does it, because, well, he does it so often. Length ball fired in towards middle and leg. Looks to play the angle and work it into the leg side, but this one grips and bit and turns. The leading edge pops in the general direction of the non-striker's head, and Jadeja flings himself across and grabs it with two hands"
"flat length ball on middle stump, punched down the ground to long-on"
"tossed up slow, wide of off stump, and that's nicely driven, with some whippy wristwork to generate power. Beats Kohli diving to his left at short extra, and the man sweeping on the square cover boundary has no chance"
"tossed up full, angling into the stumps, clipped away through midwicket"
"back of a length, slanting across to off stump, opens his bat face and stabs to deep point"
"length ball close to off stump, uses his wrists to steer it to the sweeper at deep cover point"
"flat, back of a length, angling into off stump, no turn. Looks to carve through point  but he's cramped for room a bit. Stabbed into the covers off the inside half of the bat"
"slower now, gets forward for a push to the right of backward point, and he has to hurry to beat Jadeja's throw to the non-striker's end"
"on the pads, worked away square on the leg side"
"shortish, a bit of width, slapped through point off the back foot"
"tossed up, angling into the stumps, clipped to the left of deep midwicket. This is a big outfield, and the ball was going to Saini's weaker side, so two runs were always available if they hurried"
"back of a length on the stumps, whipped away to deep midwicket"
"slower ball on a length just outside off. Looks to shuffle forward and across and sweep, but he misses and the ball hits his front pad"
"shortish slower ball, flat-batted to long-on"
"length ball on the pads, clipped to fine leg"
"mis-directed attempted yorker, ends up a half-volley on the pads and he plays the pick-up shot off his pads, sends it aeriel, but it lands short of the man at deep midwicket"
"back of a length, goes back and swivels to pull this to fine leg. Doesn't time it all that well"
"length ball in the channel, gives himself room to drive this to mid-off and take a quick single"
"floated up outside off, he goes across and works it to long on"
"length ball into the pads, goes back and works it off his pads to short fine leg"
"skips down the track and takes it on the half volley, flicks to deep midwicket"
"angled on the pads, and he works it into the gap on the front foot, between deep square leg and deep midwicket. Played softly enough to come back for two"
"<b>inside out and over the top</b>. Gave it some more air, and Miller decided to go after it, didn't get it completely off the middle but got enough meat to have it carry over extra cover"
"darted in quicker, skids on, and it's tucked to short fine leg. Was hurried into the stroke a little, and the ball went off the inside edge, or inside half of the bat"
"back of a length, pitching outside leg and angling towards leg stump. Looks to work it square and ends up inside-edging into his front pad"
"low full-toss close to off stump, looks to make room and force it past extra-cover but can only hit it straight to the fielder"
"in the blockhole on middle and leg, correctly reading Bavuma's intentions to hit through the off side and denying him both hitting room and leverage. Jabbed back to the bowler"
"slower ball on a good length, angling into the stumps. Looks to step across and scoop over his shoulder, but gets no pace to work with. Doesn't middle it either, and it rolls gently to the keeper"
"nice and full again, on off stump, this time he gets just enough room for a forceful drive to the right of deep point, and Jadeja makes an excellent tumbling save on the boundary"
full-toss angling into the pads - followed Bavuma who was again looking to make room. Can't connect with the flick and the ball rolls off the pad into the leg side
"slower ball, just short of a a good length outside off. Shapes for the cover drive initially, but he realises too late that it's the slower ball, and then tries to adjust and drag the ball over the leg side, but he doesn't catch it well at all. Off the outside half of the bat, and it balloons to the man at mid-on"
"slower ball, shortish, on leg stump. Swivels through the pull too early and is hit on the stomach"
"back of a length on middle stump, stays leg-side of the ball and jabs towards backward point"
"back of a length outside off, punched to deep point"
"slower short ball, slanting across and rising to about chest height over off stump. No room, no pace to work with, and Miller misses the attempted cut"
"low full-toss on the pads, clipped to deep square leg"
"bowled him. India have bowled this line to Miller very well today - pitching on or just outside leg stump, hitting middle stump or thereabouts. They've given him very little room to free his arms, while still angling the ball away from him. This is a slower ball, pretty full, and he looks to clear his front leg and hoick over the leg side, and misses. Other batsmen may have tried to hit this straighter"
"back of a length on off stump, chopped away into the point region"
"slower length ball on off stump, flat-batted to the left of mid-off"
"slower short ball, slightly down leg. Missses the pull and Phehlukwayo is puzzled why it hasn't been called wide. Umpire Shamsuddin says it brushed his shirt, and replays suggest it might have"
"another slower short ball, another mistimed heave. This time the ball hits Phehlukwayo's hip and rolls into the leg side"
"in the blockhole, at the batsman's feet. Looks to flick and misses, and the ball rolls into the point region for another leg bye"
"back of a length, angling into a tight, fourth-stump line. Looks to make room to cut but can't make enough, and the ball zips under his bat at 139.8kph"
"aims for the blockhole this time, following the batsman and hitting his left shoe as he aims a desperate flick at the ball. Ricochets off the foot into the backward point region"
"bam! Shortish, on leg stump or thereabouts, and he clears his front leg and absolutely wallops it over midwicket"
sees Phehlukwayo looking to make room and bowls a low full-toss outside leg stump. Manages to get further leg-side of the ball and stab it to deep point
"in the blockhole on off stump. Was initially looking to make room to hit through cover, but ends up dragging it back down the ground, past the stumps and towards long-on"
"slower ball, back of a length, angling into leg stump, and Pretorius finishes with a six. Sixteen off the last over. Clears his front leg, spots the pace variation, and holds his shape well to swat that way over wide long-on"
strays down leg first ball and it's going to be a wide
rapped on the pads with an inducker that he played around. Half appeal but that was going down leg
"fuller on the stumps, plays it with an angled bat to midwicket"
"fuller on off, punched to cover"
"down legside again, it might have just brushed pad but it's given wide again. De Kock dived to his left and got a glove to it, but couldn't prevent the batsmen from taking an extra run"
"magnificent timing, cuts it from fairly close to his body and sends it screaming to the backward point boundary. Nortje at the third man boundary tries to tumble and save after running square, but his body has touched the boundary triangle cushions before getting rid of the ball so that might be a four. <b>and it is a four</b>"
"back of a length going across him and slapped to third man again, but more fine so the fielder doesn't have to run"
"fullish on the stumps, patted back to the bowler"
"angling across him from over the wicket, and Dhawan cuts it fine again. He's timing it really well and the ball is travelling at pace from his bat"
"length ball in the channel, Rohit wanted to slap it away, but it goes under his bat"
"<b>imperious</b>. That's the Rohit pull shot you can write paens about. Rocks back and slams it way over square leg, didn't even seem to try and hit it very hard."
"length ball on off, blocked back"
"<b>slammed again</b>. Back of a length and angling into him, he moves inside the line opens up and pulls this waaaay over square leg. When he's hitting them like that, you can't do much"
"corrects his length by going fuller, driven to mid-on"
"<b>smoked</b> through extra cover almost nonchalantly. Room outside off and he goes with his hands to drive on the up, hitting through the line and sending the ball screaming"
"and now he chops it down to third man, at ease scoring in the V between third man and long-off apparently! Length ball closer to off and he almost guides it past the keeper"
"<b>beaten</b> Feet rooted to the crease, this is a more testing length, zipping across him at pace and he has a waft at it"
"back of a length outside off, and he uses the bowler's pace to glide this to third man"
"fullish on the stumps, pushed towards mid-on"
"fuller on the stumps, wristed it to mid-on"
"sneaks under his bat. Round the wicket, dug in back of a length and Dhawan goes for a swat, but it doesn't bounce as much as he thinks. Not too far from off stump too"
"length ball outside off, punched to point"
"pulled from low down, below his waist almost. And Nortje at the deep square leg boundary might have touched those triangle advertising cushions again. After many replays though, it's ruled safe. Back of a length on the stumps, Dhawan swivelled kept his balance nicely while whip-pulling this despite the fact that it didn't bounce high"
""
"<b>rapped dead in front</b>. Looked like a slower one, and he got it to swing appreciably into Rohit. He was looking to deposit this into the legside with a flick, but completely missed it and that's an easy decision for the umpire."
"good ball first up, gets it to straighten after swinging in. Kohli wants to clip it to square leg but gets a thick leading edge as the ball rolls towards point"
"length ball on leg stump, hoicked to deep square"
"length ball, but Kohli goes deep in his crease to tuck this to midwicket's right"
"length ball on off, plays it late, tapping it on the legside"
"<b>regal</b>. Effortless flick off his toes through midwicket. Not the best ball, there to be picked off, but there's few who can pick them off better than Kohli"
worked to deep square leg from his front foot from outside off
"not as much pace on the ball so those Dhawan drives aren't quite flying off the bat. This was nicely timed enough, but doesn't go quite as screamingly from his bat and it's straight to cover in any case"
"on the up drive to extra cover's left off a good length ball. amazing shot, and shape"
"length ball outside off, steered to short third man"
"<b>review for a caught behind</b>. There was definitely a noise as it went between Kohli's bat and body, it could have been inside edge, or it could have been pad. replays show it's the pad. But that was a very close shout on lbw too! No caught behind but that ball was hitting the top of the stumps having flicked his back pad, and it's umpire's call by the narrowest of margins on the lbw! South Africa were looking fro a caught behind, with de Kock having dived to his left to hold it."
"flicked off his hips behind square, hung in the air a while"
digs it in short but strays down leg and he'll have to bowl that again
"length ball outside off, room to drive and he does so but must manufacture the pace himself and can only send it to cover"
"tailing into him and he goes for the drive, it rolls off a thick inside edge to mid-on"
"fuller, tapped past the bowler"
"down the track but he spots him and bowls it shorter and into the body, Dhawan tucks it into the legside"
"length on the fourth stump, walks across to flick, but can't go past square leg"
"full on middle, goes across again and flicks it off his front foot to deep square"
goes back and across and punches this length ball through extra cover
"<b>run out opportunity missed by the bowler</b>. That was a suicidal single. Kohli was coming down the track and the ball rolls down off his pad, and the batsmen decided to go through. Pretorius ran down in his follow through and picked up the ball but his under-arm throw from almost at the crease misses the stumps! Don't think Dhawan would have made it."
"goes well across the right-hander, who has room to slap it through the offside"
"length ball, not much turn so far for Shamsi, he stays back and flat bats it to long-off"
"fuller outside off, Kohli doesn't play the shot often but he brings out a modified slog-sweep to midwicket. Wanted two, but Dhawan wants to play safe"
"length ball on the stumps, goes right back and punches to long-on"
takes a big lunge forward to get to the pitch of the ball and clips it to long-on
"fuller on the stumps, pushed to the bowler's right and he runs across to collect"
"<b>dismissed</b>. Down the track and a flowing drive over extra cover, giving himself room and allowing the arms to swing freely through the line"
steers it towards point for a quick single
"walloped straight back over the bowler's head. Suddenly feels like Dhawan and Kohli have adjusted to the slower pace after the opening burst. This was stump to stump and Dhawan took a step forward and punched it powerfully, once bounce into the boundary"
"length ball on the pads, tucked to square leg"
fuller outside off and Kohli gets that front foot moving to get to the pitch of the ball and punch sweetly through extra cover
"full on off, uses his wrists to whip to deep square"
"a bit short and he rocks back to whack this through midwicket, but the bowler has protection in the deep there"
"Dhawan was moving around, made as if to give himself room and Shamsi fired it down leg. ends up being a wide"
tucked to backward square leg
"length on off, comes on the front foot and pushes it gently to long-off for an easy single"

"fuller around off, driven to long-off"
"slightly short of a length, he goes back and whips it off his pads to deep midwicket"

down the track and he gets a soft leading edge but the ball plops down near him to allow a quick single
"fuller and quicker, Kohli jabs his bat down in time to punch it to mid-off"
"flattish, going across him from around the wicket, he stays low and drives to point"
"slog-swept into oblivion. Dhawan has had enough of nudging and pushing, spots the opportunity to go big, with the ball in the slot for the slog sweep and unleashes a ferocious one to send it deep into the midwicket stands"
"flatter on leg stumps, he goes back and whips it to square leg. Bavuma sprints from deep midwicket and tumbles to save the ball from going into the fence"
"fuller on off, big stride out by Dhawan to drive through the line to long-off"
"fuller on the stumps, clipped to long-on from the front foot"
"<b>what an outstanding catch by Miller at long-on</b>. We've had two great catches in this match already, but this one comfortably outstrips them. This was a flat delivery on the stumps, Dhawan stepped down and powered his drive straight. It was heading for a boundary until an airborn Miller intervened. He didn't have much time to react or build momentum by sprinting, just a couple of steps to his right, but still dived full length to his right and plucked the ball out of the air with his right hand. Stunning."

"fuller outside off, driven to cover but off the toe end"
"length ball outside off, steered to third man"

"short ball outside off, pulled from his chest down to deep midwicket. Loud call by Pant of 'NO' to stick to a single. Kohli wanted two"
"length ball down leg, he misses the flick and it takes the thigh pad to fine leg"

"fuller on off, driven crisply but straight to cover"
strays on the pads and is flicked to short fine leg's left
"tossed up on the stumps, gently nudged to midwicket. The man is back on the boundary and they're alive to the possibility of a double, which they get by running hard"
"<b>he's picked out short fine leg</b> and he's not going to be happy watching that replay. This was a gimme ball, short of a length on leg stump, and Pant got down to smack it into the leg side. Could have almost hit it anywhere, but picks out the man unerringly. This is not going to be good for the already swirling debates about his shot selection... but Fortuin has a wicket on debut"
"angled into him, and clipped to midwicket"
"length ball outside off, punches it to cover's right. Hung in the air for a bit but well clear of the man"
"lovely shot from Iyer. Quick ball, full outside off and he leans into a flowing cover drive. Needs a diving stop by Rabada on the extra cover boundary"
"<b>edged through slip</b>. He was looking to run it down in that area, but not quite as fine as it went, ended up not being in control of it. Eludes a diving de Kock"
"length outside off, cuts it to third man"
"another crisp shot through the covers, this time a back foot punch by Kohli. But it's more square than the one hit by Iyer earlier so the fielder doesn't have to move too much"

"down the track, flatter one, bunts it to the bowler's right"
"skips down the track again but the bowler sees him and denies him the room, and Kohli ends up punching it to extra cover from close to his body"
"down the track and that's just unbelievable timing! Gets to <b>fifty</b> too. Looked for all the world like it was a shot for two runs. He had stroked it, gently not with punch, through extra cover, but the timing was so good it just kept going till it reached the boundary"
bowler compensates for Kohli's saunter down the track by bowling too short but Kohli stays put this time and flays a cut through point
punched down to long-on
"back of a length, gets nice carry on it, but Iyer stays legside of the ball and almost upper cuts it to third man"
"attempted yorker outside off, driven to extra cover"
"slower ball on the stumps, he read it and tapped it around the corner with soft hands. Wanted two but Iyer is hesitant about it and that moment is enough to stamp out thoughts of a second run"
"<b>What. A. Shot</b>. This is Kohli just toying with the bowling. Length ball from Rabada at pace on leg stump, and he goes back and nonchalantly flicks it off his pads. It's such great timing that it carries all the way past the boundary. Without even trying to hit it hard"
pats this back of a length ball down with a horizontal bat outside off and is looking for a single but there isn't one
driven to cover
"takes on the bouncer, going back and pulling it from in front of his helmet to deep midwicket. That was an impressive short one on target, but Kohli dealt with it expertly"
"length ball outside off, steered to point"
"that's too quick for Iyer to pull off a cutesy upper cut. Back of a length and screaming over middle stump, Iyer was giving himself room to send it up and over the keeper perhaps, but the ball whizzes through before he can connect"
"flat on the stumps, down the track, bunted back to the bowler"
"fired into the pads, and he goes back and clips through midwicket"
"gives himself room to whip, and it takes the bottom of the bat to roll past the keeper"
down the track and his timing has been surreal all through. Picks it up and carts him over long-on without even a big flourish of the bat
comes down the track again and pushes it to long-on
finishes off the match by skipping down the track and getting to the pitch to drill a bullet straight drive into the fence.
