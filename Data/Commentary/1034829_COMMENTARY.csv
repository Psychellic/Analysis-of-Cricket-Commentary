"my, oh my. Kohli's run out. Length ball, angling towards, or maybe past leg stump. Provokes a big lbw appeal as Kohli shuffles across and tries to work it into the leg side. Hares out of the crease, looking to steal a leg-bye, and Jordan races through, picks up, and underarms a flick into the stumps to catch Kohli short. He had to turn around because Rahul didn't respond to his call, but there was definitely no single there. Hawkeye says the ball would have gone on to clip leg stump, but that's all academic now"

"bam! This is a half-volley on leg stump, and he clears his front leg again, and this time doesn't get that full follow-through in. Just abbreviates it into a punch, and it's chipped, just chipped, but all the way over the boundary at straight long-on"
"Gets the yorker right this time, and he gets his front leg out of the way and clips to deep midwicket"
"and he's gone. Strange, strange dismissal. Back of a length, and he spots the slower ball very very late. Shapes to pull, checks himself, and his bat is stopped somewhere in front of the stumps when the ball reaches it. Finds the edge and somehow carries to the keeper. That's possibly off the back of the bat"

"low full-toss on middle stump, clears his front leg and whips it away to deep midwicket. They go for the second because it's the last ball, and I'm not sure if Pandya has beaten Stokes's throw to the keeper. Nope. He's a long way out when Buttler whips off the bails"

"full outside off, driven to the right of cover point. Didn't really middle it"
"back of a length on off stump, looks to use the pace and angle to dab towards fine leg, but India have a fielder right there to cut it off, at gully. No slips, just that man at gully"

"lbw appeal, but Nehra aborts it, knows it pitched outside leg. Looks to step across and flick, only manages to send it rolling into the leg side for a leg bye"

"quicker, shorter, sliding down leg. Looks to flick and gets a tickle of thigh pad towards short fine leg"
"they're checking if this is a clean catch. Full, angling into the stumps. Looks to clip into the leg side and inside-edges into pad. Lobs up and slip dives forward to catch it two-handed. Anil Choudhury soft-signals not out. It's inside-edge, then boot, then pad. Raina dives forward and seems to have taken it cleanly, and it's out. I think the umpire may have felt the ball bounced into ground before hitting pad, but that clearly wasn't the case, as replays showed"
"fullish on leg stump, looks to whip into the leg side and gets a leading edge that rolls into the covers. Roy sets off from the non-striker's end, Root sends him back, and Chahal throws to the wrong end - the keeper's end - and a clear run-out chance is missed. Kohli moved swiftly to his right from cover and dived to stop that, and flicked a throw to Chahal. All he needed to do was run to the stumps at his end and disturb the bails"
"back of a length on the stumps, whipped into the midwicket region."

"full on middle stump, check-driven to long-off"

Not the brightest of shots, looks to slog-sweep, but it's far too wide outside off, and far too slow, and it drops shorter than he'd like, turns sharply, and the top edge balloons almost vertically, allowing Dhoni to take a few steps to his left and catch it near where a short leg may have stood"
"length ball on off stump, presses forward to push to cover"
