"walks across the stumps just a touch and helps this shortish delivery over point, beats square third man. Tracer bullet stuff."
"just eludes mid-off. Went hard at this but toe-ended the full delivery, the bat face turned in his hand as he threw his hands at that one"
"slows it down, McCullum picks the length delivery and deposits this pull deep into the stands at deep midwicket. It was almost as if he was waiting for this slower delivery. Sensational hitting already."

"smashed back past the bowler, no chance for mid-off. Didn't look like he timed it all that well but it still beat the infield. Sensational onslaught already"
"backs away and lofts this through the line, clears long-off effortlessly. Watson too predictable, not much pace either. All this translating into a party for these two."
whips this off his pad to the square leg boundary. Juicy half-volley that was asking to be hit. Inhibited hitting right out of the top drawer this

"backs away to slash over point, beaten. Swung through way too early"

shows the full face of the bat in defence of this length ball
"drifts in a quicker ball, defended"
drifts back in to hit the pad as McCullum's bat gets stuck on the inside of the pad while attempting to nurdle fine. Got himself into a tangle.

punches this straight to midwicket

defends with the bat well ahead of the pad. Nice flight and loop again
"oh, dear. They're committing hara-kiri. Non-striker didn't respond to this little dink towards midwicket, Hasan was halfway down the pitch when he turned back, simplest of run-outs as Sarfraz whips the bails off."

"looks to drive, gets a thick inside edge onto the pad as the ball rolls back towards the bowler"

The key to it was to run in quickly, which he did, but it wasn't all that easy because the momentum kept bringing him forward. He held his composure despite the momentum taking him forward."
