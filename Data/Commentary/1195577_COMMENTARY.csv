"full around off, thick inside edge behind square on the leg side where Zahir Khan tries to stop the ball with his right foot but doesn't. Poor effort"
"shorter outside off, he drives and misses"
"full outside off, tentative push to point this time without footwork"
"fuller and closer to off, pushed down to mid-on this time"
"he was expecting the short ball, he opens up as soon as he sees the length ball and <strong>smacks that</strong> over the square leg boundary for a six!"
"tries to heave this length ball outside off to the leg side too, but misses this time"
"on length just outside off with the angle, pushed to cover"
"on offend middle now, similar length and pushed back to Renshaw"
he tries to drill that through the covers but doesn't middle it
"on middle and leg now, tickled off the pads to midwicket for one"
"he's got the wicket, has him <b>caught at backward point</b>. Was it a trap? Long-on at the boundary, so Maddinson made a lot of room and tried to drive that over the covers but ended up top-edging it to backward point and Renshaw did a little jig for the celebration"
comes down to work the ball past a diving midwicket to long on for one
"excellent stroke there to counter the late swing from Lalor, but Cartwright adjusted very well to drive that nice and hard down the ground. The ball was swinging in from middle stump but Cartwright was well on top of it"
"on length around middle, pushed down the ground again for a single"
"right on target on off stump, no room whatsoever and Stoinis pushes it to mid off"
some room this time as Lalor goes shorter and Stoinis carves it nicely over point for three as Heazlett dives to keep the ball in
drives uppishly and the crowd 'oohs' as the ball goes down to third man after briefly being in the air
"slightly short but not much room, he guides it to extra cover and doesn't want the single"

"medium pace around off stump, no room and he defends it back"
"fuller on off, nicely flicked with the wrists to the leg side, there's a chase put in and the fielder slides in the deep but it goes for four"
"some rom on off and Stoinis gets to punch-drive that through the covers by leaning into the ball, and this time Lalor puts in a dive and saves one"
short enough for Cartwright to rock back and cut that nicely right in the gap between point and short third man for four. Pierces the gap beautifully
"good reply from Laughlin, this delivery comes into the batsman and he is cramped for room"
"<b>dropped</b> at long-off while running towards the boundary by Lalor. It was a <b>really tough chance</b>, to be fair to him. Cartwright lofted the ball high, Lalor ran backwards and got both hands to it but couldn't quite hold on"
on the pads and worked to the leg side for one
"he tries a cheeky scoop on the leg side, clever delivery from Lalor but he gets a wide because the batsman misses and its gone down leg"
"simple skier this time and <strong>Lalor gets a wicket</strong>! Kind of in the slot from Lalor as it was on the stumps, Cartwright skied that one too and it gave Bryant a couple of days at midwicket to get under it for a simple catch"
"slower delivery on the stumps, he defends it back"
"on middle and leg, worked off the hips to leg for one"
"<strong>direct hit</strong> at the bowler's end, it's gone to the third umpire! Handscomb pushed the ball to mid-off with soft hands and took off quickly for a single, and replays show he made it to get off the mark"
"<strong>dropped</strong> by the keeper this time! Lalor did what he could to draw Stoinis' outside edge with the help of the angle and short of length delivery, Stoinis was squared up but the keeper could not hold on despite getting both hands to his right. I think he moved a bit to his left initially"
starts with a dipping full toss which is flicked to leg for a single
"<strong>beaten completely</strong> with a googly, right through bat and pad and that somehow misses leg stump and Stoinis' foot is just inside the crease to save him"
pushes it down the ground this time for one

dabs this legbreak from around length to leg for an easy single
"coming in, he tries to work it to leg but can't middle it"
drives uppishly in the air towards mid off for one
"slightly shorter on middle and leg, worked off the hips for one"
waits in the crease and slices the widish delivery to short third man
"another skier, that's gone a mile in the air and Heazlett runs in a few miles himself from deep backward square leg to slide, and then get both hands under it to send a scratchy Stoinis back"
"short of length and angling in, worked behind square easily for one"
"wrong'un outside off, he picks it and dabs towards short third man"

goes back in the crease to work that towards deep midwicket for one more
goes deep in the crease and paddles that fine on the leg side for two to beat short fine leg
shot of 'catch' from the keeper as Handscomb chips that dangerously over cover for one. Don't think he wanted to hit it there
hangs back and steers it to point from back of length for one
"<strong>edged and just wide</strong> of the diving keeper! Cutting drew the drive from Maxwell, Maxwell edged and it just beat the keeper's right glove for four"
"that's called rubbing salt in the wounds. Short ball, Maxwell probably expected that and ramped it rather easily very fine on the off side for four more"
this one comes in and he chops on the off side for one towards point
"<b>excellent direct hit</b> from keeper Peirson at the non-striker's end and he's got rid of Handscomb, Stars in more trouble now! Handscomb wanted the risky single after not being able to connect properly, the ball went just behind the stumps and Peirson ran in quickly, swooped in and had a shy at the stumps without relying on anyone else"
drives that one towards cover point for one
"<b>what an effort</b> at the long-off boundary from Laughlin! Maxwell slammed that full toss down the ground, Laughlin ran to his right and pretty much flew to his right with arms extended, even touched the ball but couldn't grab it"
goes back to cut off the back foot but misses
"on the back foot again, he cuts on the off side for two this time"
this one turns down the leg side for a wide
"wrong'un from well outside leg, not much room and Maxwell works it off the pads for one"
he waits and then helps the ball towards mid-on to get off the mark
"it's full, it's on leg stump, it's not a wrong'un so what's Maxwell going to do? He stands tall and hammers that with the turn, well over the midwicket fence and the security person catches it easily"
"on middle and leg, it's the googly an it squares up Dunk a bit as he defends on the off side"
"on the pads, he works it away for a single"
"fullish on leg stump, tickled down to long-on for one"
"almost a mix up as Dunk slams it to short cover, a bit of a fumble makes him think of a single but Maxwell says no"
"shouts of 'catch' as Dunk goes back and cuts in the air, but it goes wide of point for one"
"turning into leg from middle, he helps it to long on for one"
"almost a wide yorker, he jams his bat into the ground for a single on off"

"edges the slower ball, but it bounces a few yards ahead of the keeper"
"full on off, drilled to cover where Cutting gets his left hand to it with an excellent dive to save a few runs"

"angling in from length now, steered off the pads for one to long on"
"fullish on the stumps, driven down to long on"
"too full on off, Dunk slams it hard back between the bowler and Maxwell, and beats a running long-off for a powerful four"
"oh Swepson has the fitting reply, Dunk holes out to long on. Pitched up again, but this one is turning in and Dunk lofts that but doesn't get enough to clear Laughlin who ran to his left to pouch it with both hands"
"Maxwell is so unfazed by the fall of wickets at the other end! He sees a half-tracker, rocks back and dispatches it over the midwicket boundary for another massive six"
"bit short outside off, he lets it turn away and cuts to sweeper cover for one"
"on length and turning in, he defends it back"
"almost a long hop, turning away as it was the wrong'un, Maxwell slams it to sweeper cover"
comes down the track and drives straight to cover
"the wrong'un comes in sharply, cramps him for room and he can only guide it to short third man. He didn't pick it"
"comes down again, and only drives the low full toss back to the bowler"
"dances down again, wants to work it to leg but only gets an edge onto his pad. Dot ball again"
"and the pressure mounting has ended in a wicket, what an end from Zahir Khan! No need for the wrong'un, Hinchliffe comes outside the crease to drive the ball on off, Zahir pitches it shorter so that the ball turns away and beats the bat, and Peirson does the rest"
"short ball turning away, he cuts it hard to sweeper cover"
"turns away from length, pushed into the covers for one"
"in the block hole outside off, Maxwell connects but finds cover"
"lofted over the covers, it's landed just wide of Laughlin, the ball is about to go over the rope after a bounce but he does very well to throw it inside for the other fielder and saves two"

"shorter on off, he cuts it through backward point for a single"
"angling into the pads, heaved to leg for a single"
slower ball and Zampa does well to help it to leg and give the strike back to Maxwell
"slow legcutter wide outside off, Maxwell chases by going down on a knee and misses"
"it's the <b>reverse paddle</b>, it's Maxwell, and it's four! How do you stop this man? It wasn't that bad a delivery, Maxwell just knew the field, changed his bat angle and connected the way he wanted to"
"more straight bat now, length ball outside off and he drives into the covers for two"
"slower and coming in, doesn't connect this time but gets a leg bye"
"slower and full, good work from Zampa to help it to leg with soft hands with the fielders in the deep and they come back quickly for the second. So Maxwell gets strike"
"slower ball on length, he works it into the gap wide of midwicket and gets two quick runs"
"slams the full delivery down the ground, it reaches long-off after a bounce"
"nice yorker from Laughin, Zampa respects it and blocks it back"
"slower and shorter, it doesn't even bounce much and goes well under Zampa's bat as he looked to pull"
"another shorter and slower ball, Zampa pulls and misses again"
"Zampa tries to do a Maxwell with a reverse paddle, but it's a short ball from the clever Laughlin, and Zampa nearly hands a catch to short third man while losing balance"
"oh, don't ball short to him. It's short from Lalor, Maxwell goes deep in the crease and pulls that high and long over the wide long-on boundary"
"a wide yorker from Lalor, Maxwell tries a reverse paddle along the ground and barely connects. Good reply from Lalor"
"tries the yorker again, it's a low full toss and Maxwell whips it hard to deep midwicket"
smart work from Zampa to chips the short of length ball over the covers for one
"short again, on the leg side again, and six again from Maxwell! It wasn't that short from Lalor, but short enough for Maxwell to power that off hips and over the fine leg boundary"
last ball and he drives it to deep cover to keep strike
"not a bad ball, it's a slower offcutter and Maxwell goes deep as it's short of length and smacks that straight down the ground for four"
"full delivery, tries the reverse paddle, only gets an edge to his pad and the ball goes to the keeper"
"another short ball, another pull, another boundary! It was slower too, and Maxwell picked it well to hammer it between deep midwicket and deep backward for four just in the gap"
"the big show is over, he's played on, that too off a full toss. It was a widish full toss, Maxwell went hard at it and only got an inside edge that rocked into the off stump"
"full toss again, steered to deep cover for one"
"excellent attempted yorker on the shoes, he can't get it away and the Stars have to do with a leg bye"
"angling in towards middle and leg, he defends it to midwicket and off the mark"
"shorter and wider outside off, he dabs it to point"
"excellent legcutter to beat Bryant completely there. Pitched on length around off, his bat is in front of the off stump but the ball moves away and beats him"
"beaten again, this time Bryant doesn't move his feet at all as the ball swings away from outside off. Chases and misses"
"nicely bowled again outside off, he connects this time to run it down to third man for one"
"on the stumps, worked towards mid on for a quick single"
"reverse-slapped for a four first ball! He went down on a knee, swept the ball with the turn and middled it to fetch four on the off side"

swing and miss yet again in this over as Banton chases it well outside off. This time it's a wide
"he's found the answer for these outswingers! Moves some distance on the off side and scoops the ball fine on the leg side, nearly for a six. One bounce and it goes over the rope"
