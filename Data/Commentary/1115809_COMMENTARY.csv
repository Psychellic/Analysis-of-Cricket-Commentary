Man in the deep though, and it's an excellent catch from the outfielder. Dives forward and completes a tough low catch. Those dismissals are always difficult for the fielder to execute. Full marks. Small delay as the umpire wants to check if the catch was completed. Looks like Bruce's palms, ball in hand, hit the ground while trying to complete that catch. Were his fingers under the ball? Nothing conclusive on the replays. The on-field umpire's decision stands. Fakhar falls for 46."
