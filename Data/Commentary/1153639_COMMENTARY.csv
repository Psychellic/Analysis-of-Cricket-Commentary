"a touch straighter now, clipped to short midwicket"
"angled in with a slightly round-arm action, towards off stump. Presses forward and blocks to short extra-cover"
"oh, well bowled, and Bangladesh are celebrating, but Taylor's standing his ground here... The umpires have gone upstairs for a catch at short leg. The soft signal is out. Nazmul Hossain Shanto claimed a low catch, straight off the inside edge, and Taylor wasn't sure he'd taken it cleanly. From the replays it seems like he has. Very well bowled. Drew Taylor forward to defend, and the ball kept coming in with the angle to take a thick inside edge. Could have played that with softer hands, I guess. Much better hands from Shanto - the ball nearly popped out but he grabbed it nicely on the second attempt"
"floated up full, angled across the left-hander. A touch early on the drive and the ball dribbles into the on side off the inside edge"

length ball sliding in with the angle towards off stump. Watches it well and defends off the front foot to silly point
"short, and that's punished as it should be. Not too much readymade width, but he has all the time in the world to manufacture some by rocking back deep in his crease. Slapped away in front of backward point"
"nice flight, wider outside off. Driven with an open face to backward point"

again he tries to drive inside-out but ends up playing it back to the bowler. Taijul's getting some inward drift here to complement his angle
"full again, on middle stump, driven back to the bowler"
"full on off stump, defended to short extra-cover. Hardly any stride forward there - his front leg actually moved away from the line - and his hands did all the work. He seems wary of the one that comes in with the angle"
"back of a length outside off, punched into the covers"
"full on off stump, blocked to the right of the bowler"
"short, and that's slapped away hard but straight to cover point"
"lovely. This is the ball that'll trouble Williams with his front leg going away from the line. Slower, outside off, turning away. Leans forward to defend with his foot nowhere near the pitch of the ball, and ends up feeling for it, away from his body. The edge rolls away to the right of backward point and he sets off for a single but Masakadza wisely sends him back"
"closer to off stump, a bit quicker, blocked back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off and middle, punched to mid-on"
"tossed up outside off, defended to silly point"
"length ball outside off stump, defended with soft hands to backward point"

"quickish length ball close to off stump, defended to silly point"
"length ball turning from middle to off, defended into the extra-cover region"

"full now, on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"nice angle from Taijul here, into off stump with a bit of drift. Again Masakadza tries to drive inside-out, again he ends up playing the wrong line and inside-edges towards midwicket"
"length ball on off stump, punched back to the bowler"
"back of a length now, punched back once more"
"oh man, Masakadza's really struggling with Taijul's angle here. He's playing for the turn, playing inside-out even in defence, and this drops on a beautiful length and slides on straight and he nearly inside-edges into his stumps. Just about squeezes past leg stump"
"a bit fuller, defended into the covers"
"slower now, more flight, on off stump, and Masakadza pulls out his get-out-of-jail shot, the sweep, and this time he hits it square and firm, over the head of the square leg umpire"

"full on middle and leg, blocked back to the bowler"
"ooh, nearly. Not short enough or wide enough to cut, and it keeps slightly low too. Hits the inside half of the bat rather than the inside edge, and bounces up off the pitch to silly point"
"and again, Masakadza inside-edges while trying to drive Taijul into the covers. It's amazing he's still batting. This time it rolls away to the right of square leg, allowing him to get off strike"
"fullish, close to off stump, defended back towards the bowler"
"back of a length, spins in towards middle and leg, stays back and whips it to the left of long leg"
"tossed up on off stump, driven back to the bowler"
"flatter, slanting across to off stump. Just about short enough for Williams to step back and swipe through square leg"
"flighted and full on off stump, driven to long-off. For once, Masakadza let the ball come to him and didn't go too hard at the drive"
"nicely flighted on off stump, but long-on is back and Masakadza clips it gently in that direction to get off strike"
"angled into off stump, pretty full, clipped to mid-on"
"nicely bowled, that. Excellent length, and Williams is caught half-forward, with his pad going away from the line. Slides on with the angle, and that opens up a bit of a gap between bat and pad, but he jams his bat down just in time"

"he was getting some sharp movement into the right-hander, and now he finally manages one sharp enough to beat the inside edge and ping the pad. Moves in the air and further into him after pitching.

"and Mahmudullah's given Bangladesh the breakthrough! The big, big wicket of Williams, that too. Even against Mehidy, he was having a bit of trouble with the one that pitched outside off and turned away, because he wasn't getting his front foot far enough across. He had been worried about the straighter one, worried about lbw, and his front pad had been going away from the line of the ball. Well, now Mahmudullah flights one nicely into that line outside off, and gets it to dip onto a dangerous length and spin away sharply. Williams looks to defend, but he's playing well away from his body and only manages a thick edge, which Mehidy grabs brilliantly with a dive to his left at first slip"

"<b>dropped</b> at point! Nazmul the debutant dives to his right to grab a fiercely hit cut by Chari. It comes at a decent height, somewhere around the waist, and he gets a good sighter of it too, but it appears the ball is hit too hard for his liking and it pops out"

sweeps the full delivery on leg stump - good plan

"quicker and flatter through the air, which makes Chari go back and block with hard hands"
"<b>lovely bowling</b>. Follows the dart with a sumptuous delivery - tossed up so slow through the air. Chari inches forward but plays inside the line - that's because of Mehidy's drift and it's so beautiful, just enough to beat the outside edge and knock back off stump"

"hangs it outside off again, but Masakadza goes back and across - the across is important because it gets him in line with the ball - to block it"

"slides it into middle and leg, looking to cramp the right-hander. Taylor plants the bat in front of pad and gets an inside edge. So close to being caught at short leg, though..."
"drives firmly to the left of mid-off. Taijul, for once, overpitches and since he's always targeting outside off, Masakadza has the room to free the arms"
"fullish delivery on off stump, Taylor defends"
"<b>outside edge</b> as Taylor drives away from his body, with hard hands as well. He's being a little lazy this morning"
flicks a shortish delivery off middle stump to long leg
slog sweep! And he plays it so very well. Spots the half-volley outside off - loves that it's outside off because he has the room to swing as hard as he wants to
"taps it into the open cover region - that field is for the fuller ball, not when it's short, which makes it easier for a batsman to go onto his back foot and access that area"
"good length on off stump, defends"
pushes to long-on
another slog sweep! He doesn't want Mehidy bowling that tempting line outside off - bringing his drift and dip into play. Messes with the bowler with some unconventional hitting and its paying off

"too short and Masakadza wallops it to the wide long-on boundary. On a pitch with low bounce, it's important to play with a vertical bat, even while hitting on the leg side. Zimbabwe seem to know it well"
"full on off stump, defends"
lunges forward to keep out a ball on off stump
keeps out a fuller delivery on off stump
"full on off stump, the drive finds silly mid-off"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"full on off stump, defends"
turns the fuller delivery from round the stumps past the left of short midwicket
flashes outside off and gets a thick edge that flies away behind point
"good length outside off, he defends"
nudges a full delivery outside off to long-on
drifts the full delivery into the left-hander from round the wicket. Williams is more than a match for it
defends the one pushed through full on middle
"full on off stump, he blocks"
nudges the quicker delivery off his pads to short leg
"smacks it down the ground! Too full, too inviting and too sexy from Masakadza. Full face of the bat. Pure timing takes it away"
"gets some swing in the air and into the right-hander, but Masakadza handles it well, driving to mid-off"
"back of a length on leg stump, Masakadza blocks"
"<b>big appeal for lbw</B> but the indications are it would be sliding down leg. Seems like Jayed is getting the <b>ball to reverse</b> - just a tiny bit, but it's enough to cause problems. Masakadza is caught out by that movement, trying to defend on middle and instead the ball curls in past the inside edge"
"fullish on off stump, defends"
"nails the half-volley through extra cover! As ever, a firm, bottom-hand dominant hit from the big man, picking the gap to perfection"
strikes him on the pads as he tries to flick the good length ball through square leg. Touch too early into the shot. would be going down leg too
"slow through the air, full in length, Williams nudges to midwicket"
knocks a shortish delivery outside off to a deepish mid-off
stays inside the line of the tossed up ball on leg stump and eases it into the covers
blocks the fuller delivery on middle
blocks a good length ball on middle and off stump from deep in the crease
tosses it up and gets it to drift into the right-hander. Masakadza gets a good stride forward to blunt it
"drives the slow, tossed up delivery outside off to long-off"
"full on middle, he blocks"
"launches it down the ground, but not with his trademark power, which is why it barely goes past mid-on"
"launches it down the ground, but not with his trademark power, which is why it barely goes past mid-on"
"full on off stump, nudges it to mid-on"
"looped up outside off to begin, and Masakadza is well forward in defence"
"a touch quicker through the air, and the ball rushes on with the arm to be squirted towards point"
"straighter now, and Masakadza meets the ball with an equally straight bat"
"nudged into the covers, watchful stuff from Masakadza after the break"
bat and pad come together as he pats another offbreak down the track
"Mehidy holds his last ball back, offering a little more flight, but Masakadza won't be tempted and lunges forward to defend"
"Taijul drifts on to Williams' pads, and he's nurdled backward of square for one"
"tossed up on middle, and again Masakadza defends"
"the first real shot of intent in this session, Masakadza throws his hands through a full, wide one but he finds the fielder at cover"
"he beats him this time! Masakadza gave himself just a little room to open up the covers, and this time he threads the gap between cover and mid off to collect four and move into the 40s"
"responding to the drive, Taijul pulls his length back and offers less flight. Masakadza gets back and across to tap the ball back down the wicket"
"speared down on a leg stump line, and Masakadza gets nicely in to line to defend"
"Mehidy comes round the wicket to the left hander. Williams, still displaying admirable patience, pushes watchfully forward in defence"
"there's a bit more fizz on this delivery, and it breaks away from a middle stump line as Williams defends"
Williams lunges forward to defend back down the track
"again Williams is well forward, smothering the spin"
"a touch quicker through the air by Mehidy, and the length is a little shorter too. Williams gets back to defend into space on the leg side"
"rushing through another over, Mehidy loops one down on middle and leg and Williams is back to defend. He might have gone forward there, as the delivery kept a little low. But no harm done"
"tossed up on off stump, Masakadza crashes a drive straight to mid off"
"Taijul comes over the wicket, landing the ball outside leg, and Masakadza kicks it away with his front pad"
"swept hard out to long leg, and it has the beating of the fielder on the boundary. That takes the partnership beyond fifty! Masakadza stretched right down the wicket to meet the ball on the full, and made a great connection"
pushes defensively back down the track
"big swing and a miss! Taijul has stayed over the wicket, and lands this one a little wide outside off. Masakadza flings his arms through a square drive, but the ball spins past him"
"nudged past the bowler through mid on, just the single this time"
"Where has this come from? Masakadza has played a couple of shots already in this session, and now he's perished! Mehidy came around the wicket, and Masakadza lined him up with a reverse sweep. But he misses completely, and an appeal for lbw is upheld. There's a brief chat between the batsmen about taking the review, but Williams advises against it. Bangladesh break through, and Masakadza falls short of what would have been a second patient fifty in the game."
"looped up on middle and leg, Raza is well forward to defend"
Raza stays deep in his crease to defend into the leg side.
"pushed through a little flatter. Again Raza stays back, and has to hurry his jabbed defence"
"there's a big appeal, but it's a very optimistic one, as ball hits pad. It pitched outside leg, and was turning even further in that direction"
"Raza skips out and flicks to midwicket, where a fumble allows him to get off the mark"
"Raza slaps a drive into the covers, where the fielder parries to mid off , allowing time for a quick single"
"worked to midwicket by Williams, and straight to the fielder there"
"speared down a little flatter, and aimed right at off stump. Williams defends"
"worked leg side once more, but the field is set for the shot and there's no run"
"a hint of turn in to the left hander from over the wicket, and this time Williams gets back to defend"
"Taijul hurries through another over, Williams once again nurdling the ball with the spin into the leg side."
pushed defensively into the covers
"almost back to the bowler! Raza wanted to punch through mid on, but he was too early in the shot. There's plenty of excitement, but it goes to Mehidy on the bounce"
tapped much more watchfully down the track this time
"it's a little on the short side, and Raza hops back and across to cut the ball hard into the covers. It's well stopped though"
"not stopped this one! Once again Raza's quick feet get him into a good position to cut a ball that's just a little too short and wide, and now he finds the gap"
"even better! Raza jumps out like Trumper to meet the ball on the full, and though he loses his shape a little in the stroke, gets a magnificent connection to send the ball arcing over long off"
Williams stays deep in his crease to defend into the leg side. He's still been patient so far
"well, maybe that patience is wearing thin! Out comes the big sweep from Williams - it goes in the air but lands safely on the leg side, well in front of the fielder out there."
"Raza sends the ball into the covers with a flat-batted swat, but he hits the fielder"
"Raza comes down the track with a one-two shuffle, but Taijul spots him early and adjusts the length"
squirted into the covers and he's looking for the quick single ... but there's none to be found
"this one goes on with the arm, but it's a little too short to threaten Raza's defence"
"Mehidy's length is a little short, and Williams hangs back to chop a cut past point."
"superb placement! Raza is reversing whatever pressure there might have been after Masakadza's dismissal. Mehidy floats up a half volley, and Raza swats a drive past mid off."
"Mehidy stays around the wicket, but the length is a little better on this one - not quite the half volley, and so Raza must defend"
"Mehidy goes over the wicket now, and Raza defends to point"
"looped up a little slower and a little wider, and Raza defends behind square with an angled bat"
"again Mehidy offers flight, and now Raza lunges well down the track to smother whatever turn there might be"
"and now the tip-and-run singles are starting to come. Williams finds space at cover, and Raza calls him through"
"Taijul comes around the wicket, and keeps Raza honest with a testing delivery on middle and off"
Raza offers the full face of the bat to punch defensively into the covers.
"Raza angles the bat face this time, and he finds the smallest of gaps in front of cover point for a quick single"
"bowled 'im! Well, Zimbabwe usually play the reverse sweep well, and Williams plays it as well as anyone, but the shot has now brought two wickets since lunch. Williams was quickly into position for the stroke, but the ball landed just a little too close to him to execute it properly. After a couple of ricochets, the ball finds its way onto the stumps, and Bangladesh have another. It looks like the ball came right off his boot, no bat involved."
"there goes another one! Mahmudullah took an age setting his field just right, and a rattled PJ Moor pushed with hard hands to offer silly mid off a simple catch. There was a man at a close, catching mid on, a short leg, silly mid off and a slip. They all crowded Moor, who tapped his first ball straight to Liton Das at silly mid off. Two in two!"
"Raza's still there, and it looks like he'll continue to play positively. A lapped sweep brings three down to fine leg"
"Chakabva plays his first ball right under his eyes, defending well"
"a little too short from Nazmul, but Chakabva's cut is intercepted at point."
"worked into the leg side, and in the gap, a quick single the result"
"a cut, an edge, and the ball has the beating of Mehidy as he tries to chase it down at third man. That will help ease the pressure on Zimbabwe"
"a full toss is firmly slapped down to that fielder at long off, and Raza retains the strike."
"safely kept out by Raza, who is very far forward to defend"
"Raza takes a couple of steps down the track to get to the pitch, and pushes back to the bowler"
"there goes another one! Taijul has his tenth wicket in the game, and Bangladesh are roaring back into this. Having used his feet so well at the beginning of the over, Raza inexplicably stays back to this one. The ball grips, turns and beats his desperate defensive push to rattle the stumps. This is his first 10-wicket haul in Tests."
"looped up on off stump, Wellington is half forward in defence"
"Taijul landing one wide of off, and the younger Masakadza defends. 'Heart is pumping big time here,' says Mushfiqur behind the stumps."
Masakadza steps forward to smother the ball into the leg side.
"Chakabva comes forward to defend, but the ball runs on with the arm to take the inner half of the bat, and they find a single to square leg"
speared harmlessly down the leg side
Masakadza keeps his weight on the back foot and works to midwicket
again Nazmul fires one down the leg side. Seems he's trying to bring those close catchers into the game
"and he almost brings the leg slip into play! Nazmul offers a touch more flight and the ball grips, spinning in to the left hander. He gets two down to fine leg, but that wasn't far at all from the outstretched hand of the close in fielder"
"Masakadza responds to the men crowding him with an aggressive sweep into the leg side to send heads ducking. Mahmudullah has also placed protection out in the deep though, so it's only one"
"Masakadza drives, but the bowler stops it in his follow through"
defended into the covers
"Masakadza isn't getting very far forward at all, but he's playing the ball nice and late and with soft hands. More defence"
"this time he's a little further forward, and defends to into the leg side"
"punched with a little more authority into the covers, but straight to the fielder"
"Taijul changes the angle for the final delivery, coming around the wicket, and Masakadza defends back to the bowler"
"he starts around the wicket, and Chakabva jabs down on a wide delivery to defend"
"chopped into the covers, and they collect a single"
"speared down the leg side from around the wicket, and the ball rushes on with the arm to be kicked away by Masakadza. No shot offered"
"<b>edged!</b> But it falls short of slip. Soft hands from Masakadza, and he plays it late. That's all that's saved him there."
nudged defensively into the leg side
"pushed through a little quicker by Mahmudullah, and there's a hint of grip off the surface. Masakadza stays deep in his crease to defend"
"watchful defence from Chakabva, who is well forward"
"lots of noise around the bat as Chakabva defends to silly point, on the bounce"
"a little too full from Taijul, and Chakabva threads a drive through cover"
"nurdled into the leg side, no run taken"
"that's a ripper! Turn and bounce, real rip. Mushfiqur has taken this up above his shoulder line. Chakabva didn't have a chance, groping forward to defend as the ball fizzed past him"
"and the follow-up is the arm ball, but Chakabva reads it and works the ball with the angle into the leg side"
"he comes around the wicket, and Chakabva meets the full ball with stolid defence"
"flatter through the air, and Chakabva is a little rushed as he defends to leg"
"easy runs. Mahmudullah fires one down outside leg, and Chakabva just needs to get bat on it. No leg slip in place"
"nicely tucked around the corner by Wellington. He picked the ball right off his toes, and they sprint back for three."
Chakabva thrusts his left leg forward to smother this back down the track
"worked with the angle through square leg, and a quick single means Chakabva retains the strike"
"zipped down on middle and off, watchful defence"
"Chakabva looks solid in defence, and he's well forward to meet this ball"
"looped down on off stump, and again Chakabva defends"
"defended to silly point, on the bounce"
"flatter, faster and shorter. Chakabva stays deep in the crease to defend past short leg"
"placed into the leg side, to the left of the short leg fielder, and there's just enough room for a quick single. Excellent shepherding from Chakabva"
"this one rushes on with the arm, and Chakabva has to re-adjust at the last moment to defend"
"flicked, but straight to the fielder at square leg"
"quick single! There's a gap at point, and as soon as Chakabva placed the ball there, Masakadza called him through"
"punched firmly, but straight to mid on"
"flighted on off stump, Masakadza defends"
"shot! Slammed straight back down the ground, and Masakadza collects a boundary. Mid on was too close to stop this, once it had the beating of the bowler. Zimbabwe's lead edges ever closer to 300"
"defended hard towards the silly mid off fielder, who collects it on the bounce"
"grip and turn! The ball jags away from Chakabva off the track, but he holds his bat inside the line"
defended back down the track with the full face
"is this <b>dropped?</b> Well, it's a very tough chance, if you can even call it that. Chakabva came forward to defend, and the ball dropped <i>just</i> in front of Liton at silly mid off."
"flicked with the angle into the leg side, Taijul coming around the wicket"
Chakabva defends solidly to complete another maiden
tapped defensively back down the track
"Mehidy comes around the wicket, Wellington defends to cover point"
"a straight bat keeps sends the ball to silly mid off, on the bounce"
"big shot, no dividend! Masakadza was aiming to punt this down the ground, but he finds mid off"
"worked into space on the leg side, a quick single taken"
"very nicely played by Chakabva. Mehidy stayed around the wicket, but didn't adjust his line for the right hander. All Regis has to do is get bat to ball, and he does so to collect a boundary to fine leg"
"spinning in to Masakadza, who works with the spin to find a single on the leg side"
"there's definitely some grip on this one, but Chakabva does very well to smother it in defence"
"tapped defensively to short leg, on the bounce"
"Taijul zones in on middle and off, and the ball meets a nicely straight bat"
"turned into the leg side, but there's a man at square leg to cut it off"
"Taijul switches to over the wicket for the final delivery, but the result from Chakabva is the same, and he defends back down the track"
"speared down on off stump, and Wellington defends to cover"
"turn and bounce! The ball leaps up at Masakadza from over the wicket, and he nearly sends an edge towards the slip as he tries to draw his bat out of the way"
defended back down the track
"Masakadza is well forward, and angles his defensive bat to push the ball to point"
Masakadza stays deep in the crease and jabs down hurriedly to defend
"there's an <b>appeal</b> here, but has the ball carried? Masakadza came forward to defend, and the ball took the inside edge into his pad. Rod Tucker calls for a replay, and the soft signal is not out. Replays confirm it's a bump ball and went to ground before silly mid off grasped it."
tapped softly back down the track
"spinning across Chakabva, from over the wicket, and he defends to silly mid off on the bounce"
yet more watchful defence
"Chakabva is really laying down an anchor here, batting time and occupying the crease. Yet more defence"
"leading edge! Chakabva stayed deep to defend as the ball spun across him, and it's fallen safely"
nudged to leg to end another tight over
Masakadza chops down on the ball to send it to point
he's well forward to defend towards short leg
"Masakadza is stretching out as far as he can now, smothering the ball in defence"
big appeal as ball scoots past bat! Was there an edge here? The players discuss a possible referral ... and decide against it.
"pushed softly back down the track, Masakadza using every inch of his height to get forward"
"solid defence to end the over, another maiden"
"quick single! The ball took the inside half of the bat, and Wellington called him through quickly to break the run of three maidens in a row"
"nicely played by Masakadza, who defends into the leg side"
this time he lunges forward to meet and smother the ball
"glanced just past the diving close fielder on the leg side, and they hurry back for the second"
a tentative drive sends the ball rolling into the covers
Masakadza is back and across to get right in line and defend back to the bowler
"there are cries of 'catch it!' as the ball leaps up at Chakabva from a middle stump line. The ball flies just wide of the leg slip fielder, who is very close to the bat on the leg side"
nudged defensively to leg
worked with the angle into the leg side. Mehidy is zoning in on Chakabva's pads to bring those close catchers on the leg side into play
tapped back at the bowler
"looped up a little wider of off stump this time, and Chakabva lunges forward to meet it"
"quicker one, and flatter too. Chakabva defends off the back foot"
"well wide of off, and Masakadza's eyes light up but he plays and misses a cut"
"again Taijul offers width, this time Masakadza lays bat on ball to get the ball to cover"
"left well alone outside off. The ball spins in to him, but not enough to endanger the stumps. Good leave"
"placed nicely into the covers, Masakadza well forward on the drive"
"turn and bounce! Every so often Taijul does this, and there's definitely some life in the wicket for the slow bowlers. To his credit, Chakabva keeps his bat well inside the line and doesn't follow it"
"the arm-ball is the follow-up, but it's read and met with a vertical defensive bat"
"Masakadza is looking for a gap on the off side with this drive, but none can be found"
"defence this time, and well played too"
"floated up on a leg stump line, from over the wicket, and Masakadza is half forward to defend"
"nicely played, this, and it takes Zimbabwe's <b>lead</b> to 300. Masakadza comes forward with soft hands to guide the ball behind point"
watchful defence back down the track
"tapped to the short leg fielder, on the bounce"
"low trajectory, but there's definitely some turn for him. Kept out by Chakabva"
Chakabva comes well forward to defend to cover
"Mominul holds this one back, and there's enough turn and bounce to beat Chakabva's forward poke"
"more excitement! Chakabva stretches forward but the ball finds the outside edge, landing just short and a little wide of Mahmudullah at slip"
"unrattled, Chakabva stretches into a forward defensive"
"too short, and he's not going to miss out on that. With fielders crowding the bat, Chakabva rocks back and slams a cut well in front of square"
"<b>keeps low</b> but Wellington is able to plant a defensive bat down on top of it, just outside off"
steps forward to block the tossed up delivery on off stump
"<b>beats him with a beauty</b>. It's tossed up on off stump, drawing Wellington forward. But as soon as it pitches, it veers away from the angle so sharply, beating the outside edge"
lets a good length ball outside off go - and it is ever so close to off stump too. Gorgeous bowling from Mehidy
"<b>lbw</b> to the slider but Wellington goes for a review. This is beautiful bowling. Pitching it right up on off stump, the undercutter meant to go on with the arm. Wellington goes back - which is a poor call - and is rushed by the ball zipping through to him, pinning him in front of middle. DRS gives out three reds and umpire Tucker's decision stands"
"gets this one to hold its line on middle and Mavuta, as he defends with bat in front of pad, gets a bit of an edge"
"drifts into the pads, Chakabva hits it to short leg"
stretches forward to block the flighted ball outside off
"shapes to cut, but the ball goes through under his bat, missing the edge and also missing the off stump. Oh, we're going to have fun in the fourth innings... Maybe not the Bangladesh batsmen though."
nudges it behind square leg
"slogs the length ball over wide long-on. Massive hit. Brave too, considering he's going against the turn"
"<b>skids through at shin height</b> but Mavuta is rock solid behind it, averting the danger to his stumps"
"tosses it up on middle, Chakabva keeps it out"
"<b>caught at short cover</b>! That's not what you do with a half-volley. Having looked fairly solid in defence, he goes for the drive - and it's wide enough to drive too - only he fails to place and he's utterly peeved with himself for the mistake. Spins around in disgust, hacking his bat at the air, before walking off."
"<B>beats him</b> with a teaser, angled into middle and ripping away past the batsman's front-foot poke."
pushes towards extra cover
"full toss, which he whacks to a deepish mid-off and sprints through for a single"
"<b>taken at deepish mid-off</b>. Two wickets in the over, to not especially great deliveries, but that's expected at the tail-end of a batting line up. Mavuta makes room to belt a length ball. But in making space for himself, he ruins his chances of making good connection. Toe-end strike goes straight up and Ariful takes a simple catch"
"defends the quicker, flatter delivery on middle"
slog sweeps the length ball over midwicket and it trots away to the boundary.
"again, he heaves it over midwicket even though there's a man placed out on the boundary this time. And with that strike, Bangladesh will have to break the record to win a Test match here."
"<b>big appeal for lbw</b> and umpire Kettleborough gives it. Chatara asks for the review, and it seems like he thinks he's hit it. Replays show he has, but the ball strikes pad first, before the bat comes into contact. This doesn't look good for Zimbabwe. The skidder is in line with middle stump. It straightens just enough, and does so at good pace, to trouble the batsman. Ball-tracking comes up - three reds - he's out"
"significant swing away from the right hander for Jarvis, but Liton has a good look and lets it go"
"another hooping outswinger from Jarvis, lovely shape on the ball. But it's still too far to draw a shot from Liton"
"Liton is squared up a little by one that pitches on leg and swings across him, but does enough to keep it out"
"a touch shorter, and this one doesn't swing. Liton works it off the hip to midwicket. He doesn't seem to be in any discomfort after twisting his ankle earlier in the field"
"pitched up, outside off, and curving towards the slips. Liton lets it go"
"Jarvis lands one full on off stump, and Liton presents the full face of the bat to drive it back to him"
"curving in through the air at the left-hander Imrul, who props forward in defence"
"this one is shaping down the leg side before Imrul meets it with a flick - uppish, but landing safely. Bangladesh's innings is up and running. Just the 320 more to get"
"there's swing for both of Zimbabwe's quicks so far, but Liton once again leaves alone"
"pushed fuller and straighter by Chatara, Liton dead-batting it on the front foot"
"squirted off the outer half of the bat, but along the ground to point"
"effort ball from Chatara, and it rises from a middle stump line but is easily negotiated by Liton, nudging to leg"
"angled across the left hander, who stands at the crease to defend"
"a hint of shape back in off a full length, but Imrul is right behind the line in defence"
"wrong line from Jarvis, and Imrul takes full toll with a neat little glance down to fine leg. Easy runs"
"that's a much better line from Jarvis, starting the ball on off stump and angling across the left hander, who comes forward to defend"
"Jarvis tests Imrul's front foot defence with a probing line, and the batsman stays firm"
"floated up, full and wide, but Imrul offers no shot"
"banged down just short of a good length, outside off, and it's left alone"
"pitched up, swinging away and inviting the drive. Liton leans forward to send the ball into the covers"
"Chatara changes his angle, coming in wide, and forces a hurried defence from Liton"
"slightly wider this time, left alone"
"zoning in at the top of off, and Liton meets it right under his eyes as he comes forward to defend"
"Liton hangs his bat out to punch off the back foot with minimal foot movement, the ball goes straight to gully"
flicks a shortish delivery towards midwicket
"good length on off stump, firmly knocks it back down the pitch"
lets go a fuller delivery darting across him
"hints of movement away from the bat, but Imrul plays late and close to his body, sending the ball to point"
"lovely bowling. He puts it right up there, teasing Imrul, seeing if he wants to drive, but the left-hander does well to temper those impulses and leave"
stands up tall and crunches the short ball outside off through cover. Beautiful cricket
"<b>outside edge</B>, wanders past the cordon. Tentative stroke from Imrul, only getting half forward to a fuller ball outside off"
short and wide and he cracks it to the point boundary. Waits beautifully for it and gets off the mark in style
"straight drive now, but mid-on cuts across to stop any runs"
flirts with a back of a length delivery outside off - not quite wide enough to cut - and <b>is beaten</b> on the bottom edge
"poor line, on the pads, and Liton flicks it calmly to long leg"
"angles into the right-hander, who dinks it away to long leg, mostly off the inside edge"
gets behind a back of a length delivery on middle and knocks it to midwicket
calmly taps the shortish delivery outside off to cover
gets forward to block a fullish delivery on middle and off stump
"a sweet drive, reaching forward to a pitched up delivery on off stump and turning the face of the bat to find mid-on"
opens the face as he waits on the good length ball on off stump and steers it to point
"darts the ball into the right-hander, and Liton, once again takes care to play with soft hands and close to the body. Lessons learned from his first-innings dismissal, it seems"
"<b>chance for a catch</B> but the ball darts past the right of gully! Beautifully bowled by Chatara, lulling the left-hander into playing in front of his body, the drive ball that seams away to take the edge but it just doesn't go to hand"
"good length, outside off, lets it go"
"full on off stump, blocks"
hits him on the stomach as Chatara gets a back of a length ball to hold its line and beat the inside edge
ignores a shortish delivery outside off
firmly behind a back of a length ball on off stump
"shortish on off stump, firmly defends"
"<b>sweet timing</b>. He stands up tall behind the back of a length delivery, only a shade outside off, and punches it to the right of point."
"draws him forward with a fuller ball on off stump, Liton hits it to silly mid-on"
"<b>so close to off stump</B>. But so long as the ball doesn't clatter into it, it's a good leave. Jarvis getting the ball to deck in off a length, making Liton's life just that bit difficult"
"now the outswing, hitting a good length outside off, Liton lets it go"
"bit of an outside edge, but he controls it, playing with soft hands and almost guiding the ball to the left of gully"
"flays it to the right of cover, a beautifully hit drive, but Raza at cover moves quickly to his right and stops a certain boundary"
nudges a short ball off his hips behind square leg
"full and outside off, lets it go"
"nice and full on off stump, he blunts it"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
steers the back of a length ball through cover point and that's drinks
"<b>big turn, big lbw appeal</b> but umpire Kelttleborough says no. The Zimbabweans come together to discuss and finally Masakadza calls for the review. Hmm. Might be a poor call  Raza draws Liton forward to block in line with off stump, but although the ball zips past the inside edge, and sharply at that, to strike the front pad, this looks like it might be turning down leg. And yep, ball-tracking says it would be missing the stumps."
"nicely tossed up, just around off, Liton is solid in defence."
"fired full on off, he gets forward and smothers this."
"shortens his length, drifts this into middle and leg, tucked to square leg for the first runs today."
"drift and turn from round the stumps, Imrul nearly defends."
once again a good stride forward as he smothers the turn.
"full, but it's a touch too straight and Liton flicks this nicely off his pad into the gap at square leg"
"shortens his length, brings it back in a touch, Liton defends back"
"length ball outside off, very little deviation off the pitch, left alone."
"poor delivery. That's a gift outside off, too short and wide. Sat up nicely and Liton smashed this cut shot over point."

"excellent from Chatara. Slants this across the left-hander, around that off stump at length, Imrul has a good, long look at that as he leaves."
"gentle push to mid-off, <strong>yes-no-yes-no</strong>, fortunately no damage done, Imrul makes it back in time."

"excellent shot! Drops short again, he makes room and punches past point, but there's protection in the deep."
"<strong>deceived in flight, looks to drive against the rough!</strong> This one flew off a thick inside edge, but lands short of short midwicket."
"<b> just eludes short leg! </B> It's all happening. Once again beaten by sharp turn as he looks to drive, whizzes off the inside edge, quickly to Chari, who moved well but just couldn't get his hands on the ball."

"cracker-jack of a delivery! Drifted in and left him just enough to beat his forward prod by a whisker. So, so close to the edge."
defended with soft hands as he lunges fully forward.
"fired full on off stump, defended back."
"drifts in and skids on, Imrul reads the line and length well as he defends back"
nearly had him jabbing to the keeper. Turn and bounce ensures this beats his forward push. Casting doubts in Imrul's mind. The noise around the bat has increased too as a result. Pressure on
"now, that's one way to release pressure. Long hop, Imrul makes room and slaps this into the gap to beat deep point. Top shot, that should make him feel much better."
"that's right in the corridor! Good start from the Zimbabwean quick, slinging one down on a length on a fourth stump line. Das has a look, and leaves alone"
"squirted past a diving gully, and Liton breaks a 21-delivery run of dots to get down the other end for a quick single"
"angling across his bows, and Imrul shoulders arms"
"Imrul stands tall in the crease to force a length delivery towards cover point. A touch of extra bounce there, perhaps, but it's well negotiated"
"watchful stuff, once again, as Imrul leaves well alone"
"<b>dropped in the slips!</b> They've grassed a chance. After all the pressure that had been built up, Imrul flashed outside off and the chance went hard right between Masakadza and Taylor at first and second slip. Neither committed to the catch, though Taylor seemed to get a palm to it. Jarvis is livid"
"tapped past a diving Chari at short leg, but square leg trots in to stop a single"
"looped up outside off, and Liton is forward to defend"
"Raza sends one down a little wider outside off, Liton covers his off stump and pads it away"
"nice use of the feet, Liton skipping out to meet the ball on the full and flick a single through mid on"
Imrul hops back and across to chop to point
"cut with a little more authority this time, but there's a deep extra cover to keep them to one"
"left alone outside off, Jarvis sticking to his lines"
"patient stuff from Jarvis, who continues to zone in on the corridor outside off. Patient, too, from Imrul, who leaves again"
"is this another <b>drop?</b> No, it's fallen just short of Taylor, falling to his right at second slip. Probing stuff from Jarvis, who drew Kayes forward to a ball he might have left"
"this time he does leave, stepping forward and across and raising his hands high"
"slashed off the back foot, a little uppishly but right through a gap at backward point"
"nipping in to Liton off the seam, and he works it into the leg side"

once again he props well forward to smother the spin
"off the outer half of the bat this time, but it goes safely to ground wide of slip and they scamper through"
"Raza gets away with a loose one here, Liton driving a full toss straight at the mid off fielder"
"much better delivery from Raza, landing the ball on a length outside off"
"<b>extended appeal for lbw!</b> Umpire Kettleborough says no, but they're reviewing it. Liton was aiming to pull to midwicket, but the ball just rushed on to him a little and struck him on the thigh and fairly adjacent. There's no bat involved, the impact is in line and it's hitting the top of middle. Three reds, the opening stand is broken and Zimbabwe celebrate! Excellent referral. Terrible shot."
"this is metronomic stuff from Jarvis, hitting a length and angling across the left hander to keep him honest. Left alone"
"closer to off stump this time, and so Imrul has to lean forward to defend with the full face"
"Jarvis continues to test Imrul's patience, offering up a driveable delivery outside off. Imrul won't be tempted"
"the ball is aimed for the top of off, but Imrul is solidly forward in defence"
"Jarvis aims this one much fuller, the surprise yorker perhaps, but it's spotted and dug out back to him"
"Jarvis ends a tight over with another delivery aimed right in the channel, forcing Imrul to defend"
"that's a confident start! Mominul skips out to turn the ball into a full toss, cracking it through wide mid on for four"
"this time he cuts, Raza having over-corrected his length a touch"
"slightly frenetic stuff from Mominul, who is clearly going to get after the bowling. Again he charges out, but this time the drive pings mid off"
"chopped hard towards backward point, where Wellington Masakadza sprints round to cut it off"
"Mominul comes forward to drive, just a touch uppishly, to extra cover"
"Mominul lunges forward once again, driving back to the bowler"
"testing lines from Jarvis, and Imrul raises his hands high above his head to leave alone. There's an absorbing battle unfolding between bowler and batsman out there, and so far Imrul has held firm"
"crashed out to cover point! Jarvis' line drifted just a little too far outside off and Imrul leaned into a cracking drive. He got a great connection, but Raza is the fielder out in the deep and he sprints round to stop the boundary"
"strong riposte from the bowler, the ball rising off a fourth stump line, but Imrul's judgement is good and he leaves it alone"
"fuller and wider, but this time there's no drive from Imrul"
Imrul shoulders arms once more

beauty! Drew him forward with the drift and then got this to fizz away to beat the edge.
makes room and punches this shortish delivery to point.
"slants a length delivery across the left-hander, left alone."
<strong>this is a jaffa!</strong> Mominul was expecting it to angle away but this one just held its line to beat the feeble push from the crease.
"<b> he's chopped on! </b> Jarvis belts out a roar and Zimbabwe are on top here. Intense bowling and the rewards are coming. Gets this to bounce extra off a length, the angle is moving away. Where Mominul was better off defending with a straight bat, he attempts to punch on the up. But the bounce ensures he's in no position and it takes the thick inside edge before smashing the stumps."
"somehow manages to squeeze this delivery back. Excellent from Jarvis. Gets this to angle in from length, keeps a touch low, defended back. Good first ball to a batsman who has just come in, that should wake him up if he isn't up already"
gets forward and jabs this away into the off side.
"late reverse back in from outside off, squeezed back past the bowler to get off the mark."
works this with the spin to wide mid-on for a quick single.

"drifts in and skids through, defended with soft hands."
"absolutely drills this inside-out, hits the silly point fielder who was trying to take evasive action. This hit him inside that left knee by the looks of it. Ouch, painful stuff. You need guts to be fielding there. Williams the fielder."

"ooooh, dangerous! Late movement back in, this was honing in towards middle, Mahmudullah somehow manages to squeeze this to mid-on for a single. A very risky one, Chatara late to run in and fire a throw at the bowler's end. Who knows what may have been had he hit direct. And he slipped as well while throwing, so that didn't help matters."

"spinning away from outside off, chopped to point"

"Mahmudullah shuffles away as he spots a little width, but there's not much to work with and he guides to gully"

"Raza lands this one just too wide of off to get Imrul playing, and it turns even further away"
"very full, and it's dug out back to the bowler"

Mahmudullah stays deep in his crease to work the ball in the same direction
"Williams pushes his length a little fuller, and Mahmudullah is forward in defence"
"tight stuff from Williams, offering nothing outside off. Mahmudullah defends"
"well, just as I type that he serves up a long hop outside off stump, but there's cover in the deep and Mahmudullah's stroke only brings one"
"Williams switches to over the wicket and spears one down a little flatter, hurrying Imrul's chop to point"
"a little bit of turn, but it's slow and easily negotiated as Mahmudullah nurdles in front of square"
"cracking delivery! Well, he might be tired but he's still capable of producing unplayable gems such as this one. Dipping in from outside off to draw Imrul forward, the ball grips and fizzes away from the outside edge"
"well covered this time by Imrul, who is forward to smother the spin"
"<b>big appeal!</b> for lbw! Kettleborough is unmoved. And rightly so, as replays show there was a little inside edge"
"solid defence this time, Imrul pressing forward to present the full face"

"that's a better line to the left hander, and Imrul stays deep in his crease to defend"
"worked down to fine leg, and there are some yelps of excitement from the close in Zimbabweans. This went through the vacant leg slip"
"left alone outside off, and the ball bursts out of the rough as Chakabva parries to leg"
"how do you play this? Absolute jaffa. Pitching leg, spinning past off, and Mahmudullah is totally squared up as he plays and misses. Excellent work from Chakabva to hold onto this one, it really took off"
a rather more sedate leave to end the over
"slider from Raza, and Imrul spots it to work a single into the leg side"
Mahmudullah crouches low and comes well forward to drive to extra cover
"off the inside half of the bat, but straight to ground on the leg side"
Imrul comes forward and smothers the ball into the leg side
"<b>bowled him!</b> Raza strikes again! Imrul had chosen his shots so wisely up to this point, but now he falls to an unnecessary paddle sweep. The ball was floated right up to him, drifting down the leg side, but it was too full for the sweep, and he's bowled around his legs."
"punched firmly back down the track, and mid on gets round to clean up"
"another slider from Williams, but it's well read and a glide through gully brings one"

"tapped down towards cover point, and Chatara is a little sluggish off the mark getting to it, so there's time for a single"

"breaks back in from the rough outside, he gets outside the line and defends."
"shapes to cut, but is beaten by the fizz. The length was a touch too full and he was late on the shot."
"the marathon man strikes again, this is a very poor stroke. He wasn't sure whether to play full-blooded sweep or just defend. In the end, he got into an awkward tangle, and the ball hit the glove, onto the body and to the short leg fielder. Alarm bells ringing in the Bangladesh camp"

"fetches the sweep from outside off towards deep square. Can be a risky proposition if there's sharp turn, like there is on this case."
"oh dear, what have you done at the stroke of lunch? This is a loose shot, what a terrible way to go. He better not look into the coach's eyes for a while to come. This is an attempted googly gone wrong, the length is too short and this was sitting up for him to slap, Shanto after giving himself the room suddenly checks his shot and ends up chipping it. Raza dives to his right and point to complete an excellent catch. <b> It's lunch and Zimbabwe are on top! </b>"
and he serves up a loopy full toss outside off that is left well alone
"accurate start from the seamer, who hits a length outside off to have Mushfiqur defending off the back foot"
"Mushfiqur leans into a neat little cover drive, flowing through the stroke. It's a good connection, he didn't over-hit it but there's time for them to scamper through for three"
"Jarvis' plan is simple, and he's sticking to it. Ariful stays in his crease to defend a length delivery on off stump"
"that's gone like a legbreak! The ball also swung after pitching and Chakabva grassed his take. Was there an outside edge? Fortunately for the wicketkeeper, nothing on it, but a cracking delivery."
"Ariful leans forward to defend into the covers, Jarvis' line making him play"
"a touch straighter this time, but Ariful's nudge to leg is a tentative one and the ball goes nowhere"
"some bounce and turn for Mavuta, but Mushfiqur rides it well to collect a single through gully"
"nicely flighted by the young legspinner, but Ariful is well forward to defend"
"big turn! Mavuta's extra rip on this meant he dug the ball in a little short, but it leapt up at Ariful and ended up hitting him on the bicep. That really took off"
nudged gently to cover
"play and a miss! Mavuta floated the legbreak right up there and Ariful threw himself into an extravagant drive. The ball fizzed past him and the wicketkeeper, and they collect a bye"
"Mushfiqur spots a full toss early and flicks to midwicket. Not the greatest delivery to end the over, but Mavuta seems to have found some early rhythm"
"Jarvis continues to plug away in the channel, but Mushfiqur's patience holds and his defence is watertight"
"a touch of outswing for Jarvis, and Mushfiqur leans forward before leaving alone"

"Jarvis loses his line for the first time, the ball pinging off Mushfiqur's pad and down to fine leg"

chopped off the stumps to gully
"Mushfiqur is forward this time, leaning right over the ball to smother the spin"
"<b>caught in the deep!</b> Mushfiqur missed a sweep in Mavuta's last over, now he's top edged one. The extra bounce meant the ball took the top edge, and Masakadza sprinted in from deep square leg to hold onto a diving catch. His sunglasses flew off his hat as he went to ground, and for a moment it looked like he'd grassed it ... but it's a clean catch, and Zimbabwe have taken a significant forward step in their push for victory."
"floated up outside off, and it's left well alone"

good stride forward as he smothers this tossed up delivery.
"slow turn as it drifts into middle, the length is short, so the batsman has enough time to defend off the backfoot"
"rocks back to cut this behind point bus is beaten by the skid on this delivery. Acres of open space on the off side, so you have to say a scoring opportunity has been missed."
eased into the gap at extra cover for an easy single
"sees this delivery tossed up, his eyes light up and so he stands his ground and muscles this to clear long-on quite effortlessly. Got close to the pitch so he negated the turn in trying to play across. Good, clean strike."

"short on middle and leg, whipped to deep midwicket as they jog the single."
stifled lbw appeal but the ball pitched miles outside leg before spinning away to hit the pad as he atempted a tickle
goes straight down the ground and clears mid-off. The timing wasn't all that great and so the ball slows down near the boundary. Jarvis with the mopping up.
"beautiful bowling. Plenty of revs, there's enough turn as it lands on the rough outside off and spins away. Mehedy jabs at this and gets the thinnest of edges. That said, it still needed some catching from Chakabva, who rode the bounce very nicely to pouch this safely. Mavuta continues to impress, what a delivery, one that would've made any top legspinner of yore very, very proud."
"fired full on the stumps, defended back."
rocks back and slaps this length delivery to sweeper cover.
lunges forward and works this gently into the leg side with the spin
gets on top of the bounce and turns this gently towards leg gully.
"<b> first Test wicket for Wellington Masakadza! </b> Nice flight, enticed Taijul to go over the top. He does exactly that but the turn means he ends not just just toe-ending it but also drag it straight to long-on. Coach Lalchand Rajput is on his feet. <strong>Zimbabwe are not far from their first away win in 17 years.</strong>"
"this is an almighty heave and boy, has he picked the bones out of it or what! Sails into the deep midwicket region. Super hit, super connection."
"draws him forward and beats the inside edge with sharp turn. The appeal was convincing, umpire Richard Kettleborough ruled it out on the field. Bangladesh went for a review, with the hope that this may have bounced over, but ball tracking confirms this as umpire's call. The ball struck just about in line and would've clipped the stumps."
"jabs at this quicker delivery outside off, beaten."
beauty! Spins away sharply from outside off to beat his forward push.

dances down the pitch and swings this freely to just clear long-off. Was happy taking on the boundary rider. Clean strike.
"shorter in length, goes right back and blocks"
"reaches out and smokes this inside-out to the extra cover boundary. Raza at extra cover flung himself to his left, may have got a finger on that. Hit so hard that the ball raced to the fence despite that"

"fired full on off, he just about manages to squeeze it out. This ball was honing in towards his left toe."
"huge lbw appeal as he's hit on the pad in trying to prod forward. First thought was he was struck outside the line, but Zimbabwe have decided to review. Okay, I was completely wrong about the line. This was a googly that spun back in to beat the inside edge and hit him on off stump. So the impact was in line, but the ball was going over. <b> Zimbabwe lose a review. </b>"
"<b> Zimbabwe have recorded their first away win since 2001! </b> What scenes in Sylhet. The batsman is completely deceived in flight, he goes for a wild heave, but ends up getting a top-edge. This is so high in the air, that two fielders are underneath it. Regis Chakabva, the keeper, calls for it and settles underneath it to complete an excellent catch. He immediately uproots the stumps before running in to join his mates in celebration. <b> Hail the spirit of the Zimbabweans </b>"
