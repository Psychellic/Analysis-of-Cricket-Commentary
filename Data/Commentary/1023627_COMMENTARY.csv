"back of a length outside off, stands tall and knocks it to covers"
"seems like it has landed on the boundary cushions on the full. Yes, it has. They don't even go upstairs to check. Fuller and outside off, lofted over long-on and the ball bounces right on the ropes"

"fuller and angled across on off, tries to carve it through the off-side off the front foot and gets an inside edge to short fine leg. Nearly chopped on"
"lofts it through long-on and sends it straight down the throat of the fielder there. It was full and Harris walked across early, probably that did not give the room he desired. Wells takes it reverse-cupped in front of the boundary"

"fullish ball on the stumps, turns it towards mid-on after getting the front leg out of the way"

worked to cover
"back of a length, pulled away off the backfoot to deep midwicket"

"length ball, angling in on the stumps, punched firmly to short cover"
"fuller on off, driven to long-off"
"back of a length and angling in, tucked with the angle through square leg. Deep midwicket runs to his right and cuts it off"

"flatter full ball on off and spinning away, White comes forward and pushes it just wide of the bowler who fails to pick it up cleanly on the follow-through"

"flatter full ball outside off, driven out to cover-point"
"fuller and outside off, comes forward and drives it out to sweeper cover"

"tries to slog this one wildly and does not get hold of it, skews it to long-on"
swivels around to pull and helps it along the deep fine leg boundary
walksa cross the stumps early before whipping this length ball behind square. It goes just over the outstretched hands of the fielder at short fine leg. Flew past him but mighty close. Would have been a superb catch had he held it
"half-volley outside off, just employs a flick of the wrists before lofting it cleanly over deep midwicket"
that one's even bigger and even better as well. Walks across past the off-stump early to get in position and heaves this good length ball over deep square leg
"full toss, driven to the left of mid-off who moves across to gather it"
"fuller outside off, driven past the diving short cover fielder but cannot get it past  extra cover"
"tries to do the same thing as earlier by walking across the stumps and trying to heave it over the leg side. Does not middle it well this time and gets it off the bottom part of the bat, which means he gets elevation but not the distance. It seems momentarily as though it would carry all the way but Wells settles under it at deep square leg and snaffles it. What an entertaining innings from White"

tries to slog sweep it and gets it off the inside edge to backward square leg
stays back and tries to tuck it away but misses and the ball strikes his pad before going to the off-side

"full and outside off, pummels it down the ground to long-off who moves a couple of steps to his right to field it"
"big edge, big dive but to no avail as the ball runs away to the third man boundary. Finch was trying to slap it away but there is not enough room for him to free his arms and he gets a thickish outside edge that flies away past the wicketkeeper who flings himself up and to his right"
"what an effort from Daniel Christian at the deep midwicket boundary. It was a short ball and Cooper swivels around and pulls. Gets a lot of elevation and it seems like a clean hit but Christian runs across and leaps to get his hand to it. Pushes it away as he does so and the ball, to his dismay, drops bang on the boundary rope"
rocks back to hit this shorter ball through the leg side. They go upstairs to check if it has landed in front of the boundary but it seems to have landed just on the boundary
No need to worry about catch or where it lands this time around. Short and enough room for Cooper who lays into the pull shot and shovels it clean over the deep midwicket boundary. Goes way back into the crowd
width on offer outside off and Cooper reaches out for it before running it away to sweeper cover
"gets down for a huge slog sweep and skews it into the air off the top edge. The ball has been skied and seems to stay up for all of eternity. The midwikcet region is empty and several players run across to it, including wicketkeeper Tim Paine. He calls for it and settles under it before taking it fairly comfortably. But that was anything but easy"
worked out to sweeper cover
worked to midwicket
flashes outside off and gets a thick edge that runs away to square third man and goes on the bounce to the fielder there

turns it away to midwicket from the crease
pushed through flat and down the leg side and Cooper gets down to sweep and manages to beat the deep backward square leg fielder. Not the quickest outfield but struck with immense power
"short and wide outside off, slapped out to sweeper cover"
short of a length at a flatter trajectory. Opens the face of his bat after waiting for it to come on but cannot beat the diving backward point fielder
gets down to reverse sweep and cannot make contact as it is bowled slower through the air and he gets it to spin away a bit
"short of a length and angling in, looks to swivel around and pull, gets a top edge, a big one, but the ball sails comfortably over the deep fine leg boundary"
"slower full ball outside off, drilled hard off the front foot but chips the drive straight into the hands of mid-off. Struck quite well ut does not get enough elevation as he fails to pick the drop in pace"
"misfield at the deep square leg boundary. Straightforward pick up for Jake Reed but he makes a bad mess of it after swooping down and lets it go between the legs after failing to wrap his hands around it. Coming to the delivery, it was short and Perera tried to pull but it is a weak shot as he cannot get hold of it"
worked down to long-on
"slower short ball, pulled away to deep backward square leg and the fielder running across, from deep fine leg perhaps, cannot get to it"
gets down to sweep and nails it as he works this low full toss from outside off to the deep square leg boundary. Lovely shot. It was fired at 130 clicks and he used the pace on the delivery
full and angling in on off from wide of the crease. Swings hard on the slog and creams it over wide long-on and it goes a good 10 rows or so back
"full and outside off, yorker, drags it from outside off to mid-on which is vacant so they can scamper back for the second"
"<b>dropped</b>. Desperate attempt and a good one at that by Broad. It was a full ball and Perera was looking to slog it away. Gets a leading edge that is skied and Broad has to run a long way back, does well to get near it but just cannot get two hands to it as the ball hits his right hand and falls into the turf. It was a cross-seam slower ball. Would have been an unbelievable catch if he had got it"
turned away to deep midwicket
"angled down the leg side and Cooper got in position early by moving across early. Scoops it over the wicketkeeper's head and the ball runs away into the boundary. That's fifty for Cooper, off 22 balls. What an innings this has been"
"fuller ball, drilled down to long-on from outside off. He will keep the strike for the last over"
good slower yorker outside off that is dug out behind the stumps and the wicketkeeper runs in and picks it up
lucky boundary. He was trying to slog this fuller ball away into the leg side and gets the inside edge instead. Misses the stumps and goes away well wide of the wicketkeeper and into the fine leg boundary
"full and wide at 138 clicks, squeezed out to backward point and they concede an overthrow as the fielder fires a throw at the striker's end that wasn't really required"
and another one off the inside edge goes away to the boundary. Tries to carve this full ball over the leg side and gets a fine inside edge to the fine leg fence. It was cross-seam. Forgot to mention - Renegades have got their highest total ever
"very full and on the stumps, dug out straight back to the bowler as he takes it over the head"
slices it to sweeper cover off the leading edge as he tries to slog across the line and they come charging back for the second
tucked to the leg side off the backfoot
comes forward to drive and skews it off the inside edge to mid-on
"Perera comes around it at deep midwicket and snaffles it without fuss. Gets down for the slog sweep and skews it off a thick edge. It was given just enough air and slightly quicker. Cooper picks out the deep midwicket region, skies the ball there and Perera runs a few steps to his left before completing  good catch"
"pitched up outside off, hammered with a half-angled bat to long-off"
worked to midwicket
"length ball, presents the full face of his bat and knocks it down to long-off"
stays leg side of this short of a length ball to give himself room before slapping it away through extra cover. The ball is pulled back by the fielder who gives it a chase and he drags out a good chunk of sand as he slides towards the boundary
hammered straight back to the bowler with a flat bat. Uppishly and had Renegades excited for a moment but it lands safe
"full and angling down leg, gets down to sweep and the ball goes to the deep square leg region"
"pushed across to the left-hander from around the wicket and pitched up outside off, lofted over mid-off and the ball goes a couple of bounces over the boundary"
"flighted ball, turned away to midwicket"
gets down for an almighty slog sweep and misses altogether
angled in to the left-hander from around the wicket and lofted over long-on. Gets down one a knee and launches it clean over the boundary
"goes for the same sweep but this one is not full enough. It is on a length and he misses as the ball takes out off-stump. Loopy delivery, sliding in and the angle perhaps did him in as he cannot make contact on a wild attempt at a slog"
brings out the reverse sweep and finds backward point
comes down the track to meet the pitch of this ball but there is not enough room so his attempted loft over long-on does not come off well. He can only chip it in the air but there is no fielder there and the ball drops in front of the fielder running across from deep midwicket
tries to work it through the off side but it is a packed field and he cannot find the gap
drills it through the off side but again cannot find the gap

tries to cut outside off but it keeps low and he gets beaten
punched off the backfoot to covers
"pitched up on the stumps and not enough time for it to turn because of the length, launched clean over deep midwicket and the ball sails into the crowd"
"comes down the track and tucks it to square leg, there is a fielder stationed there and it goes straight to him. They think of the single and decide against it but the fielder has already fired a throw at the non-striker's end and the ball runs away after hitting the stumps, allowing them to steal the overthrow"
swept behind square
tries to go big over the off-side field and carve it but gets an inside edge and the ball goes to fine leg

uses his feet to meet the pitch of this ball before crunching it straight down the ground and the ball sails into the crowd over the long-on region
lofts one straight again and get a lot of elevation but this one is not as well-struck. It is slightly shorter and he does not get it off the middle. The ball bounces just in front of the boundary
""
gets the front leg out of the way and knocks this straight to the fielder at cover who fires a throw to the bowler but they are extremely quick in completing the single
"starts off by hitting the high 140s straight away, fired on middle and off, and it is knocked to long-on"
"fullish length ball outside off, whipped away to longon"
"length ball, some width on offer, opens the bat face to guide it to backward point"
"full and sliding down leg, misses the tuck and gets rapped on the pad. Faint appeal for lbw but that was definitely heading down leg. The ball rolls away to the off side and they sneak a leg bye"

""
"short ball, lays into a pull shot and actually uses the pace of Pattinson as the ball sails over the deep square leg boundary"
smoked. Shifts back in the crease to this length ball which means it is shorter to him than it was intended to be and launches it over deep square leg and swivels around. The ball goes into the second tier
"slower short of a length ball, angling in at 117kph, tucked off the pads to square leg. They think of the second but decide against it"
tries to make room and carve this over the off side but it is a slower ball legcutter and he gets an outside edge that beats the fielder diving at gully

"width on offer outside off, worked to backward point with an open bat face"
"fuller ball, drills it just wide of the fielder at extra cover"
"flat and on a length, gets down on one knee and slog sweeps it clean over deep midwicket. Huge, huge hit, into the second-tier again"

"fires it full, flat and wide outside off, slashes hard at it and gets it to deep point. And that is fifth for McDermott, off 30 balls"
drilled down to long-on for a single
"shorter ball, pulled away to deep midwicket"
comes down the track to this ball on leg and takes it on the full before driving it to extra cover
backs away to this slower ball and hammers it with a flat bat past the diving extra cover fielder. The ball is cut off by long-off moving to his left
"full and on leg stump, tries to clip it off the pads but cannot make contact and the ball goes off the pads to short fine leg"
moves across to get in position early for a scoop but cannot get it wide of the fielder at short fine leg
"slower length ball at 101kph, picks it up and waits for it before shovelling it over long-on. Because of the lack of pace, the ball does not travel a long way but just about enough to beat the fielder's attempt to pouch a catch and carry all the way for six over long-on"
"flatter ball, tries to fetch a slog from outside off and skews it off the edge. But the ball drops short of the fielder running in from deep midwicket"
reverse-scoops this length ball through the third man region. Stays in the air for quite some time but there is no fielder there. It's the switch hit actually

"gets down for a slog sweep but does not make contact and the ball misses the keeper as well as it bounces sharply and goes away towards third man. Actually, he got a top-edge on that which is what unsettled the keeper"
turned away to midwicket
flighted outside off but given too much air. McDermott drills this full toss through covers and the ball beats sweeper cover running to his right
"sixth six for McDermott. Short ball, swivels around and pulls it over deep square leg for a clean six. Moves to 80"
"yorker outside off, dug out to wide of mid-off"
"slower short of a length ball outside off, legcutter, and McDermott picks up the pull from outside off and sends the ball crashing through midwicket"
how do you explain that shot! It was at 144kph and he just walks across and closes the bat face late to help it along its way over the short fine leg fielder
"slower short of a length ball, pulled to deep square leg"
"lost control of that and bowls a high full toss that Bailey manages to fend off to deep midwicket. Free hit coming up and McDermott on strike. They can change the field because of the field, and sure enough, captain and bowler take their time to have a chat and adjust the field"
"that's a ridiculous shot. Nothing wrong with that ball at all. It was a full and wide ball, he went for the wide yorker, did not quite get it as well as he would have liked but it was still not a bad ball. McDermott carves it over point for a clean six"
"and that's a hundred for McDermott. First century of the season and he gets an applause from the crowd. You won't get to see too many of those, and certainly not too many that are that good. Eighth six. Coming to the delivery, it was short and McDermott swivels around and pulls it clean over deep backward square leg. <b>Third-fastest in BBL history</b>"
"slower length ball, shovelled away to deep midwicket"
yorker on middle and leg clipped away to square leg. They run the first one hard but decide against the second as the fielder from the deep charges in and swoops down to pick up the ball
"belted down the track with a flat bat between long-off and long-on and they easily complete a brace. Well, it's not as easy as it looks but they are making it look so"
"another one. Have really lost count of it. Well, why bother counting them? Let's just enjoy them. Sits back in the crease and heaves this short ball over deep midwicket"
"full and straight, tonks it straight down the ground and the ball beats the diving long-on fielder who goes after it with his left hand outstretched. On the bounce and over the boundary"
"full and wide outside off, drilled very hard out to sweeper cover. Desperate cries of catch it as it is played uppishly but it lands safely in front of the fielder"
"gone, McDermott perishes on the reverse sweep but what an innings. It was slightly short of a length and angling down leg. McDermott was looking to reverse sweep it and gets totally cramped for room. Wears it on the pad. Looked plumb though there was that lingering doubt if it would have missed leg. But the umpire does not think so and raises his finger"
""
makes room for himself and slaps this short of a length ball square of the wicket
"stays in the crease to this length ball and turns it away to square leg, the man in the deep runs in and cuts it off"
"short of a length, fends it off with a flat bat to deep midwicket"

makes room but it is too straight and he is forced to work it back to the bowler
""
"pitched up on the stumps, gets down on one knee and slog sweeps it over deep square leg"
"flighted and full on the stumps, brings out the sweep again, does not try to hit it as hard this time but the ball screams past the deep midwicket boundary nonetheless"
plumb. Hogg has the last laugh. That looked out from the moment it hit the pad. It was fuller and quicker. Given the right amount of air. Christian got down to sweep but it was too straight and there was no way he was going to put bat to it. Gets pinged on the pad and the umpire raises his finger almost as soon as Hogg appealed
"two in two. Double strike for Hogg, puts Renegades back into the contest. He's on a hat-trick but he has to wait until the next game to try and achieve that. He's done with his spell. Wells moved across and looked for the sweep shot but gets a long way away from the ball. Exposes all three stumps and the ball crashes into them after hitting him on the pad"
he can conjure a six. High and up over deep midwicket. Full and on the toes. Bailey was back in the crease and he launches it over the leg side and clean over the boundary
"full and outside off, Bailey drills it just wide of long-off. There was no way there was a second run there but the intent was there from the beginning, Bailey puts in the dive which saves him at the striker's end"
backs away to make room for himself and the bowler fires it wide outside off. Bailey reaches out for it and slips as he loses balance while stretching
"half-volley outside off, that is not the kind of delivery you want to be bowling at this stage or any stage in a T20. Hammered over extra cover"
"full and outside off, swings wildly as he tries to force it through the on side and gets beaten"
full and wide and what a response from the batsman. Bailey walks across the stumps early and meets the pitch of it before carving it through the sweeper cover fence
gets down to sweep but makes no contact. Think he gets hit on the shoulder and the ball goes away towards short third man
"short of a length, not much pace at all but Bailey picks up the lack of pace early and waits for it. It takes ages to come on but he pulls it away towards the cow corner region and deep midwicket runs across and cuts it off"
""
"slog sweep. Length ball outside off, has to fetch it from there and does not get hold of it. Skews it off the top edge and the ball goes straight down the throat of Cooper at deep midwicket"
"goes for a slog sweep and does not middle or time it too well. Gets it only as far as wide of long-on and ridiculous running again. No way that is two but Bailey darts across, runs as if his life depended on it and puts in the dive. May have slipped in the end there"
picks out long-on. Flat-bats this length ball and that never looked like it was going to carry. Marcus Harris gets around it and slides as he snaffles it reverse-cupped
drags this attempted pull to short fine leg off the inside edge. Slower ball
"full and wide outside off, gets a thick outside edge as he throws his arms at it. Narine dives to his left and gets his hand to it and takes the momentum off the ball. It rolls away slightly and they think of charging back for the second. Narine recovers well and fires a direct throw at the keeper's end. The batsman is short of his crease but it seems like the wicketkeeper's glove may have touched the stumps and Boyce has been asked to wait. The third umpire has had a long, hard look at it and decides that the keeper has done fine there"
"full toss, swings hard and misses. And the ball gets away from the wicketkeeper as well and they take the bye. The wicketkeeper fires a throw at the striker's end and a direct hit would have seen the back of the batsman. Instead, it misses and there is no one backing up, so they take another off the overthrow. So three runs and an extra ball"
tries to slog and skies it and the ball lands in the deep midwicket region.
"oh, goodness. Maybe went for a yorker but ends up sending a half-volley on the pads and Broad whips it away through the square leg region and the ball beats the fielder chasing it"
"outside edge. What luck, or terrible luck, depending on who you are supporting. Slower ball, wide outisde off, Broad looks to slog and gets an outside edge to the third man boundary. It was a nothing half-volley outside off and deserved to be put away, one way or the other"
"and a leading edge does it for the Hurricanes. Tries to work it through the leg side and ends up chipping it in the air, over mid-off who is inside the circle, which means that the ball lands safely"
