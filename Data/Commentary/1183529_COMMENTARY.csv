"138kph, swinging away, he drives and <strong>gets a thick edge</strong> that flies safely through the vacant gully and carries beyond the circle to third man"
"138kph, yorker, right on the money, he just digs it out. Brilliant delivery and equally well played"
"137kph, length ball across him, he flashes and misses trying to square drive"
"138kph, fuller outside off, he mistimes a drive slowly to mid off and runs with the stroke"
"137kph, angled down leg, does he get a tickle or does it come off pad? Either way it fell short of Carey"
"137kph, angled into the hip, he jumps back and glances this to wide fine leg and they push for two but only get one"
"138kph, full and some swing into the left hander, he pushes a drive to mid on and takes a tight single"
"138kph, fuller outside off, he reaches away from his body and miscues a drive to mid off"
"134kph, good length outside off, he tries to drive but drags it off the thick inside half off the bat through square leg to the sweeper"
"he shuffles down to a 140kph full inswinger, beaten for pace, it comes off the pad and rolls away. He was hit outside leg"
"<strong>beaten</strong> by a 138kph, good length wobbling in and seaming away outside off"
"he charges and <strong>lofts this over mid on!</strong> Didn't nail it. It was 138kph, shaping in a length and he shimmied down to turn it to a half volley. Good shot"
"140kph, fired down the leg side and called wide"
swinging way down the leg side and rightly called wide again. Carey has to dive a long way
"<strong>thumping square drive straight through Turner at point.</strong> It was a length ball and wide, he stands tall and crunches past Turner at point"
<strong>Given out LBW.</strong> He's been given and Babar <strong>reviews</strong>. This was full and shaping into the pad late. There was a big appeal and it carried to slip. There's no bat involved. Nothing on hot spot. RTS appears to say pad only. Daylight between bat and ball. Ball tracking is a little slow. We have to wait 30 seconds for ball tracking. Ball tracking says <strong>umpire's call! Clipping leg. It stays out LBW</strong>. It was just pitching in line and just clipping the outside of leg.
"<strong>Bowled him! Searing 140kph inswinger!</strong> This was like a heat-seeking missile. Started on off, swung late through a gaping gate as he tried to drive away from his body. His pads were outside leg, his bat outside off, the ball swerved through and crashed into middle and leg"
"142kph, good length outswinger on off, he pushes a drive to mid off"
"142kph, fuller length, no swing, he drives firmly back to the bowler and it comes off Starc and ricochets to mid off"
"138kph, bouncer and he ducks under it easily"
"good length, hint of shape across him, he pushes a length ball to point"
"he charges early and it's banged in 131kph, into the ribs and he defends knocking it down"
"short on leg, he pulls to wide fine leg, they push hard for two on Abbott's arm and Imam has to dive to make it! They check upstairs but he's home just"
"137kph, short ball, over middle, he backs away and tries to uppercut but misses"
"137kph, short ball, he pulls and <strong>miscues off the top edge</strong> but it lands safely at the circle at midwicket"
play and miss at a135kph length ball that swung away late
"132kph, length ball, top of off, he defends from the crease towards point"
"<strong>thumped straight over the umpire's head!</strong> 132kph, in the slot and he swings through the line and hammers it straight at the sightscreen"
"<strong>top edge caught at midwicket!</strong> Short ball banged in outside off, he tries to pull but goes from low to high with his hands, gets a top edge that flies straight up to midwicket, McDermott camps under it and takes the catch very easily. That was a poorly executed stroke"
"135kph, good length fourth stump line, he pushes towards mid off"
"132kph, back of a length, he pushes away from his body to backward point and Smith makes a superb diving save"

"back of a length on off, he stands up and defends"
"144kph, full inswinger and he <strong>whips with the swing behind square</strong> Good shot. Conventional stroke, using the pace to ping it behind square"

"141kph, fuller outside off, he tries to drive he miscues to mid on"
"138kph, bouncer over leg, he half pulls half ducks, it flies through to Carey. No wide call"
<strong>magnificent cover drive!</strong> Another long half volley and he leans forward to pound it through the big gap at cover.
"short ball into the ribs, he gets inside the line and works it around the corner to fine leg"
"134kph, short ball, climbing outside off, he tries to cut and it beats him for bounce"
"142kph, fuller outside off, he drives hard and <strong>slices a thick outside edge</strong> high and wide of third man"
<strong>thick edge nearly carries to third man!</strong> Richardson ran in off the rope and couldn't block the half volley. It was a good effort to try and catch it. That edge flew a long way
"138kph, back of a length on off, he defends to cover-point"
"141kph, fuller on off, he drives back to the bowler, Stanlake deflects it onto the stumps at the non-strikers but Haris is back safely"
"fuller outside off, he drives firmly through cover straight of the man in the deep for a couple"
"91kph, shorter length, he's back and punching down to long off"

"102kph, low full toss, whipped to deep midwicket"
"shorter length, slid through at 98kph, he's back and cutting to backward point"

"142kph, bouncer, over leg stump, he ducks under it easily"

"135kph, over-pitched, he crunches a straight drive back and it comes off his boot and flies to mid on"
"138kph, shorter length, into the ribs, he tucks this to fine leg"
"<strong>caught at long off!</strong> That was brilliant from Agar. Haris jumped down early, Agar dragged the length down, Haris went through with the shot, mistimed it trying to launch over long off, he clothed it straight down  Richardson's throat at long off. Easy catch 15 metres in off the rope"
"tossed up slower, he works with the turn towards long on, he pushes for two but it's not on"
"drifting into middle, he's back and working this through midwicket"
"drifting outside off, he drives, without timing past cover to the sweeper in the deep"
"tossed up, he pushes gently to cover point for one"
"shorter length, he's back and cutting to backward point"
"short of a length, thuds into Khushdil's chest, the pair scamper through for one"
"pulled belligerently but no timing, straight to mid-on"
"cut away to third man. Stanlake is persisting with that short length, and doing a good job with it"
"fuller length, steered to midwicket"
"driven to mid-off, pair scuttle through for another quick single. This is good stuff from Australia"
"excellent over. Pakistan really going nowhere at the moment, and the pressure Iftikhar feels is understandable. His wicket could be the game"
chipper to long-off
straight back to the bowler
"<strong>the reverse sweep comes out</strong>. No timing, but that allows Pakistan to come back for two"
guided past short cover-point for one
runs it to backward point for a single
"poked to fine leg, and another tidy over concludes"
"this won't help improve their mood! Khushdil cleared his front leg and looked to tonk this into the stands behind midwicket. It went so high the keeper thought he might catch it, but in the end Starc at fine leg got himself into position and snared a swirling one. Pakistan lose half their side."
"short and wide, and finally a <strong>boundary comes!</strong> The width allowed Iftikhar to slash at it, and it races to the third man boundary"
"better delivery, defended"
"short ball again, muscled to midwicket. Gets clean contact on that and they come back for two"
cut straight to backward point
"no control from the batsman, but <strong>it's four</strong>! Top edge that nearly carried all the way for six; when you're in form like Iftikhar is, everything goes  your way. Turned out to be a decent over from Pakistan despite the wicket; they need to get a move on"
cut away for one
"poor delivery, gets away with it. Down legside, and Iftikhar gives it a slap, but fine leg is there to cut it off"
"no timing from Imad, but they come back for two"
"a whack down the ground, but again, got very little of the middle of the bat on it"
"guided to square leg, Agar has been so tight today. Fantastic spin bowling."
excellent over once more. Just what Australia needed after a slightly expensive one from Richardson
"Imad goes down the ground, the length is dragged back, and he can only splice it to the onside for one"
"good timing, but Abbott is bowling short of a length at pace, and Iftikhar doesn't have enough time to get underneath it"
"<strong>gone!</strong> What a catch! Agar can't put a foot wrong today. Not a surprise, in truth. Nothing had been working for Imad in the short time he';d been there. I don't believe he middled a single ball. Similar shot to the previous one. Came down the pitch, and the length was too short for him to get any purchase on the shot. Agar sprinted forward to scoop it up inches from the ground"
"Shadab nearly got himself run out. No communication between the two, and Shadab at the non-striker's end would have been gone with a direct hit"
steered to third man
"blocks and sets off rather aimlessly, Iftikhar knows better than to take him up on the offer."
Scooped into the vacant legside infield from Iftikhar. think he was looking to get it into a deserted enough area to come back for two
Pace and bounce. Lovely stuff from Stanlake. Tentative poke and a miss
Nudged to short backward point and Shadab gets himself off strike
"<strong>excellent bowling </strong>again. Short and Iftikhar didn't quite know what to do with it. Lucky he didn't edge it straight back to the bowler. Almost comes back and hits his stumps, the batsman had to stop it with his bat"
pulled to fine leg
"makes room for himself and Stanlake throws it well outside off stump. Never quite in position to execute the extravagant cut, and it's another swing and a miss"
"<strong>massive blow for Pakistan!</strong> Heaved down to fine leg from Iftikhar. He'd been struggling with the short ball for much of the innings, and Starc at fine leg was secure as ever. Richardson, who copped such heavy punishment from Iftikhar last game, get's his revenge"
clattered straight to point
swing and a miss. Shadab one off six now. Needs to kick on badly
"copy and paste. This time he tried a swivel-pull, but Carey gathers it behind the stumps again"
"the miserable innings comes to an end! Well, colour me surprised! Shadab had been struggling badly all eight balls he was there, and this time, he got a thick edge. Mid-on made a bit of a meal of it, but that's it for the allrounder"
"wow, <strong>what was that</strong> from Hasnain! No double wicket maiden for Richardson, as Hasnain middles his first ball for an exquisite cover drive that goes straight to the boundary! Watch and learn, Imad and Shadab, the teenager might meekly mutter to himself"
dragged down legside
"backs away, does Amir, and tentatively times it back down the ground"
"<strong>that's better!</strong> First maximum of the night. Amir backs away again, but it was the shorter delivery that allowed Amir to get a thick edge on it, which carried all the way over the third man boundary"
straight to the fielder
"yorker, Amir digs it out and the pair change ends"
"he was barely in the same postcode. Looked to repeat the shot he played so well off Richardson, but the shorter length renders it impossible"
yorker that just misses leg stump
run down to third man
"wild swing from Hasnain, but Richardson says 'I deserve more respect' with a ball that flummoxes the number 10 completely"
"Carbon copy. Hasnain might have to consider descending from cloud nine, where he might still be after that lovely cover drive first ball. Needs to rotate the strike"
"but who cares what I think? Another lavish swing, another obvious miss. One off four balls this over"
"<strong>four in a row</strong>. Nothing connecting for Hasnain now, and Amir can only watch from the other end"
swing and a miss. Hasnain has clearly decided that is all he wants to do. top stuff from Richardson. Just one off that over
"short ball, Amir ducks below it"
Amir backed away to try and cut it through the covers. Misses again. That's <strong>seven balls in a row</strong> the bat hasn't made contact with the ball
make that eight! Amir looks to scoop this over fine leg. Doesn't even make contact with it
"hallelujah, there's bat on ball! And there's even a ticking over of the scores. They take a single. A SINGLE! What will Australia do now?"
"Hasnain swings like a rusty gate, as they say these days. Just one off five balls this final over"
"and ends, predictably, with another miss. Two off the final two overs, and on a miserable evening in Perth, Pakistan limp to 106. They trudge off, no sign of a spring in their step, while Australia are practically prancing off the field. This should be comfortable for them"
"130kph, perfect length, touch of shape away, he's squared up pushing to point"
"132kph, good length angled in, it comes off the thigh pad"
<strong>top edge just carries over third man's head!</strong> Why was Hasnain off the rope? If he was on the rope he catches that at waist high! It was short and wide but the extra bounce caused the top edge to fly all the way to third man but it's six instead of a wicket
"full angled into leg, he pushes to mid on"
"<strong>huge mix up and Imam misses!</strong> He did everything right. Warner crunches a cut shot, Imam makes an unbelievable diving save and Warner had taken off thinking he beat him, Imam got up had all the time he needed to throw the stumps down and missed"
"back of a length, he pushes this to cover-point"
"back of a length, climbing outside off, and it comes off the stickers as he defends. He was surprised at 137kph"
"142kph, beats him. Beaten for pace. Feet were anchored, he pushed at it and it zipped past the edge"
long half volley and he caresses a <strong>square drive through point</strong>. Finch had no trouble here. Just placed the gift through the gap
"142kph, good length, top of off, he is forced to defend back to the bowler"
"139kph, back of a length, middle and off, he punches off the back foot but drags it to mid on"
"short and fractionally wide, Finch cuts with authority, placing it through point. He got on top of the bounce and it raced through the infield"
"<strong>dismissive pull shot.</strong> Fractionally short, he rocked back and with a short arm jab smacks it wide of mid on"
"123kph, slower outswinger, he's squared up but guiding it away to third man"
"134kph, swinging down the leg side. A long way down, Rizwan dives to take it"
"135kph, good length, shaping back into the thigh pad, he can't whip it away"
"135kph, good length, but swinging down the leg side again"
"back of a length outside off, he's back and punching this to wide mid off and running sharply for an easy one"
"135kph, short and very wide, he tries to upper cut with amazing bat speed but is beaten for bounce"
"125kph, slower outswinger, he's back and jabbing a cut to point"
"147kph, very full on off, Finch is hanging back, left leg out of the way, he mistimes a drive to mid off"
"143kph, full on off, he swings hard trying to hit down the ground, gets a thick inside edge that runs behind square"
"145kph, very full outside off, he squeezes a push into cover for a single"
"<strong>hooked for six off the top edge.</strong> 143kph, bouncer right at the helmet, but fine leg is up, Finch swivelled and was hurried but the top edge goes all the way"
short and wide and <strong>cracked forward of point!</strong> It was in the air at a catchable height but wide of the man. Just a bad ball and met with a flashing blade
"140kph, chest high short ball, he ropes a pull at speed flat but short of the deep square on the fence"
"141kph, good length, angled into the thigh pad, it comes off the thigh and runs to short fine"
"146kph, outswinger outside off, back of a length, he's beaten fending away from his body"
"144kph, angled into leg stump, full, he clips this neatly through square midwicket, the man in the deep is backward of square, they take on the throw for two and beat him"
"<strong>pulled over square leg!</strong> Cracking shot. Finch at his best. Shoulder high short ball outside off, he was back set up to hammer it, got it out of the screws and cleared the man on the rope easily!"
"142kph, good length on middle, he pushes this neatly straight of mid on"
"145kph, shorter length on middle, he leans back and lets it run off the angled bat to third man"
"126kph, angled into leg, he works this off his pads square of midwicket for a single"
"good length on off, he pushes to mid off, he calls yes but then sends Warner back quickly"
"136kph, back of a length outside off, he's back and mistiming a back foot drive wide of mid off"
"138kph, low full toss, he just <strong>punches it for four</strong> straight down the ground. That was a little too easy"
"135kph, predictable bouncer and it's too high"
"139kph, short ball, he rolls with a <strong>pull shot and the placement and timing is superb.</strong> He beats the two men on the rope. Picked the gap perfectly"
"126kph, good length on middle, he works to midwicket but can't find a single"
"short and wide, he smokes a cut shot and it hits Shadab's wrist on the half volley. That stung. it bounces away for one"
"143kph, bouncer, he sways inside the line"
"145kph, angled down the leg side and called wide"
"141kph, shorter length, he mistimes a pull shot wide of mid on for a couple"
"length ball angled into the hip, he tucks it behind square just outside the circle and sprints for two. Exceptional running from Warner"
"133kph, slung into leg stump, it cramps him and takes him on the thigh, Finch calls him through though"
"141kph, fuller on off, he's back and hanging outside leg, he punches straight to cover"
"89kph short and wide, he's back and slapping a cut shot in the air towards the deep cover-point"
"fuller outside off, he skips down and crushes a drive straight to long off. That was lasered"
"92kph, shorter, he's back and pulling to wide long on, they run brilliantly to pinch two"
"in the slot, he stands and <strong>launches it over long on into the stands!</strong> It was caught in the crowd! This was just lobbed up in the arc, Warner spotted it, stood still and teed off. He got it out of the screws"
"shorter on middle, he's back and tucking this to midwicket, again he calls two immediately and gets there easily"
"shorter length, he's back and punching to cover"
full toss slips out! It is sprayed way down leg and Rizwan produces some great acrobatics to knock it down
"length ball on middle, he swings hard but drags it off the inside edge through square leg. That was a proper mow"
"<strong>launched over square leg again!</strong> This has gone nearly 100m! Chest high short ball outside off, he's camped back and ready to swing hard. Again he flushed it"
"good length, he clears the left leg, and smears it across the line, but he mistimes this to midwicket"
"141kph, good length, he's back and jabbing a cut to backward point"
"141kph, good length top of off, he's back and pushing it to the gap at cover-point"

"143kph, fuller outside off, he drives open chested to mid off"
"123kph, slower ball on leg, he chips this over midwicket without timing for a couple"
"143kph, length ball outside off, he just mows this across the line along the ground and <strong>it runs all the way!</strong> He didn't time it but still got enough of it"
"good length wide of off, he's back and running this to third man"
"142kph, short outside off, he's back and punching to deep point"
driven through the offside
"slower ball, swing and a miss from Warner. That was more like what Hasnain was doing at the tailend of the last innings. Suspect it won't happen nine times in a row though"
"short again. Warner watches it go by while fixing the umpire with a piercing look, who obliges and calls it awide"
"didn't middle this, flew through to deep cover, where Iftikhar was racing in. Falls slightly short though, meaning the possibility of a 10-wicket win is still very much on"
stroked to mid-off
"slower ball once more. Tidy over so far, this, but Australia just eight runs away"
"attempted pull by Finch, and the inside edge clips it onto his pads. He keeps the strike. Into the 12th over we go now"
"Finch thought about walloping this, but realised just in time he was getting a free run. 5 away from his half-century"
"misfield allows the Australian openers to come back for two. Four away from as eries win, each batsman three away from 50"
"brilliant stop at backward point from Shadab. He's an excellent fielder in that position, one of the best in the world, in truth"
"low full toss, Finch drives through the air to long-on on the bounce. Right, three to win. Will Warner get his half-century instead, then?"
"not yet, nurdles it down to fine leg"
"and that brings it to an end! 50 for Finch, a series win for Australia. This is a blinding performance from the hosts against the world's number one team. They've made them look astonishingly pedestrian, and should do their confidence the world of good before the Test series. There's no sugar-coating this; Pakistan have been humbled here."
