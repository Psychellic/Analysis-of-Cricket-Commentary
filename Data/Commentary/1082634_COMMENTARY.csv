"good length at middle stump, punched on the up to mid-on with the angle"
"<b>now Bipul puts one down.</b> Good length, angled into the thighs and Smith whips this uppishly towards short fine. Dropped. It's face-height for Bipul who looks flustered as he gets hard hands in front of his face, too early, and lobs it backwards"

But he appeals for the caught behind...and <b>there was a huge edge</b> on that. However, replays show the ball had hit the keeper's grille before he held on to it. So it shouldn't have been out. Not sure that's why the umpire didn't give it though"

"slower ball, back of a length at off stump, squeezes it with an open face to third man"
"full at off stump, drives it wide of long-off....and goes back for the second. Dhoni doesn't want it. Tiwary might've been looking to give Dhoni the strike next over, but it won't be that way. Both batsmen were stranded at the other end, Bhuvi collects the throw and jams his fingers into the stumps"
"oh good fieldinfg. This is back of a length at middle stump, he looks to shovel this past short midwicket, where Henriques dives to his right and can't get power on his underarm flick. Would've caught him short with a direct hit"
"slower ball, angled across off stump, but backward point and third man are in. Dhoni isn't in control of this but he only has to slice it square, and he does it"

"back of a length at off stump, puts in a lot of effort to try and pull this, but it's too quick for him and he can only bunt it straight to short midwicket"
"slower ball, good length outside off stump, follows the ball and looks to tickle this past short fine leg, but is beaten. They run the bye"
"Warner walks at the bowler, this on a length, and swings back in to rap the thigh. Unadkat stumbles after his followthrough, he is <strong>clutching his right hamstring</strong>. His front foot landed awkwardly. Not good signs for Pune"

"shortish and width outside off, Dhawan flat-bats it away to the left of sweeper cover"
"crunched, again, this time Rahane is beaten to his left sliding at sweeper cover. Full and width outside off, Dhawan sends it clattering away to the boundary. Sunrisers have already hit a boundary"
"Unadkat pulls his length back slightly and gets it to nip away outside off, Dhawan sticks his bat out, nearly shaves the outside edge"

"change-up. Slower cutter, and it just misses the off stump. Warner swings early to leg and is already through with the shot"
"just short of a good length and outside off, punched square through the off side"
"short and outside off, 120ks, hip-high ball and attached with a lot of width. Dhawan nails a pull over midwicket. He might send Unadkat a thank-you note later"
"length ball, on off now, tight line, Dhawan gets forward and pushes a single in the gap at cover"
"another slower cutter, Warner looks to force it through the covers. He only manages an inside edge that wanders away to square leg"

"this is flat on middle again, 96ks, Dhawan uses his feet and punches a single to long-off"
"pushed through on off stump, 101ks, Warner attempts a switch-hit. Mis-times it to short third man (for a left-hander)"
"hint of width, but the length is really full, which means he can only squeeze it to backward point. Tumbling save from Tiwary"
"slides on off stump, Warner can only push it straight to mid-on"
"short dart on middle, 104ks, Warner looks to open up the off side by backing away outside leg again. He flays it straight to cover"
"and he strikes first ball. Offcutter from Stokes, Dhawan presses forward and look to push it through cover. But this keeps extremelylow and sneaks through his defences"
"full-toss wide outside off, Williamson simply glides it through the vacant slip region for four"
"and he strikes again, Williamson is gone this time. Good length outside off, shapes away, and bounces at Williamson. He has a short stride and pushes at the ball, plays away from the body. Stokes shaves the outside edge. Dhoni takes it. A quick 39 with the bat and two wickets in his first over. Stokes is turning it around for Pune again"

"full and width outside off, Yuvraj goes over the top. Crashing it over extra cover"

"another googly from Tahir, full, Yuvraj gets forward and defends to cover"
"hip-high short ball on leg stump, hurled at 103ks, Yuvraj swats it away, the ball flies to Sundar's left at square leg. He is a bit late to react and <b>can't cling onto a tough chance</b>"

"slower cutter outside off, Yuvraj looks to drive early and is beaten by the change up"
"very very full on middle, backs away a bit and jabs it down to mid-off"
Stokes returns and takes down Warner. What a gun player. Banged in short and outside off from around the wicket. Warner jumps off his feet for an upper cut but can't get on top of it. He skies it to Thakur at sweeper
"low full-toss outside off, sliced away past backward point"
"pitched up and outside off, driven through the line to sweeper cover"
"full and sliding down the leg side, had Yuvraj left it it would have been a wide. He toe-ends it to deep midwicket. Unadkat collects the ball and throws it to Dhoni on the half-volley. He can't collect it cleanly"
"cross seamer, on a good length and outside off, that's probably a bad length to Yuvraj. He sits deep in the crease and launches it over the bowler's head with s straight bat. Vintage"

"full on the stumps, defended back to the bowler"
"flat slider on off, backs away and punches a single through cover"
"pushed through flat on middle, defended"
"tossed-up legbreak finishes on the pads, whipped to deep square leg"
Tahir unleashes the googly. Starts outside off and breaks back in. The length is short. Henriques has no clue about this. He looks to cut and drags it back onto the middle stump

"slower cutter, grips in the surface, really wide outside off. Yuvraj is stapled to the crease as he flashes and misses"

"full-toss on off, quick one, bunted to short midwicket, Smith flings himself to his left to stop the ball"
"<b>Tiwary misjudges a skier at short fine leg</b>. This was the front of the hand slider on the leg stump, Yuvraj is cramped for room. He pulls and ends up top-edging it to the right of Tiwary. He was late to run back and across to his right. He stretches his hand right out but the ball balllons over him. Tahir is peeved"

"full and really wide outside off, another slower one at 116ks, asks Yuvraj to reach out and drive to long-off"
short and wide - wider than a set of stumps outside off - Unadkat forces Yuvraj to reach out for the ball. He looks to cut it away but is undone by the width. He only slices it in the air. Tripathi judges this skier well. Runs to his right and snaffles it. Yuvraj has some advice for the incoming Bipul
"clears Christian at long-on. Full slower ball outside off, Ojha does not time his loft. Ends up skying it over the long-on boundary and tilts it Sunrisers' way"
"slower ball outside off, pushed into the covers"
"full and outside off, presses forward and whips it away between deep midwicket and long-on for two"
"slower short ball outside off, dragged down to long-on"
"Unadkat strikes with another slower ball, tilting it towards Pune's way. Slower, fuller offcutter wide outside off. Ojha has to reach out, much like Yuvraj did; he looks to loft and ends up slicing it in the air. It's that man Stokes again. He runs in from sweeper cover and tracks it down"
"wide yorker outside off, Rashid can't run it down to third man. Beaten"

"full and really wide outside off, toe-ended in the air, drops in front of deep cover and deep backward point running in"

"full offcutter outside off, 119ks, the line is wide, Bipul slogs early to the leg side.... and misses"
"Unadkat and Stokes combine for another wicket. Slower ball, good length on off, Bipul Sharma picks it and swings to leg again. He only skews it off the bottom of the bat. Gets more height as opposed to distance. Holes out to Stokes(who else?) at deep midwicket"
Two in two for Unadkat. Another slower ball outside off. Rashid does not pick it. Clears his front leg and toe-ends it in the air. Unadkat himself settles under the skier
"four straight dots and a <strong>hat-trick in the last over</strong>. What a way to reach 100 IPL wickets. Yet another slower ball outside off, this is slightly short. Bhuvneshwar is through with his pull and splices a catch to the right of cover"
"wide of the crease, another slower ball, which bounces over the stumps, as the batsman plays down the wrong line"
"what a finish from Unadkat. <b>A hat-trick maiden in the last over</b>. Offcutter outside off, flat-batted to extra cover. There is a mix-up between the wickets, it's eventually a dot. Take a bow, Unadkat. He becomes only the third player after Malinga and Badree to take triple-wicket maidens in the IPL"
