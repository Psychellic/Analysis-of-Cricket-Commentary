"length, outside off, and he leaves"
"shorter, and he latches on to this. Drives this between point and cover-point, and picks up two. The fielder, Sikandar Raza, puts in a slide to stop the ball, and sees some of the outfield come out with his knee"
"length, angles into him, and he defends towards square leg"
"length, around off, and he defends"
"length, angles in nicely, and he is forced to defend. Delivered at 130.1kph"
"fuller, and he drives this gracefully, but straight to mid-off"
"length, just outside off, and he defends towards point"
"length, defended towards square leg"
"length, just around off, and a <strong>bit of extra bounce</strong> as it beats Das on the outside of the bat!"
"does him again, with some <strong>bounce and away movement</strong> off a length. Das has a swish at it, no feet moving, and would probably have edged it straight to the wide slip in place"
"angles in, fuller, and he flicks this towards square leg"
"length, angles in, and he defends"
"length, angles in, and he hops to play this towards square leg"
"length, but width on offer, and he <strong>climbs into this</strong>! Short movement of the feet to get to the pitch of it, and then through with his arms. Through the cover-point region"
"<strong>good response!</strong> Dug in a bit short, and Tamim is forced to fend this off from in front of his face, taking his bottom hand to prevent this skewing up"
"back of a length, angles in, and he negotiates this well, towards square leg"
"length, presses forward to tap this towards point and run, but cannot get the single"
"length, but down the pads, and he places this to the left of square leg. Fine leg has to run around to his right to cut this off, and they take two easily"
"length, outside off, nipping away a touch, left alone"
"length, punched towards cover-point"
"length, punched towards cover point again. A bit of movement back in, at 127.8kph"
"length, but straighter, and he goes back and <strong>punches this past mid-on</strong>. Sheer timing, as it races away towards the mid-wicket boundary"
"length, drives this straight back towards the bowler"
"length, whips this away on the on side, but straight towards short mid-wicket"
"fuller, angles in, and he works this between square leg and short mid-wicket. That is a sensational bit of timing and placement. Nothing more than a push, and it just keeps square leg interested for a bit, before racing away"
"length, pushes forward and defends close to his body"
"short, angles in, and he defends towards square leg"
"length, but down the leg side, and he whips this away towards deep square leg. Terrific effort from Tshuma going across from fine leg. Keeps this back in, and then sends in a sharp, but somewhat wayward throw!"
"length, around off, and he runs this down past point towards third man"
"length, around off, and raps Tamim on the pads, as he looks to flick this away. There's a half-appeal from the bowler, but Williams reckons this is going down leg. Possibly also a bit high"
"length, punched off the back foot towards cover"
"<strong>superb shot!</strong> The length isn't too full for the drive, but the line takes the ball back into him, and he just leans into a drive past mid-on. Dive put in, but in vain, as the ball zips away towards wide long-on"
"leans forward and drives this through covers. <strong>Das is looking like a few million Taka this morning!</strong> Again, a ball that wasn't bad in line or length"
"<strong>this is superb batting!</strong> Length, but a bit of width this time, and he is ready, with a forward stride. Just drives through covers"
"straighter, angles in, and he defends towards square leg"
"length, drives off the crease, and skews this towards third man. May not have been in complete control of this, but that's 11 from this over, which has provided Bangladesh with some early momentum"
"length, jags back a touch from outside off, and Das is happy to defend this"
"length, around off, and he drives this, but doesn't get close enough to the pitch of this. Off the lower part of the bat towards mid-off"
"fuller, outside off, and <strong>beats the outside edge</strong>! Lazy batting from Das, who goes through with an intended drive without any foot movement"
"straighter on to him, and he works this away towards deep square leg. There's protection there, but they can pick up two as the fielder has to move to his left first"
"length, width, and this is better! Leans into it a touch, and then just taps this through covers. No great power, but sumptuous timing on it. Just stands and admires his shot"
"a bit of extra bounce to a length ball around off, and he is able to run this down to third man"
"a bit short, outside off, and Das whacks this through the extra cover region. Bad ball, and Das won't miss these today"
"length, turns back in, and he drives to long-on"
"just around off, and he plays the late cut. Cut off, running to his right, by short third man"
"length, whips it with the turn in to him towards deep mid-wicket"
defends one towards square leg
"length, straighter, and he presses forward to defend"
"length, around off, and he drives to cover"
"short of a length, and he looks to pick it up towards deep square leg. There's a man stationed there, and luckily, Das hasn't timed it as well as he might have wanted. Drops short of the fielder"
"length, driven back towards mid-on"
"fuller, but too much of width. Tamim throws his hands at this, and slashes this over point towards the deep backward point region"
"length, whips this away on the on side, but well stopped by Chakabva at square leg, diving away to his left"
"length, around off, and he stretches forward to defend towards cover"
"length, towards the leg side, and hurries on to him, and he fails to get this away"
"length, driven with the turn towards deep mid-wicket"
"length, presses forward to defend"
"drives this off the back foot, just wide of mid-on"
"fuller, on the pads, and he flicks this. Towards square leg"
drives this back to long-on
"on a length, outside off, and it's pushed through the gap at cover for a single to the sweeper"
"slightly straight, and it's eased square off the pads"
"rising off a length, outside off, and he opens the face to get it to third man"
"just short of a good length, and he hops to flick off his hip for one more"
"effort ball, pushed through at his legs at a shade under 131km/h, Raza slides at midwicket to stop any thoughts of a single"
"full again, just outside off, and a drive is intercepted at cover"
"full, pushed back at him"
"nicely flighted, outside off, and it's tapped watchfully to cover"
"straighter, and drifting in towards his pads, eased down to long on"
"not quite there for a the drive, and Madhevere fields off his own bowling"
"this time he does drive, but not past mid off"
"<b>reverse sweep, up and over!</b> There's a big gap behind square on the off side, and Das picks it out perfectly with a neat little reverse sweep. Raza runs over to Madhevere for a spot of encouragement, good over ruined by the boundary"
"a touch short, Tamim hops up on one leg to whip into the leg side"
"<b>short, thumped!</b> Tiripano digs one in, but on this pitch it just sits up to be hit. Das leans back and doesn't bother keeping it down"
"forcefully punched off the back foot, through cover and out to the sweeper"
"fuller, delivered from around the stumps, and it's helped on its way down to fine leg for one"
"seems a better length on this track, landing closer to the batsman and drawing him into the drive. Stopped at cover"
"slower ball to finish, an offcutter, and it's worked into space on the leg side"
"he comes around the stumps to the right hander, as is his wont, and is worked through midwicket"
"<b>extra bounce</b>, the ball kicks off a length and stings his glove, looping to the leg side as Tamim presses forward"
"flicked off the toes, just the one"
"quicker one, flatter through the air, and he's back and across to defend from the crease"
"firmly glanced into the leg side, the ball bursts past a diving Raza at midwicket, but it's cleaned up by the man in the deep"
"pushed to cover, Tamim wanders out looking for a quick single, but there's none to be had and he's sent back"
"quick single! A direct hit might have been interesting. Das taps it towards Taylor at mid on and sents off at a dead sprint, putting in a dive, but the shy goes wide. And Das takes an edge to lift himself off the turf. Seems alright though, if stepping around a little gingerly"
"chopped down behind square on the off side, an ambled single"
"punched, on the up, but straight to point"
"slower ball, right up to him, and Das drives it back through Tiripano's legs, but mid off scoots around to stop the single"
"angling in to him, landing on a length, and he works a single just wide of midwicket"
"pushed to mid on, on the walk, and there's no room for a quick single"
"drifting down towards leg, from around the stumps, and helped to long leg for a single"
"<b>well bowled</b>, some dip and drift just outside off. Tamim comes forward, watchful"
"Tamim's left elbow leads as he drives down to long off, just the one"
<b>fifty for Liton Das!</b> And he gets there with a neat little flick off his legs for a single. His fourth in this format
"<b>inside out, over extra, all the way!</b> Tamim's been becalmed the last half hour or so, but now he jumps out and lifts a full one handsomely over the boundary"
"quicker ball, a flick of the wrists brings a single to long on"
"speared in to the pads from around the stumps, tapped back at the bowler"
"tight on his legs once again, flicked through midwicket"
"some grip for Williams, and Das is a little taken aback as he fends uppishly (but safely) towards point"
"Das is watchful now, as he comes forward to defend to leg"
"<b>wrong line, easily put away!</b> This wasn't the greatest delivery, a quicker one hurled down the leg side, and Liton eased onto the back foot and paddled it wide of short fine leg. Too easy"
"<b>lbw appeal now</b>, as another arm ball rushes on and pings him on the pad. It's purely speculative though, likely headed down the leg side. Umpire Reiffel says no, and they don't want a review. <b>But oh dear, replays show that would have cannoned into leg stump!</b> Zimbabwe have missed a trick"
"swept uppishly, but landing safely in front of long leg"
"worked off the pads, just the one"
"Tamim comes forward with soft hands, angling it down just to the right of short third man"
"<b>threaded through cover</b>, the sweetest of drives from Liton Das. Raza hurled down a quicker ball, but it landed as a long half volley and Liton leans into a checked, classical drive"
"another drive, but this one finds the cover fielder"
"floated up outside off, pushed back at the bowler"
"glanced off his pads, just wide of the man at short fine leg"
"Williams keeps his line tight, aiming at middle and leg, and he's worked square for a single that <b>brings up the 100</b>"
"Tamim lunges forward in defence, the ball flicking his glove and then looping up off the pad, but Mutumbami can't quite get to it as he charges around from behind the stumps"

"punched off the back foot, extra cover sprinting around to stop the single"
"<b>imperious!</b> Tamim skips out and lifts the ball way, way over long off. The timing is supreme, and he holds his shape throughout. Stunning stroke"
"quicker one from Raza, and it's kept out"
"a little more loop on this delivery, defended to leg"
tapped firmly back at the bowler
"down the ground, just the one"
"Tamim thinks about a dab outside off, but draws his bat out of line at the last moment"
"tapped square, one more"
"eased down the ground, another single"
"very full, and he leans forward to glance off his toes out to deep midwicket"
"<b>there's that timing!</b> No violence in the stroke, but there was no stopping it after it was hit. Floated up, on his toes, and Liton just opens up into a graceful leg glance. The timing and placement were spot on"
"flicked into space on the leg side, and they're back for the second, <b>taking Tamim to fifty!</b>"
"flicked square, another single"
"Liton's well forward, using the spin in to him to angle a single to the right of midwicket"
"<b>flashed in the air, but over extra!</b> Beating the man inside the ring, over his head, but long off cleans up"
"<b>sharp fielding saves runs</b>, Chakabva down at fine leg sprinting across and diving full length to cut off a firm sway in that direction"
Tamim waits in his crease and presses a length ball firmly back at the bowler
"squirts off the edge after the ball dips and grips, point running around to stop it"
"looped up, nice and full, he's on the drive to cover"
"<b>cracking delivery!</b> Williams finds drift and turn to beat the outside edge of a well set batsman. It scoots <i>just</i> past the edge, and somehow misses the off stump too"
"a touch wider, pushed to point"
pressed to cover this time
"Liton makes room and thrashes a cut, but straight to point"
"speared in to the pads, milked behind square"
"zipped down a touch wider outside off, Liton has a look and lets it go"
"punchy little drive, but it's stopped at midwicket"
"<b>reverse sweep</b>, but Taylor chugs around at short third man and keeps them to one"
"glanced off the pads, into the deep"
"Tamim checks a firm drive to Raza's left, and an athletic dive stops the single"
"punched through cover, the strike turns over once again"
"eased down to long on, easy as you like"
"Liton drives, but he can't find a way through a packed cover field"
"nicely bowled, not much flight but the ball grips and spins across him, having landed on a leg stump line. Liton's forward to smother it"
"slightly shorter, but there's no room through that cover field once again"
"right up to him this time, and Williams fields off his own bowling"
"<b>in the air, but safe!</b> Tamim looks to attack the young offspinner straight away, but he's not close to the pitch of the ball. He goes through with a loft all the same, and mistimes it, the ball falling in front of long off, running around"
""
"flatter, at the stumps, defended"
defended into the leg side now
"checks a drive, along the turf and straight to cover"
"<b>ruins the over!</b> Tamim didn't like being bogged down, and he skips out to mow a full one high over long on. Very solid connection"
"Liton makes room, and punches in front of point for a single"
"Tamim's forward, playing softly into the leg side for one"
"firmly driven back at Williams, who fields off his own bowling"
"<b>what's happened here?</b> Liton hops back and slices a cut to short third man, and somehow the bail has come off. Ah, it's the keeper, Mutumbami, who tips a bail off, Liton having sliced the ball very late"
""
"tapped through cover, and a single keeps him the strike"
"he starts full, Das driving down the ground for one"
"on a length, landing on middle and leg, and it's glanced through midwicket for one"

"speared down on middle and leg, flicked just in front of square for a single"
"arm ball, rushing on with the angle, and the ball kisses the pad before rolling fine. <b>That's the first extra of the innings</b>"

"looped up with much more flight, almost gets the better of Liton, who wisely opts to defend"
"too short, outside off, cut out to deep cover"

""
"<b>swing and a miss</b>, outside off. Liton drives away from his body, without much foot movement"

"drives on the up, but he can't beat the cover field"
"flicked off the toes, just the one"
"<b>in the air, and safe!</b> Liton leans back into a pull shot, but slices underneath it and the ball goes high into the gloomy sky ... but comes to ground right in the middle of three fielders converging from different directions on the leg side. Lucky!"
"chopped down behind square on the off side, no run"
cover bends low to stop a firm drive
"<b>nicely played</b>, Liton paddling a leg side delivery very fine"
"and now it's Tamim who gets low into a paddle sweep. Short fine leg dives over the top of it, but it's only two"
"<b>leading edge!</b> Liton's been riding his luck in the last few overs. Now he walks down into a flick to leg, but the ball takes the leading edge and flies over backward point instead"
"walks into another drive, along the turf this time"
"<b>huge swing</b> from Tamim, who almost swings himself off his feet but doesn't put bat to ball"
"whipped into the leg side, just the one"
"full, angling in towards off stump, pushed to point"
"a neat little drive finds the gap at cover, but the sweeper keeps them to one"
"<b>much too short</b>, Liton hops deep in the crease and thunders a cut in front of square"
"<b>quick single</b>. Liton taps it towards cover, and then sets off, before hesitating and looking up at his partner at the other end. Tamim sprints through as the cover fielder swoops, and puts in a big dive. Safely home"
<b>there's the record stand!</b> Tamim jumps out and swings with the spin into the leg side. Massive hit! And the crowd liked that one
"paddle sweep, but it's just the one"
"<b>hundred up!</b> And he gets there in fantastic style, placing an elegant cut behind point. That's his third ODI hundred, and his second of the series. Huge cheers around the ground. And the shot also takes him to 1,000 runs in ODI cricket!"
"punched through cover, one more to the total"
"walks down at a short one, and slugs a single down to long on"
"short, Tamim is up on one leg into a flambuoyant swivel pull, but picks out deep backward square"
"down the wicket, and skews the shot in the air, and it goes towards Brendan Taylor at third man, but he has <b>dropped</b> this! Just failed to get close enough to it, in fact, but he was not a long way off from that. Good to have attacked the ball and gotten his body behind it, though"
"slower ball, on leg stump, and he drops it towards short fine leg and picks up a single as Mutumbami goes chasing"
"short, and he has a swish at it. Too short, in fact, as Das fails to make contact. Really went high over his head"
"full toss, on the pads, and he whips it away towards deep square leg. Will pick up two"
"fuller, on the pads, and driven to long-on"
"short, but slow, and he flogs it away towards deep backward square leg. Only gets the one for it"
"slower, off-cutter, and he plays this away towards deep backward square leg. A good diving stop from the fielder at fine leg, Taylor, who swiftly moves to his right and stops this from going past him"
"length, whips this off his pads towards deep mid-wicket"
"slower ball, on the pads, and he flicks this away. Taken at short fine leg, but are they going to call this a <strong>no-ball</strong>? The umpires get together to have a chat, and seem to have referred this to the TV umpire. Taken on the full, but I think the contact is well ahead of his body, and possibly wouldn't have been over waist height. Das gets the toe-end to this, and it is collected by the man inside the ring, as it doesn't travel a long way. <strong>It's a no-ball!</strong> Free hit to boot."
"Iqbal backs away a bit to leg side, opens up the off side, and hammers a length ball over the covers. Terrific bit of timing!"
"length, whips this towards long leg"
"length, and he has <strong>climbed into this</strong>! Tees off, and powers this well over mid-wicket"
"length, but width on offer, and he goes back and cuts this wide of deep point. Excellent placement, and takes him into the 90s in style"

"fired in quicker, and he nurdles this towards square leg for a single"
"fuller, straighter, and he goes across the crease and drills this over long-on. What an absolutely stunning shot from Liton Das. <strong>He's watching the ball like a football at the moment!</strong>"
"flogs this, backing away, towards long-off. Toe-end of the bat, and goes on a couple of bounces to Madhevere"
"fired in wide of off, and he misses an attempted cut"
drives a length ball towards deep mid-wicket
"slower ball, played away towards mid-wicket, and they sprint through for two. Iqbal was always aiming for the second, and he ensures he gets there"
"short, blitzes this away towards deep mid-wicket. Doesn't get a good hold of it, and it lands a couple of bounces ahead of the man stationed in the deep"
"slower ball, and he has gone high with this, and Raza has <strong>dropped it at deep mid-wicket</strong>! Das was early on the shot, and miscued it, getting it a lot higher than deep enough, and Raza just seems to have missed the flight of this"
flicks a length ball away towards deep backward square leg. Single to Brendan Taylor
"length, pulled away towards long leg. Not quite off the middle, but they get the single anyway"

"length, and misses the yorker, and he hangs back and deposits this deep over mid-wicket"
"slower ball, outside off, and a dangerous ball to bowl with no sweeper at cover. He clears the in-field, and helps himself to four more!"
"short, and he looks to hook this away. Good ball by Tshuma, as it just goes over his shoulder"
"slower ball, he looks to back away and cut this over point, but misses. Decieved by a good change of pace"
"short, and also down the leg side"
"full ball, and he slaps this just beyond wide long-on. Four more, as this over ends up giving Bangladesh 21 runs!"
"takes this on the full by moving towards the ball, and works this to the left of long-on. Picks up two before mid-wicket can charge to his right and send in his reply"
"short, and he plays this away towards deep square leg. <strong>Successive hundreds for Tamim Iqbal!</strong>"
"full toss, and he looks to swing this towards deep square leg. Madhevere misjugdes this a touch, and <b>drops</b> it! Took time to pick it up, and eventually had to dive forward, and just couldn't hold on"
"full toss, on the leg stump line, and he whacks this one through mid-wicket. Just needed to pick up the line, and once he did that, spanked it away"
"short, slower ball, and he has been able to clear the man at mid-wicket inside the circle. Sprints two before wide long-on can send in his throw"
"full, on the leg stump, and he drills this towards deep square leg. Perhaps a change in pace again, and that means Iqbal can't get any great momentum on his shot"
"turns across him, but starts from way outside off, and called a wide"
"fuller, drives hard towards long-off"
"full toss, on the leg side, and he has flogged this away over long leg"
"short, and he goes back and hits this hard, but can only get it towards deep square leg"
"full toss, will be a no-ball, and Iqbal slogs this away towards deep mid-wicket. Probably slipped off his grasp, but that's another free hit, now for Das"
"length, and he swings acorss the line. Dropped by Mumba going back from short fine leg, but he can pick up two anyway. Wouldn't have been out, this being a free hit"

"swings one away towards long leg, and gets four more for it"
"slower ball, and he taps this towards cover and picks up a single"
"slower off-cutter, outside off. He looks to cut this away, but he misses out on contact. One bouncer called for the over"
"length, and he goes down the ground with a really powerful hit. There's a fielder coming in from long-off, but can only parry this over the ropes. That's a magnificent effort, but his first touch itself happened beyond the boundary!"
"short, over deep square leg. <strong>Liton Das can do no wrong today!</strong> Change in pace, and he just swats this with a free swing, and he is middling more often than not today"
"taken at wide long-on by Raza, <strong>at long last</strong>! Mumba bowls length again, and is perhaps a bit lucky to get a wicket for that. A tired shot in the end, as Das cannot clear the ropes this time. Goes a bit off the toe-end, and what a reception he gets on his way off!"
"tries to flick a length ball towards deep square leg. There's a fielder in the deep, and it zips through to him"
"slower ball, and he plays this away with one hand towards long leg"
"short, and he swings this over deep mid-wicket"
"length, backs away and swings this over mid-wicket. Much more off the middle of the bat. Tasty!"

"slower ball, around the pads, and he works this off his pads towards fine leg"
"full ball, and given out leg before as Mahmudullah looks to flick this away. Considered a review, but then realised that this was quite straight. He had shuffled across to work this towards fine leg, but the length and speed on that made picking it for runs impossible"

"full toss, outside off, and he drives towards long-off"
"slower ball, on the full, and flicked towards deep backward square leg"

"length, swings away after pitching outside off. Called wide, as the batsman looks to smack it away but cannot reach it"

"length, swings away from outside off, and he fails to make contact. Not far from the tramlines, but not given a wide"
"swing away again, and Kamunhukamwe has a jab at it, from the crease. Dies on its way through to Liton Das behind the stumps"
"length, moves away, and takes the outside edge. <strong>Mashrafe knows it as soon as it happens!</strong> Kamunhukamwe done in by the lack of foot movement, and indecision about the place of his off stump. Just poking at this, and getting a feather edge through to Das"
"length, around off, and he defends towards point"

"length, but down the leg side, and he gets a good glance down to fine leg. Beats the man in the deep, who is quite square"

"fuller ball, and he blocks this straght back towards the bowler"
"<strong>chipped to short mid-wicket</strong>! Length, and straight, and he was looking to clear the mid-wicket region, but couldn't keep it low enough. Mithun at that position dives low to his left and picks up a smart catch, and Saifuddin pulls out his WWE-esque celebration"
"fuller length, drilled through covers. Beautiful, and authoritative"

"length, around middle, and he defends"
"length, nurdles this away towards square leg. Wants two, but short mid-wicket gets across to this very quickly"

"length, and he defends this towards cover"
"fuller, on the pads, and he flicks this away. Intercepted by Mithun at square leg, diving away to his left. Gets up and has a shy at the non-striker's end, too, where Chakabva has to scurry back to safety"

"hint of swing, but it starts down leg and goes further that way"
"Williams leans into a fluid, languid drive, but pings the point fielder"
"this time he does find the gap, in front of square and through the covers. Williams looks up for this, and he's found the boundary with another neat little shot. Checked the drive, held his shape"
"pitched right up to him, Saifuddin searching for swing, but it dips towards his toes and is flicked through square leg"
"Chakabva waits on a length delivery in the channel, dabbing down on it at the last moment. He almost waited <i>too</i> long on that one, the ball only just bounced past the stumps"

"placed into the covers, another hard run single"
"this one rushes on with the arm, Williams plays with the angle and finds a single to leg"
"quicker one, Chakabva sends it bouncing to square leg with a wristy flick, but can't beat the infield"
"floated a touch full, Regis glancing off his pads for one"
"held back a touch, from around the stumps. Williams defends from the crease"

"rising off a length, he's glanced off the hip to deep midwicket"
"nicely punched by Williams, but the shot is stopped by a diving point fielder. The fizz likes that. As does the crowd. Big cheer"
"punched off the back foot again, this time it's the cover fielder who stops it"
"too straight, Williams flicks off his pads for a single into the deep"
"this spits off a length at Chakabva, who is forced into a hurried fend and does well to keep it down"

"hurled down full and wide, and he places a drive to the cover sweeper"

"neatly punched by Williams, on the up, but he can't find a way through the cover field"

"too straight, flicked with the spin into the leg side"
hurled down the leg side
"<b>misfield brings runs</b>, Williams leaning back to spank a short, wide one. Naim should have stopped it near the cover boundary, but he over-runs it and lets the ball through his legs. Mehidy offers a stern glare"
"a touch more flight, Williams comes forward to defend"
"flatter this time, more defence is the response as the line is tight on middle and off"
"flighted outside off, watchfully placed into the covers"
"angled across him, in the channel, defended under the eyes to point"
"sliced down to third man, just the one"
"landing on a length, tight on off stump, and offering nothing for Williams to work with"
"<b>bristling delivery!</b> Where did this come from? Mustafizur lands this one just short of a length and the ball rears visiously at Williams. It's nippy, at 136km/h, but that seemed to have hit a crack"
"dug in short, Williams hurriedly ducks under it"
"fuller, straight, and Williams defends"
"Regis comes down the track but doesn't get to the pitch of it, chipping the ball in the air but <i>just</i> short of the man at midwicket"

eased down the ground to long on

"full, dug out to cover"
"tight on off stump, Wesley defends to leg with the spin"
"full, outside off, and he slaps a drive, but straight to cover"

"floated up, on his toes, Regis finds a single through midwicket"
"<b>heaved over deep backward square!</b> Madhevere bends into a slog sweep, and gets enough on it to clear the man at the boundary with ease. First six of the innings"
"flicked to leg, they want a single but the midwicket fielder is too fast"
"Regis drives at mid off, who is a little deep, and they pinch a single"
"glanced with the spin through square leg. Wesley wants two, Regis says no"

"rushing on with the arm from outside off, and it's pushed to midwicket"
"he starts full, on off stump, and is worked wide of midwicket for one"
"clipped to leg, the accumulation on the leg side continues. But Zimbabwe need boundaries if they are to keep in touch"
"Regis sets himself for a big hit to leg, but the ball skids on to him and turns his shot into a feeble heave that lands in front of deep mid on, so badly was it timed"
"a touch of leading edge about this one, as he closes the face of the bat a little early, but the ball lands in space for a quick single"

Madhevere places a wristy drive through the cover field
punched firmly back at the bowler

"arm ball, pushed through at off stump and it's tapped to point"
"Taijul continues to attack the stumps. No turn for him, but he's getting drift on this arm ball, and another one tests Raza's defence"

a crunchy drive gets the ball down to long off

"<b>genuine edge</b> this time, Madhevere flinging a cut out at a wide one and sending a thick edge through that slip region again. They all count"

flicked wristily out to the man at deep midwicket
"very full, right up to him, Raza digs a drive out to long off"

"<b>full toss</b>, but he can't take full toll, driving to long on"
"short, and he swats another pull out into the deep. This time deep midwicket cleans up"
"targeting the pads, Raza glances but can't beat the fielder in the ring"
"picks up a pull into the leg side, but the ball drops well in front of the fielder in the deep"
"<b>caught at point!</b> Saifuddin digs in another short one, rushing Madhevere, who tries to pull. The ball takes the shoulder of the bat, and balloons on the opposite side as that intended, being easily caught at point. Saifuddin is pumped, and raises his fist at the young Zimbabwean to send him off. The visitors had just started to find some traction with this stand, but it's been broken now, and Bangladesh are well on top"
"Mutumbami walks down at the first ball he faces, but Saifuddin sees him coming and digs it in very short"
"rising off a length, and he defends to leg."
forced to defend a straighter ball
"drives a fuller ball through covers. Crisp timing, and good placement as well"
"down the wicket, and whipped over mid-wicket. Gets some good distance on this!"
"fuller, down the leg side, and he tickles this fine, past Mortaza at short fine leg"
"length, playued towards mid-wicket, and the non-striker has set off, and <strong>fatally so</strong>! Played far too straight to the one man in the circle on the on side, and Mutumbami has run a long way down the wicket before Raza says no. Not enough time to get back, and the throw is a simple one back to the bowler"
"length, pushed towards cover, but this time no run on offer"
goes back to cut one towards third man. Intercepted by short third man
"short, goes back and smacks this through the cover region to the sweeper in the deep"

taps an incoming ball towards point
"length, played away towards square leg for a single"
"cutter, across him, and he pokes forward in hope. Beaten"
"down the wicket, and lofted over mid-off. Hit quite well, and it bounces a couple of times before trundling into the long-off boundary"
"edged, and <strong>through to slip</strong>! Just the ball that Mustafizur would have been looking for. Cutter, at good pace, across Mutombodzi, who instinctively hangs his bat out. Runs off the edge, and is pouched by the man stationed there to his right"
"length, angles across him, and he defends towards cover-point"
"short, angles across him after pitching around leg, and he has to weave out of the way"
"a bit short, and he goes back and taps it towards cover-point. Wants a single, but the fielder is quick to converge on this, and forces him to change his mind"

"length, presses forward and defends towards cover"
"shorter, angles in, and he drives this towards the man at deep point"
"tossed up, and he drives this towards short mid-wicket"
"length, angles in, and he can only drive this back towards the bowler"
"length, angles back in, and he defends towards cover"
"length, slashed over slip, and also beats third man. Smart from Raza, because he uses the pace of the ball as it angles across him. Another cutter, but a better result for Zimbabwe this time"
"under-edge this time. Around off, and he was looking to swat this away with the horizontal bat. Went towards the left of Liton Das, who got a bit of glove on that, but couldn't prevent the single"
"short, and he has scooped this away towards deep mid-wicket, and <strong>sent it all the way</strong>!"
"shortens the length a touch, and slants it across him. Beaten outside off!"
"down the wicket, and slaps this straight back past the bowler. Over long-off. He has treated Mustafizur like a slow left-arm bowler here!"
"<b>dropped by Das!</b> A good response by Rahman, as he angles this across Tiripano, who goes for the big swipe. Across the edge, and towards slip. Das comes flying across, and gets his right glove to it, but cannot hold on"
driven through cover
"looks for a reverse sweep, but cannot make great contact. Off the glove, towards the ground"
"down the wicket, and Taijul fires it down the leg side. He swats it away towards short fine leg"
"fuller, driven towards cover point"
"tossed up around off, and he drives to cover"
"<strong>lucky!</strong> Looks for a drive, leaning forward. Off the inner edge, and just misses the stumps too, as it runs away towards fine leg. Reeled back in by the man on the edge of the circle"
"length, bashes this away towards sweeper cover. Afif runs across from deep point, and stops this low to his right. Good work, to keep it down to two"
"fuller, angles across him, and he looks to drive. Misses out on contact"
runs a length ball down to third man
"looks to move away and whack a short ball, angled across him, over mid-wicket. Misses out. A bit of movement with the cutter as well, and also good pace on this one"
"short, and he looks to pull. This may have come off his body, as it goes towards slip. Dies on Das, as he looks to collect. Gets a bit of glove, but they pinch the leg bye. Again, good pace from Mustafiz"
"length, played away towards mid-wicket. They are going back for the overthrow, as the throw at the striker's end wasn't backed up properly"
"looks to go forward to drive, but misses"
"the Don is gone! Taijul sticks to the basics, angles one in without much turn, and Tiripano loses shape in looking to slog across the line. Misses, and the bowler hits"
"driven back towards the bowler. Taijul dives to his left, and parries the ball away. Allows them to pick up a single"
"length, defends towards square leg"
"fuller, and driven to long-off. That's <strong>fifty for Raza</strong>, in his 100th ODI"
"drives to covers, where the fielder dives low and keeps the batsman on strike"
"full toss, around leg and middle, and he swats this away towards deep square leg"
"length, defends this towards short mid-wicket"
"slower ball, around off, and he slices this away through covers towards the sweeper in the deep"
"angles in towards leg stump from outside off, and he whips this towards deep square leg. Just a single"
"length, driven towards deep cover"
"looks for the yorker, but ends up a low full toss around off. Driven hard towards cover, and Mortaza gets low down from his position at mid-off to cut this off. Superb bit of work, especially for a man with dodgy knees. Duly applauded"
"length, goes on with the angle again, and Raza cuts to point"
"unerring accuracy again from Taijul, but just a touch predictable now. Raza smacks this over long-on, after clearing his front leg out of the way"
"shapes back in from around the wicket, and bowled a touch quicker. Can only defend this"
"shorter, and he goes over point towards the sweeper in the deep this time"
"length, around off, and Mumba goes back to punch this towards cover"
"length, punched past cover, but the man in the deep will do the cleaning up"
"length, driven hard towards long-off. Refuses the single, to retain strike"
"slower ball, and he has hit this down deep mid-wicket's throat! The fielder is actually three-quarters of the way into the boundary, and that's why it ends up being an easy catch for him in the end. Saif picks up another, and Raza's resistance comes to an end"
"<strong>doesn't last more than one ball!</strong> Four for Saif, who bowls a searing in-swinging yorker to greet the number 11. It's difficult for anybody to deal with that first up, and more so for someone in just his second ODI. Saif does his typical cross-chested celebration, and the entire team now converges around Mashrafe Mortaza"
