not yet Hogg's last ball at the WACA. Because this is a no-ball. A full toss that slips out of the hand and has been shovelled over deep midwicket
"oh, dear! Hogg's WACA sojourn ends with a brace of sixes. This is another full toss and Turner advances down the ground before slapping it over long-on. Gets a rousing ovation from the crowd and he acknowledges it with a wave of the hands and a genial smile. What a player he's been!"
Agar can't believe that's not been called a wide. But he had walked across and Bravo slipped this past him and very close to the leg stump. Close but still outside but Agar had walked across
"Bravo showcases his football skills and effects a run out. Scorchers are losing some ground and this match is swinging again. And it's the big fish, Ashton Turner. Bravo just runs forward towards the stumps and kicks the ball to fell the bails and Turner is well short of his ground even as he bends forward and grounds the bat. Agar had tried to flick and got hit on the pad and they tried to steal a leg bye"
"full toss, whipped straight to Richardson at deep backward square leg"
"very full outside off, flays it wide of long-off, and hang on. There's been a run out. They try a non-existent second run. This was struck with immense power and so there was really no second run on there. They decide to take it nonetheless and it ends up being suicidal. A fiery throw from the deep is collected clean by Bravo who takes the bails off and hurls the ball in the air"
"slower ball but Agar picks it and heaves it with good timing straight over. A full delivery and it isn't the prettiest of strokes. But pretty isn't what Scorchers need right now. Effectiveness is what they need, and 10 out of 10 on that"

even shorter and bounces even more this time. Beats him with pace as he tries to slash at it again
"oh, dear! A third swing and a miss. Scorchers don't need to be making it harder for themselves here. It's a simple equation. Stands in the crease and simply swipes across the line to get beaten"
he goes for the big shot nonetheless and it helps them knock off two more from the target. A full and wide delivery that's heaved over the in-field in the extra cover region
slaps at a wide fuller delivery and hits it straight to cover. Dot
"fuller ball, pushed into the cover fielder again. Pressure building again"
comes down the track and whips this towards wide long-on who's on to in a flash. Only time for a single
drills this from outside off down to long-off. Not clean connection as he chops into the ground but that will do
"No, we won't. A full toss to end it all that's driven wide of long-off and that seals a hard-earned win for the home team much to the delight of a record local crowd"
