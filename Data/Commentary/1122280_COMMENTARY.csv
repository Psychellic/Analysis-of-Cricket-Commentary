"'catch,' is the cry with short point in place, and Amla forces it straight to him, looking for another boundary."
"goes straighter at Amla, who needs no second invitation to bring his wrists into play."

"<b>the ball hits the stumps, but the bails don't come off</b>! Quinton de Kock has been in woeful form all tour. And here, after watching his partner charm the ball to the point boundary, he gets one with extra pace, cramping into him, leaving him nowhere to hide. He tries to block with soft hands, but it dribbles away to his sticks"

the length is a shade short and that triggers Amla's instincts to cut. Not quite enough room to go for the full-blooded shot though
"<b>kicks up again</b>, even as Amla sets up for that punch off the back foot, perhaps a little straighter though cover this time. But Bhuvi gets a little extra on this short ball"
"goes full and outside off, Amla looks for a whippy drive, keeping his front leg away so he has room to free his hands. Mistimes it"

"good length on and around off stump, defends"
another leg-side offering and de Kock whips it away to long leg
thrusts the straight bat at a fullish delivery hunting the top of off stump
"after the most hostile of welcomes, de Kock is being serenaded by short balls on leg stump. Flicks it to deep square leg"
"back of a length and outside off, pushes it to cover"
"he's looking to force the ball down the ground, but a lack of pace, but more so the late swing Bhuvi can get with the new ball, forces a mistimed bunt towards the non-striker"
"<b>pierces the gap at point</b>, and it's possible because he has just enough room to use some power. Good thing though is Bhuvi keeps bringing the batsman forward"
"<b>sweet timing</b> as de Kock leans over a full one on middle, closes the bat face on contact but looks up to see midwicket foiling his plans for a boundary"
"good length and outside off, de Kock taps it into the covers for a quick single."
the bounce unsettles de Kock as he tries to force it through the off side. Bunt to mid-off

"waits on the short delivery to come close enough that he can drill it through point, showing off that high elbow"
"looks to spirit a back of a length delivery directed across him through midwicket, but he is into the shot too early and gets a leading edge to point"
"carves it behind point, and manages to hit the gap even though there isn't much room to pull the shot off"
<b>inside edge</b> as Amla looks to hit the back of a length ball through cover and instead finds a single to long leg
tries to drive on the up but the pitch isn't necessarily pacy enough for such shots. Wonder how batsmen will fare when the ball loses its newness
"<b>past slip</b>! It is agonisingly close to Rohit Sharma diving to his right and sticking out a hand, but Amla has hit the ball hard enough to beat him even with an outside edge"
"tries to flick a shortish delivery to the right of mid-on, but the ball hits a little too high on the bat"
squirts off the inside half of the bat towards mid-on
"<b>that's class</b>. He indulges in a cursory front-foot stride, but after that, it's those hands. They throw themselves at a perfectly good delivery outside off and bully it through the covers"

"sets up a pull, but again the shot isn't well timed. Again, the new ball isn't coming onto the bat"
"142 kph, goes a smidge wider of the crease but Amla negotiates the exaggerated angle into him superbly"
"looks for lbw, but Amla is alert and his wrists are like lightning. They meet the fast and straight delivery and send it away to long leg"
"even the flick - and this is Amla we're taking about - doesn't quite work as intended. He wants the gap to the right of mid-on, but off this slow pitch, he mistimes the shot straight to Bhuvi"

<b>breaks the shackles</b> as he charges down the pitch and slogs a length ball outside off to the midwicket boundary.
<b>outside edge</b> as it soars past point and into the third man boundary. These are manifestations of South Africa's frustrations. They're taking a lot more risks to try and up the run-rate and most times they are not paying off

leaves a good length ball outside off
"back of a length and outside off, Amla dabs it to point"
digs it in short and outside off. Amla thinks about a pull but then bails out
"<b>so sublime</b>. Gets in line with off stump, greets the good length ball outside off with the full face and times the pants off it."
"<b>gives him caught behind  but Amla immediately opts for a review</b>! Bhuvneshwar's retribution is in the form of a back of a length delivery that cuts into the right-hander, who is in an awful position. He is set up to flay it through the off side, the movement makes him change his shot and try to punch through mid-on. That leads to gap between bat and pad, and replays indicate there is quite a big edge through to the keeper"
<b>beaten</b> as this indipper sneaks under the bat as Markram tries a cut
"back of a length and outside off, punches to cover point"
"<b>and there's turn straight away</b>. Pushes it through, as he does at the start of a spell, pitching on middle and getting it to cramp de Kock even as he tries to make room. Chops to cover"
"on the pads, perhaps worried de Kock would step legside again. He doesn't, instead playing a scoop to long leg"
"shortish on off stump, drills it to cover"
"cuts from off stump, and therefore doesn't have the timing to beat point"

"splendid drive, on the up, but short cover is in the way"
"deflects a shortish delivery from outside off to midwicket. Neatly done, has to wait for the ball to get in position for such a shot. He's been out there long enough to perhaps get used to the pace of the pitch"

"full on off stump, defends"
closes the face of the bat to find a single to the right of mid-on.
"nicely fighted on off stump, Markram defends"
"drifts it into leg stump, and because of that, Markram is able to flick against the turn to square leg"
leans forward to the pitch of a tossed up delivery on off stump and tees it through to deep midwicket
"'this is the ball,' says Dhoni as it comes down in line with middle, trapping Markram in his crease and forcing him to hurry into a whip to mid-on"
gets forward to block a well flighted delivery outside off
"<b>falls to a long hop</b>! Pull shot goes off the bottom of the bat and settles in Pandya's hands at deep midwicket. De Kock continues to have a terrible 2018. In better form, he would have pulled it into Jupiter's orbit. But at present, he can't help but give his wicket away."
<b>caught off a short ball again</b>! South Africa would have known wristspin would be a menace on this slow pitch. But never would they have imaged two batsmen slogging a half-trackier straight to deep midwicket.
"nicely flighted, and Miller gingerly gets forward to it and blocks into the off side"
"looks for a cover drive, but the ball drifts in just enough to ping off the inside edge and through to short midwicket."
<b>appeals everywhere</b> as a slider - flat in trajectory - pings off the pad and through to Dhoni
"<b>another one falls</b>,  at least this is to a good ball! It's tossed up. Goes above the eyeline, drawing Miller forward with the drive. That's when the ball dips, turns, hitchhikes off the outside edge straight to Rahane at slip."

"ushers the new batsman forward, and Khaya blocks well"
"<b>slider</b>! He was setting up for that with the first two ridiculously flighted deliveries. This one is flat in trajectory, and wicket-to-wicket. Could have been lbw if not for the quick hands of Zondo"

"slogs the full toss away to the left of deep midwicket, showing his senior players how its done"
shimmies down to tap a full delivery to the left of Kuldeep
"drives to mid-off. Lovely pace from Kuldeep, and great control of length, constantly bringing him forward"
pitches on leg and turns sharply. Zondo waits for it and clips it past leg slip's left
goes for the sweep shot - with the line being outside off. Inside edges onto his boot
"good length ball pitches outside off and bounds away to Dhoni. 'What bowling, dude,' is the shot from the close-in fielders as they see the ball spit off the pitch"
gets down the pitch but Chahal's drift doesn't allow too many attacking options. Drive to long-off
paddle sweeps - premeditates it as well - and the flighted delivery on middle goes to long leg
hangs back to a flatter delivery and steers it to point
"lets go a good length ball outside off - and it goes straight through, no turn. This is going to mess with the batsman's mind"
"<b>past slip</b>! The outside edge results as Zondo skips down the track. Chahal pulls his length back, finds turn, then the outside edge, but it's just thick enough to save him"
plants his bat in front of pad and blocks. <b>That's drinks</b>
"sets up for the cut, but there is too much turn! It defeats the batsman, and even the wicketkeeper. Dhoni doesn't normally fumble behind the stumps to a spinner"
strides forward and blocks
"goes back to read the quicker, but full length, delivery off the pitch and blocks it"
"tries to force it off the back foot, but without any room, he can't beat point"
leans into the artfully flighted delivery outside off and drives to deep cover
"<b>gets dip</B> and Dhoni is particularly pleased - 'ooooh, nice' - as that little bit of magic has the batsman thrusting his bat in front of his body. The ball pings off, in the air for a distance, to midwicket"
smacks it to the left of mid-off. Pace on the ball brings a confident shot from a South African batsman
"goes around the wicket for a shortish delivery outside off, Duminy lets it go"
"slashes it to the third man boundary. He isn't in control of the shot, but he is looking to find the gap behind point and a thick edge helps him out. Also, Bumrah might have bruised himself while diving out there. A stretcher comes out for him, but he flashes them a grin and sends them off on their way. It's just a cut to the skin"

"good length ball outside off, Zondo lets it go"
<b>jaffa</b>! He hits the deck and gets plenty more bounce than Zondo expects. The batsman is trying to glide it to third man for a single and is comfortably beaten
"more awkward bounce, but with the line being on middle and leg, Zondo is able to work it behind square leg"
pulls the short ball outside off to deep square leg
blocks the short one to point

"tosses it up with a proper, high arm action, and Zondo works it through midwicket. 'Good start, good start, Keju,' says Dhoni"
"around the wicket, going wide of the crease for the slingy good length ball outside off. Duminy lashes it to short cover. Runs saved"
"slides it through with his low arm again. As a result, there is no pace, or bounce. Zondo can only block"

"full and outside off, he drives to the right of sweeper cover"
"shortish and outside off, punches through to the sweeper"
clips a shortish delivery outside off through to deep midwicket
comes through so very slow and even a short ball outside off results in only a single behind point
"tosses it up outside off, Duminy taps it to the right of cover"
"goes side-arm, extremely side-arm, and the ball on middle is flicked to long leg. If Zondo missed that, he would have been lbw"
"tosses it up on middle, from around the stumps, Duminy defends"
"pushes it through on middle and leg, the batsman keeps it out"
"high-arm action for a 92 kph delivery on leg stump, Duminy drives it to long-on"

cuts a flatter delivery outside off to deep point
"sweeps off the stumps and that little bit of bat proves highly useful, otherwise there might have been a fairly vociferous appeal"

"slingy delivery on middle, forcing Duminy to take a risk as he backs away and cuts to cover"
"drives a full delivery outside off to the right of short cover, but Chahal does well with a dive"

"width on offer and Duminy chops it through point. Dhoni goes, 'not outside [off]'"
"<B>keeps low</b> and if not for Zondo's quick hands and a straight bat, that might have thudded into the pads in front of off stump"
"short and wide, Zondo cuts straight to cover. Bad balls yielding no profit"
goes back to block a good length ball on middle
"googly, pitching on leg stump and turning just a tiny bit away from the left-hander. Duminy, by virtue of playing late, is able to glance it past leg slip"
"<b>top edge</b> and he's gone. Pandya is the one running back from short midwicket, he doesn't quite take it on the first grab, but recovers well. This is the Chahal special. Slowing it down. Tossing it up. Lining it wide outside off and daring the batsman to swing across the line. Zondo feels the pressure of a limp run-rate and goes for a slog sweep. Doesn't pay off."
"nicely tossed up outside off, Duminy blocks"
"closes the bat face as he whips a flighted delivery outside off to long-on. Brings up the South African hundred, at a run-rate less than four"
"smokes an overpitched delivery outside off - could well be the googly - through the covers. That might have been the shot Chahal wanted Morris to play, but the batsman executes it to perfection"
"oooh, it dips on the batsman, and just a hint of turn has Duminy squared up in the crease, on the front foot, as he defends"
glides a shortish delivery outside off to point
brings him forward and Duminy drives the ball outside off to long-off
"quicker delivery, googly too. Morris hurries into blocking it, hands in front of his body, feet going nowhere"
sweeps a flighted delivery outside off to long leg
"short and wide, Duminy slaps it to the sweeper"
goes back despite the full length and blocks in front of middle and leg
"<b>lbw in front of middle</b>! Duminy goes for the sweep, hitting across the line, for at best a run or two. The ball dips on him ever so wonderfully, it also drifts in such a way that it starts on leg stump, but pitches on middle. Would have straightened to topple it too. Duminy wants a review but South Africa have none left."
defends a full delivery on leg stump to midwicket
gets forward to block on off stump
nudges a good lengt h ball on leg stump past square leg
"cuts a fairly full length delivery on off stump and gets a single to deep point. Risky, very risky"
goes on the bounce to Bumrah at long-on as Morris goes for the big hit
closes the face and the little bit of turn that India's wristspinners are consistently drawing gets a leading edge
"<b>doesn't pick the wrong 'un</b> and with him camped so deep in his crease, the decision is straight forward. Kuldeep does splendidly to land a good length ball outside off - it comes out all slow and unthreatening, but the moment it grips into the pitch, it tears into the left-hander."
"<b>dropped</b>, and then there is a run-out chance too, Morne is sprawled on the floor. Will he survive? He's safe. Good slide. But what a shot to start. Takes on the wristspinner with a big heave, mistimes it to mid-on, and Jadhav, having to dive forward, isn't able to cling on"
"launches it to the straight boundary - big stride forward, long arms hitting through the line. He's a very good hitter. Keeps his shape ever so well"
immediately pulls his length back and lines the ball a little wider outside off. Morris hits to cover
"tosses it up on off stump, Morkel only just protects it."
pushes a full delivery outside off to mid-off
"might be the textbook definition of a plumb lbw, but the way Morkel is walking off it looks like he's had a hundred stolen from him. A wrong 'un, pitching on middle, the tailender doesn't pick it and plays against the turn. It straightens off the pitch, sneaks under the bat, and mercilessly traps him"
lunges forward to block
comes forward to drive with an open face and is nearly caught at second slip
gets forward and blocks outside off
"<b>falls short of the sweeper</b>! Dhawan is the man running in off the boundary, diving forward, trying desperately to get under the ball. But it bounces short and hits him on the chin. #Ouch. Superb timing on the upper cut though"
good length ball speared in at the pads. Tahir is slow with the flick
"back of a length and outside off, wafts and misses"
"full and on leg stump, Tahir backs away and blocks. He's not very happy facing pace"
knocks the off stump over. Tahir's plans of staying away from the ball at high pace would always have led to this. It was simply a matter of time for Bumrah to get his radar right.
"full on off stump, defends"
"goes for the slog sweep, but the legbreak drifts too far into his pads and doesn't allow him any hitting room"
<b>that's South Africa's lowest ODI total at home and Chahal is the wrecker in chief with his maiden ODI five-for</b>. The turn he gets on the leg break makes Morris skew his lofted shot to deep cover
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"drifts down the leg side and offers an extra, when he has only 118 to defend"
"aims at off stump, Rohit protects it with a straight bat"
"that's a Rohit Sharma special! The front foot swivel pull against extreme pace and the ball sails into the midwicket boundary. How he gets on top of the bounce, and keeps his head still while going for an attacking shot is simply marvelous"
gets down with an attempted yorker and keeps it out
"looks to flick a full on middle through midwicket, but is a touch too early on the shot. Leading edge to point"
"nudges the ball on his pads ever so neatly to the right of mid-on. Makes sure to keep the face straight, considering this is a slow pitch and it can foster leading edges"
gets a good length ball to straighten and a wary Rohit defends it late
looks for a flick to long leg but accepts the wide instead
strides forward to a good length ball and blunts it with great confidence
lets go a good length ball outside off. Rabada continues to get a hint of seam movement away
"<b>given caught behind but Rohit has reviewed immediately</b>. Regardless, this is a good ball. Pitches it up outside off, gets it to slant away off the pitch, draws Rohit into prod and it appears the bat strikes pad just as the ball passes it as well. Ultra-Edge will clear this up. Actually no, it is almost perfectly simultaneous. Bat hits pad just as ball passes the edge - textbook example of no conclusive evidence - but the third umpire bucks the trend and overrules the on-field call. It is, however, the correct decision."
"shortish on off stump, nudges it to midwicket"
"goes full and straight, Rohit keeps it out"
"length on leg stump, he taps it on the up towards mid-on"
<b>beaten on the outside edge</b> as he wafts away from the body against this rising ball
"crunched. Fuller from Morkel, wider too. Gets low to reach it and sends it through cover point with no fuss"
"good length and down leg side, misses as he looks to flick"
<b>aerial</b> but he beats extra cover's dive to the right. Length ball wide outside off and once more he wafts to try and drive on the rise. Ends up slicing it with some loss of control and Miller's fingertips aren't far
"full ball on middle stump, jammed back down the pitch"
"good length just outside off stump, punched on the up to mid-off"
"good length on off stump, defended on the front foot"
"what a shot. Full ball on leg stump, he allows it to come on and keeps his head still as he gets the bat in front of the pad. Then, he caresses it through midwicket"
"good length on off stump, defended on the front foot"
<b>no third man</b> and he gets four with the ramp. Two slips and a gully mark South Africa's pursuit of wickets. But the ball is dropped short and just outside off. He backs away and lifts it after arching backwards
"<b>superb bouncer!</b> Rabada makes Rohit look ordinary with this and then claps him off. Rising sharply at around helmet height and Rohit's front leg is in the air as he looks to hook. His right calf and ankle have to bear all the weight and usually that means you're in trouble. Losing balance, losing shape, he rends up lifting it up towards Morkel at fine leg who runs in languidly but in signature style, manages to get down just in time and hold on to his left"
"looks for the yorker first up and it's a big bending full toss down leg side. Dhawan doesn't get bat on this and QDK leaps to his right to save four. It's not called wide though, and just like Dhawan, I'm not sure why"

"short ball on the hips, steered to fine leg with a controlled pull"
"classy shot from Kohli. Gets on top of the bounce outside off and opens the face to run this wide of Tahir at deep point. He's running to his left and dives to try and pull it back with his right hand - with a backhand flick. In the end, it's his trailing left hand that stops it"
ohhh yes. Sweet timing. Length ball slanted across the left-hander who leans in to this and offers a straighter bat than previous occasion to punch wide of mid-off
"length on leg stump, flicked to square leg's left"
"good length and in at off stump, solidly blocked on the crease"
good length and angled into the pad. He tickles it to fine leg with the angle
another great bouncer. Dhawan takes one hand off the bat to keep this down but the feet weren't moving too much
errs full on the attempted yorker again. This time it's at a middle stump line and he punches it back at the bowler who can't collect cleanly in the follow through. Deflects it wide of mid-off
<b>beaten outside off.</b> This short of a length delivery is too close for a cut
<b>raps him on the pad</b> this time. It jags in off the seam and he's caught deep in the crease as he looks to flick. Too high for a reasonable lbw appeal
<b>cramps him again</b> just outside off. Dhawan unsure by now whether the angle will take it across. Hurriedly digs it into the pitch after shaping for a cut
short of a length and just outside off. Left alone
good length just outside off. Giving him nothing at the moment. He defends into the point region
"<b>outside edge</b> squeezes past gully. A good over from Morris ends with the batsman getting runs anyway. Draws him forward and he isn't in control as he stabs at it. Once again, no third man in place"

"back of a length just outside off stump, defended on the back foot"
<b>beats him with the bouncer.</b> Kohli gets inside the line and is beaten by raw pace as he swivels to try and hook this
"<b>hits him</b> with the bouncer this time. Looks like it's just under the ribs on the right side. He's winded, but he's on his feet. Got bat on the hook this time and gets an inside edge. Ouch"
<b>and then he inflicts some pain of his own!</b> This one doesn't rise as much as the ones before. He's under it quickly and slaps it over fine leg
