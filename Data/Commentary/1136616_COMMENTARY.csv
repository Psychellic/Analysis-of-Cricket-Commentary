"<b>beaten.</b> Ngidi gets some sharp climb across the corridor as Gayle gets stuck in the crease, fishing away from the body"

"short of good length, angled in, blocked"
"good length ball that nips in, comes forward and blocks and the ball goes off the inside of the at to mid-on. Tiwary is halfway down eager to get off the mark but is sent back. The throw misses the stumps and three fielders fall over it and they end up getting it anyway. Comedy of errors"
"good length outside off, subtle shape away, rips past the outside edge"
old wounds opened up for Rahul. Remember the Tests in Sri Lanka when he lost his stumps shouldering arms? It's happened again. A length ball that nips in sharply from outside off. Error in judgement costs Rahul

"full ball outside off, plants the front leg across into the off side and looks to flick. Gets it off the leading edge to long-off"
leg stump length ball. Tickled fine off the thigh guard. Dhoni fields and the batsman is caught staring at him as his partner calls through for a run and gets halfway down the pitch with no response. All safe in the end
"loopy slower ball on leg stump, flicked straight to midwicket to pinch a single"

"low full toss wide outside off, steps out and completely misses the slash outside off"
"<b>there's a sound as Dhoni takes this.</b> Yeah he's out. No one appeals. But Tiwary and Dhoni both no he's got an edge on this attempted slog sweep. Once again, before the review can be taken, a batsman walks off. Routine length ball outside off and a very tame, sober sequence of play breaks the partnership. Good innings from Tiwary"

<b>bowled him!</b> Beauty from Bravo. The perfect yorker. Miller shuffles and comes back in line but it's all too much because he won't be able to keep this yorker from hitting off. Right on the crease and crash. Two set batsmen gone in six balls.
"full ball outside off, a nice-looking straight drive to long-off"
"length on middle stump, tapped to midwicket from the crease"
"good length on middle stump, punched on the up to long-on"
<b>beaten on the inside edge.</b> Plays down the wrong line at this. It's in the corridor and he's poking well wide from that. Bravo thinks there's an edge but Dhoni's in no mood
"length ball on middle stump, punched back to the bowler on the up"
"short of a length slider outside off, chopped straight to point"

"backs away, gets followed. Shovels it to deep backward square"
"short of a length on off stump, pushed back to the bowler from the crease"

short of a length and in at leg stump. Backs away and slices to sweeper cover. Jadeja pushing em in fast
oh well played. Jadeja is firing it in to make sure they don't get a swing on the front foot. So he goes on the back foot and uses that pace to slap it wide of long-off. Stunning hit
"length ball on off, punched to long-off"
"pushed through at off stump, punched to long-off"
"length ball on leg stump, backs away and gets followed down leg side. Looks to flick it uppishly but can't get bat on it"
"<b>misfield at mid-off.</b> Length ball just outside off, mistimed, slic-ey punch on the up from Axar. Chahar gets down very slowly and allows it to pass"
<b>give that man a raise! Sam Billings takes a stunner!</b> A graceful leap forward after a short sprint in from a straight-ish deep square leg position and a tumble to kill the momentum without letting the elbow hit the floor - top class athleticism. Axar slices the short ball and it's dipping fast
<b>goes over extra cover.</b> New favourite shot for Nair. Exposes the stumps and gets an overpitched ball again that he can open the face against as he goes aerially. Beats BIllings to his right
<b>induces the bouncer</b> by faking a shuffle. Quickly jumps back and gets inside the line to ramp this comfortably over deep square leg
knuckle ball goes woefully wrong It's very wide
"<b>lazy attempt from Dhoni</b> and that's a missed chance. Nair backs away too much and is lunging to try and play a square drive. Gets a thick edge that flies to Dhoni's right and he only gets an obligatory right hand out at this, feet barely moving"
short ball down leg side. He looks to tickle it fine. Ngidi appeals. Umpire says wide. No review.
"<b>a review this time</b>. Ngidi must have charming eyes. Dhoni says he heard nothing but takes the review anyway. But Ngidi is right! Ashwin is looking to chop this length ball down to third man and he's got a very very thin edge on this! <b>Ashwin is gone!</b> What a review. Some climb in in the corridor from a length, very fast, and just enough for Ashwin"
a vicious yorker first up. Does fantastically to dig this out to mid-off
"<b>chips the next one straight to mid-off.</b> Ngidi with the Heavy Ball<sup>TM</sup>  in the corridor again. Tye looking to jab at it well in front of the body, can only chip it harmlessly over the bowler. <B>4 for 8</b> for Ngidi. Kings XI's season closing rapidly..."

<b>hello!</b> Karun Nair with an outrageous reverse pick-up from outside leg stump. Full and fired down leg side. He skips quickly into stance and taps this over backward point
"<B>he's in full control</b>. Once again, puts the pressure with one six and makes the bowler bowl exactly what he wants the next ball. Bravo's slower ball is anticipated - he's going down on his knee very early outside off. When it arrives, he scoops him over fine leg"
"<b>fifty!</b> And once again, he knows what's coming because he's made it so! The short ball, obviously. Steps out and swats it over wide long-on"
"<b>and then he msicues one to find mid-off.</b> Nair is livid with himself. Seems to have been in the right place once again. A yorker and he's leg-side of it, trying to go inside-out between extra cover and mid-off. Gets it right off the toe to that fielder and whacks the ground with his bat"
"slower ball at a length on leg stump, tapped into the midwicket region off the back foot"
"nice juicy length ball outside off, nice, clean, aimless swing somewhere in the middle stump vicinity. Beaten"
"yorker outside off, has a heave at it again, thick outside edge to third man"
"full ball on the stumps, makes room and drills it to sweeper cover"
"<b>bowled out.</b> Slower short ball at off stump, makes room and slices one to long-on where Faf is calm and very still a centimetre in front of the boundary. Graceful landing and that's out, confirmed by the replays"

"good length outswinger wide outside off, left alone"

"and again. Swing movement and bounce. Faf at it again away from the body, can't get a touch"
"<b>close.</b> Rayudu allows this to come very close to him, with no forward press. It's a length ball and he gets it onto pad off the inside edge"
"<b>got him!</b> The new ball is talking, the new ball as got CSK's best batsman of the season! Mohit hits a length just outside off, Rayudu jabs at it and gets an edge through to Rahul"

"short of a length at leg stump, leaps to get on top of it and nudges through square leg"
"good length outside off, defended solidly on the front foot"
<b>past Mohit's outstretched hand!</b> Faf jabbing nervously from the crease at this length ball. It doesn't have too much movement on it and that's probably what's deceived him a touch. Manages to find four from between mid-off and the bowler
big inswinger onto the pads. Raina falls over into the off side and glances uppishly towards fine leg
<b>beaten.</b> Short of a length outswinger wide outside off. Slashes at it but it skids through from under
"<b>leading edge</b> to mid-off. Great bowling, this. Outswinger from middle stump. Faf's bat face is closed too quickly and this ends up at mid-off"
"<b>outside edge past second slip!</b> Scythes at another one outside off, goes fully at it. No position at all to execute that perfectly and it flies quickly to the third man boundary"
"length ball swinging away, wide outside off. Left alone"
"shot. Won't allow you to bowl to me, says Faf. Gets down the pitch to cut out the swing and lifts one over the off-side infield"
"short ball slanted across off stump. Cut into the turf, on the bounce to point"
"good length, shaping into the corridor. Defended into the leg side off the inside half of the bat"
"<b>slapped away.</b> Too short from Tye. Sits up outside off stump and it's an easy put away. Aerial, over point"
<b>boom!</b> Steps out and pumps him straight! At a length on off stump again and he meets this outside leg to drill past his partner
bouncer. Down leg side.
short ball down leg side. Raina leaping to get out of the way and stabbing at it. Beaten
length ball swinging away outside off. Left alone
<b>well done Tiwary.</b> Leaps to his right and saves four. Raina leans in nicely for this cover drive on the up but can't get it past him
drives straight to cover. Nicely to the pitch of this full outswinger outside off
"short of a length, curving away. Faf with the waft. Beaten"
<b>Gayle unsure at first slip if he's taken this.</b> Faf driving on the up against an outswinger gets a thick edge. Soft signal is out. Gayle went weirdly at this - with a reverse cup with his right hand and a normal catching position with his other hand! Goes low to his left and it looks like he's managed it...<b>no conclusive evidence to overturn this.</b> Faf is gone! Superb bowling finally rewarded.
<b>got him!</b> Ankit Rajpoot does not like simple endings! He's keeping Kings XI alive. A length ball that nips away marginally to beat a very nervous-looking forward defence from Billings - he's inside the line. The top of off stump is tonked and suddenly CSK will feel the nerves!
back of a length outswinger outside off. Walks down the pitch and taps it into the leg side
"<b>dropped!</b> Finch has dived in front of Gayle from second slip and put one down! Rahul chucks the ball away in frustration. CSK were this close to being in a disastrous position. Rajpoot, back of a length outside off. Harbhajan jabs at it with feet rooted to the crease. That was going straight to Gayle."
"length ball in the corridor, Raina nervously defends off the inside edge"
"full ball on off stump, tapped from the crease into the covers. Some late swing there"
<b>he's early run out!</b> Why is Harbhajan out there?! Calls for a run he can't make and is not even stretching to make the striker's end. Raina anxiously dabs another length ball to square leg and the fielder can't hit the stumps
<b>wild heave</b> is mistimed. It trickles out to mid-on. A length ball outside off
"<b>finds the point boundary!</b> Length ball outside off, gets the front foot out of the way and slices it over point"
full toss on middle stump. Mistimed slog straight to square leg
"<b>almost strangled down the leg side</b>. Harbhajan moves across and tries a flick and the ball goes over leg stump. Barely! Geez, what's happening here!"
"short ball, too much pace and bounce outside off, Harbhajan tries to ramp it over but can't get on top of it"
"short ball, swings for a pull and misses as the ball gets over the bat. Harbhajan asks if it isn't the second bouncer and then the umpire calls it a no-ball. He had walked down the ground too. Rajpoot can't be any less amused"

shuffles across to a length ball and flicks to deep backward square leg
"pitched up around off, hammered down to long-on"

"<b>a blockbuster finish!</b> Mohit Sharma looks to double-bluff Dhoni, the man who mentored him through his early phases in this tournament. He bounces him. Dhoni knows it's coming. He's sitting on the back foot. He's ready - he sends the hook sailing over long leg"
