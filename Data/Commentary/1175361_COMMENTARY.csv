"swinging into the pads, thumps the legs, deflects back into the bowler's followthrough"
"swinging past the pads, we'll have that one again"
"full and straight, with a perfect upright seam, that's a good solid line at this early stage. Powerfully clonked off the front foot, but staight to short cover"
"<B>big appeal</b> as the ball jags back, but might have snagged an inside edge as it thumped into the pads"
"a dirty hoick across the line, under-edged to short fine leg and Lynn is up and running"
"pushed onto the back foot, clipped to leg but no gap there. That's a fine probing over"
"looped onto a full length, dabbed cautiously off the legs to midwicket"
"<B>plonked into the dug-out!</B> Plants the front foot, swings through the line, clean over long-off! Old Mystery 1 New Mystery 0"
<B>through Varun's fingers!</B> Smashed back down the track and he can't cling on to his left!
"<B>honked through midwicket!</B> That's another calculatedly aggressive mow. No need for finesse, just pummel it to the rope!"
"<B>that's gone many a mile!</B> Right to the pitch of this one, a hooning slog sweep, high over the leg side! Big pressure now!"
"sliding down the leg side, and <B>launched over backward square!</B> Yeegads, Narine's at it again!"
leans back and <strong>monstered over the covers!</strong> KXI's fine start is a distant memory!
"pushed onto the back foot, that's a good riposte, hitting the splice hard with that strong seam position"
"back of a length, <B>out comes the kitchen sink again!</B> Caught this with the handle of the hot tap, to be fair, but no-one to defend that at long-on!"
"<strong>right underneath it!</strong> That's threatening a few satellites as it soars into the Kolkata (k)night ... Miller calls for it, braces for impact as it drops to earth like a comet, and <strong>falls to the turf to cushion the catch!</strong> Great hands"
"banged in short, <B>smashed back to the bowler who spills it!</B>"
"good finish to the bowler, shorter and sharper, zipping through to the keeper from back of a length"
"outside off, pushed through to the keeper on a wide line. A precious dot"
"on the back foot, pressed into the off side. Good line and solid pace"
sliding past the pads
"sliced wildly up in the air, and<strong> Viljoen has a debut wicket in his first over!</strong>. Rahul called for it early, watched it carefully, swallowed it with a late adjustment. Back of a length and following Narine who was cramped for room on the slog. That's the breathing space KXI needed!"
back of a length again and jagging in late as Uthappa attempts a tentative push
"pressed into the covers, on the front foot"
"<strong>too much width this time</strong>, and Viljoen's over is ruined at the last! A yawning swipe on the up, and clobbered flat over point, and the rope!"
"back of a length, popping past the left-hander who doesn't quite pick one of Tye's myriad variations"
nipping off the deck and thudding into the splice as Rana defends uppishly off the back foot
swished baseball-style round the corner as Tye slides in a back-of-a-length slower ball. Short fine leg gathers
"cutter, on the back foot, tapped to point, no run on offer there. Cunning variety in this over"
poked to the off side
"firm defence to complete a very tight over. It's been a mixed bag from KXI so far, but they've settled after that raucous second over"
leaning onto the front foot and flipped to the leg side
"tossed up, round the wicket, nudged to the leg side"
"wider line, attempted slap through the covers but can't connect"
"<B>no messing with this one!</B> Width again, but this time Uthappa was waiting for it, and unfurled a dismissive slog sweep, high over the leg side!"
"back into the crease, nurdled down to long-on"
"a swish across the line, half an appeal for lbw but clearly outside the line"
"too wide, chopped backward of the diving point and clean to the rope!"
"straining onto the front foot, slapped back down the track, the bowler gathers"
"short and wide again, <strong>slapped through backward point again!</strong> It's not getting much better for the rookie ..."
"better this time, bravely offers more air, and eased down the pitch to long-off"
"looping onto a good length outside off, and blocked. That'll make him feel better"
"swished to backward point, not sure he read the spin there, and another useful dot"
"on the back foot, pushed out to cover"
"slapped out through the leg side, reaching for the ball and just about connecting"
skidding through on the back foot from round the wicket
"<B>hoisted into the stands over long-on!</B> The runs keep coming, as Ashwin strays into the hitting zone and pays the price!"
pressed off the back foot to deep cover
"much wider line, just inside the lines, and Rana misses out on a flat-footed wallop through the covers"
"on the back foot, good length, and dabbed to midwicket"
"low full toss, tapped into the gap at long-on"
slower ball ... so slow it almost scuttled backwards out of the hand. Rana can't connect as it skids under his bat
"outside off, another slower ball, and tapped to the covers"
"back of a length, dabbed to backward point, good control from Tye"
"banged in shorter, can't get it away. This is a fine little spell that is just about putting KXI in the box seat"
"tosses it up on middle, Uthappa knocks it gently to long-on"
<b>launches it over long-on</b>! He shifts his weight back the moment the ball is short - plus it has loads of room as well - and that means Rana has a free swing
"ends up a full toss on leg stump, Rana, rather graciously, dabs it to long-on"
"looks like a carrom ball on leg stump, he flicks it through midwicket"
"another carrom ball and another full toss, Rana stays inside the line and lashes it through cover point"
"carroms all the way! This one short, which means Uthappa can go back, read the turn off the pitch and tap it to long-on"
it's the slower ball - but it's also in the blockhole. Uthappa digs out the 122 kph delivery to mid-off
looks for a flick as the good length ball at 128 kph strays into his pads. Goes straight off them to deep square leg
goes short and across the left-hander and Rana's attempt to ramp it over third man doesn't quite work
"goes round the wicket for <b>another bouncer</b> - and at 138 kph, with the angle cramping him for room and the ball coming up above his shoulder - it's really really tough to hook em away"
"glides the good length ball outside off to the right of point, where Gayle puts in a big, tumbling dive, saves a few runs and gets a few high-fives."
flicks the back of a length ball on middle away to deep square leg.
"gets the ball to turn away from the right-hander again - except it's a bit short and Uthappa doesn't really make the most of it, cutting it back to the bowler"
"waits a little longer this time, because he's picked the length early, and cuts the short ball on middle behind point"
big ole full toss from round the wicket and right in the hitting arc outside off. Rana goes down and slog sweeps it into the crowd behind midwicket
the carrom ball goes way too wide outside off
<b>W-O-W</b>! This is the offbreak and Ashwin tries his hardest to keep it out of reach of Rana outside off. But the left-hander reaches out - while somehow still not losing his shape - and flat-bats it over long-off
drags a length ball from way outside off to deep midwicket because he premeditates a sweep shot
flicks the flatter delivery straying into the pads to fine leg. <B>Ashwin's spell is over: 4-0-47-0</b>
"short, wide, cut behind point. The part-timer, forced to bowl because of Varun's bad day, gets the business"
"length on middle, he turns it through midwicket"
sits up for the slog and Rana shows he's not above such temptation. Takes aim and smashes the short ball outside off over midwicket
"<b>over cover</b>! That's pure timing. You can slog over the leg side with power. But to hit a six over point, off the front foot, requires a sound base and great hands"
nudges it down the ground to long-on
"looks to slice the shortish delivery outside off through the covers, but misses it altogether"
<b>that's fifty</b> in only 28 balls! Gently deflects the back of a length ball on his pads to the unmanned fine leg boundary. His first four of the night... to go with six sixes!
<b>outstanding</b>! He picks up the short ball outside off - a short ball that doesn't really bounce - and wallops it over long-on.
"<b>lashes it behind point</b>. This is ball-striking of the highest quality. No premeditation. Superb balance at the crease. And all round the park. Take this shot: it's a length ball outside off, the kind they let go in Test cricket, but he steps forward and plays the most glorious square drive"
slower ball - good thinking against a rampaging batsman on an easy-paced pitch - Rana dabs it at around square leg to pinch a single
<b>splendid timing</b> as he gets down low to the off-pace delivery outside off and steers it past point. Could easily have gone to the boundary without Agarwal diving to his left on the boundary
length ball slithers down leg
"yorker on middle, he flicks it through to deep midwicket"
starts with a reverse sweep which Varun spots and fires the ball flat and quick down the off side (which is now the leg side for the switched-up Rana)
"now the orthodox sweep, but with Varun taking the pace off, and getting it to spin away from the left-hander, he beats him again"
"<b>taken by long-off running in</b>. He's deceived the batsman again, tossing it up and keeping it slow. Rana plays the line - because the ball is on leg stump - but the ball turns away from him, takes the top edge and is then caught very very well by Agarwal racing forward from the edge of the boundary to almost the 30-yard circle. Quiet relief on Varun's face, and several pats on the back to make him feel better. Good stuff from Kings XI"
"<b>googly again</b> and it's turning big! Someone's told Varun to bowl slow and trust his strength and he's doing just that. With pace off the ball, the batsman isn't able to just blindly hit. Here Uthappa tries to defend and is beaten as the ball breaks into him"
"shortish and outside off, he slices it to point"
"drives the slow, tossed up delivery outside off, rather gently through the covers"
<b>appeal for lbw</b> as Uthappa plays all around a full toss. Luckily there's an inside edge and he made sure to show the ump his bat too. Just in case (which I'm not sure is allowed)
"back of a length and outside off, he slashes and misses"
"full toss, which he hits back at the bowler and gets a deflection to long-off"
"bouncer! And it's angled into the right-hander, coming up to his head, cramping him up and quick in pace too. Russell goes for the hook and it just goes off the body and over to the keeper"
"slower ball on middle and off, Russell blocks into the covers - uncharacteristically gently - and sets off"
flicks it fine and all the way to the boundary to bring up his fifty. <b>That's also the timeout</b>
"round the wicket, looking for the yorker, Russell clears his front leg and miscues it to long-on"
"<b>excellent bowling</b>: yorker, on middle, he nudges it to square leg"
"<b>nails the blockhole again</b> from round the wicket and even with Dre Russ setting himself up for the slog, he can only get a single to long-on. Great execution under pressure from Shami. This is why he's in with a shout of playing the World Cup for India"
"whips it to the left of long leg, where the fielder Varun C isn't quick enough to stop the boundary. And so a good ball - a near-yorker on middle - ends up leaking runs. Uthappa batting deep in his crease, expecting the toe-crushers"
"full toss on the pads, he flicks it to deep square leg"
"<b>nails him with the sweetest siren of a yorker</b>! It is irresistible. Except for one tiny problem - it's <b>a no-ball</B> for only three fielders being inside the circle. There needs to be at least four. And as a result, Russell, who was bowled neck and crop by a ridiculously cool yorker on middle from round the wicket, gets a florgin free hit now"
"heaves it out to deep midwicket, where Tye keeps it inside the ropes, knowing full well he doesn't need to take the catch because it's a free hit ball. All he concentrates on is keeping the ball in play and he does"
"<b>another yorker</b>, tailing into the right-hander, almost like reverse swing and even the great Dre Russ ends up looking so clumsy. Nearly falls over as he tries to jam it out and keep it away from his stumps"
swings a slow short ball away to deep midwicket
"hiiiigh in the air and it's over the boundary. A top-edged six! He's got his eyes off the ball. He's cramped. He's just blindly heaving at a back of a length delivery meant to cramp him on leg stump. And yet even after being deceived like that, his sheer power bails him out"
"ooooh, it's length. It's length and outside off and Russell clears the front leg and bludgeons it to deep midwicket. B-L-U-D-G-E-O-N!"
"HIIIIIIIIGH AGAIN AND IT'S A BOUNDARY AGAIN! Somebody get Russell's bat and put it through every science experiment ever! He pulls the back of a lengt hball. Mishits it big time. The ball hangs in the air, so long that the keeper himself has time to run back all the way to the fine leg fence, but he can't keep it in"
"pounds it away over deep midwicket! Short ball, but just sitting up to be smashed and Russell never needs second invitation to do that. Brute force that somehow looks poetic"
finds the yorker outside off and Uthappa slices it to deep point
"full toss on middle, drills it to long-off"
"<b>launches it over long-off</b>! And it's an unbelievable stroke because Shami has missed the yorker by an inch or two. But Dre, sitting back in his crease, gets under the ball and heaves it away"
full toss! It's a full toss and that's basically a giant birthday cake for Russell. He yells thank you and digs in with a pull shot over deep midwicket
"another full toss, which Russell swings over midwicket. And would you believe it, Russell has been hitting these balls so hard he's broken his bat. And he's P-I-S-S-E-D!"
nails it to the long-off boundary. All along the ground this time. Shami's efforts at finding the blockhole goes just a touch awry. And Russell has room this time - in addition to his tactic of staying so very deep in his crease - to pounce
"yorker on middle, nudges it to long-on"
"takes all the pace off the ball and keeps the line outside off - anticipating the batsman clearing his front leg, which would then mean he'd be off balance if he goes for the slog again. And that's exactly what happens. Great bowling. Mis-hit to long-on"
"slower bouncer on middle and leg, Uthappa goes for the pull, has to check his shot because of the change in pace, and gets a top edge to fine leg"
"taken at deep midwicket! Right on the edge of the boundary too! Eden rises to its ball-bashing hero. Russell goes for 47 off 17! And this shot too - a front foot pull to a bouncer that came up over his shoulder - is absolutely pummelled, But dragging a ball like that - especially from that height - takes some timing off the shot - even from Russell's shots. Good composure from Agarwal to track the ball, time his jump and take it cleanly"
"length ball on middle, launches it to long-on"
"okay, lets unwrap this. First he moves his back leg outside leg. Then he leaps across his stumps. Then he has to deal with a slower ball and even through all that he somehow keeps his head and dabs it behind point and all the way to the boundary."
"on the back foot, tucked to the leg side to get off the mark straightaway"
"back of a length, cautiously tapped into the cordon"
"short, wide, and <B>ramped up and over third man!</B> He looked to be swaying inside the line at first, but just tapped the underside of the ball as it got big on him, and it launched over the fielder!"
"a flat-footed mow, wide of off stump and through to the keeper"
"<strong>spanged through finer third man!</strong> A thick edge, too thin for the fielder, and an unsuspecting cameraman by the dugout wears it on the shoulder!"
"a round-house swing at thin air! Good lift off the deck. Well then, this is living up to the billing already!"
"solid line and length, like watching Angus Fraser trundle in during a Benson & Hedges World Series match circa 1990-91. Blocked"
"sharper lift, on the back foot, tucked to the leg side"
"width outside off, hitting the deck harder, and Rahul can't connect with a flash of the wrists"
"<B>a flimsy flap to mid-off!</B> Rahul is through the ball too soon, driving on a full length, the bottom hand comes off the bat, and Yadav makes no mistake."
"wide on the crease, dabbed down to third man to get off the mark first ball"
"very wide on the crease again, Gayle squares up on the back foot to defend."
"takes off down the leg side, lots of pace and bounce, but the wrong line ..."
"hops across the crease, pure timing from Mayank, clipping sweetly off the pads and through square leg"
"<B>clouted over the covers!</B> That's supreme batting, a fraction of room to the leg side, opens up the off, and creams his drive over the ring and away to the rope!"
opens the face this time from deep in the crease but can't create the angle to beat point
"on the back foot, poked to point once more"
"gives room to the leg side again, but that's a good response from the bowler, rolling his fingers on a slower ball outside off, and Mayank can't reach it"
"flicked off the pads again,<strong> he does time those well!</strong> Proper cricket shots in that over!"
"sharp delivery, hits the seam and jags past the squared-up batsman"
beaten for pace ... lack of pace. A big wind-up but the ball never reached him
"fired past the leg stump, very full length"
"rolls the fingers again, Gayle steps back, deep into his crease to defend. Keeping it solid while he finds his range ..."
"very full once more, speared into the blockhole. Gayle is content to defend. It's ominous when he plays it this way..."
"<B>steps back for the smack, and <I>just</I> skims it over Yadav at mid-on!</B> A dirty shanked pull, but it's gone for four ..."
"<B>oof, that's the one he's been waiting for!</B> On the back foot, battered into the stands! It just looked tenderised as it left the blade!"
"hint of shape on the back foot, tapped down to third man"
"<B>Gayle's gone!</B> Hits the deck hard, Gayle is cramped for room as he top-edges his pull, and Krishna, I think, takes the catch ... just ... as he and his team-mate at mid-off converge behind the bowler and all but collide!"
"ambitious appeal, raps the pads but on a very full, leg-sided length"
"<B>cor, that's a shot and a half!</B> An inverted jack-in-the-box, squashing himself like a concertina, down into the crease, then ramping the ball off his nose and over the keeper! You need good knees for that stroke!"
tapped to the off side
"on the pads, whittled to backward square"
angled dab into the off side
"outside off, through to the keeper on a wide line"
"very full, angled into the toes, defended to the leg side"
"defended on the back foot, and pushed to the off side"
"very full, and tapped to the off side"
pushed into the gap for another single
pushed into the off side again
"attempted wipe across the line, and <strong>Kuleep finds the top edge!</strong> Flies safe to short third man"
"very wide, and cut to deep point"
"through to the keeper, another wrong'un, taking it away from the right-hander and missing the mow"
"a quicker slider, out of the front of the hand, and suddenly, KXI are sinking"
cracked firmly along the ground to long-off. A fine introductory over
"tight line, defended on the back foot, to the leg side"
"opens the face, glided down to the third man fence, using the pace well"
"attempted wipe over the leg side, but Karthik simply jogs round behind the stumps and swallows another loose top-edge! Easy pickings for KKR, and they've got themselves a stranglehold now ..."
"short, and sways inside the line to let this  go"
"fenced into the leg side, off the back foot"
"zips off the deck, into the thigh pad. This innings needs some CPR"
"flashed into the off side, and through for the single"
nudged down to long-off for a single
"very wide of off stump, but angled across the batsman"
"on the back foot, tighter line, blotted to the off side"
firm-handed block on the front foot
"down on one knee, <strong>swept hard through square leg</strong>. That's good intent"
flicked to long on once more. It's slow going for KXI. And that will be a <B>time-out too</B>
"<strong>big tweaker</strong>, past the left-hander's outside edge"
"wider line, through to the keeper once more"
"down on one knee, swept backward of square"
just another single ... a boundary is desperately needed
"flashed with intent, up and over wide long-on, but the sweeper is in position to limit the damage"
"patted off the pads, <strong>beats the despairing fielder at backward squar</strong>e. Useful boundary"
"loops it up on off stump, Miller goes for a hard-handed push and the ball nearly ends up back in the bowler's hands"
"round the wicket now for a pitched up ball on leg stump, Miller drills it through midwicket"
"googly, which Mayank tries to cut, then bails out of the shot, looking up to see the umpire call it wide outside off"
flicks a shortish delivery on off stump away to deep midwicket
"<B>nearly drags on</b>! Kuldeep bowling really well against a batsman who doesn't start well against spin. Takes all the pace off. Makes him wait ages and ages. Then, in his anxiety, he goes hard at the cut shot and nearly inside edges onto his stumps"
<b>booom! Over midwicket</b> and into the silent night! Eden did not like that. A slog sweep of great quality
"<b>dropped</b> by Ferguson on the long leg boundary! Another slog sweep. And it's pretty well timed too. Just that it's hit too flat and it's almost straight to the fielder. Ferguson times his jump well enough but the ball just pops out of his reverse cup. Then it's almost set to go to the boundary but he has the presence of mind (and agility) to move to his right, dive and stop it in the end"
"beats him with an offbreak outside off, pitching on a lovely length that can't be driven off the front foot, or cut off the back"
<b>launches it down the ground</b>. Half-volley from Narine. In the slot for Miller. He winds up and goes big. Straight bat goodness.
"power-hit to the boundary again, this time with a pull shot, having picked up the length of the ball - short - so early. Some would say he engineered that length with the last shot"
flicks it through midwicket
flat-bats the length ball outside off back down the ground. Big back lift and pure power again.
"<b>late cut</b>. And it's a lovely one. Especially because the ball turns back into the right-hander and nearly ends up over leg stump. Still, Agarwal manages to stay beside it, and deftly let it glide off the open face."
stays back and cuts the googly through point. Seems a touch full for the shot but he pulls it off very well indeed
"picks it up and smears it over square leg! He needs to get down low to meet this quicker, flatter delivery, so in the end he's got his back knee on the ground and short-arm pulling the ball over the boundary. <b>Spectacular</b>!"
works it through midwicket
backs away and cuts the short-pitched googly to cover
chops the shortish delivery outside off to cover
"pulls the short ball on leg stump away to deep midwicket. Risky second but they get there in the end, helped by a dodgy throw"
"slower ball at the base of off stump, Agarwal practically helicopters it to deep midwicket"
makes room to try and ramp the short ball on off stump over the keeper. Too quick for such shenanigans
"works the fuller deliveyr on middle to the right of long-on. Wants two and gets it. <b>That's his fifty, his first in the IPL since 2015</b>! Pretty good innings but can he find the next gear? (And the next and the next?)"
again he flicks the length ball off the stumps to deep square leg
now his ramp shot's beaten by the slower bouncer (on middle and leg). Dre's toying with his prey
"drills a near yorker down the ground - ha, that's exactly how it feels like when you do it Dre - but there's not enough on the shot to beat long-off running to his right. That part's not quite like Dre"
walks across his stumps and is a sitting duck when the good length ball skids into him. Miller ends up forcing himself to block
sweeps a tossed up delivery outside off to deep midwicket
"<b>dropped</b> by cover running to his left. It's Rinku Singh subbing for Uthappa. The batsman is deceived as he comes down the track, Kuldeep keeping the ball wide of off stump to deny him the hitting base. The miscue goes out square on the off side and though it's a tough catch, Rinku having to run quite a distance and dive, it should have been taken"
pushes to long-on
"hangs deep in his crease and smears the very full delivery outside off to the right of long-off. Russell's down there, moving quickly, diving, trying to flick the ball back, but at the same time, his foot is touching the rope."
"good length ball, drifting into middle stump and then turning away from the left-hander. Miller stays deep in his crease and pushes through the covers. <b>That's the timeout. Kings XI need 86 more off 30 balls</b>"
"lashes the googly, because it's short and spins away outside off, to the sweeper"
"<b>bowls him with the googly</b>. Agarwal does try to hit with the turn, but he's into the shot too early and Chawla, having held the pace off, but kept the revs up, watches it spin through the gate and crash into leg stump"
another one the turns the wrong way from the legspinner. Mandeep flicks it to deep square leg
"looks to drag a googly from well outside off over midwicket, but he's trying to do too much there, especially when the ball ends up near the wide line. Inside edge through midwicket"
nudges a tossed up googly behind square leg
"<b>appeal for caught behind and it's given, only Miller's gone for the review</b>. This is another wrong 'un. Pitches outside off and spins even further away. And yet Miller tries to slog it over the leg side. That's why he gets nothing on the ball. And so it's not out. Not a wide either, which is surprising."
holds his shape and launches the length ball outside to the long-off boundary. Perfect cricket shot.
"full and outside off, slices it to deep point"
"lovely batting! Spots the short ball angled into him, makes a little room, then lets it run off the open face of the bat and places it to the left of short third man. That's all that's needed for a boundary. Even in T20s"
"slower ball ends up a full toss near waist-high, Miller pulls it down to short fine leg"
"full toss outside off, he carves it to the sweeper"
"looks for the pull, but the extra pace from Ferguson, and the height he gets on the bouncer - above shoulder - makes sure the ball goes off the splice to point"
"short ball outside off and Mandeep, since he's new at the crease, spots the length but not the change of pace and he's into the pull shot too early"
"full toss outside off, taps it to cover"
nails the low full toss down the ground.
looks to swing the full delivery on leg stump away over deep square leg. Doesn't connect. Missed opportunity
top-edges the pull shot with the bouncer coming to him a lot quicker than he expects. Lands safely at midwicket
upper cuts the short ball even though it keeps angling towards him over the keeper. It's actually good bowling trumped even better batting.
full and goes down leg. Miller can't quite connect
"round the wicket yorker on leg stump, Miller's nearly taken off his feet in trying to dig that out"
stays leg side of the short ball on middle and leg and taps it to the left of point. Good placement again from Mandeep
"yorker a shade outside off, Mandeep smears it back down the ground and right through the bowler"
"slower ball, from round the stumps, on middle and leg, Miller flicks it to deep midwicket. <b>That's fifty to Miller</b>"
slices it over the backward point boundary. He's backing away to the length ball on leg stump and makes the absolute most of it
"slower ball outside off, Miller looks for the cut and his groan can be heard through the stump mic as he misses making connection"
"heaves the googly away to the midwicket boundary, where Uthappa misfields"
"more googlies, Mandeep flicks through midwicket"
scoops the googly on off stump over Lynn at short fine leg.
"that's a seam-up delivery. He's a legspinner who, I think, hasn't bowled a single legbreak today. Drive to long-on"
"googly on off stump, Miller cuts to the sweeper"
slaps the short googly to cover. And that's that.
